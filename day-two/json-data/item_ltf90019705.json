Divine impulse on the minds\n ot men : indeed, when God is about soon to accomplish\n any work of mercy or of judgment, in behalf of hi-:\n church, he ordinarily raises up instruments, and qualifies\n lliem tor the work, and so disposes events, in the natural\n and moral world, as to bring it to pass, as it pre-existed\n in the Divine purpose.\n</p>\n<p>\n The sure word of prophecy, as it has been understood\n by the current of interpreters, and as it has been illustra\u00ac\n ted by recent events, lias raised a general expectation\n among the Protestant Christians, that the millenial age is\n near at hand, if not already commenced, when the Hea\u00ac\n then shall be given to Christ for an inheritance, and the\n uttermost parts of the earth for his possession : and shews\n that God is, in these events, now addressing his church,\n in the sublime and animating language of the evangelical\n prophet, \u201cArise, shine, for thy light is come, and the\n glory ot the Lord is risen upon thee ; for the Gentiles\n shall come to thy light, and kings to the brightness of thv\n rising. \u00b0\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:me:mo:ir:so:fh:en:ry:ob:00:dw:ig:_0:memoirsofhenryob00dwig_0:memoirsofhenryob00dwig_0_0221/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 181, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 335}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:me:mo:ir:so:fh:en:ry:ob:00:dw:ig:_0:memoirsofhenryob00dwig_0:memoirsofhenryob00dwig_0_0221/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 362, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 670}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:me:mo:ir:so:fh:en:ry:ob:00:dw:ig:_0:memoirsofhenryob00dwig_0:memoirsofhenryob00dwig_0_0221/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 724, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1341}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:me:mo:ir:so:fh:en:ry:ob:00:dw:ig:_0:memoirsofhenryob00dwig_0:memoirsofhenryob00dwig_0_0221/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1449, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2682}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:me:mo:ir:so:fh:en:ry:ob:00:dw:ig:_0:memoirsofhenryob00dwig_0:memoirsofhenryob00dwig_0_0221/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/me/mo/ir/so/fh/en/ry/ob/00/dw/ig/_0/memoirsofhenryob00dwig_0/memoirsofhenryob00dwig_0_0221.jp2", "height": 2682, "width": 1449, "levels": 6, "size": 356366}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"221\">\n<p>\n Inaugural Address .\n</p>\n<p>\n o\n</p>\n<p>\n The spirit of a Mayhew, of an Elliot, and of a Brainerd,\n is transfused into many oi the faithful servants and min\u00ac\n isters ot Christ, who, trom day to day, are coming to the\n help of the Spiritual David, until they have become a\n great host like the host of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n For the support and encouragement of these and their\n successors, kings are becoming their nursing fathers, and\n queens their nursing mothers: and numerous Missionary\n and Bible Societies, in Great Britain, in Russia, in most\n other European kingdoms, in the United States, and even\n in Asia and Africa, of high respectability, have formed,\n and are constantly forming, and by various associations\n auxiliary to them, are rapidly diffusing their benign and\n sacred influence, through a mass of population, embrac\u00ac\n ing all orders and descriptions of men, high and low, rich\n and poor, old and young, male and female.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus organized, and clad in the Christian armor, this\n sacred band, feeble in itself, and unequal to the combat,\n but strong in the Lord and in the power of his might, go\n forth to mortal warfare against the whole strength of\n Satan\u2019s kingdom, fortified as it has been for ages, by all\n his power and subtlety, to which full scope seems to have\n been permitted by the will of Heaven, as if to render the\n victory over him, in the end, the more complete and\n glorious, and thus to give an illustrious specimen of the\n truth of the declaration of the Psalmist, \u00ab Out of the\n mouth of babes and sucklings hast thou ordained strength,\n because of thine enemies, that thou mightest still the en\u00ac\n emy and the avenger.\u201d '\n</p>\n<p>\n It is true, indeed, that to an eye of sense, victory in\n lavor of such combatants, and over such an enemy, is\n impossible ; but to the eye of faith it is not only possible,\n but is anticipated to be certain and final.
