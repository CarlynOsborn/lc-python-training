A free and full discussion confirmed the\n statement that the colored were giving more attention\n to education than the whites. At the Quarterly\n Conferences the subject was thoroughly canvassed; at\n many Quarterly Meetings it was the burden of my dis-\n courses. These were substantially repeated in 1888 at\n my own District Conference and at others, at Camp\n Meetings, and elsewhere within and without the\n District. While the facts were unpalatable\u2014 and to no\n one more than to myself\u2014 their truth was not denied.\n The evil was wide-spread\u2014 far more than had been\n supposed.

And so, for the sake of the\n five or six white students in the University, the appro-\n priation was lost to the blacks.

And such was the proficiency of the school\n in all its departments, it was conceded that we had\n never witnessed a better average examination. Nor\n do I believe that this examination was exceptional. I\n am persuaded that the average examinations in the col-\n ored, are better than the average in the white schools.\n And, in my judgment, this is easily explained. In\n my lectures at Oxford, I was wont to say, If I were\n asked, \u201cWhat is the first requisite for success in\n scholarship\u2019\u201d I would answer, Teachableness. If\n asked, \u201cWhat is the second?\u201d I would answer,\n Teachableness. And if asked, \u201cWhat is the third?\u201d\n I would still answer, Teachableness. Nor would I\n make any other reply, were the question put to me a\n thousand times \u2014 for teachableness is the basis of all\n education. Now this is something in which the\n average white boy is wanting; it almost universally\n distinguishes the negro.
