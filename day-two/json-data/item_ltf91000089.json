A vast concourse, com-\n prising the entire population of the town and the vicinity, with\n delegations from other places, followed, with sadness and tears,\n the remains of General Lee to the tomb. The funeral services\n were conducted by the Rev. W. N. Pendleton, D.

The body was deposited in a vault\n prepared for the purpose.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the day of the funeral a large number of ex-Confederate\n soldiers assembled in the court-house at Lexington, and after\n giving expression to the love and veneration of the South for\n General Lee, and to the sorrow at his death, resolved to take\n steps to erect a monument in honor of their great leader. They\n felt that even in the midst of poverty and disaster, no labor\n could be more grateful, no duty more sacred, than that of\n making manifest to the future, in some enduring way, the love\n and admiration of his countrymen for the character and genius\n of Robert E, Lee,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:re:mo:ni:es:co:nn:ec:00:un:se:ceremoniesconnec00unse:ceremoniesconnec00unse_0006/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 269}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:re:mo:ni:es:co:nn:ec:00:un:se:ceremoniesconnec00unse:ceremoniesconnec00unse_0006/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 539}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:re:mo:ni:es:co:nn:ec:00:un:se:ceremoniesconnec00unse:ceremoniesconnec00unse_0006/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1078}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:re:mo:ni:es:co:nn:ec:00:un:se:ceremoniesconnec00unse:ceremoniesconnec00unse_0006/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2156}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:re:mo:ni:es:co:nn:ec:00:un:se:ceremoniesconnec00unse:ceremoniesconnec00unse_0006/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4312}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:re:mo:ni:es:co:nn:ec:00:un:se:ceremoniesconnec00unse:ceremoniesconnec00unse_0006/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ce/re/mo/ni/es/co/nn/ec/00/un/se/ceremoniesconnec00unse/ceremoniesconnec00unse_0006.jp2", "height": 4312, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 515454}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"6\">\n<p>\n 4\n</p>\n<p>\n At this meeting was formed the Lee Memorial Association,\n and the following were appointed an Executive Committee to\n carry into effect the objects of the Association :\n</p>\n<p>\n Gen.

V.\n Valentine, the distinguished Virginian sculptor, was sent for.\n Mr. Valentine had, the preceding summer, modeled a bust of\n General Lee from life, which was considered an admirable\n work of art. Mrs. Lee, after examining a number of drawings\n and photographs of celebrated works of art, suggested, as a\n suitable design for the monument, a recumbent figure of Gen-\n eral Lee lying asleep upon the field of battle. The (fesign was\n suggested to her by Rauch\u2019s figure of Louise of Prussia in the\n mausoleum at Charlottenburg. This figure of Lee, some-\n what above life size, was to be placed upon a sarcophagus suit-\n ably inscribed and decorated. The whole was to be of white\n marble and was designed to be placed over the remains of Gen-\n eral Lee.\n</p>\n<p>\n The suggestions of Mrs. Lee, both as to the monument and\n as to the artist, having been cordially adopted by the Associa-\n tion, Mr. Valentine was, on November 24, 1870, requested to\n \u201c prepare a design for the tomb of Gen. R. E. Lee, proposed\n to be erected, and an estimate of the probable cost of the same.\u201d\n Measures were also taken for collecting from the admirers of\n General Lee, the funds needed for erecting the monument.\n Liberal responses were received from a number of sources,\n among which was a donation of $1000 from W. W.

Meantime donations had come in from\n various places. The ladies of Baltimore sent, in May, 1875,\n $1,319.82, the result of an entertainment given by them.

In the\n summer of 1876 it seemed to the Executive Committee, from\n their progress so far, that they might expect the contributions\n for a mausoleum to reach an aggregate of $10,000 or $15,000,\n but not more.

Magruder, Esq., brother of the late distinguished Con-\n federate officer, Major General John Bankhead Magruder, in which the writer\n takes exception to this statement of my address. He says that to General Ma-\n gruder belongs the credit of the \u201cstrategic skill\u201d which held McClellan at bay\n on the lines of Yorktown ; that General Johnston never commanded on those\n lines; and that the Army of Northern Virginia never fired a shot in their de-\n fence.\n</p>\n<p>\n The high character and standing of the writer, and my great respect for the\n memory of General Magruder, to whom I would do all honor, induce me to\n notice this article here. 1 do not deny that General Magruder did, before the ar-\n rival of General Johnston, defend the lines of Yorktown with wonderful address\n and boldness, and is entitled to high praise for the ability and courage displayed\n in so doing. Yet there can be no doubt that General Johnston did command\n the army defending the Yorktown lines ; and that his army fired many a shot\n in their defence. This is attested by all the official records. That there can be\n no mistake about it, I am myself a witness, for I marched from Centreville to\n Richmond, and there took steamer for the \u201c lines of Yorktown \u201d with General\n Johnston ' s forces; lay with them there in the trenches for weeks, and saw and\n heard the firing of many a shot from cannon, rifle, and musket in their defence.\n And under command of General Johnston, whom I personally saw on the field,\n I marched with his troops on the retreat from Yorktown, and participated in the\n battle of Williamsburg, May 5th, 1862, with the advancing forces of McClellan.\n</p>\n<p>\n The fact is Mr. Magruder has fallen into what is to me, a strange and unaccount-\n able error as he will discover on reading any history of the events referred to. I\n have before me McCabe\u2019s Life of Lee, and Gen. Joseph E. Johnston\u2019s work, enti-\n tled \u201cJohnston\u2019s Narrative,\u201d and they confirm the accuracy of the statements\n upon which my remarks are based. The credit given General Johnston is due\n him ; but it in no wise detracts from that likewise due General Magruder for\n his anterior exploits of a like nature. J. W.

A fine head, with broad,\n uplifted brow, and features boldly but yet delicately chiseled,\n bore the high aspect of one born to command. The firm yet\n mobile lips, and the thick-set jaw, were expressive of daring\n and resolution ; and the dark scintillant eye flashed with the\n light of a brilliant intellect and a fearless spirit. His whole\n countenance, indeed, bespoke alike a powerful mind, and in-\n domitable will, yet beamed with charity, gentleness and benev-\n olence. In his manners, quiet, reserve, unaffected courtesy and\n native dignity, made manifest the character of one who can\n only.be described by the name of gentleman. And taken all\n in all, his presence possessed that grave and simple majesty\n which commanded instant reverence and repressed familiarity ;\n and yet so charmed by a certain modesty and gracious defer-\n ence, that reverence and confidence were ever ready to kindle\n into affection. It was impossible to look upon him, and not to\n recognize at a glance that in him, nature gave assurance of a\n man created great and good.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mounted in the field, and at the head of his troops, a glimpse\n of Lee was an inspiration. His figure was as distinctive as that\n of Napoleon. Ah! soldiers! who can forget it? The black\n slouch hat, the cavalry boots, the dark cape, the plain gray coat\n without an ornament but the three stars on the collar, the calm,\n victorious face, the splendid, manly figure on the gray warhorse,\n that steps as if proudly conscious of his rider ; he looked every\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:re:mo:ni:es:co:nn:ec:00:un:se:ceremoniesconnec00unse:ceremoniesconnec00unse_0067/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 269}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:re:mo:ni:es:co:nn:ec:00:un:se:ceremoniesconnec00unse:ceremoniesconnec00unse_0067/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 539}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:re:mo:ni:es:co:nn:ec:00:un:se:ceremoniesconnec00unse:ceremoniesconnec00unse_0067/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1078}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:re:mo:ni:es:co:nn:ec:00:un:se:ceremoniesconnec00unse:ceremoniesconnec00unse_0067/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2156}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:re:mo:ni:es:co:nn:ec:00:un:se:ceremoniesconnec00unse:ceremoniesconnec00unse_0067/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4312}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:re:mo:ni:es:co:nn:ec:00:un:se:ceremoniesconnec00unse:ceremoniesconnec00unse_0067/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ce/re/mo/ni/es/co/nn/ec/00/un/se/ceremoniesconnec00unse/ceremoniesconnec00unse_0067.jp2", "height": 4312, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 603762}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"67\">\n<p>\n 65\n</p>\n<p>\n inch the true knight \u2014 the grand, invincible champion of a great\n principle.\n</p>\n<p>\n MENTAL ATTRIBUTES AND ATTAINMENTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n The intellectual abilities of General Lee were of the highest\n order, and his attainments, scientific and literary, were remark-\n able for one who had devoted so many years of his life to the\n exacting duties and details of the camp and the field.
