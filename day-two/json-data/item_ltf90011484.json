Dur-\n ing the next general convention, which was held in the city of New\n Haven, in the year 1811, the bishops there and then assembled, is-\n sued their second pastoral letter ; which related to sundry particu-\n lars, especially interesting to themselves in their ecclesiastical ad-\n ministrations. Although any of the matters discussed on these oc-\n casions, might be now profitably recurred to, as having not been be-\n fore exhausted ; yet we rather feel a desire to set before you some\n circumstances in the state of our church, which we consider as\n fruitful of encouragement ; and some other circumstances, which\n open to our prospect an extensive field of zealous labour ; and, on\n the review of these two subjects, to ground some heads of advice\n and exhortation, deemed by us worthy of being presented at this\n time to the members of our church in general, and to the clergy in\n particular.\n</p>\n<p>\n One branch of the encouragement referred to, is the visible de-\n cline of infidelity, and the growing disrepute attaching to activity\n in its cause.

Whatever there was of novelty in the event,\n arose from an extraordinary combination of circumstances in the\n political concerns of nations ; which produced an imaginary alliance\n between projected improvements in civil policy, and the eradicating of\n religion under the name of superstition ; whereby whatever was cor-\n rupt or unreasonable in the former line, was supposed to be upheld.\n Under gigantic struggles for the reformation of political abuses,\n there rose into notice and into power a species of philosophy, which\n proclaimed war with religion generally, and with Christianity in\n particular : and very extensive were the ravages which happened in\n consequence, in every line wherein human happiness, either tempo-\n ral or spiritual is concerned. The issue which we hold out as a sub-\n ject of congratulation, although not without painful sensibilities on\n account of intermediate mischief, is an opening of the public mind\n to the shallowness of the pretences, by which so many have been\n deceived and demoralized. It is more and more confessed, that\n religion enters essentially into all the interests of individuals, of\n families, and of state| : and while some are induced, on that ac-\n count, to encourage irwith a view to public order and private mo-\n rals, and for the promoting of the temporal prosperity of the social\n body, doubtless, a prevailing sentiment to this effect must lead other ' s\n to contemplate the important subject, as it manifests a bearing on\n the interests which will remain when the present state of things\n shall be forever at an end. For when we suffer ourselves to pro-\n ceed in the correct reasoning, which ascends from what we ob-\n serve and know, to causes competent to the producing of it ; we can-\n not but perceive, that the benefits resulting from the due exercise\n of the religious principle, are evidence of its being given by the\n great author of nature, for the government of the human mind. The\n consequence is undeniable 5 unless on the pretence, that in the con-\n trivance of the present system, its order and its continuance have\n been provided for by a salutary deception : which yet has not been\n so ingeniously contrived, as to escape detection by the discernment\n of those, who cherish a sentiment so foolish and so profane.\n</p>\n<p>\n This leads us to remark another article of encouragement, tend-\n ing more immediately to the same blessed end. We mean an in-\n creased attendance on the duties of public worship, and an increas-\n ing desire to provide the means of sustaining and continuing it,\n over a considerable proportion of the territory of these states.\n While we ascribe this, partly to the detection of the insidious pre-\n tensions of infidelity, we cannot but have our eyes open to the fact\n that, from whatever secondary cause it may happen, there are sea-\n sons of religious sensibility, wherein it is more easy than under or-\n dinary circumstances, to call the attention of the people to the things\n which belong to their everlasting peace. It is for the purpose of\n improving an opportunity of this description, that the remark is\n made : and accordingly we invite all serious persons of our com-\n munion, and especially the ministers of the gospel, to avail them-\n selves of existing circumstances, for the sowing of the seed of gos-\n pel doctrine 5 under the hope, that through the influences of the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:ot:pastoralletterof00prot:pastoralletterof00prot_0005/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 150, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 262}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:ot:pastoralletterof00prot:pastoralletterof00prot_0005/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 524}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:ot:pastoralletterof00prot:pastoralletterof00prot_0005/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 603, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1048}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:ot:pastoralletterof00prot:pastoralletterof00prot_0005/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1206, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2097}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:ot:pastoralletterof00prot:pastoralletterof00prot_0005/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2413, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4195}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:ot:pastoralletterof00prot:pastoralletterof00prot_0005/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/pa/st/or/al/le/tt/er/of/00/pr/ot/pastoralletterof00prot/pastoralletterof00prot_0005.jp2", "height": 4195, "width": 2413, "levels": 6, "size": 814023}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"5\">\n<p>\n 5\n</p>\n<p>\n Holy Spirit of God, it will bear fruit, thirty, sixty, and an hundred\n fold.

We are aware, how easily there may take\n place counterfeit revivals of religion, and how often it has happen-\n ed in different times and places. There are now alluded to, what\n has been the effect of violent agitations of the passions, suddenly-\n excited and soon subsiding. We neither aim nor rejoice at sucli\n revivals; perceiving nothing like them either in the word of God,\n or in the history of the primitive church; nor any thing favouring\n them in the institutions of our own. Accordingly, when we refer\n to a growing attention to religion, we mean of that cast which is\n agreeable to truth and soberness, and congenial with the known de-\n votions of our church. While we thus define the religious profession\n which we are desirous of perpetuating we do not set up any in-\n stitutions as conceiving them to be acceptable to God, any further\n than as the outward form may be expressive of an inward power.\n But we do not aim at revivals of religion, in a departure from the\n principles of Christian worship, which we believe to have descended\n to us from Jesus Christ and his apostles, through the channel of the\n primitive church and of the church of England. On this ground,\n when we rejoice at what we conceive to be observable within our\n communion, of an increased interest in religious inquiries and atten-\n tion to religious duties ; we mean to be understood as speaking of\n these, within the bounds which have been defined.\n</p>\n<p>\n Having alluded, under the preceding head, to some extravagan-\n cies interfering w ith the spirit of the worship of this church ; which\n in some districts of country, wherein there was the w r ant of an in-\n telligent and zealous ministry, have withdrawn many from her com-\n munion ; it is with great satisfaction that w ' e go on to remark, as\n another cause of congratulation, a decrease of the disorder. In va-\n rious vicinities of the United States, wherein our communion was\n formerly numerous and respectable \u2014 for we speak of the subject,\n only as it has a bearing on our own religious interests\u2014 there has\n been a visible decline of the effects of a species of zeal, covering\n itself with the character of our church, although not in harmony\n with her institutions, and no longer continuing to wear her name,\n than until circumstances sustained it in secession, and often in un-\n disguised hostility.

It was not uncommon, for a body of set-\n tlers to be bound closely together, either by a foreign language, or\n by some peculiarity of religious opinion, labouring under discour-\n agement in the land of their nativity. To such persons, it was an\n obvious dictate of prudence, to form compact settlements in the\n land chosen by them, to be in future the country of themselves and\n their posterity. The case was otherwise with the emigrants of the\n church of England, who being without such especial ties, were the\n easier induced to make their settlements, according to each family\u2019s\n separate interest and convenience. As a counter balance to this, so far\n as their religious profession was concerned, it was natural to look for\n encouragement to the church in the parent country. This was in-\n deed extended to them, until the change of the relative situation of\n the countries in civil matters, produced such a severance of them in\n religious discipline as rendered pecuniary aid either impracticable\n or inexpedient. The fact above stated is at least one of the causes\n of the dispersed settlements of the members of our communion, in\n districts wherein the mass of population has risen under the influ-\n ence of principles, and in some instances of languages, different\n from ours.

AVhile there is, in theory, a general conviction of this\n pervading our communion ; and while the principle is acted on, in\n some places, to a reasonable extent; there are others, wherein there\n has been lamentable deficiency, in the discharge of pecuniary en-\n gagements. This is a hardship which affects our own characters, in\n a point of great delicacy and difficulty : For being pressed from va-\n rious vicinities within our respective dioceses, for the supplying of a\n resident ministry ; in addition to the distress which we generally\n feel on account of the want of opportunities of meeting the demand,\n there is often the additional embarassment, when opportunities\n occur, that we may be the authors both of loss and of vexation to\n worthy men, by encouraging them to trust to promises which will\n not be fulfilled.\n</p>\n<p>\n The comparatively small number of our clergy, induces us to re-\n commend to destitute congregations, especially to those whose num-\n ber is such as renders the speedy settlement of an ordained minis-\n ter improbable, to avail themselves of the services of a lay -reader ;\n where such a person, respectable in character, and sufficient in other *\n</p>\n<p>\n respects, takes so much interest in religion, as to be willing to read\n on Sundays those parts of the Liturgy, which are not appropriate to\n ordained ministers, and such printed discourses as may be judged\n to be adapted to the understandings and the circumstances of the\n people. It will be no difficult matter, under the superintendence of\n the proper ecclesiastical authority, to select such discourses from\n the many able works of Divines, which have been given to the pub-\n lic from the press. We hold this to be a laudable effort of Christian\n zeal. Nevertheless, as like every other expedient of the same de-\n scription, it is liable to abuse; we would hold up to view the pro-\n visions of the 19th canon, in regard to the selection of the sermons\n to be read. Neither will it be foreign to the purpose, to allude to\n what the same canon provides, when, in relation to readers having\n a view to the ministry, it forbids not only the use of such parts of\n the service as are appropriate to it, but also some matters of little\n importance in themselves ? yet tending to mislead the world, as to\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:ot:pastoralletterof00prot:pastoralletterof00prot_0010/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 150, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 262}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:ot:pastoralletterof00prot:pastoralletterof00prot_0010/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 524}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:ot:pastoralletterof00prot:pastoralletterof00prot_0010/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 603, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1048}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:ot:pastoralletterof00prot:pastoralletterof00prot_0010/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1206, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2097}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:ot:pastoralletterof00prot:pastoralletterof00prot_0010/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2413, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4195}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:ot:pastoralletterof00prot:pastoralletterof00prot_0010/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/pa/st/or/al/le/tt/er/of/00/pr/ot/pastoralletterof00prot/pastoralletterof00prot_0010.jp2", "height": 4195, "width": 2413, "levels": 6, "size": 840061}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"10\">\n<p>\n 10\n</p>\n<p>\n the claims of the agents to an official character, which is not yet,\n and perhaps may not hereafter be conferred.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another mean to be recommended, is encouragement and pecu-\n niary aid, where necessary and practicable, to young men of known\n piety and virtue, and of promising qualifications in other respects,\n in their preparing of themselves for the ministry.

In a country so much advancing as ours in population, it\n i9 evident, that a very great proportion of the people must be with-\n out the benefit of social worship ; unless there be a proportionate ad-\n dition of houses, in which it is to be offered. We appeal to it as an\n incontrovertible fact, that in general, of the mass of society, in the\n portion of it who become lost to this great mean of whatever is estima-\n ble in every department of social life, there ensues manifest evidence\n of depravity in their conversation and in their manners. Here is a\n canker in the body, which cannot fail to spread ; unless it be subdued\n by active efforts, for the putting of the means of public worship\n within the power of all. In this debt to the public welfare, have\n not we a share ? Have w r e not also a like debt, to the church of\n which we call ourselves members? Certain it is, that very many\n have left the membership of it, because they and their families could\n not enjoy the means of grace within its pale. It is not improbable,\n that from the same cause, many have been lost to the Christian pro-\n fession, in whatever shape. The keeping of churches in decent re-\n pair, is so manifest a dictate of propriety ; that we should not have\n mentioned it, were not the fact know n to us, that in some places,\n there is delinquency in this matter, to the dishonor of those to\n whom it is to be ascribed : since in the vicinity of suoh neglect,\n there is scarcely a passing stranger, who can forbear to remark se-\n verely on the indifference or the parsimony which are the causes\n of it.\n</p>\n<p>\n While the subject now before us is contemplated as leading to\n expence, we wish to define the limits of it. There is reason to be-\n lieve, that in some instances, there has been discouragement of the\n design of erecting a house of worship to Almighty God, because the\n agents in it could not compass the means of gratifying a taste for\n magnificence and expensive ornament. We do not think with\n those, who w r ould interdict the fine arts from this department. On\n the contrary w^e are of opinion, that where wealth abounds, and\n where it can be bestowed on this object, without interfering with\n any other more imperious; and while it carries with it the inciden-\n tal benefit, of giving employment to industrious tradesmen and sub-\n sistence to their families ; it may be not only innocently, but even\n laudably thus bestowed. But under the insufficiency for the erect-\n ing of splendid churches, we consider the affecting of them as evi-\n dence of too weak an influence of the principle, which should go-\n vern in accomplishing such objects : and we know that it has had\n a mischievous tendency, in the frustrating of some efforts and in\n the discouraging of others.\n</p>\n<p>\n Associations, in those vicinities wherein the number and the abi-\n lity of our people are competent to the sending of occasional aid to\n our more scattered and less wealthy population, we hold to he\n judicious mean of building up our church; and not unreasonably;\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:ot:pastoralletterof00prot:pastoralletterof00prot_0012/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 150, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 262}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:ot:pastoralletterof00prot:pastoralletterof00prot_0012/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 524}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:ot:pastoralletterof00prot:pastoralletterof00prot_0012/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 603, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1048}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:ot:pastoralletterof00prot:pastoralletterof00prot_0012/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1206, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2097}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:ot:pastoralletterof00prot:pastoralletterof00prot_0012/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2413, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4195}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:ot:pastoralletterof00prot:pastoralletterof00prot_0012/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/pa/st/or/al/le/tt/er/of/00/pr/ot/pastoralletterof00prot/pastoralletterof00prot_0012.jp2", "height": 4195, "width": 2413, "levels": 6, "size": 870935}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"12\">\n<p>\n 12\n</p>\n<p>\n claimed of any members of that mystical body, concerning which we\n are taught, that if one member suffer, all the members should suffer\n with it.
