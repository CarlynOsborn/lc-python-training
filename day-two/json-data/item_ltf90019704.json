The man whose life was marked by mis\u00ac\n fortune, was supposed to have been born under an un\u00ac\n lucky planet, which was the god that directed his fate.\n If a nation suffered conquest, being torn to pieces and\n captivated, it was represented by all the planets being\n darkened over the land, or falling from their places,\n and thus withdrawing their shining.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:co:nd:de:at:hi:ll:us:00:do:ds:seconddeathillus00dods:seconddeathillus00dods_0006/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 493}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:co:nd:de:at:hi:ll:us:00:do:ds:seconddeathillus00dods:seconddeathillus00dods_0006/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 560, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 986}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:co:nd:de:at:hi:ll:us:00:do:ds:seconddeathillus00dods:seconddeathillus00dods_0006/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1121, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1972}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:co:nd:de:at:hi:ll:us:00:do:ds:seconddeathillus00dods:seconddeathillus00dods_0006/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2243, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3944}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:co:nd:de:at:hi:ll:us:00:do:ds:seconddeathillus00dods:seconddeathillus00dods_0006/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/se/co/nd/de/at/hi/ll/us/00/do/ds/seconddeathillus00dods/seconddeathillus00dods_0006.jp2", "height": 3944, "width": 2243, "levels": 6, "size": 620132}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"6\">\n<p>\n 6\n</p>\n<p>\n The Hebrews while in servitude among the Egyp\u00ac\n tians learned their notions of worship ; and even after\n they were liberated by Moses, they did homage to the\n hosts of heaven.

So I prophesied as he command\u00ac\n ed me, and the breath came into them, and they lived,\n and stood upon their feet an exceeding great army.\n Then said he unto me, son of man, these bones are\n the whole house of Israel: behold they say, our bones\n are dried, and our hope is lost: we are cut off for our\n parts. Therefore prophesy, and say unto them, thus\n saith the Lord God ; behold O my people, I will open\n your graves, and cause you to come up out of your\n graves, and bring you into the land of Israel.
