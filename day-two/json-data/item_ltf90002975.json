In the use of bright objects the Luys Mirror\n has some points in its favor, and the Hypnotic Ball\n invented by Mr. McIntyre, of Brooklyn, is an ingen\u00ac\n ious contrivance. When a bright object is used, it\n should be before other processes, and the moment\n the eyelids drop or any nervousness is noticed, the\n object should be removed and suggestions and\n passes substituted.\n</p>\n<p>\n Bright Object.\n</p>\n<p>\n He who depends upon the bright object entirely\n will find very few people susceptible to the deeper\n stages at least, and will probably have an incorrect\n idea of hypnotism.\n</p>\n<p>\n The bright object sometimes leaves trifling evil\n effects, while verbal suggestion is always productive\n of pleasant sensations, and when the patient is sus\u00ac\n ceptible to it suggestion should be resorted to in\n preference to all other methods, though passes are\n usually equally agreeable. The efficacy of a pass,\n however, seems due solely to its effect on the nerves\n of sensation and not to any subtle fluids, magnet\u00ac\n ism, etc.\n</p>\n<p>\n Record.\n</p>\n<p>\n In hynotizing, a record should be kept of each\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201430\u2014\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hy:pn:ot:is:ma:si:ti:sb:00:sa:ge:hypnotismasitisb00sage:hypnotismasitisb00sage_0045/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 442}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hy:pn:ot:is:ma:si:ti:sb:00:sa:ge:hypnotismasitisb00sage:hypnotismasitisb00sage_0045/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 542, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 885}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hy:pn:ot:is:ma:si:ti:sb:00:sa:ge:hypnotismasitisb00sage:hypnotismasitisb00sage_0045/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1084, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1771}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hy:pn:ot:is:ma:si:ti:sb:00:sa:ge:hypnotismasitisb00sage:hypnotismasitisb00sage_0045/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2168, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3542}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hy:pn:ot:is:ma:si:ti:sb:00:sa:ge:hypnotismasitisb00sage:hypnotismasitisb00sage_0045/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hy/pn/ot/is/ma/si/ti/sb/00/sa/ge/hypnotismasitisb00sage/hypnotismasitisb00sage_0045.jp2", "height": 3542, "width": 2168, "levels": 6, "size": 348117}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"45\">\n<p>\n patient; the method employed each day, its effect,\n etc.\n</p>\n<p>\n I proceed on the theory that every person is a\n somnambulist (though this may be contrary to au\u00ac\n thority), and if I fail to induce such a state I con\u00ac\n sider the failure owing to a lack of knowledge or\n perseverance on my part, unless I can discern some\n physical derangement which prevents the concen\u00ac\n tration of the patient\u2019s mind.
