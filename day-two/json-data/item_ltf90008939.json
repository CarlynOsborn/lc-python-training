None\n appeared so much offended as a young man who was the\n son of a minister, and who professed sanctification. In\n giving his experience, he used to say that he wished to\n leave this wicked world to go and live with Jesus. In the\n course of a day or two, he was found to be the guilty\n party.

The following extract, from his\n journal of this date, shows clearly enough the depth and\n earnestness of his religious life: \u201cGlory be to thy name,\n dear Savior, for having taken me to be one of Thy sheep.\n O Lamb of God! may I never perish; but rule Thou in my\n soul every motive, every desire, and every action.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Nor was he less diligent in studies than devotional in\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0037/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 260}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0037/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 318, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 521}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0037/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 637, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1042}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0037/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2084}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0037/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4168}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0037/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/as/on/do/gm/ao/rf/oo/00/br/ay/_0/reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0/reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0037.jp2", "height": 4168, "width": 2551, "levels": 6, "size": 552792}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"37\">\n<p>\n MENTAL CULTURE.\n</p>\n<p>\n 27\n</p>\n<p>\n life.

They were reading Antigone, a Greek play of\n Sophocles; and it was the professor\u2019s custom to translate\n for the class to-day what he would assign them as a lesson\n to-morrow. Merton protested against this custom, holding\n that it was ruinous for the professor thus to do the scholar\u2019s\n work. One morning at the recitation the professor\n hesitated in his translation, and finally told the class that,\n the passage being very obscure, he would excuse them for\n the day. In an instant Merton thoughtlessly replied:\n \u201cWhy professor? I am sure the passage is easy enough.\u2019\u2019\n With one voice the class cried out: \u201cRead it, Merton. Get\n up, and read it. \u2019 \u2019 The professor blushed, but said nothing.\n Merton felt deeply the impropriety of his conduct, and\n longed to apologize, which he determined to do on the\n following day; but the next day the professor did not\n make his appearance; and Merton always thought that it\n was because of his deep mortification. On the second\n morning after the occurrence of the unpleasantness, as soon\n as he had opportunity, Merton arose in his seat, and\n apologized; for well he knew that although what he had\n said was true enough, his actions, as a student, were\n nevertheless very improper. The professor replied: \u201cI\n recognized the impropriety of your conduct, Mr. Merton;\n but I willingly receive your apology. I also hope that in\n the future you will be as well prepared in your studies, as\n you have been in the past. \u2019 \u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n The daily life of many of the \u2018 \u2018 bibs \u2019 \u2019 was a great sur\u00ac\n prise to Merton, who had hoped to find in them examples\n of pure and holy living; but with their character, as a class,\n 110 person could be very favorably impressed.

He might have written that it arose from\n the conscious conflict of reason with the superstition taught\n in the name of religion; and that its more immediate cause\n had been the reading of the posthumous essays of J. Stuart\n Mill, and other similar religio-philosophical writings. The\n argument of the great and truth-loving Mill had been too\n much for Merton. The taste for such writings once hav\u00ac\n ing been established, Merton\u2019s mind could find no rest\n until he had read almost everything he could find, bear\u00ac\n ing on the fundamentals of Christianity. Never was ground\n held more tenaciously; never was there a more unwilling\n tenant ousted; but, still, little by little was Merton obliged\n to surrender much that he had been accustomed to regard\n as essentials of Christian faith, and necessary to eternal\n life. This he had to do as reason forced the changes upon\n him. The fact also that from this date he made much less\n frequent entries in his journal, proves the change which\n was slowly but surely coming over him. He began to un\u00ac\n derstand that states of mind, or experience, may result\n from faith in things that do not exist. A son rejoices in\n the hourly expectation of meeting his mother, although,\n unknown to him, she died yesterday while on her journey.\n Her death did not lessen his conscious joy, although the\n form which he was momentarily expecting to gladden his\n heart, was now cold in the embrace of death.

The students had a custom of \u2018 \u2018sloping\u2019 \u2019 en masse,\n if the professor should be a few seconds late in coming in\u00ac\n to the recitation-room.

He felt every lesson missed was a loss to\n him, and that the professor owed him the recitation. He\n therefore would not leave, but await the professor\u2019s ar\u00ac\n rival. This brought the ire of the class down on Merton,\n and frequent threats of vengeance.

After\n this the boys found him more obdurate than ever. It was\n not the way to gain their end. Merton held his own, and\n finally brought \u201csloping\u201d into disfavor. The boys liked\n him the better in the end for what he did; although it\n seemed a little hard for him at first. He was very desirous\n of gaining the friendship of his class; but he could not\n think it right to possess that friendship, at the expense of\n losing his recitations.

Father Sanctity\n was there, and was even invited by the Rev. Mr. Tubbs to\n make the closing prayer. He did so in a most familiar,\n boisterous manner.

The people having been dismissed, there was a\n general shaking of hands. Merton approached Father Sanc\u00ac\n tity, and offered him his hand. He refused to take it, say\u00ac\n ing Merton had hurt him the preceding year. Merton told\n him he was shocked at him, at the mockery of his prayer,\n and advised him to go home, enter his secret chamber,\n and come out no more until he had a better heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here Merton had the most certain proof that man may\n use the words of prayer, yet never pray; that his lips may\n say, \u201cthe Ford be with you,\u201d while in his heart he may\n wish that you be possessed of a demon. Of this fact he be\u00ac\n came more and more convinced, as he watched more and\n more the lives of those who prayed. This knowledge in\u00ac\n creased the doubts already existing in his breast, and made\n him begin a more searching investigation of the fundamen\u00ac\n tals of Christianity. He felt more and more the uncertain\u00ac\n ty of things received without question, and determined not\n to enter on the work of the ministry, until he sought and\n obtained more information. He therefore made up his mind\n to complete a theological course. By so doing he felt sure\n he should get more light on those matters which now were\n so obscure to him. Surely, he thqught, men whose sole\n work it is to teach theology, must know more than all others\n about the Being of whom they speak. So Merton thought,\n but so he found was not the case. Rather did he find in\n theology a mass of jarring words, and of unreasonable and\n conflicting statements; and in theologians, the bitterest an\u00ac\n tagonism to one another, and a general and profound ig\u00ac\n norance concerning the subjects of which they speak.

In due time\n I was surprised to know that the result of my assay agreed\n exactly with that of the regular assayist. For this I thanked\n God; but, still, I was undecided. Again I asked for a sign.\n I took some more ore, and, as before, divided it into two\n equal portions, keeping one myself, and sending the other\n to the assayist. This time I promised God that if I could\n find no metal in the ore as the result of my assay, I would\n not doubt that He had called me to preach the everlasting\n Gospel of the Son of God. To my great surprise, although\n the assayist found the same percentage of metal as be\u00ac\n fore, I could not find even a trace.

It\n seems to me it takes a miracle to prove a miracle, and that ?\n too, without end; and this fact, it seems to me, makes belief\n in miracles impossible. In your case I find it much easier\n to suppose, first, that the crucible leaked, or, second, that\n the ore was non metallic, than in the occurrence of a\n miracle. Again, you must have been greatly excited, be\u00ac\n lieving as you did in the visible interference of the hand of\n God.

Merton, while at his house one\n evening, was told the following in proof of miraculous\n interferences: \u201c Not long ago,\u201d he said, \u201c I lost my place\n on the New York Exchange. I tried every honest means,\n to get back, but my enemies were too powerful for me. My\n family, used to luxury, was now threatened with want. In\n this state I sent a letter to one of the most prominent mem\u00ac\n bers, who, I knew, if he would, could have me re-instated in\n my former position. He answered my letter, saying: \u2018 Ask\n me no favors; I have done with you.

It is wonderful on what flimsy evidence\n the credulous-minded man admits the occurrence of mira\u00ac\n cles; but the reasonable man can not easily be induced to\n look beyond nature, as he knows it, for the explanation of\n things occurring in nature.

As Merton reflected on\n these different phases of human life, he thought how fre\u00ac\n quently they are all experienced by the one human soul.\n As the gamut contains all the notes of the scale, so some\n men seem to experience every varied phase of human life,\n from the highest point of power to the lowest depths of\n degradation and woe.\n</p>\n<p>\n Merton spent some time in the city, and while there\n saw such marks of poverty as he never before had seen,\n and never afterwards forgot.

In his heart, however,\n he was not sure whether the precipitous rout of the allied\n forces of dogmatism was owing to bad generalship, or to\n lack of power and virtue in the legions themselves. He\n hoped the cause would be found to be in the former, and\n not in the latter; and that under better generalship, and\n spurred by the memories of past victories, the allied forces\n of dogmatism might yet regain their lost ground, and wave\n once more their flag victorious and triumphant. So, for\n the present, he tried to quiet his fears, and hope for the\n best. But how fleeting is such a quiet! how vain is such\n a hope! Merton had beheld a glimpse of the truth. He\n was passing out of the house of bondage; and, however\n slow, in due time such souls are sure to come into the\n Promised Eand.\n</p>\n<p>\n To Merton the .sweetest of all names was the name of\n Jesus; and surely no sweeter name can be pronounced by\n the lover of righteousness. But the truth was not yet fully\n grasped by him, that it was this sweet Jesus who found in\n the organized church his most inveterate enemy: it was the\n church that condemned and crucified him. And as often\n as the mind of Jesus has been manifested in the church, so\n often has the human being who bore it, been subjected to\n persecution and frequently put to death.

He be\u00ac\n lieved that prayer serves to strengthen and sanctify the\n soul, in the same manner as food serves to strengthen and\n fortify the body. But as he did not believe that God ever\n directly accomplishes for man, what food is known to ac\u00ac\n complish; so had he grave doubts that God ever interferes\n with the natural order of things, notwithstanding prayer\n and supplication. But by \u201cnatural order\u201d it must not be\n supposed that Merton understood anything low or com\u00ac\n mon. In his heart he was inclined to believe that nature\n is the grand totality in which God is ever manifesting\n himself; and that the laws of nature are only the constant\n manner in which the universally present, and immutable,\n Divine Being operates in it. As man is nothing apart\n from his body, so God is nothing apart from nature.\n Mind and body make man; so the material universe, and\n the soul which operates it, make God. He could not help\n coming to this conclusion.

L,et us take\n the least possible portion of nature, a mere atom of so-\n called matter. What have we? We answer, a mere point\n of force, an infinitely small particle of nature. It is evident\n that two infinitely small points can not occupy the same\n space, at the same time; and that since God can not be\n apart from any portion of nature, the infinitely small por\u00ac\n tion of nature we are now considering, must be of the Di\u00ac\n vine Essence.

And since it is the nat\u00ac\n ural order, that for whatever man possesses, be it money,\n power, or wisdom, he must labor in some way or other,\n until he obtains it; Merton could not understand, how it\n would be reasonable to expect from God such interference\n with the natural order, as Mr. Carter claimed. Merton had\n firm faith in prayer. It was a soul-food without which he\n had never lived. But he thought of prayer, not as a means\n of compelling, or coercing God; but as a means of com\u00ac\n pelling, coercing, or educating himself, better to interpret\n the mind or will of God. Thus by prayer he might be en\u00ac\n abled to form a better judgment, where and how to begin\n his work; but he doubted that God would grant the min\u00ac\n ister information on terms easier than those on which He\n grants skill to the mechanic, wisdom to the philosopher,\n or right management to the farmer. He knew well it is a\n peculiar favor the minister frequently claims; but he was\n also convinced there was no reason for such claim.

The bishop answered his letter very fully, and spoke\n \u2022 of a church, in a certain city of that state, needing a pas\u00ac\n tor; and advised Merton, at the same time, to write the\n presiding elder of the district, where the church was sit\u00ac\n uated. Having addressed the latter concerning the matter,\n Merton received an answer to the effect, that the vacancy\n had been for some time filled. While unable to give him\n that appointment, the elder urged Merton to come to Kan\u00ac\n sas, filling his letter with the most glowing accounts of the\n country. The advantages to be had in coming there, he\n said, were very many: the climate was unequalled; the\n people were reaching out their hands; and the possibilities\n for the minister could not be surpassed. A few days after\u00ac\n wards, Merton received a letter from another presiding eld\u00ac\n er, of the same state, offering him the choice of two, as\n he said, very desirable appointments.\n</p>\n<p>\n At first Mrs. Merton was very unwilling to go so far\n west; but after a little persuasion, she consented, hoping\n with Merton that the voice that called him, was the voice\n of God.

Tired as he was when the work of\n the day had been finished, he had to travel to Littleville,\n a distance of more than four miles, in as dark a night as\n he had ever known. Through the thick darkness he groped\n his way over the railroad ties, cheered by the conscious\u00ac\n ness of having done his duty. One bridge had been crossed;\n but yet another was to come much more dangerous than\n that. The ties of the former were spanned by boards, but\n the ties of this were not spanned; and underneath them ran\n a roaring torrent of water swollen to such a degree from\n the late rains, that it threatened to carry away the whole\n structure. The intense darkness, and the roar of the tor\u00ac\n rent below, made him hesitate, tremble; and the frequent\n flashes of the vivid lightning made the scene still more ap\u00ac\n palling. He could not see where to step, and one false\n step would hurl him into the flood beneath. What then\n would Mrs. Merton do! The thought made his head swim;\n and to prevent himself from, falling, he crossed the most\n dangerous part of the bridge on his hands and knees. A-\n gain and again in his heart did he rebel against the work\n he had to do; and as often did he say: \u201cIt is my Father\u2019s\n hand that leadeth me, and he doth all things well.

No sooner had he done this\n than,with a frightful howl,they sprang at the horse.

As soon as this\n was done, they.stopped pursuing Merton; and the whole\n prairie seemed resonant with the howls of the ferocious\n beasts. But even though no longer pursued, the horse\n would not be checked. On it rushed like a meteor, until\n it dashed into the yard of its owner.

The\n town was composed chiefly of one short street, formed\n of detached, low-built houses, and dilapidated stores. The\n side-walks were as irregular as waves on the ocean\u2019s beach;\n and in front of the stores, sat men puffing volumes of smoke\n from their cherished pipes, and talking of politics and re\u00ac\n ligion. Among them was Mr. Smalleyes, who had come\n for the purpose of taking Merton,in his carriage,to his new\n appointment, a place ten miles distant from the railroad\n depot.\n</p>\n<p>\n Merton was to preach at three points, namely, Mazar,\n Moth, and Budds. At Mazar,his place of residence, there\n was neither church nor meeting-house, but the rudiments\n of a village; at Moth there was a nice little church,but no\n village; and at Budds there was neither church nor village,\n the preaching being done in a school-house.\n</p>\n<p>\n In making his pastoral visits, Merton first called on\n Mrs. Rattlebones.

The best men\n we have here, never go to church ; they have had too much\n of it already. Mr. Hardtocrack, for instance, is as good as\n a man can be ; but he never goes to church. He had a\n very pretty daughter to whom Mr. Smalleyes\u2019 son was en.\n gaged. While in this relation, this young blackguard be\u00ac\n trayed her. What did his father do? Why he sent him out\n of the country, and left the poor girl to live in open shame.\n Mr. Backslider is another good man. He had made a note\n promising to pay the church authorities the sum of two hun\u00ac\n dred dollars toward building the church here. Things went\n against him. His note became due ; he couldn\u2019t pay it.\n Mr. Smalleyes thereupon sued him, and forced him to sell\n what little stock he had to meet it. He now spends all his\n spare time in cursing the Methodists. Mr. Blackbird was\n treated in like manner, and to-day is a bitter enemy to the\n church. The minister went around with a subscription-\n paper ; Mr. Blackbird signed it; his promise became due ;\n he was unable to meet it; he was sued, and forced to pay it\n at the expense of selling his stock.

Do the members of our\n churches live any better lives than those wiio make no\n profession whatever? I have my doubts that they do. The\n ethics of Aristotle or Plato,- who certainly were not\n Christians, would damn to the very depths of hell the\n average church-goer. It was but yesterday that a sincere\n Christian woman said: \u2018The churches are full of infidels\u2019,\n ' fhere is more truth than fiction in her saying. So-called\n Christian civilization differs from heathenism more be\u00ac\n cause of its power to wear an outside garb, than because\n of any superior inner qualities.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Merton was coming to see more and more that the true\n value of any religious faith, should be measured by its\n power to make men better in this world, the only world\n we know anything about. But such evidence as he had,\n went to prove that professors were no kinder, no more\n charitable, no more merciful, no more forgiving, no more\n honorable in their dealings\u2014in short,no better than those\n who made no profession; indeed, he sometimes thought\n that the latter were the nobler men. Who was he who\n first called on them in their new home, and inquired if\n they were comfortable or not? He was one of the so-called\n children of this world.

The leaders of the revivalists\n were nothing but a band of horse-thieves. I and my wife\n knew a very successful revivalist who generally ended his\n work by seducing one or two young girls. I often wonder\n why people can put confidence in such men. Who knows\n them? Nobody. They pass through the country like met\u00ac\n eors, and disappear the same way.

Rather was he conscious that\n every inference he got from life in this world, went to dis\u00ac\n prove it. There are countless hosts of men who; though\n they put forth strenuous efforts to lift themselves above and\n out of their surroundings, yet die in despair, engulfed in\n the immoral filth in which they were born and raised; like\u00ac\n wise are there multitudes who, though they put forth\n scarcely any efforts of their own, yet because of their inher\u00ac\n ited tendencies, family relations,early associations, and ed\u00ac\n ucation, live fairly good, moral lives, and die what are called\n good church-members. According to the doctrine of a fixed\n state after death, the former are eternally damned, while the\n latter are eternally blest. Now, if any man can see a par\u00ac\n ticle of justice in such judgment, he must certainly look\n through other eyes than those of reason. Certainly there\n would be no justice in such decrees. If it were possible for\n the God of the universe thus to judge, it is certain that He,\n being of such character, must remain unknown to us.

But there are no evidences\n of a fixed state in this life ; on the contrary, all is constant\n change. Every sun-rise brings with it new opportunities,\n every sun-set carries with it lost ones.

He never had any faith in\n death-bed repentance; and he fully believed that one good\n nurse was worth any number of praying priests, at the bed\u00ac\n side of a sick man. That the mercy of God is conditioned on\n the prayers of a minister,or heaven opened by the power of\n the church, he considered not only an absurd but a blasphe\u00ac\n mous claim.

Thus performing our part,\n danger may surround, and threaten us on every side;\n but greater is the danger that must ever threaten him who\n shuns the performance of his duty. In the former case, while\n the death of the body is at most only contingent, the life of\n the soul is certain,because discharging one\u2019s duty ennobles\n the nature,and tends to the elevation of the whole race; but\n in the. latter case, while the life of the body is probable, the\n death of the soul is inevitable,because the wilful avoidance\n of one\u2019s duty, debases the higher nature, and tends to the\n degradation of humanity. The preservation of the body at\n such a cost,is vastly too expensive. Here it is certainly true:\n He that would lose his life, shall save it; and he that would\n save his life,shall lose it. Nevertheless, the body is no less\n the work of God than is the soul, though the office of the\n former is considered less noble than that of the latter. It is,\n therefore, a very grave sin to wilfully destroy the body, or\n injure any of its members. , And even where one\u2019s actions\n unintentionally result in the death of the body, great sin\n must be incurred, if such result should have been prevented*\n by the proper use of reason. Many a man has been given,\n especially by the press, the death of a hero; when wisdom as\u00ac\n sures us,it was the death of a fool. The noble nature shuns\n no danger that ought to be encountered, and runs into no\n danger that ought not to be faced. Where duty had called\n Merton, there he never knew what it was to be afraid; but\n he always thought it most unwise, if not sinful, to rush un\u00ac\n reasonably into danger. Says Aristotle, than whom proba\u00ac\n bly no nobler person ever lived, and whose wisdom has,\n perhaps, never been equalled:\n</p>\n<p>\n l ' Uar eirel ^ avdpeia eariv ij eXriarrj 2\u00a3ts wept 06/?oi ' S nai Odppt),\n Set 5 e p^Q ' ovrw s ws oi Opaaeh pr)d ' ovtcj s ws oi 8 ei\\ol StjXov ws\n 17 ptait) diddeais dpaatinqros Kai SetXtas eariv avdpeia ....\n H 7 dp avdpeia dKoXoddrjais rip Xdycp iariv, 9 Se X070S rd KaXbv\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0185/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 260}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0185/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 318, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 521}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0185/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 637, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1042}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0185/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2084}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0185/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4168}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0185/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/as/on/do/gm/ao/rf/oo/00/br/ay/_0/reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0/reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0185.jp2", "height": 4168, "width": 2551, "levels": 6, "size": 536791}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"185\">\n<p>\n THE CALL, OF DUTY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 175\n</p>\n<p>\n acpecadac xeXeoec.

True\n bravery is obedience to the reason, and reason bids us strive\n for that which is noble. Therefore, he who, when surrounded\n by danger, is not guided by reason, is either cowardly or\n rash. The coward fears where he should not, and the rash\n man is fearless where he should not be. But the truly brave\n acts in both instances as he should, and, therefore, fills the\n middle position ; for he is both fearless and fearful as rea\u00ac\n son directs him.\u201d (Eud. Eth. Ill, 1, [3-4, 10-12.] )\n</p>\n<p>\n As far as the fear of death has affected me, I have often\n longed to die, to escape, as it were, from a prison, and to see\n if perchance there be something better in store for me ; no\n less than to be forever free from a world, where the insincere\n and the pretentious are received with the plaudits of the\n crowd, while the candid and truly learned seek in vain for\n recognition. It can not be doubted that humanity is as\n greatly deceived, as it is given to deception. Mankind likes\n flattery, and to be made the heir of great expectations. It\n is this in man that offers such great opportunities to the\n hypocritical, the insincere and the pretentious, whether in\n the pulpit or elsewhere ; it is this that gives the holy knave\n and the rascally politician such open fields to reap their\n golden harvests. But longed as I have to die, reason bids\n me wait my time ; to be brave, sincere and true, no less for\n my own sake than as an example to others.

The Episcopal Church was the first\n Catholic Church in this country; and therefore she is the only\n one that to-day is here by divine right.

The fact on\n which this assertion is based, is said to have been discover\u00ac\n ed by Mr. Fane, of Washington. It would seein strange,\n but it is admittedly no less true, that a gaseous body los\u00ac\n ing heat by radiation, and contracting under gravity,\n must, instead of falling in temperature, actually grow hotter\n and hotter, until it ceases to be a perfect gas. The energy\n acquired by the contraction, is more than that lost by\n radiation. In the case of a solid or liquid this is not so.\n Contraction may supply heat for radiation; but it can not\n raise the temperature of the contracting solid or liquid body,\n nor keep it from gradually falling. Little by little the\n temperature of such a body must be reduced to that of\n surrounding space.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe condition of our sun to-day is known to be one that\n is neither a true gas, nor a liquid, nor a solid. In parts\n it is a true gas, as is proved by the spectroscope; in other\n parts, as in the photospheric clouds, there is much liquid;\n while in yet other parts, it is possibly solid. The present\n relative proportions of true gases and liquids in our sun\n are such as to keep his temperature about stationary.\n (Young.)

If a man contends wilfully for the truth of\n error, he paralyzes his mind, and renders himself incapable\n of searching for further truth; even if he only unintentional\u00ac\n ly does this, he is liable to be confirmed in the belief of his\n error.

Augustine lays down premises, and through his\n blinding passion to conquer, strives, according to the pro\u00ac\n verb, to make himself and others believe that his conclu\u00ac\n sions are true. Adam, he tells us, was created with a nature\n \u2018posse non peccare et non mori/ that is, with such a na\u00ac\n ture that he might have lived free from sin and free from\n death; but having transgressed, Adam, he says, became\n \u2018 non posse non peccare et non mori/ that is, became such\n that he could not live without sin nor without death. Now,\n since man is declared in Scripture incapable of self-redemp\u00ac\n tion, Augustine holds that it is evident that as many as are\n saved, are saved by grace; and since all are not saved, al\u00ac\n though they would be, that it is not because of their lack of\n desire, but because of the eternal and unconditional decree\n of God. Thus we find Augustine denying the freedom of\n the mind, offering us an absurd gospel, and presenting us\n with a god the most unjust and base. All this he does in\n contention for what he has assumed. This is the predesti\u00ac\n nation theory which ' has its advocates in the Christian\n church of to-day, and which, if true, would induce me to\n be very charitable of the devil\u2019s sin, and conclude God not\n only the author and builder of hell, but also of all the sin in\n the universe. Such false doctrine kills the soul of the\n tea cher, and certainly unfits it for noble living or noble dy\u00ac\n ing, by philosophically destroying the highest incentives to\n virtue, and reducing man to a mere tool.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Belief saves nobody; the truth only saves.

In the first place, there\n are the authors of the synoptic gospels, Matthew, Mark and\n Luke. To the author or words of the fourth gospel, it is\n useless to refer, since both the author and his words are\n subjects of too much uncertainty and speculation. What\n shall we say of the three who remain to testify to the life\n and words of Christ ? I answer, we can say nothing; for of\n their persons and lives we have no really satisfactory and\n authentic information. From tradition and the little we find\n in the New Testament itself concerning them, it is generally\n inferred that they were ignorant men, and, therefore, we\n say, totally unfit to discriminate between the miraculous and\n the natural. When I ask for proof of it, I can not find that\n the apostles had sufficient ability to determine the questions\n at issue. Indeed, in the early ages it was a much disputed\n question, whether the apostles could even write ; and to-day\n the question is far from settled. In the second place, if I\n ask for the production of the evidence upon which the\n apostles base their opinions, what do we find ? Why, I am\n presented with a few documents disagreeing in many ma\u00ac\n terial points, and whose authors are either wholly unknown,\n or subjects of contradictory judgments. Let us examine\n more closely. Even if we admit that the author of our\n present Gospel of St. Matthew, was the same person as the\n Matthew who is said to have been the apostle of Christ, still\n it does not help us much ; for Papias distinctly says that\n this Matthew \u2018 put together the oracles of the Lord in the\n Hebrew language, and each one interpreted it as best he\n could.\u2019 Of this original work of St. Matthew we know ab\u00ac\n solutely nothing ; and it does not increase our confidence in\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0237/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 260}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0237/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 318, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 521}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0237/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 637, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1042}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0237/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2084}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0237/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4168}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0237/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/as/on/do/gm/ao/rf/oo/00/br/ay/_0/reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0/reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0237.jp2", "height": 4168, "width": 2551, "levels": 6, "size": 536542}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"237\">\n<p>\n THOUGHTS OF AN HONEST PRIEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n 227\n</p>\n<p>\n the copy we possess, to be told bv Papias that each one\n translated the original as best he could.

Stating it more briefly : of the\n writer of the original St. Matthew we have no definite and\n satisfactory information ; we do not possess the original, nor\n know of any one that ever did ; the Gospel of St. Matthew\n which we possess, is not the original St. Matthew, but at\n best only a translation made by some unknown person whose\n ability to perform such labor must be questioned, since he\n did it only \u2018as best he could\u2019 ; or, lastly and probably, it\n may be the compilation of an unknown author, based chiefly\n upon the original Gospel of St. Mark. I ask any candid and\n unprejudiced mind, is there no room for doubt about the\n statements made in such a gospel. Such a question admits of\n but one answer. When we come to the Gospel of St. Mark,\n we find no better satisfaction. Of the person and life of St.\n Mark we know nothing, or worse than nothing, except the\n little we gather from the New Testament; on the latter we\n can place, in our judgment, but little reliance, as well be\u00ac\n cause it is a witness testifying in its own behalf, as of the\n unsatisfactory character of what is there said. If I ask,\n therefore, for proof of the ability of St. Mark to determine\n the questions at issue, it is impossible for me to get it.

And as a\n friend and counsellor, I have the right to pray that God, our\n common Father, may give you strength to stand the evils\n you now have to bear. The divinity of Christ is nothing to\n me. I know it is a dogma of the church, that never has\n been established.

Man as\n man reaches out his hands after the hidden, yet everywhere\n present and felt, Deity. God is the object not only of the\n Christian heart, but of the heart of humanity. It is as nat\u00ac\n ural for the human soul to turn to its God, as for the flower\n to turn to the sun. You, therefore, as man, not as a Chris\u00ac\n tian, have the right to act as man, and lean on Him who\n alone can give you strength to bear your present evils; and I\n as man, not as a Christian, have the privilege to call on our\n common Father for the brother that I have upon this bed,\n in so great distress. As a believer in humanity, I pray to\n God for you, and not as a believer in the dogmas to which\n you refer. But if you do not believe in human nature, if\n you believe that its convictions are false, then, of course, it\n is useless for me to point you to it, as my warrant for\n prayfer.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThank you, Merton,\u201d he said; \u201cI like you, like to\n hear you talk.

This letter, as Merton was afterwards told by Mrs.\n Gray, was at the sick man\u2019s request frequently read to him,\n during the last few days of his painful life, and she thought\n it had a great influence over him for good; for at his death,\n which occurred in Washington, D.

But notwithstanding the greatness and wisdom\n of such writers, the reading of these words evokes only a\n laugh to-day, and rightly so.

For his own part, Merton was obliged to confess\n that he had never received such evidence. He had never\n witnessed a miracle; therefore he could not possibly say\n that he was satisfied with the evidence he had of Christ\u2019s\n divinity; but he wished, as his disciple, to make himself\n and others, more worthy of being called the children of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n To teach the deity of a person, is to teach a most stu-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0248/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 260}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0248/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 318, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 521}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0248/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 637, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1042}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0248/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2084}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0248/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4168}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0248/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/as/on/do/gm/ao/rf/oo/00/br/ay/_0/reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0/reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0248.jp2", "height": 4168, "width": 2551, "levels": 6, "size": 563734}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"248\">\n<p>\n 238\n</p>\n<p>\n FOOTPRINTS OF A SOUL.\n</p>\n<p>\n pendous miracle; even that a virgin should bring forth a\n son, is something at variance with all the known laws of\n nature.

I\n must admit that the analogy between the birth, life, and\n death of Buddha, and the birth, life, and death of Jesus,\n seems almost exact; and it is by no means impossible that\n the Buddhistic traditions floated around among the Jewish\n people, clad as it were in Jewish clothing, and that, in due\n time, they assumed the form they have in our present gos\u00ac\n pels; for it would be an easy matter to change the name of\n the hero, making it a Jew called Jesus, instead of an Indian\n called Buddha. Look at the analogy: Buddha was born of\n a royal and virgin mother, so was Jesus; Buddha\u2019s advent\n was announced to the virgin mother by a mighty angel, so\n was that of Jesus; at the birth of Buddha a new star ap\u00ac\n peared in the east, so it was at the birth of Jesus; wise men\n brought costly offerings from afar to the shrine of the infant\n Buddha, so was it with the infant Jesus; at seeing the infant\n Buddha we have a learned priest singing a nunc dimittis,\n and at the sight of the infant Jesus we have Simeon doing\n likewise, and both declare they had seen the promised Mes\u00ac\n siah ; when it was known that Buddha was born, a wicked\n king, fearing him as a future rival, sends spies after the boy,\n so was it during the infancy of Jesus; Buddha is one day\n missed by his parents who found him some time aftewards\n in an assembly of learned Rishis, surprising them with his\n questions and answers; so likewise was Jesus missed by his\n parents, and afterwards discovered, in a similar manner,\n amazing the Jewish doctors. Buddha had a fore-runner, a\n herald; so had Jesus. Buddha fasts in the desert, is tempted\n by the prince of evil spirits, and chooses his disciples;\n so Jesus fasts, is tempted by the devil, and chooses disciples.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0254/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 260}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0254/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 318, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 521}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0254/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 637, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1042}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0254/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2084}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0254/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4168}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0254/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/as/on/do/gm/ao/rf/oo/00/br/ay/_0/reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0/reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0254.jp2", "height": 4168, "width": 2551, "levels": 6, "size": 583315}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"254\">\n<p>\n 244\n</p>\n<p>\n FOOTPRINTS OF A SOUL.\n</p>\n<p>\n Buddha had a beloved, a doubting, and a traitorous disci\u00ac\n ple, so had Jesus.

In other\n words, all the principles of the New Testament have cer\u00ac\n tainly been produced by human authors, because they are\n known to have been current long before Christianity was\n established. The fatherhood of God, rewards and punish\u00ac\n ments, immortality, heaven and hell, prayer and sacrifice,\n priest and temple, penitence and divine forgiveness, the\n sanctifying power of the Holy Spirit, the duty of man to\n man and to God,\u2014 all these principles were taught long\n before the advent of Christ, and by people other than the\n so-called elect.

This\n is all the people asked who lived contemporaneously with\n Christ.

It\n seems to me Celsus, even from the garbled account we have\n of his work, would make shorter work of the ministers of to\u00ac\n day, than he made of the ministers who lived at the time of\n his writing.

MERTON, I greatly appreciated your sermon,\u201d\n said banker Pomposity, \u201con the Miraculous in\n Christianity. It was a treat to me,and to all who were pres\u00ac\n ent, last Sunday evening. It is a rare thing, if not a start\u00ac\n ling one,to find a minister who admits the truths of science.\n I myself have long since stood where you now stand.\n Every one that has any knowledge of the matter at all,\n knows well enough that whatever occurs, whether now or\n in times past, is the result of law and established order.\n In order to believe in the immaculate conception of Christ,\n I must conclude that man is not man, that woman is not\n woman, and that God is not immutable but self-contradic\u00ac\n tory ; and all this must I believe on the authority of a few\n pages of writing not much less uncertain or untrustworthy\n than the Arabian Nights. It offends me greatly that any\n minister, through ignorance or fear, should dare preach\n such stuff in the presence of the average congregation. I\n am sure that if Jesus Christ wasn\u2019t the son of his mother\u2019s\n husband,he must have been illegitimate born; and this latter\n I do not believe. That the ignorant followers of Jesus might\n possibly have believed in his divine conception, is no reason\n whatever that I should believe in it; for in like manner were\n the founders of many other religions supposed to have been\n divinely conceived. Indeed, in early days immaculate\n conceptions were common; for it was nothing unusual for\n gods to have union with women.

In the Gospel of Nicodemus, the whole\n multitude are represented as charging Christ with illegiti\u00ac\n macy; and Celsus introduces a Jew as accusing Christ of\n having invented the story of his birth from a virgin.

In the fourteenth century, when English human\u00ac\n ity began to groan under oppression, and demand the ex\u00ac\n tension of liberty, the church advised emancipation ; but\n although she could advise the barons to emancipate their\n serfs, she had not the virtue to emancipate her own.

Still further removed\n from all Christian influences was Plato, Aristotle\u2019s teacher,\n who left the world three-hundred and forty-seven years be\u00ac\n fore Christ came into it ; and many a gospel might be taken\n from the writings of this noble man, and not a little of the\n Christian gospels is contained therein. Contemporary\n philosophers have many advantages over their ancient\n brethren ; nevertheless, in beauty of diction, sublimity of\n thought, reverence of mind, and moral worth, the ancients\n have never been, and are not likely to be, surpassed. What\n they did, they did well. We are told that the great Lord\n Burleigh always carried, in his breast-pocket, Aristotle\u2019s\n Rhetoric and Cicero\u2019s de Officiis, and that he thought these\n two works sufficient \u201c to make both a scholar and an honest\n man.\u201d In some respects, however, the ancient philosophers\n had advantages over their modern brethren. In their days\n the scholar was more highly respected, and much less em\u00ac\n barrassed with the cares of a life whose demands seem to\n increase, as the years roll on.

But anxious\n as he was to do the will of him who sends every man into\n the world, Merton yet felt a pain at the thought of resum\u00ac\n ing pulpit work. Now he was conscious of a freedom for\n which he had often longed. The broadness of the prairie,\n the clearness of the sky, the brightness of the sun and stars,\n the vividness of the lightning, the pealing of the thunder,\n the roaring of the wind, were all calculated to inspire\n independence of spirit and freedom of action. As he look\u00ac\n ed ' over the vast and rolling plains, he would think of the\n broadness of God\u2019s creation, and the narrowness of his\n creed, which man had created; and often would determine\n to rid himself of the shackles which bound him, and escape\n from the slave-master\u2019s coils. The thought that he was\n free from bishops\u2019 dictation, gave him a peculiar satis\u00ac\n faction. Should death there overtake him, it would find\n him ready; and the earth that would receive him, was\n dearer than consecrated ground. No funeral dirge would\n have been said over his body; no hollow, priestly prayers\n would have been given to the wind. As he would have\n died in peace, so without sham or pretense would he have\n been given to the earth to await his lot. Having resumed\n his work, Merton, one morning after preaching a mission\u00ac\n ary sermon, was thus addressed by his wife:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHarry, why are you so much troubled?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI am troubled,\u201d he answered \u201cat the thought of the\n disagreement of my mind with the teachings of the church\n at whose altar I serve.

The foundation of\n all missionary work is, that out of Christ all nations are in\n a lost and hopeless state; or, at least, that without faith in\n Christ as their Redeemer and God, there is no known salva\u00ac\n tion for any people. You know I do not believe that the\n so-called heathen nations are lost, or that they are without\n a known salvation, any more than we are.

It is not needed\n to bring them into a state of salvation ; for in that state\n every child of man is, and always has been. If I believed\n otherwise, I should have to say, \u2018 Poor God ! What can be\n done for him ! The happiness of himself and his children\n is wholly dependent on the good-will and activity of the\n missionary society.\u2019 All nations have, as they believe, their\n redeemers, their divine mediators, and holy revelations; and\n this is all we can say for ourselves. We believe certain\n things which distinguish us as Christians; but of those same\n things, we can prove absolutely nothing. In such belief I\n can put no real confidence. On this one thing I wholly\n rely: the universal fatherhood of God: God dwells in all\n things, in all men; and He is reflected by each man as man\u2019s\n mind is polished with intelligence, and his heart with\n purity. All men receive Him in some measure; of this we\n are sufficiently certain from our knowledge of the religious\n nature of universal man.

But that a faith makes a man happy, is no sufficient\n reason for holding or adopting it. A man might have all\n confidence in his ship, although, unknown to him, she may\n be fast filling with water. As a rule, the faithful followers\n of any religion are contented and happy. I can assure you\n that the degree of happiness a religion may give a man, has\n nothing to do with its truth or falsity. But although I have\n known some ministers whose sincerity and truthfulness I\n have had no reason to doubt, I have known many more who\n were insincere and untruthful. Such ministers have spoken\n to me of their doubts concerning Christ\u2019s divinity, who yet\n in their sermons never breathe such doubts; have denied to\n me the Trinity, and afterwards in the pulpit affirmed their\n faith in it; have denied to me the personality of the devil,\n and afterwards before their people asserted their belief in it;\n denied eternal punishment, and in their public utterances\n affirmed it; denied the inspiration of the Scriptures, and on\n the very next Sunday affirmed their faith in it. All this I\n have known them to do; and the only excuse they give, is\n that a man should not give utterance in the pulpit to his pri\u00ac\n vate opinions. I tell you, doctor, I am sick of the insincer\u00ac\n ity and hypocrisy that I have witnessed among ministers.\n Some good and noble men there are ; but, as I have said, I\n do not believe that the average minister is, in the true sense,\n a good and noble man.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c I have seen enough, indeed, to assure me that ministers,\n like others, are in general moved by a short-sighted selfish-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0323/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 260}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0323/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 318, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 521}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0323/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 637, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1042}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0323/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2084}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0323/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4168}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0323/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/as/on/do/gm/ao/rf/oo/00/br/ay/_0/reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0/reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0323.jp2", "height": 4168, "width": 2551, "levels": 6, "size": 534115}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"323\">\n<p>\n *\n</p>\n<p>\n A PRIEST AND A PHYSICIAN. 313\n</p>\n<p>\n ness which teaches, that the welfare of the body is more\n than that of the soul.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAnd what good, indeed, do you suppose I could get by\n going to church?

This time of felt security did not come be\u00ac\n fore near the close of the second century.

The proofs, however, which this good\n father adduced for it, were not unlike those the church\n fathers adduced for other beliefs.

It moves, and reacts against stimuli\u201d.\n Furthermore, in lower animal life in general the waste\n resulting from the wear and tear of life is not so great as\n it is in the higher ones. In man this waste is very great\n indeed; for in him \u201cthe constituent cells live very fast,\n making much waste, and using much food\u201d. (Martin).\n Some idea of cell life may be had from the action of blood\n corpuscles. The colorless blood corpuscles act as if living\n animals. Each of these consists of a soft mass of proto\u00ac\n plasm. They change their forms constantly and sponta\u00ac\n neously, thrusting out one process, and retracting another.\n They are even seen to \u201ccreep across the field of the\n microscope; and they sometimes bore right through the\n capillaries, and creep about among the other tissues\u201d.\n (Martin). As they become chilled, after having been\n taken from the body, they get closer and closer together,\n as pigs on a cold day. Thus we see the elementary stones\n of the human temple are constantly crumbling into dust,\n and others take their places. The body, therefore, that\n we have at one moment, is not, in all of its elements, the\n body we have at the next; far less is the body we have to\u00ac\n day the body we shall have to-morrow.

When\n positive trickery has not been practiced, circumstances have\n been concealed which, if known, would have stripped\n many a transaction of the miraculous aspect which it wore\n in the eyes of the ignorant. In order than an individual\n may be enrolled as a saint, and invoked in this character,\n it has been held to be indispensable that he should have\n wrought miracles. It is easy to conceive not only what a\n stimulus this theory must have afforded to the devout\n imagination, but also what conscious exaggeration and\n wilful invention must have sprung out of such a creed. A\n great number of ecclesiastical miracles can be explained by\n natural causes. Frequently natural events of no uncom\u00ac\n mon occurance are viewed as supernatural. The physical\n effects of vigils and fastings, were no doubt in many cases\n salutary. Heated imagination, ardent faith, confident\n hope, may produce extraordinary effects. A variety of\n nervous disorders are cured by sudden shocks.\u201d Mr.\n Fisher then admits that if the Gospel miracles were of the\n character of the ecclesiastical, \u201cthere might be no occasion\n for referring them to supernatural agency;\u201d but he, of\n course, denies their similarity.\n</p>\n<p>\n In reply we would say that in most ancient times, no\n less than in apostolic, men were predisposed to belief in\n the miraculous.

There\n are many ignorant, earnest Christians who fully believe in\n the power of prayer to move the Deity to act in their be\u00ac\n half. On the other hand, most scientists affirm that prayer\n is not only irrational, but that it partakes of the nature of\n irreverence, if not of blasphemy. Such men may find some\n reasonable hope of immortality; but they find no grounds\n whatever of hoping for an answer to prayer. Nor must it\n be supposed that only irreligious scientists and infidels thus\n deny the efficacy of prayer; for even some who are among\n the most religious take the same position. Says Eckhart:\n \u2018Thou needst not tell God what thou hast need of; he knows\n it all beforehand. If I pray for anything, I pray for that\n which is nothing. He who prays for anything besides God,\n prays for that which is an idol. The pure man does not\n pray; for every prayer is for some definite object, but the\n heart of the pure craves for nothing. God is not moved\n by our prayers. He has foreseen all things from eternity,\n including, therefore, our prayers; and he has from all eter\u00ac\n nity granted or refused them\u2019.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBut if prayer has no other value, it is certainly of in\u00ac\n finite value in its subjective influence. We should pray\n rather that God\u2019s will be done in us, than for any special\n object or favor.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cNear the close of Israel\u2019s wanderings, and on the east\u00ac\n ern side of the Jordan, opposite Jericho, might have been seen\n</p>\n<p>\n two men,Balak and Balaam, the former being the king of\n</p>\n<p>\n 338\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0349/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 260}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0349/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 318, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 521}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0349/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 637, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1042}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0349/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2084}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0349/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4168}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0349/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/as/on/do/gm/ao/rf/oo/00/br/ay/_0/reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0/reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0349.jp2", "height": 4168, "width": 2551, "levels": 6, "size": 496067}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"349\">\n<p>\n THE HEAVENLY ADVERSARY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 339\n</p>\n<p>\n Moab, the latter his heathen priest.

As the practice of virtue, justice, or righteous\u00ac\n ness, makes a man virtuous, just, or righteous ; so he who\n does not practice justice, virtue, or righteousness, can never\n become a good man. The knowledge of what constitutes\n these noble, moral traits, is not sufficient: right theory and\n proper practice are each alike necessary to the develop\u00ac\n ment of a good man. In this, as\u2019in other arts or sciences,\n every man is not competent to theorize for himself; for\n virtue is as much the flower of reason, as the rose is the\n bloom of the rose-tree. Now all rose-trees are not alike :\n while some are so situated as to produce a perfect rose,\n others are not. And when we desire to know the nature of\n a rose, we never think of choosing a stunted and sickly tree;\n but we search until we find a perfect one. Thus when we\n search after the normal action, and proper uses, of the reason,\n we do not choose for examination a sickly, poorly endowed,\n badly educated mind ; but one, as far as possible, properly\n educated, and harmoniously developed. Ever and anon\n such a man appears ; and, like a star of the first magnitude,\n his path of life is a stream of light emanating from virtue.\n Such a soul is indeed a true light that lighteth every man\n that cometh into the world. In him only is seen the truly\n beautiful and good ; and he only has that reason which\n may be taken as our guide. Such a man has meat and drink\n of which the multitude know nothing ; and to him nature is\n responsive and the secret of happiness made known. To\n virtue nothing is beautiful but truth ; for virtue seeks great\u00ac\n ness of soul, and greatness of soul continually feeds on\n truth\u2019s immortal fruit. Virtue can never be fed on silver or\n gold, or any other external adornment ; for in possession of\n all these, it would speedily sicken and die.

Every other* possession\n is sought as a means ; virtue only is sought for itself. Virtue\n is true life, soul-life ; the absence of virtue is true death,\n soul-death. Soul-life is spiritual life, and spiritual life is\n divine energy, and divine energy is an emanation from the\n one Universal Spirit, God. He that dwelleth in virtue,\n therefore, dwelleth in God, and God in him. The posses\u00ac\n sion of virtue gives peace, rest, trust, hope, courage and joy;\n the total lack of virtue leaves the soul in outer darkness, and\n deplorable misery ; while the lack of it, in any degree, mars\n to that extent the sacred temple of God. From the petty\n jealousies and hatreds of neighbors to the armament of\n continents in universal strife, every thing destructive to\n human happiness, can be attributed to the lack of virtue. On\n the other hand, whatever happiness is found, blessings ex\u00ac\n perienced, or peace possessed, may certainly be said to be\n the fruit of virtue. Well may virtue be its own reward ;\n for with it, poverty is riches ; without it, the millionaire is a\n beggar.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Virtue we have said is soul-life.

I would not like to live\n without faith in the immortality of the soul, Sunshine. Here,\n I fancy, we scarcely begin to know, to love, or to do. We\n come into the world infants physically, and leave it infants\n mentally and spiritually.

So in the case of the death of a lit\u00ac\n tle son he had lost: Merton believed that it was not a re\u00ac\n sult in accordance with the will of God, but of injudicious\n treatment or nursing.\n</p>\n<p>\n By their death Merton was made more practical, more\n realistic, more skeptical; less visionary, less superstitious,\n less credulous; more a child of reason, less a slave of\n dogma.\n</p>\n<p>\n Easter, Easter, glorious Easter! how I love thy glorious time!\n Alleluia! heaven\u2019s echoes fill- my soul with hope divine;\n</p>\n<p>\n And the earth, her icy garments casting off, from nature\u2019s bed,\n Brings with joy her new creation, leaping, bursting from the dead.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0383/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 260}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0383/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 318, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 521}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0383/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 637, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1042}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0383/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2084}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0383/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4168}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0383/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/as/on/do/gm/ao/rf/oo/00/br/ay/_0/reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0/reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0383.jp2", "height": 4168, "width": 2551, "levels": 6, "size": 471411}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"383\">\n<p>\n DEATH AND IMMORTALITY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 373\n</p>\n<p>\n Easter, Easter, heavenly Easter! lays to thee divine I\u2019ll sing,\n When thv Son, the Lamb of Calvary warms my wintry soul with\n spring;\n</p>\n<p>\n When the yearning hope within me, for a power from death to save,\n Rises clad with exultation at the Christ who bursts the grave.\n</p>\n<p>\n Easter, Easter! saints and angels, all creation\u2019s wide domain,\n Bring to thee their alleluias; and we join their sweet refrain;\n Alleluias to the Father, alleluias to the Son,\n</p>\n<p>\n Alleluias to Jehovah, to the great Eternal One.\n</p>\n<p>\n Easter, Easter, joyful Easter!

I can not tell you exactly what the\n work of Moses was; but I do emphatically deny that he\n was really the author of the ten commandments. Moses\n was a wise, shrewd and great character. He was a Hebrew\n of the tribe of Levi, who in the natural course of events\n had received the benefit of a thorough Egyptian education,\n and the standing of the ruling caste in that country. But\n though indebted to Egypt for his education and social stand\u00ac\n ing, he felt still greater obligations to his own kindred;\n and when he saw them, once free men of the plains, now\n serfs of their Egyptian lords, he determined on their deliv\u00ac\n erance, and, with this object in view, set himself at their\n head. Having had all the benefits of a learned Egyptian\n education, he was well acquainted with Egyptian cosmogony,\n theology, and such sacred writings as were extant, and\n known to the priests of that religious country. I am willing\n to admit that Moses may have formed a kind of digest out\n of the materials known to him on the subject; that he may\n have purified and simplified the modes, forms, and cere\u00ac\n monies, of religious worship; that from his superior mind\n stored with the varied learning of the times, he may have\n made some original contributions to such digest; that\n assisted by his father-in-law, Jethro, a priest of Sinai, he may\n have given the Israelites their national god, Jahve; but that\n there was anything miraculous about the work of Moses, or\n about the origin of the ten commandments, I emphatically\n deny; and I insist that it is very wrong in ministers to teach\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0387/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 260}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0387/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 318, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 521}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0387/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 637, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1042}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0387/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2084}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0387/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4168}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:as:on:do:gm:ao:rf:oo:00:br:ay:_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0:reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0387/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/as/on/do/gm/ao/rf/oo/00/br/ay/_0/reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0/reasondogmaorfoo00bray_0_0387.jp2", "height": 4168, "width": 2551, "levels": 6, "size": 521309}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"387\">\n<p>\n AN INQUISITIVE VISITOR.\n</p>\n<p>\n 377\n</p>\n<p>\n that there is.

The\n historical books of the Old Testament were for the first\n time subjected to a comprehensive revision during the\n Babylonian exile. Says Prof. Carl Heinrich, an orthodox\n theologian of the University of Koenigsburg, speaking of\n the books of the Pentateuch: \u2018Not before the exodus\n from Egypt can we speak in a strict sense of a history of\n the people of Israel. All that lies before this point of time,\n may be characterized as prehistoric. Even if we regard Mo\u00ac\n ses as the author of the five books which bear his name, yet\n concerning this remote epoch, separated from its own by a\n series of centuries, Moses himself would have had to re\u00ac\n sort to oral tradition. It was impossible for him to report\n these things as eye-witness. But it is now generally con\u00ac\n ceded that Moses can not possibly be the author of the\n books named after him. These books originated from the\n comprehensive digestion of a whole series of independent\n written sources, of. which the oldest can not be older than\n King Solomon, nor yet much later, and written conse\u00ac\n quently between 900 and 850. Any comprehensive and\n coherent work earlier than 900 can not be proved. The\n material contents, the ingredients of these narrations, must\n be regarded from the point of view of popular tradition, or\n legend. It remains utterly impossible to state precisely and\n positively of what the work of Moses really consisted;\n since, however unwelcome the truth may be, not even the\n ten commandments may be regarded as actually formu\u00ac\n lated by Moses. We have here only an inverted conclusion\n from effect to cause. \u2019 In theological discussion the aver\u00ac\n age minister invents illogical issues, to inflame the minds\n of his hearers. Denying a special revelation, I am charged\n with denying the sacred character of the Scriptures; deny\u00ac\n ing the deity of Christ, I am charged with denying the\n usefulness and beauty of his life.

In the days of celi\u00ac\n bacy, it was common for the beastly, priestly fathers to trans\u00ac\n mit their ecclesiastical offices to their unlawful-born children;\n and for centuries princes levied a tax called \u201c Culagium,\u201d as\n a licence for priests to keep concubines. The morals of the\n clerical celibates sank far below the morals of laymen. Pope\n John was condemned for adultery, and incest; the abbot-\n elect of St. Augustine at Canterbury, was found, in 1171, to\n have, in a single village, seventeen illigitimate children ; the\n abbot of St. Pelayo, in Spain, was proved, in 1130, to have\n kept no less than seventy concubines; the bishop of Liege was\n proved to have had no less than sixty-five illigitimate children.\n In the days of celibacy, nunneries were turned into places of\n prostitution and infanticide; and incest was so common that\n the most stringent laws were passed against clergymen living\n with their mothers or sisters ; and the employment of the\n confessional for the purposes of debauchery, was a frequent\n and common crime. The papal legate to England, in the\n 12th century, had only just ended his fearful denunciation of\n the unchaste lives of the priests, when he himself was dis\u00ac\n covered in flagrante delictu with a courtesan ; and the\n atrocious immoralities prevailing in the monasteries, at the\n time of their suppression, are well known to all. Indeed, it\n was the custom of many laymen to insist on their priests\n taking concubines, in order to secure the safety of their\n wives and daughters.

Instead of personal purity, there is a long\n story of licenced and unlicenced concubinage, and appendant\n to it, much miscellaneous profligacy, and a general low tone\n of morality in the very point that is supposed to be secured.\n The treatment of such moral evils was left to the church\n courts; the church courts became centres of corruption.\u201d\n Says Kurtz: \u201cBetween the fourth and ninth centuries,the\n unmarried clergy were frequently chargeable with unclean\u00ac\n ness, adultery, and unnatural vices. \u201d The same author,\n speaking of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, says:\n \u2018 \u2018The moral condition of the clergy was sufficiently sad. The\n bishops commonly lived in open concubinage. The lower\n clergy followed their example, and in many cases paid for\n this indulgence a yearly tax to their bishops. To this ar\u00ac\n rangement the people made no objection; in fact, it secured\n their wives and daughters from the temptations of the con\u00ac\n fessional.

Sir: From my youth up I have done scarce\u00ac\n ly anything else than study; and since 1867 I have always\n shaped my studies for the better preparation for the minis\u00ac\n try. My mind is now much disturbed. All men are more\n or less superstitious, often founding mountains of fear upon\n imaginary foundations. From my infancy Christ has been\n my meat and drink. Why should I now hesitate to turn\n aside from a work not at all desirable? My intelligence says,\n \u2018go;\u2019 but the web which my life\u2019s activities have woven\n about me, is hard, yes, painful to break. But, God help\u00ac\n ing me, around whom may my little world ever move, I feel\n I must break through it. That I should have much dis\u00ac\n quietude in ceasing to publish the theme of Calvary, seems\n childish, or at least superstitious; for seeking after God on\n purely Platonic grounds, I should be confident of beautify\u00ac\n ing my life\u2019s temple, and of fitting it for the hoped-for\n future life.

As Merton read them at the\n time he ceased to act as a priest in the Episcopal Church,\n a solemn question arose in his breast: \u201cHave you been\n true to the promise contained in these words? Have you\n been true to the God and Lord before whom you fell down\n and worshipped?\u201d Merton answered himself thus: If a\n man promises to live faithful to all the injunctions of the\n Koran, is he morally and rightfully bound to keep his\n promises, in regard to those injunctions which he after\u00ac\n wards discovers to be neither useful nor true? Do Latimer,\n Luther, and Ridley fasten upon themselves the charge of\n moral turpitude, because they broke their ordination vows?\n All that a man can rightfully mean in his ordination vows,\n is that he will be faithful in the discharge of what he be\u00ac\n lieves to be his duty. No person can possibly be faithful to\n God, who is not first of all faithful to his own convictions\n of right and truth. The highest obligation a man can have,\n is the discharge of what he believes to be his duty, as day\n by day, in his eventful and progressing life, he is called on\n to determine what his hands and heart shall do. There can\n be no virtue or moral worth belonging to an act that is not\n done in accordance with the convictions of duty, it mat\u00ac\n ters not how remunerative or apparently successful such\n an act may be. He who would fall down before God and\n worship Him, must take care to do so, first of all and more\n than all, in his own heart, the place where God delights\n to dwell, and where He most reveals himself.

Mankind clings\n to the hope of personal immortality,and longs for it, whether\n the hope or longing can be ever realized or not; and man\n naturally prays to what he imagines to be a living, person\u00ac\n al, conscious God, whether such a being be existent or not.\n Man as man loves whom he imagines to be God, and is\n prone to seek help and comfort from Him, when he despairs\n of getting aid from any other source. Nor does any man\n live, in my judgment, who hates God. A few days ago there\n appeared, in a leading paper, the assertion that a certain,\n widely known, popular lecturer hates God and the Demo\u00ac\n cratic party. Such foolish, and most unjust assertions are\n common in newspapers; but they are no less untrue than\n they are common. The lecturer may hate the god of the\n person who wrote the article, but I am sure he does not hate\n the Being whom he himself imagines to be God.
