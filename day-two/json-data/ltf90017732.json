Last week they were members of a branch of\n the Christian Church ; to-day they are postulants for\n admission to some strange new sect. What they once\n believed they must now deny. How is it ? There are\n several explanations suggested. One is that they have\n never really understood the claims and the nature of\n Christianity. It is God\u2019s final revelation to men, and\n it contains every excellent feature that has a foundation\n in truth. What is good anywhere else is found at its\n best in Christianity. But some have not been well\n grounded in the principles of Christ\u2019s religion, nor do\n they know how it originated. Their superficial knowl\u00ac\n edge is but a poor defence against the sophistry of the\n zealous propagandist of the new \u201c ism,\u201d and they yield.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are others who, being still more superficial, re\u00ac\n gard religion somewhat as they do politics or the social\n excitement of the hour. They consequently fall in with\n the current, and are for the time anything that society\n about them happens to be.

Unhappily they are not\n always well guided in their investigations, and some\u00ac\n times see but the best side of the new systems presented\n by ardent and enthusiastic people. Sometimes impa\u00ac\n tience at the slow progress of Christianity and disap\u00ac\n pointment because of the imperfect lives of its advocates\n may lead them to listen all the more readily to the pre\u00ac\n tensions of those who hope to make the wilderness\n speedily blossom as the rose and usher in the universal\n reign of peace and prosperity.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are few persons so worthy of sincere pity as\n those who turn away from Christianity to anything else\n in their eagerness to hasten the golden age, and then\n find themselves mistaken.\n</p>\n<p>\n The waking up from dreams must come. The realiza\u00ac\n tion thafTtKey have blundered must be part of the ex\u00ac\n perience of those who desert God\u2019s way to accept man\u2019s\n way, and it cannot be other than painful.\n</p>\n<p>\n The advocates of erroneous systems are very zealous in\n spreading their views. They make large use of the press\n for this purpose ; and nothing is so easy to be had as\n pamphlets and tracts telling us, for example, the won\u00ac\n ders of Theosophy, the comforts of Spiritualism, and the\n miracles wrought by Christian Science.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is not so easy to find literature for popular use de\u00ac\n signed to meet these claims.

If any one is disposed to consider any one of these\n proposed substitutes, he should certainly \u201c make haste\n . slowly,\u201d and see what he gives up, if he ever relinquishes\n Christianity, to accept something else. There are, doubt\u00ac\n less, many unhappy people to-day who have swung away\n from the old faith before they had well considered the\n new. Their next plunge may be into the dark cavern\n of no faith at all. Let us hope, however, that they\n may be kept from so sad a fate as that, and be led back\n to the brightness which shines from Him who is the\n Light of the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n Perhaps at the foundation of well-nigh every rejection\n of Christianity is the failure to understand that a relig\u00ac\n ion cannot be true if it is devised by man. A true relig\u00ac\n ion must come from God. But men have thought that\n they could make their own religions and change them\n when they would. Some have supposed that Christian\u00ac\n ity was simply a code of maxims and wise sa ying s which\n originated with a man called Christ, and, therefore, it\n could be superseded by something else at men\u2019s own will.\n Others have thought that if man originated Christianity,\n they could accept just what they cared to accept and let\n the rest go. Hence the attempt to eliminate the super\u00ac\n natural element from the Gospel and to explain away\n not only everything that is supernatural, but everything\n that Is theological. By this process Christianity becomes\n simply a code of morals, like the sayings of Marcus\n Aurelius.\n</p>\n<p>\n Think of Christianity as having no higher origin than\n man, and you can reject it at your pleasure.

The\n stone, the bird, the tree are parts of God. Observe,\n then, that when one becomes a Theosophist he gives up\n his belief in a personal Deity and accepts instead \u201c an\n impersonal God, who cannot see, or feel, or hear, who\n ^has no sympathy, no love, no thought.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Closely allied with this conception of God is the\n other thought, that all things are fixed by an eternal\n necessity. \u2018 4 There is the iron law of a remorseless neces\u00ac\n sity, the fatality of unchanging and unchangeable force.\n There is no possibility of setting it aside.

The animal soul lives for a while\n after the death of the body until it reaches a definite\n stage and is separated from the other soul, the ego,\n when it goes into the place of the souls of animals. The\n ego, the personality, goes on through a land of dreams\n until it awakes and-seeks to be reincarnated, to take a\n new body ; and this process may be repeated many\n times.

The quiet, self-re\u00ac\n strained, dignified maiden of to-day may be, in her next\n process of reincarnation, the bootblack who plies his\n business on the corner of the city street. The man of\n wealth now may have to appear next as the ragged beg\u00ac\n gar, and the day laborer may become in the next change\n the refined gentleman or the cultivated gentlewoman.\n No one knows how many times he may have to be rein\u00ac\n carnated.

Christian Socialism takes into consid\u00ac\n eration the bettering of man\u2019s present condition, but\n with a clear expectation of the continuance of life here\u00ac\n after. Such Socialism would put down all injustice be\u00ac\n tween men, would check the greed that gets all it can\n out of the laborer without any adequate return. It\n would so spread the spirit of brotherhood that men will\n always be ready to share what they have with others.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let us except Christian Socialism, then, from the\n statements which are to follow.\n</p>\n<p>\n Socialism as referred to here means the movement\n which is outside of the Christian Church, and which is\n so often in direct antagonism to Christianity itself.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:so:me:mo:de:rn:su:bs:ti:00:sh:in:somemodernsubsti00shin:somemodernsubsti00shin_0073/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:so:me:mo:de:rn:su:bs:ti:00:sh:in:somemodernsubsti00shin:somemodernsubsti00shin_0073/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 860}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:so:me:mo:de:rn:su:bs:ti:00:sh:in:somemodernsubsti00shin:somemodernsubsti00shin_0073/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1086, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1720}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:so:me:mo:de:rn:su:bs:ti:00:sh:in:somemodernsubsti00shin:somemodernsubsti00shin_0073/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3441}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:so:me:mo:de:rn:su:bs:ti:00:sh:in:somemodernsubsti00shin:somemodernsubsti00shin_0073/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/so/me/mo/de/rn/su/bs/ti/00/sh/in/somemodernsubsti00shin/somemodernsubsti00shin_0073.jp2", "height": 3441, "width": 2172, "levels": 6, "size": 420406}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"73\">\n<p>\n WHAT IS SOCIALISM ?\n</p>\n<p>\n 67\n</p>\n<p>\n Perhaps if you think of this kind of Socialism as hay\u00ac\n ing no necessary reference to any other world than this,\n and as aiming to secure more enjoyment from the pres\u00ac\n ent life than is possible now, you will have a fairly clear\n idea of its aim.
