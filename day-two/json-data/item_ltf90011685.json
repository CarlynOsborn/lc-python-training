They were\n not of the smart and rattling order, perhaps, nevertheless their\n story is fresh and vigorous, and their example a wholesome one.\n They were earnest men. The Beldens and the Bettses and the\n Boutons, the Camps and the Cannons and the Churches, the Hoyts\n and the Isaacs and the Jarvises, the Nashes and the Reeds\n and the Warrens of 1779-90 were no negatives. Like the\n John Beldens and the Jonathan Camps and the William Jar-\n vises of the previous generation they said and they did in no\n equivocal way ; they believed in the church of which they were\n members ; their creed was a positive quantity, and it might\n without any strain upon the truth be asserted, possibly of all\n of them, that they were endowed with the belief of every syllable\n of it. And they did earnest work, as we might expect such men\n would do. Their ancestors held a meeting in 1742* and deter-\n mined, before the parish was six years old, to erect a new edifice\n \u2014 the one that was burned. And even the diction of their vote\n</p>\n<p>\n was energetic, \u201cthat said building be forthwith carried on.\u201d\n And it is creditable to the men of 1779 and a triumph of their\n energy and faith that, before the next twelve month had perform-\n ed its abdication, they had held a meetingt and called a clergy-\n man and resolved to build, and albeit so greatly reduced, had\n generously subscribed for, their third habitation in forty-\n three years for the Lord God of Hosts. It is a no mean com-\n mentary this. The men of \u201986, a century ago, did nobly, and it is\n right on this occasion to recollect what they did. We proceed to\n particularize concerning them ; remarking that our notice of them\n constitutes, unavoidably, a string of sketches rather than a logi-\n cally connected recital, and speaking first of the clergy of the past\n one hundred years.\n</p>\n<p>\n Jeremiah Learning, D.

It is an\n interesting fact that the cousins should, each in his respective class, have\n borne away the highest honors of Alma Mater, and it is testimony to their\n intellectual capabilities also because in both instances, the race for the\n distinction was a sharply contested one.

Edward was\n af terward elected rector of St. Paul\u2019s church, Cincinnati, Ohio, and after that\n of St. Paul\u2019s, Norwalk, Ohio, and he being grandson of Moses and Sarah\n (Woolsey) Rogers was gr. gr. grandson of Ralph Isaacs. The Benjamin Ed-\n wards mentioned in \u201cThe Scheme,\u2019\u2019 was from Long Island, and of the Yale\n class of 1829, and his discussion of the art of printing and the mariner ' s com-\n pass was probably his farewell to school, while his disputant, Stephen Reed,\n was a Greek student and belonged to the Reed family of West Norwalk. R.\n John Everitt was a young man who belonged to the institution and was bap-\n tized by Dr. Sherwood while under his care: and Edward Sellon, who pro-\n nounced the parting words, was the son of a clergyman of the English church ;\n there were two brothers, Sellon, who attended Dr. Sherwood\u2019s school.\n</p>\n<p>\n The connection of the Norwalk Rogerses and the Massachusetts Winthrops\n was through Nehemiah and Elizabeth (Fitch) Rogers\u2019 son Henry. His (Henry\u2019s)\n son, Dr. John Smith Rogers, married Gov. Thomas L. Winthrop\u2019s daughter,\n Augusta, sister of Robert C. Winthrop.

Some forty communicants had died\n or removed during Dr. Sherwood\u2019s fourfeen years care.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Diocesian Convention of 1828 met in Norwalk, and in his report of that\n year i Which was his last but one), the rector of St. Paul\u2019s mentions that he had\n attended two hundred and fourteen funerals. \u201cSupposing then,\u201d he goes on\n to say, \u201cthe whole number of souls in the parish, including men, women, and\n children, to amount to seven hundred, which is thought a large calculation,\n we find that a number nearly equaling one-third of the whole congregation,\n has within the last twelve years been numbered with the dead. And if on\n this computation, which is certainly a reasonable one, we extend our views\n forward, it will be found that within the short space of thirty-six years, there\n will have died in this parish a number fully equal to the whole congregation\n at the commencment of this period.\u201d Dr. Sherwood\u2019s limitation of thirty-six\n years expired, in 1864, but extend the time sixteen years so as to include Dr.\n Mead\u2019s entire rectorship, and over 1,600 have been attended.

Y. His parents were transient residentsof that place, their\n home being in New York City, to which their young son was taken for baptism\n by Bishop Moore. He was afterward sent to a school taught by one of the\n Fitch family, of Darien, and subsequently to Cheshire, where his predecessor\n at- St. Paul\u2019s, Dr. Wm. Smith, was principal. He then studied, as did also\n Bishop Benj. T. Onderdonk, and Judge Hoffman, with Dr. Barry: and the\n doctor\u2019s three pupils entered Columbia College together and graduated in\n 1809. Mr. Kemper read theology under the direction of the clergy of Trin-\n ity Church. In the spring of 1811 he was ready for deacon\u2019s orders, and as\n Bishop Moore lay stricken with paralysis, and Bishop Hobart was not yet\n consecrated, he was ordained by Bishop White in St. Peter\u2019s Church, Phil-\n adelphia, on March 11th, 1811. He was almost at once called to the united\n parishes of St. Peter and St. James, of which Bishop White had been rec-\n tor. He was admitted to priest\u2019s orders by Bishop White and continued his\n Philadelphia connection until 1831. During a portion of the time he spent\n in Pennsylvania he was in ill-health, and consequently took long journeys,\n usually on horseback. In one of these trips he went as far west as Ohio,\n visiting and officiating in Canfield and Boardmans, and Poland, in that\n diocese. In 1814 he was called to the assistantship of St. Paul\u2019s Church (Dr.\n Kemp\u2019s), Baltimore. He refused it and the parish was oflered to his friend,\n the late Dr. Wyatt, who there continued until the end of his life. In 1816 he\n was married to Miss Jerusha Lyman, a daughter of General William Lyman,\n of Northampton, Mass., a lady of rare intellect and superior character. She\n died, in 1818, and in 1821 he married Miss Ann Relf, of Philadelphia, who was\n the mother of his three children \u2014 Elizabeth (Mrs. William Adams), Louis,\n one of the noblest sons of the church, and Samuel, residing in Wisconsin.\n Mrs. Ann Kemper was fifteen years younger than her husband, and was a\n very remarkable and very beautiful woman, and although a resident of\n Norwalk for only two months, was cherished and beloved by our people. It\n was the desire on the part of her husband for a rural parish that secured for\n St. Paul\u2019s this happy rectorship, to an appreciation of which the people at\n once rose. The v estry of the parish went on the evening ot the doctor\u2019s\n arrival in June, 1831, to Old Well, and after the steamer Fairfield was made\n fast to the pier, and the doctor and his family descended the plank, extended\n to them a true welcome. They were at once driven to Hezekiah Jarvis\u2019s\n house and the \u201cSquire\u201d and his wife, and his daughters Lavinia and Sarah\n and Amelia and Mary received them, and (until their goods arrived)\n made them at home. A bright and happy summer followed: the pas-\n tor and his partner both throwing themselves with great zest into country\n parish life. Dr. Kemper spent a great deal of his time with his people. In a\n letter of Mrs. Kemper written at that time is penned that he \u201chad every\n evening a service in some of the outlying hamlets.\u201d It was his custom, after\n the second service in the early afternoon on Sunday, to visit some of the\n parishioners who through age or infirmity had been kept away from church,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0025/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 163, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0025/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 327, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 549}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0025/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 655, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1099}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0025/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1310, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2198}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0025/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2621, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4396}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0025/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ad/dr/es/sa/tc/en/te/na/00/se/ll/addressatcentena00sell/addressatcentena00sell_0025.jp2", "height": 4396, "width": 2621, "levels": 6, "size": 524774}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"25\">\n<p>\n 19\n</p>\n<p>\n above all tlie saintliness of the rector from 1831 to 1835 are among\n the holy memories of this people.

Religious belief and faith must be bottomed\n upon facts, truths: the hearer must not only be induced to yield assent; he\n must be convinced.

Within the past 25 years nearly 600 funer-\n als have been attended by your rector, or by those who represented and as-\n sisted him in this parish. Nearly 600 times in the aggregate has \u2018Earth to\n earth, ashes to ashes, dust to dust.\u2019 been pronounced over the mortal re-\n mains of some of your relatives, friends and acquaintances. \u2018Your fathers,\n where are they?\u2019 Of the aged and middle aged who greeted me at my coming\n to this parish, but few now survive. The tomb, the green hillock which\n marks their graves sadly reminds us that they are gone, that the place which\n once knew them, will know them no more; and that soon their fate will be\n ours. Of the four parishioners who, as the committee of this society invited\n me to be your rector, three now sleep with their fathers, and one alone re-\n mains. Amid all this havoc of death, the occupants of your parsonage have\n been singularly preserved. Of the houses which stood around the green and\n near the church and parsonage-lot when I came here, not one but has given\n its trophy to death. I have often stood on my lawn and mused on the\n changes wrought by time, and thought of departed friends and neighbors, and\n been startled when I had numbered them, to find that some seventy, within\n the call of my voice, had been removed by death, and yet those whom the\n parsonage roof tree sheltered remained unscathed. Loudly has this fact\n admonished your rector that, \u2018whatsoever his hand findeth to do, for Christ\n and the Church, should be done with his might.\u2019 May the solemn voices of\n the dead excite us, who must soon follow them into the spirit world, to devote\n our short remnant of life to glorify God by doing good in our day and\n generation.\n</p>\n<p>\n One more topic, brethren, and I close. Within 25 years, 3,775 sermons\n have been delivered in this place; 2,717 by myself, and the rest by clergymen\n of the church who have assisted me. It is a solemn fact that the religious\n instructions so extensively offered and so variously received have already\n had their effect for good or evil on their hearers. For we may rest assured\n that, whether, under the preaching of the Gospel, men will fear and improve,\n or forbear and harden their hearts, God\u2019s word, proclaimed by his ministers,\n will not return unto Him void; it will accomplish that for which He hath\n sent it; either to secure the salvation of those who improve it, or to justify\n the condemnation of such as disregard it. \u2018For we are unto God a sweet\n saviour of Christ in them that are saved and in them that perish : to the one\n we are the saviour of death unto death, and to the other the saviour of life\n unto life.\u2019 It is God\u2019s design, \u2018by the foolishness of preaching to save them\n that believe\u2019 and obey. It is His design through the faithfulness of preaching\n to vindicate all his attributes when he shall bring us into judgment, and fix\n the portion of each for eternity. Here the great fact will be shown that every\n one who perishes has been his own destroyer, seeing he has had deliverance\n placed within his reach, and might have grasped it if he would.\n</p>\n<p>\n If then, brethren, it be true that you cannot be neutral under the preaching\n of the Gospel, if it be true that every sermon you hear will either benefit or\n injure you, how carefully and earnestly should your minister preach, and\n how thoughtfully and prayerfully should you \u2018take heed how ye hear.\u2019 Many\n years have I spoken to attentive ears and generous hearts, to minds alive to\n appreciate the truths of the doctrine uttered, and to approve the forensic\n skill and eloquence with which it may have been presented. But, ah,\n brethren, the great question for each to settle is, has the word preached as\n yet proved to my soul a savor of life unto life, or risen to God against me as a\n savor of death unto death ?\n</p>\n<p>\n We must deliver our message however men may receive it. We dare not\n keep it back. We tell you that it is only by repentance and faith and\n obedience that you can hope to escape the wrath to come. \u2018 We pray you in\n Christ stead be ye reconciled unto God.\u2019 We set before the thoughtless and\n unconverted the only alternative that can be proposed ; either forsake sin,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0029/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 163, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0029/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 327, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 549}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0029/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 655, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1099}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0029/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1310, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2198}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0029/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2621, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4396}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0029/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ad/dr/es/sa/tc/en/te/na/00/se/ll/addressatcentena00sell/addressatcentena00sell_0029.jp2", "height": 4396, "width": 2621, "levels": 6, "size": 575266}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"29\">\n<p>\n concerned ecclesiastical jurisprudence, was to be trusted with entire\n confidence.

It was too soon to\n decide upon a final plan ; the smoke had hardly cleared away from\n the burnt district ; the prospect politically was gloomy ; the blasts\n of war were heard in the land ; but they could not remain without\n their church, and decided to put up a building 24x36 for temporary\n occupancy, some among them offering money, some material, some\n both, to help in its construction.

There were some special offerings : David\n Lambert gave the communion table, as Stephen St. John and\n Ebenezer Church and Thomas Fayerweather did the chancel and\n the pulpit in the former church ; and Thomas Belden the brass\n hinges for the desk ; and Jacob Jennings the hinges for the pulpit ;\n and Eliakim Warren and David Nash their cash donations, in addi-\n tion to their subscriptions for the church of 1786 ; while Captain\n</p>\n<p>\n *Born in 1844 In New York city, and educated at Trinity School.

He was one of those\n who helped expend, at Bunker Hill, the twenty-seven half-barrels of pow-\n der, the stock of munition in that line, and at that time of the Continental\n Army; and he did not leave Massachusetts until the British embarked under\n Howe, and made their adieu to Boston. From thence he went to New Jersey,\n and was present in the town of Trenton when, on the day after Christmas,\n 1776, nearly a thousand of the enemy \u201c threw down their arms and begged for\n mercy.\u201d Six days after, on the first morning of the new year, he entered\n Princeton and helped achieve the victory that day, and there received the\n title of \u201c Captain.\u201d In 1778 he fought at Monmouth, but the dawn of July 11,\n 1779, found him at home. The first Norwalk victim fell, it is related, near\n the hill north-east of the Hammersley place, over which one of St. Paul\u2019s\n vestrymen had just passed on an errand of mercy, only, however, to be seized\n on the next hill beyond and carried to one of King George\u2019s boats anchored\n off Fitch\u2019s Point. Capt. Betts was wide awake, but (Gen. Parsons\u2019 command\n did not arrive until later in the morning) Ti-yon overpowered him, and in the\n Secretary of State\u2019s office, Hartford, is filed an affidavit made before Thad-\n deus Betts to this effect: \u2018\u2018Capt. Stephen Betts in ye Continental service,\n personally appeared and made solemn oath, that on ye 11th inst., while ye\n enemy invaded Norwalk, he, with about fifty Continental troops and some\n militia, engaged a superior number of the enemy, which obliged them to\n give way to an unequal force. \u2014 Fairfield County, Norwalk, July 26, ryjQ.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The captain was at Yorktown in September and October, 1781, where it was\n permitted him to witness, on the afternoon of the 19th of the latter month,\n the surrender to Gen.

It is said,\n however, that, notwithstanding his daring, the general lived under the con-\n stant dread of death, to which fact one historian seems to attribute the escape\n of Stamford from conflagration. This possibly is mere fancy: but after the\n arrival of Gen.

He\n is introduced as leading, in 1780, in a subscription for the building\n fund of that year.

The parish could\n have made choice of no truer and more capable man than Goold\n Hoyt to fill its highest lay offices. His term of office embraced\n the period covered by the administrations of Drs. Dibble and\n Bowden, and Revs. Foot and George Ogilvie, and Dr. William\n Smith, and the beginning of the rectorship of Rev. Henry Whit-\n lock. He united with Thomas Belden in a letter to Bishop Seabury,\n acquainting the latter of the call, on the part of the parish, to the\n Rev. Mr. Ogilvie, and he records the adoption, in April, 1793, by\n the parish, of the \u201cConstitution of the Protestant Episcopal\n Church in the State of Connecticut, as agreed upon by the clerical\n and lay delegates in convention at New Haven, June 6th, 1792.\u201d\n Mr. Hoyt was the father of the late Goold Hoyt, Esq., of New\n York, whose generous legacy to it is very justly acknowledged, by\n the parish, upon the inscribed marble before the front of this edi-\n fice, and also of Ebenezer Dimon Hoyt, father of the late Munson\n and Edwin Hoyt, and of the surviving Mrs. Charles Hoyt and Mrs.\n J ohn Cleveland. Mr. Ebenezer D. Hoyt appears upon the parish\n record first, in 1813. His name is often repeated, and was not\n dropped until his death, in 1824. He was a worthy son, and is\n thought of with pleasure.

He advanced the funds for the building of the first parson-\n age, and was the largest of several contributors and subscribers\n</p>\n<p>\n * Goold Hoyt, Sr., built the comfortable Edwin Hoyt house and occupied it\n immediately after his marriage to Miss Elizabeth Dimon, of Fairfield. Mrs.\n Hoyt, in 1779, herself petitioned one of Tryon\u2019s aids that he would interpose\n his authority and save the house from burning. Her petition prevailed, and\n the generous lady asked that her neighbor\u2019s house on the right hand corner\n above, (formerly the Jennings,now the McClure property) might also be spared,\n which, it is said, was done. Goold Hoyt\u2019s five children were : Thomas, born,\n in 1767, who built what was afterward known as the Henry Belden house; and\n Goold, born, in 1769, who removed to New York City; and Esther, born,\n in 1773, who married Henry Belden; and Ebenezer D., born, in 1776; who\n married Miss Huldah Hanford, and for whom was built the commodious\n Charles E. St. John house; and Munson, born, in 1781, who lived in New York,\n and was one of the most skilled and accurate accountants of his day.\n</p>\n<p>\n Isaac Hoyt, the father of the late Charles Hoyt, Esq., and of Mary, the\n mother of General William T. Sherman, one of the first soldiers of modern\n times, and of the Hon. John Shermaii, United States Senator, lived in South\n Norwalk, in the house, still standing, on the line of the street, the first dwell-\n ing west of the grounds of the late A. E. Beard.

Melancthon Hoyt (brother-in-law of theRev.\n</p>\n<p>\n B. M. Yarrington, of Greenwich, and pioneer missionary of our church in the\n west,) was born. This house stood nearly opposite the present store of F. H.\n Nash. About the only dwellings, in 1832, between these limits, and on that\n side of the street, were the James and Deborah Keeler houses (near thedwell-\n lings of the late Lewis Curtis and Mrs. Matilda Keeler,) and \u201cthe old red\n house,\u201d and a small cabin (both of them a few rods south of Mrs. Deborah\n Keeler\u2019s) and the house of Mr. James Benedict (which stood a few feet back of\n the present gateway to Mrs. Charles D.

The Prospect Hill road diverged at right\n angles from West avenue and the Whites\u2019 house was built on the south cor-\n ner and fronting north. The topography of this locality was changed by the\n cutting through of the New York Turnpike. Peter White and his son, Samuel,\n were intelligently helpful members of St. Paul\u2019s.

The original Marvins were\n two brothers, Reynold and Matthews, and one sister, Elizabeth. Matthew,\n brother of Reynolds and Elizabeth, was thirty-five years old when he came to\n this country, and fifty-one when he came to Norwalk. He went first to Hart-\n ford, of which place he ivas one of the settlers, and in which city he was a\n surveyor, residing on the corner of the old \u201cVillage\u201d and \u201cFront\u201d streets.\n His son, Matthew, who was now twenty-four years old, accompanied his\n father to Norwalk : they occupied adjoining home-lots, the father close by the\n present house of H. M. Prowitt, Esq., and facing East avenue, and the son\n backing upon his father\u2019s lot, fronting the south, and bounded in that direc-\n tion by the present street running west from East avenue, and just north of\n the Consolidated Railroad. This street was a part of the ancient mail-coach\n route between Stamford and Fairfield. The Marvins came from the same coun-\n ty as the Fitches, and father and son lived in Norwalk about the same length\n of time. Matthew, Sr., died somewhere between 1680 and 1790, it is thought\n about 1687, and his son died in 1691. Among Matthew, Sr\u2019s., brother Reinold\u2019s\n (or Reynold\u2019s) descendants are : Gen. Elisha Marvin, and Judges Richard P.\n and William Marvin, and Congressman Dudley Marvin ; and from Matthew\n are traced the honored Norwalk, and Wilton, and Westport families of the\n Marvins Matthew Marvin, Jr., had six children, one of whom, Sarah, mar-\n ried Thomas Betts, the ancestor of that branch of the family from which the\n late George W. Betts, Esq., and the venerable Norwalk sisters, Miss Juliette\n and Miss Harriet Betts descended, and the youngest child, Samuel, was the\n father of Josiah, the vestryman, in 1754. Josiah died about the time that the\n church was burned. He had six sons and four daughters. His sons were\n Daniel, William. Jared, John (who died in Nova Scotia), Josiah, Jr. (who died on\n Long Island), und Samuel (see Talcott\u2019s New York and New England Fami-\n lies.) Vestryman Josiah Marvin\u2019s aunt, Elizabeth, (Matthew, Jr\u2019s., daughter),\n married Joseph Platt, who has the remarkable record of General Assembly\n representative from Norwalk for one-half a century. The occupant of the office\n for the greatest number of years since the Revolution, was the late Benjamin\n Isaacs, who represented this town at the state capitol during thirteen sittings\n of the legislature; the same Benjamin Isaacs (St. Paul\u2019s parish clerk from 1815\n to 1846), who so possessed the confidence of his fellow townsmen, that he held\n the office of town clerk during a period of thirty years.\n</p>\n<p>\n Matthew Marvin, Sr., had several children. Four were born abroad. The\n first one born in, America was Abigail, who, on June or January 1st., 1657,\n married John Bouton, of Norwalk. John Bouton came to this country before\n he was twenty-one yeai-s old, in 1635, and went, after residing in Massachu-\n setts, to Hartford, where he married and had a child or children. He removed\n from Hartford to Norwalk, in 1651, and, in 1657, married Abigail Marvin, as\n before stated. To them were born five children, the oldest of whom were sons,\n John, born Sept. 30, 1659, and Matthew, born Dec. 24, 1661. Matthew, after a\n time, removed to Danbury, and John remained in Norwalk, married, and had\n two sons, Jakin and Joseph. Jakin was twice married, had two children by\n his first wife, and two sons and several daughters by his second wife. His\n oldest son by his second wife was Esaias Bouton, made a vestryman, in 1792, and\n who was father of Nathan and Stephen Bouton, of Troy civil and ecclesiastical\n note and great-grandfather of one of Westport\u2019s highly respected residents,\n and for many years principal practicing physicians, George B. Bouton, M. D.\n</p>\n<p>\n t He married Mary Reed, oldest daughter of John Reed, of south-western\n Norwalk. John Reed was an Englishman \u2014 one of Cromwell\u2019s officers. After\n residing in different portions of the colonies, he removed to Norwalk, in 1684,\n and purchased a farm at Five Mile River.

The branch of\n the family represented by some of these is historic. Samuel, Jr., who was\n vestryman as early as 1757, was the nephew of Governor Thomas Fitch, and\n Lindall, who was a generous donor in 1742 and 1751, and son of Nathaniel,\n who, in 1742, left a legacy to the parish, was second cousin. As a number of\n the members of this old colonial family, and several direct descendents of the\n crown-commissioned governor and his nephew have been attached to St. Paul\u2019s\n and its daughter parishes, the author has borrowed a limb from that sec-\n tion of the family tree, which, as a help to him in tracing its genealogy, he had\n constructed, and which, for the convenience of any who may be interested in\n the matter he has caused to be placed at the close of the appendix to this docu-\n ment. Samuel Fitch, Jr., son of Governor Fitch\u2019s brother Samuel, and vestry-\n man as early as 1757, married Elizabeth Platt and lived upon the fine eight-\n eenth century Fitch estate, near the property of the Finch Brothers, (1886) on\n Chestnut Hill. Himself and wife rode regularly to and from St. Paul\u2019s, stop-\n ping in cold weather at Mrs. Fitch\u2019s relatives, on Newtown avenue, to re-\n plenish the foot stove with live embers, there being in those primitive days no\n other fire in the church. The son of Samuel Fitch, Jr., viz. : the Samuel born\n in 1761, was the father of Joseph Platt Fitch and grandfather of Mr. Sherman\n Fitch and his sisters who are to-day such active members of St. Matthew\u2019s\n church, Wilton. The Chestnut Hill homestead, a hundred or more years\n ago, was one of the favorite resorts of Mrs. Nehemiah Rogers, nee Miss Eliza-\n beth Fitch, who, after her husband\u2019s decease, in 1760, and her subsequent\n removal from Norwalk, often returned hither. Her own and Mrs. Rogers\u2019\n relatives were numerous in this town. Her father lived for a number of\n years after his son-in-law\u2019s death. She had a brother on Chestnut Hill, and\n her daughter, Mrs. Susanna Lambert, resided in great comfort about one\n mile to the west of Chestnut Hill. Some of our people to-day tell of the\n arrival, in early times, in Norwalk, and of the call at the doors of the Rog-\n erses, of the Lambert establishment, if not a modern Tally-Ho, yet approxi-\n mating to it, which was quite an event in the place. An eloquent tribute has\n been paid to the late Mrs. Hannah Fitch Bullard, mother of Gen. Edward\n Bullard, of Saratoga Springs, and possibly the same might have been said of\n Mrs. Elizabeth Rogers of a century and a quarter ago, viz. : \u201cA descendant\n of Sir Thomas Fitch, she inherited the energy and magnamity as well as the\n blood and honor of the English nobility.\u201d It was Mrs. Rogers\u2019 practice to\n leave with those who had entertained her some souvenir of her visit, as\n those of her line to-day tell and produce the evidence of. Her portrait, and a\n fine painting of her daughter Susanna (Mrs. David Lambert, Jr.) grace the walls\n of the Lambert home in Wilton, in which the clergy of St. Paul\u2019s in gone days\n were so warmly welcomed. The late David Rogers Lambert and his brother\n Samuel Fitch Lambert in their youth attended school in Norwalk, residing\n at the Fitch home, down town, now occupied by Mrs. Theodocia Bradley.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some of the Norwalk kindred of Nehemiah Rogers, whom his widow, Mrs.\n Elizabeth (Fitch) Rogers visited, have been the progenitors of families of\n note in America. Her brother-in-law. Dr. Uriah Rogers, Sr., who bought\n where the brothers James and Alfred Mallory afterward built, was a citizen\n of high standing. His daughter, Hannah, was the mother of Chancellor\n Kent, and his granddaughter, Hannah, married into the Zephaniah Platt\n family, of Plattsburgh, and his cousin, Elizabeth, was the grandmother of\n Miss Francis M. Calkins, the historian, of New London, Conn. His relative,\n Betsey, may be remembered from the circumstance of his grandson (Chan-\n cellor Kent) visiting and caring for her in Norwalk. His son, Dr. Uriah, Jr.,\n occupied what has since been known as the Betsey Church place, which after\n Miss Church\u2019s death, became the property of St. Paul\u2019s parish, and then of\n the late Reuben Williams, but is now owned by Mr. Edward Merrill, who has\n within a few years erected a new house upon it. Dr. Rogers, Jr., was a man\n of promise. He married Elizabeth Raymond, sister of Esther (Mrs. Hezekiah\n Rogers), and of Mary (Mrs. Isaac Hoyt, General and Senator Sherman\u2019s\n grandmother), and of Hannah (Mrs. Lemuel Brooks, who, as well as the other\n sisters, were all staunch church women), and he was great-uncle of Judge\n William Kent, professor in Harvard College Law School, and was a brother of\n the maternal head of that branch of the Scribner family from whi h the late\n Charles Scribner, the senior of the large New York publishing house of Scrio-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0048/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 163, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0048/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 327, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 549}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0048/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 655, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1099}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0048/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1310, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2198}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0048/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2621, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4396}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0048/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ad/dr/es/sa/tc/en/te/na/00/se/ll/addressatcentena00sell/addressatcentena00sell_0048.jp2", "height": 4396, "width": 2621, "levels": 6, "size": 649600}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"48\">\n<p>\n 4 2\n</p>\n<p>\n parish.

Taylor Sherman, who practiced law in this town\n contemporaneously with Roger Minot Sherman, and who was the forefather\n of some of the distinguished of the land, was not of the same lineage as Roger.\n There seem to be two lines of the Sherman family in this country. Captain\n John, great-grandfather of Roger M., married, it is thought, before he came\n from England. He died in 1690, and left a son Joseph. Joseph had a son\n William, who was the father of Hon. Roger Sherman, and another son, Josiah,\n who was the parent of Roger Minot, the Norwalk lawyer. Taylor Sherman,\n grandfather of Major General William T. Sherman, U. S. A., and of Hon. John\n Sherman, late Secretary of the Treasury, was a descendant, it is probable, of\n William Sherman, who came over somewhere about 1630. The family is evi-\n dently an ancient one, and of German origin, although it has been represent-\n ed in England for many hundred years. Taylor Sherman\u2019s son, Charles R.\n Sherman married Miss Mary Hoyt, who belonged to one of the oldest of St.Paul\u2019s\n families. Her mother was a Raymond from South Norwalk, sister-in-law, it\n may have been observed, of Hon. Hezekiah Rogers, who lived fora time in the\n old Quigley place, on Main street, but who died in Washington.

The\n father was grandson of the most important proprietor of the place, was throne-\n appointed notary, and elected selectman of the town, and was not a stranger\n outside of it. He was addressed as Mr., (Master) which was a colonial title of\n respect, and he provided that at least one of his sons should receive a complete\n education. The home was an unbroken one until the decease, in the spring\n of 1731, of its paternal head, who before he was taken hence, saw his daughter\n settled in life, and his college boy graduated, and started upon a career which\n became illustrious, and also beheld several grandchildren who were destined\n to celebrity. Twenty-nine days before his departure, he had distributed\n portions to those who were to be left behind, making thoughtful provision for\n the one about to be widowed, and dividing between the brothers and the\n daughter that which would conduce to the comfort of both, and intrusting\n his landed interests to the management of his competent sons, the descent\n from one of whom, (Thomas, the governor,) is detailed at the conclusion of\n this volume. His son Samuel was the father of Samuel, Jr., the vestryman of\n St. Paul\u2019s parish in 1757. Samuel, Jr., made choice, for a bride, of a miss in\n her very teens, but she was a sensible and industrious young woman and\n made the Chestnut Hill home a happy one. The handed-down narrative of\n the visits to the couple, by their kin, is pleasing, and the picture of the two\n coming from such a distance to the old St. Paul\u2019s, is instructive.

Elizabeth, the only daughter of Samuel, Sr., mar-\n ried Nehemiah Rogers, another vestryman of St. Paul\u2019s; and it may be ques\n tioned whether, in the whole United States, there can be found a family con-\n taining a larger number of prominent (socially and professionally) members\n than does the family which has Elizabeth Fitch, daughterof Samuel Fitch,\n Sr., and neice of Governor Thomas Fitch, for its progenitress.

He\n had fourteen children, and he bought from Ebenezer Keeler some six acres in\n the lower part of the town, with dwelling house, and barn, and fences, and fruit\n trees, and tide mill thereon standing, paying for the same between fourteen\n and fifteen hundred dollars. This seems to have been the homestead, but\n he was quite a land holder outside of this purchase; he was possessed\n of seven acres of the timber tract in \u201cIndian Field,\u201d (a locality mentioned\n in the accompanying address), and of a four-acre house-lot, with dwell-\n ing and barn, which had belonged to one John Smith, and on May 16, 1727,\n was deeded to \u201cJames Rogers, late of New London, now of Norwalk,\u201d fora\n consideration of several hundred dollars, the eligible corner on the opposite\n side of the street, and a little distance north of the present East Norwalk rail-\n road station, while a short time before his death he invested rather largely\n in Commonage land. He was a citizen of Norwalk about seven years, and\n until his decease in 1733. He appointed Samuel Cluckston (church warden\n in 1737) one of his executors, and distribution of his will was \u201c performed\n on March 15, 1739-40,\u201d his son James (of New London) being first named by\n the executors, and afterward his daughter Mary (Mrs. Jonathan Chester),\n and Esther (Mrs. John Seabury, of Groton, Conn, the birthplace of Bishop\n Seabury) and Uriah, (Dr. Uriah, of Norwalk, who came hither probably with\n his father, and who here married Hannah, daughter of James Lockwood\n and granddaughter of Samuel Smith, evidently the same Samuel Smith\n who was a heavy, 1687, Commons proprietor, and appointed by the first\n Thomas Fitch an \u201cOverseer\u201d of his will), and Jedediah, and Nehemiah,\n and Edward, and Stephen, and Moses, who, March 24th, 1749, was \u201csup-\n posed to be deceased,\u201d and Aaron (who removed to Wethersfield), and Lemuel.\n There were also Elizabeth, and Claron and Samuel, but they did not share, if\n the record is correct, in the distribution.

The chancellor\u2019s mother,\n Hannah (Rogers) Kent, died while her son was but a mere lad, but some of\n our older residents may possibly recall the chancellor\u2019s widow (Mrs. Elizabeth\n [Bailey] Kent), who survived her husband and lived until 1851.

One\n traces with gratification the prosperous careers of her sons, Fitch, Moses,\n Henry and Nehemiah, all old New York brothers and merchants, and with\n admiration the descent from these. The family is, and has been, one of\n renown ; its ancestress had hardly been called hence ere the lineage em-\n braced the names of many who were already adorning private life, or be-\n coming conspicuous in its public walks. Had a few years more been vouch-\n safed her, she might have beheld some of her line serving their country at its\n own capital, or as its embassadors at capitals abroad, and others holding\n court at learning\u2019s seat, and others still, whose great enterprise was securing\n for them great wealth, and whose recognized rectitude and respectability\n were dignifying and exalting social life, of the highest civilties and courtesies\n of which, they were the acknowledged representatives.\n</p>\n<p>\n There were these among the Kings of academic and military fame : Presi-\n dent Charles, L.L.

It was just north of the summit of \u201cGoodman Hoyt\u2019s\u201d\n (the Hammersley) Hill, that Norwalk\u2019s young student, and first representative\n at Yale College, resided.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the site of the Henry Fitch place (quite a model of the unpainted,\n shingle-sided, low-running, back-roof style of building, which succeeded to\n the log structures of the settlers), dwelt the ancestors of the Norwalk, and\n Wilton, and New Haven Olmsteads, and immediately south, where the Indians\n of yore hid, and afterward some of the Rogerses lived, and Mrs. Clark now\n inhabits, is the spot where the first of all of the name of Eli, or Ely, abode.\n In front of the Fitch property, which stretched to the river, occurred the\n wreck of the first steam craft which navigated the Norwalk waters ; an\n experiment, on a smaller scale, perhaps, but an improvement, nevertheless,\n upon the celebrated John Fitch experiment, a hundred years ago, next year,\n in the same line. Mr. Fitch\u2019s steam yawl, the first steamboat the world ever\n saw, had an iron kettle for a boiler, with lid secured by bolts, and all went to\n pieces upon the banks of the pond, (not fifty miles from this town) upon\n which the bark was launched ; but a portion of the Norwalk vessel, which was\n preserved until a few years since, evidenced advance over Fitch, at least,\n in the construction of the boiler. In this district was erected the first school\n house known in these parts; twenty by sixteen, and \u201csix feet between the\n joists.\u201d Here, on one of the lower East avenue corners, the depression of land\n still indicating it, was the swamp, filled thickly w r ith bushes, which the red\n man was wont to take to after his depredations upon the fathers\u2019 premises.\n Here is the gentle dale, a mere \u201cscoop\u201d in the land, in which the founders,\n with their one cook, inaugurated the settlement. Here, near the mighty iron\n highway of to-day, was the \u201cold parade ground,\u201d all alive on \u201cTraining\n days,\u201d where, in all probability, was mustered the small, but heroic quota,\n who, under the command of the lamented Seeley, shouldered the musket and\n went, in 1675, to the Narraganset Country, to meet King Phillip, in an engage-\n ment in which a thousand Indian warriors were killed and wounded, and\n many helpless women and children burned alive. Here stood the enclosure,\n constructed for the protection of the settlers\u2019 cattle from the wolves. Here,\n some few rods north of the Tide Mill, was built the cottage of one who came\n over when he was eleven years old, in the ship \u201cFrancis,\u201d and was employed\n long before the war, and for a beneficent purpose, to beat the drum in the\n morning, and sound the horn \u201cabout twelve of the clock.\u201d Here was the\n fathers\u2019 \u201cgreen,\u201d a little distance from the east end of the South Norwalk\n carriage bridge, and along the new shore drive of 1886.

He then became rector of Trinity\n Church, Portland, on the Connecticut. Failing health compelled\n his resignation of that parish, and the last years of his life were\n spent at the home of his daughter, Mrs. Elizabeth H. Colt, of\n Hartford. With the exception of during youth, Mr. Jarvis was\n not a resident of Norwalk, but his personal merits and professional\n devotion were not unknown to us.

The first occupants of Nor-\n walk were Indians, and when the town was settled there appear to have\n been not two tribes, but two clans, who had possession of the place. One clan\n occupied the territory on the east side of the river, and the other that on the\n west side, and along this latter side ran the ancient \u201cPonassus path named\n after Ponus, Sagamore of the Rippowams. This sachem\u2019s realm embraced\n from the sparkling waters of Rowalton (Five Mile River) on the west towards\n the Pequonnocke Indians, \u201cGold Hill,\u201d land on the east, and as far north as\n the Mohawk forests.

It may be impossible to in-\n fallibly determine concerning our pre-historic predecessors, but the evidence\n is abundant that stray representatives of the five nations were in possession\n of the place anterior to the arrival of the white settlers; and a rational in-\n ference is, that the red rangers were attracted to the locality by the natural\n beauty of the spot.

He married Ruah, daughter of David Boult, and built in Main street,\n near the south corner of the present Hoyt street, and but a short distance above\n the old Lockwood house, which stood in, and took up quite a portion of what is\n now the roadway. The stores at that time, on the west side of the street,\n extended, towards the north, about as far as the store of Messrs G. & S.

Two of William Daskam\u2019s children survive: Mrs. Judge\n Sidney B. Beardsley, of Bridgeport, and Miss Harriett F., of Norwalk.\n</p>\n<p>\n William St. John, of Pews Nos. 7 and 13, was son of William, Sr., and Mary\n Esther (Belden) St. John. The belief which has obtained in Norwalk is, that\n three Sensions (St. Johns) came at first to this land. One of this country\u2019s\n genealogists appears to disclaim this, affirming, \u201cI have read too many\n records to tolerate\u201d the belief, nevertheless, there was evidently a father\n and son (Matthias, Sr. and Jr.), in Norwalk, in 1655, and Dr. Hall, in his\n valuable compilation from the ancient records, mentions the name of\n Matthew, also, while it seems that there was a St. John in Dorchester,\n in 1634. William, of St. Paul\u2019s Church, married Esther, daughter of James\n and Rebecca (Goold) Cannon. His house was a fine old style structure, and\n stood at the lower end of High street. Other than Esther (Mrs. William\n St. John), James Cannon\u2019s children were Sarah (Mrs. Jonathan Fitch),\n Amelia (Mrs. Garrett Harson Newkirk) and Mary (Mrs. George Lockwood). The\n children of Mrs. Jonathan Fitch were Mrs. Stephen Raymond, and Mrs.\n James Mallory ; and the children of Garrett H. Newkirk were Mrs. Jonathan\n Camp, Mrs. Reuben A. Williams, Margaret Bennett, Mrs. Adelaide Quigley,\n and the late James Newkirk ; and the children of Mrs. George Lockwood were\n Sarah, Mary, and James, who is one of the solid men (financially), of Ohio;\n and the children of Mrs. William St. John were Mrs. Munson Hoyt, Mrs.\n Charles Sherry, Mrs. Francis Skiddy, Mrs. J. A. VanZandt, and William and\n Frederick St. John.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. Charlotte St. John, of Pew 22, was the second wife of Stephen Buck-\n ingham St. John, brother of William, of Pew 7. Stephen B. St. John\u2019s first wife\n was a daughter of John Cannon. His second wife, Charlotte (Bush) St.\n John, was the mother of Mrs. James A. Hoyt, who has succeeded to the owner-\n ship of the historic Grumman\u2019s Hill property.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Cornwall was another who rented two pews. Thomas, the father of\n William Cornwall, came from Middletown. His wife was a Miss Mary Beers,\n from Stratford. They lived near Mr. Thomas Benedict, Down Town, and had\n four sons, William, Grove, Josiali, and George. Grove and George took up\n their homes in Milford, and Josiah and William resided in Norwalk. Josiah\n married in this town, but died in earlier life.\n</p>\n<p>\n William married Lucinda, daughter of Noah Nash, of Westport, and his\n children were Lorinda (Mrs. John B. Hunter), Mary Ann (Mrs. Samuel Gor-\n ham), Esther (Mrs. Eli K. Street), Eliza (Mrs. William D. Haight), Catharine\n (Mrs. Charles S. Lockwood), Sarah (Mrs. Charles C. Brooks). Thomas, William,\n John, Robert, and Louisa (Mrs. George F. Belden). Mrs. William Cornwall\u2019s\n uncle and aunt, Luke and Jemima Keeler, of Norwalk, removed, probably\n in the \u201cPrairie Schooner\u201d (a large traveling vehicle), to the West, and were\n among the founders of St. Paul\u2019s parish, in Norwalk, Ohio. The Cornwalls\n adhered to their church, and of William, at his death, Dr. Kemper said : \u201cHe\n was to me a brother, a counsellor, and a helper.\u201d His services as lay reader\n and chorister, were of no trifling importance to the parish ; and albeit he has\n gone, and his old choir has disappeared, and other choirs have been formed,\n to be in their turn displaced, yet such ministrations are not lost forever. The\n blessings, which those who lead in our praises bequeath, are abiding.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lawrence Stevens was the last of the four, who in 1839, took two pews each.\n He was son of Ebenezer Stevens by his first wife.

His wife, Cath-\n arine, was the neice of the second bishop of Connecticut.\u2019\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n There were several good and solid members of St. Paul\u2019s church who\n resided, many years ago, in West Norwalk; and among these the occupants\n of Pew No. 25. Nathanael Street, and Esther his wife, were the parents of\n Samuel, and Joseph, and John Street. The old Street house stood on the road\n leading from Norwalk to Darien, a few rods south of the West Norwalk chapel\n of to-day. In that house Dr. Kemper held his \u201ccottage services,\u201d and Dr.\n Mead officiated. Samuel, son of Nathanael, was the father of the late much\n respected Chauncey Street. Joseph was the father of Edward Street, the first\n organist of St. Paul\u2019s church, who married one who, even at eventide, made\n life radiant by her willing attentions and kindness, the mother of Mrs.\n Charles T. Leonard. John was the parent of William Jarvis Street, who\n married a lady of high character and much benevolence of purpose, the sister\n of Jonathan Camp, 4th.\n</p>\n<p>\n David Boult, of Pew No. 27, was a man who, it is inferred, could be counted\n upon. There were eighteen who paid more, and forty-nine who paid less\n for their pews than he; which seems to indicate his parish status straight\n through. The family (he remained here), removed to Norwalk, Ohio, and was\n influential, quite probably, in the founding of St. Paul\u2019s parish, in that city.\n</p>\n<p>\n Jacob Jennings, the owner of Pew No. 34, took to wife Miss Grace Parker,\n (daughter of Dr. Parker, of Boston,) an English lady of rare gifts, whose con-\n spicuous qualities elicited the admiration of the Norwalk people. Her society\n was sought, and the young people, in particular, seemed to court her com-\n pany. The house, which is in good preservation to-day, stood on the south-\n east corner of Main street and North avenue, and within it was reared a large\n family. The oldest child, Lydia, married Abijah Mead. Grace, the second\n daughter, resided in New York city, and was the mother of the late Thomas\n Brady, a former member of Trinity school, New York, and afterward, and\n until old age, a member of St. Paul\u2019s church, Norwalk. There was a son,\n Seth, and the son next to him was Isaac, who married Miss Elizabeth Sammis,\n of Long Island. (Selectman Sammis, and most, if not all of the Norwalk\n Sammises of to-day, are of the same Long Island family.) Anna, a daughter,\n next younger to Clarissa. (Mrs. Bryant Jarvis,) married Nicholas VanAntwerp,\n the father of Edwin VanAntwerp, a resident, in past years, of East avenue.\n Jacob, Jr., married Miss Nancy Trowbridge, and was the father of the late\n George W. Jennings, and of his sisters Delia and Julia Ann. Charlotte\n married Dr. Fenton. Sally was the worthy Mrs. McClure, who lived and died\n in her father\u2019s home. Lawrence married Levi Clinton and resided in Patter-\n son. Mrs. Abijah (Jennings) Mead was the mother of Mrs. Eliza Weeks, and\n grandmother of Carlysle T. Weeks.\n</p>\n<p>\n The children of Isaac, son of Jacob and Grace, were Almira, (Mrs. Henry\n Hurlbutt and an old choir member); and Eliza, (Mrs. Nathan Whitehead, the\n mother of Mrs. James C.

Mrs. Captain\n Bouton was a Miss Margaret McLean, an individual of sweetly-blended virtues\n of character. Their daughter, Harriett, afterward Mrs. Langdon Mott, was a\n member of St. Paul\u2019s church choir, and sang in the church with Isaac Adams,\n of Westport, (father of Charles, of Norwalk,) and William Cornwall, and Miss\n Ann Boult, and others.

Olmstead, and his sisters Julia and\n Fanny), of Belden\u2019s Hill. Mr. Asa Olmstead belonged to St. Matthew\u2019s parish,\n Wilton, but during the closing years of its existence himself and family\n attended at the St. Paul\u2019s, of 1786. His son. Dr. David W., studied under Bev.\n Dr. William Smith, and graduated at the New York Medical College. He was\n unmarried, as was alse his sister Julia. His sister, Fanny, married William\n Harrington. His cousin Charles (father of two communicants, in 1886, Mrs,\n Edwin and Mrs. George Beers) resided in Cranberry Plains, and his cousin,\n Silas, lived at Tarrytown-on-the-Hudson, and was one of the wealthy and most\n prominent citizens of that place. The nearest Norwalk descendants of Asa\n and Betsey Olmstead, now living, are the widow of Murrain Raymond, and\n Mrs. Julia Ann Hayes, and Mrs. Andrew Selleck.\n</p>\n<p>\n Captain Alfred Taylor, of Poplar Plains, nephew of Paul Taylor, of West\n Norwalk, is probably the oldest churchman in St. Paul\u2019s, or either of its\n daughter parishes. He was born in 1791, and was, therefore, something of a\n child when the pews were first disposed of, in 1794. He is too infirm to attend\n upon the public services of religion, but his faculties, with the exception of\n his healing, are remarkably preserved, and the fervor with which the rare\n old faithful (whose memory antedates the rectorships of Dr. Mead, Dr. Kem-\n per, Dr. Sherwood, and Dr. Judd and extends through that of Mr. Whitlock, to\n the rectorship of Dr. Smith) engages in the private offices of the church, is\n impressive. He has come, with the partner of his days \u2014 fouryears his junior\n \u2014 gratefully, to the ending of a long life, both of them speaking tenderly of\n the blessings which, through the pilgrimage, have been vouchsafed them;\n and, together, looking hopefully forward to re-union in the land of endless\n youth and ceaseless song.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2666Around the old parsonage (see cut) crowded many interesting associations.\n Beneath its roof Mr. Whitlock spent the concluding months of his parish\n connection, and Dr. Judd went in and out, and Dr. Sherwood resided for\n fourteen years. It was Mr. Richmond\u2019s temporary home, and he planted a\n tree outside of it which reminds us to-day of the birth of a daughter within\n it. Dr. Kemper thoroughly enjoyed, and Dr. Mead was much attached to it.\n Under its shade such as Drs. Harry Croswell, and Francis L. Hawks, and\n William Shelton were welcomed. Bishop Brownell there met his gathered\n clergy. Bishop Benjamin T. Onderdonk knew the place. Dr. Muhlenbergh\n spent many pleasant hours therein. Dr. William F. Morgan read in its study.\n Dr. Thomas W. Coit was accustomed to its tones of greeting, and so was Dr.\n Gurdon S., his brother, and Dr. Ambrose Todd, of Stamford, and Revds.\n William Jarvis, and David and Abel Ogden, and Charles I. Todd, and B. M.\n Yarrington, and John Purves, all gone with the exception of the well remem-\n bered rectors of St. Thomas\u2019, New York, and Christ church, Greenwich.\n</p>\n<p>\n The ancient spot witnessed to protracted discussions, and brave attestations\n to the church\u2019s doctrines, and advocates of modern \u201cdevelopments\u201d found no\n audience. The sound old churchmen thought and taught that it is by the\n spirit of the Lord, that the world progresses, and the notion, that because of\n the march of mind truth must change its base, seemed as senseless to them\n as the fear lest the \u201cchaotic tendencies of Hume and Hobbe\u201d should supplant\n the Divine revelation seemed shallow.\n</p>\n<p>\n Three parishes, in this old Episcopal see, were wont to be represented within\n the hospitable walls of that parsonage : The three\u2014 formerly as now\u2014 import-\n ant cures of Western Connecticut: St. John\u2019s, Bridgeport, St. John\u2019s, Stam-\n ford ; and St. Paul\u2019s, Norwalk. The rectory of the latter, standing about mid-\n way between the other two, and close on to the old Post Road, naturally be-\n came the place where the clergy would frequently meet. The Revs. Philo\n Shelton, Jonathan Judd, and Reuben Sherwood, and, later, Drs. Gurdon S.\n Coit, Ambrose S. Todd, and William Cooper Mead, were cotemporaries. These\n clergymen were of one mind with regard to ecclesiastical polity, and the fun-\n dametals of the faith; their laity were churchmen from conviction, and dur-\n ing an era marked by \u201cdepartures,\u201d the parishes were a unit in insisting that\n there should be \u201cno tampering with the landmarks.\u201d The three have gone\n growingly on ; each can count, in missions, or in established parishes, at least\n five daughters ; and although the easternmost ranks its sisters in having been\n the first to rear, upon \u201ca fair site,\u201d a noble temple of stone, beautiful\n within and without, a temple worthy of the parish antecedents, still the other\n two have no cause to look regretfully back upon their achievements.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0072/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 163, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0072/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 327, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 549}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0072/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 655, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1099}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0072/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1310, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2198}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0072/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2621, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4396}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0072/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ad/dr/es/sa/tc/en/te/na/00/se/ll/addressatcentena00sell/addressatcentena00sell_0072.jp2", "height": 4396, "width": 2621, "levels": 6, "size": 642892}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"72\">\n<p>\n 66\n</p>\n<p>\n fund for the support or maintenance of the rector or minister of St.\n Paul\u2019s Church or society in the town of Norwalk, county of Fairfield,\n State of Connecticut, and in consideration of the provisions and\n</p>\n<p>\n It will do no harm, perhaps, to add that the parsonages of 1806, and 1742,\n were conveniently situated a,s pertains to a particular other than that of\n a clerical gathering point.

During the reign of\n one of the Georges, the birth of an heir, apparent or presumptive, was in this\n manner published to our people. The shrill \u201ctooting\u201d of the tidings-bearer\n was heard as he galloped down \u201cJarvis Hill,\u201d and the denizens along the Green\n ran out to learn what the tidings might be. The messenger sped across the\n common, crying loudly, \u201ca Prince is born, a Prince is born,\u201d but one of our\n old rector\u2019s neighbors was not satisfied ; he wished to know more concerning\n the matter, and would interrogate the courier; but the rider dashed on, leav-\n ing behind him the echoes of the proclamation, \u201ca Prince is born \u2014 a prince\n is born.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n PARISH BRIEFS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some one says that the greatest poets have \u201clearned in suffering what they\n taught in song.\u201d The church of 1786 was born of struggle, but it burst forth\n eventually in brightness, and, when finally completed, was ah object of ad-\n miration. Its symmetrical proportions; its curved door and window head-\n ings; its artistic spire, tapering, in perfect lines, towards the sky; its con-\n cave ceiling, and graceful chancel arch, and panneled gallery fronts; the\n pure, pearl tint, reigning within, relieved pleasantly by the choir hangings at\n the west, and by the plush or damask desk, and pulpit drapery at the east\n end, and by the cushioned pews, and carpeted aisles, gave to it a certain indi-\n viduality, and made it a sort of survival of olden-time ecclesiastical taste.\n</p>\n<p>\n The fine row of Lombardy poplars in front of it (look again at cut of\n church) were set out, it is probable, in the spring of 1802. The parish made\n a purchase of between twenty and thirty of these tender-legended saplings,\n and distributed them through the church yard. They gave a kind of sober\n dignity to the spot, and are not, by any means, forgotten to-day.\n</p>\n<p>\n Neither has the tower room (the open space behind the choir) with its raised\n seats, and aisles branching to either gallery, passed quite out of memory. It\n was not an inconsiderable portion of the church in ancient times, and its\n south window (first tower window over the front door, as shown in cut) is\n referred to as having given a particularly cheerful atmosphere to the\n unpartitioned apartmenn The colored people once occupied this space, and\n in the days before the organ was introduced, their voices, in response and\n song, were wont to come in deep volume from it, over the gallery elevation.\n Latterly, and after the organ was placed in the church, a little room was\n parted off in that portion of the edifice, through which access was had to the\n belfry.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. William Smith was a composer of music, and during his rectorship\n awakened, doubtless, a taste for more fluent and attractive melody. Chanting\n was comparatively unknown, at that day, in this land, and a strong prejudice\n existed against it, so that no great progress in it was made at St. Paul\u2019s further\n than that the singers themselves became much engaged in the matter. One\n of Dr. Smith\u2019s successors seemed averse to it also, but the choir was persis-\n tent, and finally made use of an argument which prevailed. They arranged\n fora musical serenade to their rector, and prepared a choice programme.\n The selections (in chanting) were so delightful, and their execution of the same\n so skillful, that resistance ceased. Chanting was introduced, and so unusual\n was the practice, and so perfect was the old choir\u2019s performance of it, that\n visitors from the city came to the town and church to listen to it.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of the most efficient members of the choir, in the past, was Mrs. Edward\n Smith (Esther Benedict,) daughter-in-law of Rev. Dr. William Smith, and\n mother of the present William D. and Henry Smith, and also aunt of the late\n Mrs. LeGrand Lockwood, and of Mrs. Charles F. Raymond, now residing in\n Knight street. Mr. and Mrs. Smith were married, on May 22d., 1811, by the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0073/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 163, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0073/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 327, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 549}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0073/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 655, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1099}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0073/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1310, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2198}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0073/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2621, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4396}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0073/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ad/dr/es/sa/tc/en/te/na/00/se/ll/addressatcentena00sell/addressatcentena00sell_0073.jp2", "height": 4396, "width": 2621, "levels": 6, "size": 577153}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"73\">\n<p>\n 67\n</p>\n<p>\n stipulations hereinafter contained, do promise to pay, to the wardens\n and vestrymen of said parish or society for the time being, such sum\n</p>\n<p>\n Rev.

The remembrance of\n the \u201crehearsals\u2019 within it is not yet effaced. The family pew was No. 24\n south side of the church.\n</p>\n<p>\n Prominent among the twenty-seven choirsters, from the consecration, in\n 1786, down to Dr. Mead\u2019s acceptance of the parish, was Mr. Samuel J. Camp,\n who lived in the house now standing, on the north-west corner of North\n avenue and Camp street. He was fond of music, and the choir was often at\n his house, and, when intent upon its trial of some new piece or anthem, his\n appearance (long curls flowing over his shoulders, and tune book in one hand,\n and tuning-fork in the other and beating time with both), was striking, and\n indicative of earnestness. The \u201csinging schools\u201d at choirster Camp\u2019s house\n were quite a social feature, and among their frequent neighborhood visitors\n were Hon. Thaddeus Betts and Mr. Charles Robert Sherman.\n</p>\n<p>\n The line of four tower windows in the old church, and the series of small\n sky windows in the spire above the belfry, were brightly illuminated on the\n eve of ' he Nativity: which spectacle, heightened by that of the reflection of\n a burning candle from every pane in the nave, and voiced by the tones of the\n church bell borne cheerily out upon the electric air, was not only a brilliant\n but an inspiriting one, at the glowing tide when Christmas \u201cset its warm\n kiss upou the inner man of the heart.\u201d The old church was a marvel of\n beauty on Christmas Eve, and the susceptibilities of our fathers, to the\n charms of the grateful season, were remarkably keen. The church yard was\n black with people waiting for admission to the service on the night \u201cwhich,\n to the cottage as to the crown, brought tidings of salvation down,\u201d and of\n such account was the festival, in the estimation 5f one of the worshipers in\n the church of 1786, that from the hour of lighting the candles, on Christmas\n Eve, all work on the part of the farm hands was suspended for the next\n twelve days.\n</p>\n<p>\n While Christ church parish, Westport, was being organized, some fifty odd\n years ago, a \u201ccrisis\u201d occurred. Subscriptions were slow, and the funds were\n running low. Approaching Mr. Daniel Nash, who was much interested in the\n matter, and who stood in the aisle or at the stove in old St. Paul\u2019s, Dr. Kemper\n remarked, \u201cUncle Daniel, I purpose to double my subscription for Sauga-\n tuck.\u201d \u201c Then I must double mine, \" was the reply. The result of which was the\n addition of several hundred dollars to the treasury, and the completion and\n consecration of the church.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Kemper was not only fond of parish visiting, but he made systematic\n work of the duty. Among his parishioners from a distance w ere a father, his\n son, and their families, who dwelt beneath one roof. The pastor dined in\n one side of the house, and supped in the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n Th v first church, built by the parish, stood in the north-east corner of the\n present church grounds. It was used for church purposes about five years, and\n then converted into a parsonage. After about seventy years, service it was\n finally taken down in 18J6.\n</p>\n<p>\n The second church was built in 1743 and was in dimensions fifty-five feet by\n forty-two feet It was destroyed in 1779, and after worshiping for a few years\n in a temporary structure, the parish erected the church of 1786, over the ruins\n of the one that was burned, and of the same dimensions.\n</p>\n<p>\n Stephen Marvin is alluded to, in the centennial address, as having drawn\n the first stick of timber for the church of the last century. This was a fact,\n but the honor was coveted by another. Mr. Jemmy James said, in the hearing\n of Mr. Marvin, that it was his intention to be ahead of any one else with an\n offering. Then Mr. James, answered Mr. Marvin, you will have to get up very\n early in the morning. Stephen Marvin lived where his grandson, Josiah\n Raymond, of Westport, now lives. Jemmy James lived towards Belden Hill.\n Both were astir betimes, but Mr. Marvin was first upon the ground.\n</p>\n<p>\n The large vane which, alike in balmy air or furious blast and during sun-\n shine or through continuous rain, turns, a faithful indication of the course\n of the winds, formed, in the beginning of the nineteenth century, a target for\n a young city lad, (afterwards a vestryman of Trinity church, New York), who\n was staying in the place. The lad was a clever marksman, and on this occa-\n sion he took very excellent aim. The picked up path-side stone was unerr-\n ingly directed, and the vane fell to the pavement.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0074/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 163, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0074/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 327, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 549}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0074/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 655, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1099}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0074/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1310, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2198}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0074/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2621, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4396}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0074/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ad/dr/es/sa/tc/en/te/na/00/se/ll/addressatcentena00sell/addressatcentena00sell_0074.jp2", "height": 4396, "width": 2621, "levels": 6, "size": 643205}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"74\">\n<p>\n 68\n</p>\n<p>\n or sums as are applied to our names respectively, on tlie following\n terms or conditions, viz :\n</p>\n<p>\n Payment shall be made in the following manner, one-fourtli part\n at or before Easter Monday, one thousand eight hundred and\n seventeen, one-fourth part at or before Easter Monday, one thousand\n eight hundred and eighteen, one-fourth part at or before Easter\n Monday, one thousand eight hundred and nineteen, one-fourth\n part at or before Easter Monday one thousand eight hundred and\n twenty, with the lawful interest from Easter Monday one thousand\n eight hundred and sixteen on the whole amount of said subscription,\n and that annually, and the interest or income shall be applied to the\n support or maintenance of said rector or minister.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Propagation Society\u2019s prayer books, which belonged to the former\n church, with the rector\u2019s marginal or interlined addition of successive\n sovereigns\u2019 names, in the prayers for rulers, are kept in the parsonage.

Street was\n elected vice-president, and E. H. Street, secretary, and E. Hoyt,\n treasurer, and William K. James, librarian; while Jonathan Camp\n and Eseck Kellogg and David St. John were chosen collectors.\n This was the foundation, at least in modern times, of our present\n parish library.* The last subscription paper which can with any\n propriety be claimed as ancient, and this for the single reason that\n it holds two names which were on the subscription rolls of 1821\n and 1816, and one of them was on the subscription of 1792, is dated\n forty-seven years ago this month, and is the subscription list for\n this present edifice of the parish. The two names to which refer-\n ence is made are tho e of Jonathan Camp, Sr. , and Benjamin Isaacs,\n both of w hom lived to a good age, but neither of them long enough,\n thank God, to unlearn the glorious old time lesson of generosity,\n but together gave for this calm and beautiful house of prayer the\n sum of $600. f\n</p>\n<p>\n There have been legacies left to the parish, the incomes fromwdiich\n are helpful to it; and one bequeathment has been made from which\n those who come after us will derive the benefit. The corner stone,\n a solid block, for the stone church in which, divine providence so\n ordering and permitting, the centenary of 1986 w ill be held, is even\n now laid. I Other records may be lost or obliterated, but such,\n never, whilst immortality endures.\n</p>\n<p>\n The report w r hich summarizes the accomplishments of a century\n which is completed, must of necessity embrace performances with\n whicn all are more or less familiar, and these consequently need no\n detailed explanation. The corner-stone of this fifth parish church\n was laid in 1840, and the church was consecrated by the Rt. Rev.\n Benjamin T. Onderdonk, in 1841.\n</p>\n<p>\n A new parsonage was built in 1849, and in 1854 a new organ w r as\n procured. The sum of $1,125 w ' as paid for the site of the new\n Trinity Chapel, South Norwalk, the corner-stone of which was laid\n</p>\n<p>\n *This library, in 1797, numbered sixteen volumes.\n</p>\n<p>\n tThe subscription paper for the new church (of 1840) was put into the hands\n of Messrs David St. John, Jr., S. F. Mills, Jonathan Camp, Jr., Asa E. Smith,\n and William Atwill, committee. Before this committee was appointed, Mrs.\n Sarah MacGregor, of Main street, had contributed $100.\n</p>\n<p>\n tThe legacy of the late William K.

This, however, did not prevent a goodly\n congregation from assembling for the introductory service, at half-\n past ten o\u2019clock. , a. m. , at which hour some thirty of the clergy,\n having previously robed in the rectory, preceeding the bishop of\n the diocese, marched to the main entrance of the church. The\n hymn \u201c O God our Help in Ages Past,\u201d was the processional; on\n reaching the chancel, the lines divided, and between them Right\n Reverend John Williams, the bishop of the diocese, followed by\n the Rev. Howard S. Clapp, the rector of the parish, and the Revs.\n Drs. Beardsley and Vibbert, and Rev. Mr. Selleck, passed into the\n sanctuary. In the choir of the chancel sat the rectors and pastors\n of the five daughter parishes of St. Paul\u2019s: The Rev. Messrs. Bell,\n Williams, Lewis, Meyrick, and Coley. The remainder of the clergy\n occupied reserved front seats in the middle aisle.\n</p>\n<p>\n The bishop began the anti-communion office, Rev. Mr. Selleck\n reading the epistle, and the Rev. Dr. Beardsley reading the gospel.\n After the singing of the hymn \u2018 \u2018With One Consent Let all the Earth. \u201d\n The bishop preached from Psalm XCHI: 6, \u201cThy Testimonies,\n O Lord, are very sure; Holiness becometh thine house Forever.\u201d\n The sermon was one of rare power; its palpable idea being The\n Strength and Perpetuity of Truth and the Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n The holy communion was celebrated, the bishop being consecra-\n tor, and the rector, assisted by the clergy, within the sanctuary,\n administering. At the conclusion of the morning service all visitors\n were the guests of the parish; and at half past two o\u2019clock, p. m.,\n the bishop, with the rector and Rev. Dr. Beardsley and Rev. Mr.\n Selleck, re-entered the chancel. The hymn \u201c O Come loud\n Anthems\u201d was sung, and the Rev. Dr. Beardsley made an address\n of marked force and interest. The hymn, \u201cO Render Thanks\u201d\n followed, and, after the reading of the historical paper which forms\n the body of this book, the doxology was sung. The bishop then\n read the concluding collects, and gave the final benediction, and a\n memorable day in the parish closed beneath a cloudless heaven,\n and with happy auguries for the future.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0083/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 163, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0083/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 327, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 549}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0083/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 655, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1099}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0083/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1310, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2198}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0083/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2621, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4396}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0083/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ad/dr/es/sa/tc/en/te/na/00/se/ll/addressatcentena00sell/addressatcentena00sell_0083.jp2", "height": 4396, "width": 2621, "levels": 6, "size": 382393}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"83\">\n<p>\n 77\n</p>\n<p>\n THE VISITING CLERGYMEN.\n</p>\n<p>\n RT.

Henry Caner visited Norwalk, as missionary, as early,\n evidently, as 1729, and divine service was performed probably at\n private houses or, possibly, where a parish meeting was held in\n later times, at \u201cye old school house.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Let it be borne in mind that what are now \u201cthe green\u201d and the\n parsonage and church yards and grounds, was, in 1737, a tract of\n \u201ccommon or undivided lands,\u201d called Mill-Plain, the upper portion\n of which, the precise site of the present church and its rear yard,\n was used for a public sheep-fold. The Connecticut Turnpike had\n not been opened, although a street ran from north to south across\n the plain, on the eastern side of which, and about where is located\n the recent Flavius Clark purchase, were, it is believed, the house,\n garden, and grounds of Lieutenant William Lees. The orig-\n inal grant of land, 1733-4, to the Professors of the Church of\n England, from the proprietors of the Norwalk Common Lands, was\n one-quarter acre on \u2018ye plain before Lieutenant Lees\u2019 door,\u201d\n and Joseph Platt and John Marvin were constituted a committee\n to lay out the same. In the extreme north-western angle of\n Officer Lees\u2019 dooryard stood a rock, and a point sixty-six feet\n west, bearing south, from that rock, was the established north-east\n corner of the future St. Paul\u2019s territory. From this point, marked\n by a \u201cheap of stones,\u201d the line ran along the street, \u201csouth and\n westerly,\u201d two hundred and one feet, which at that day formed\n the church frontage. From the south-east point the line took a\n somewhat north-westerly direction for about fifty-seven feet;\n thence an easterly course \u201cnine rods and eleven feet, \u2019\u2019thence north-\n westerly \u201ctwo rods and a half, where is erected a heap of stones\n for ye north-west corner \u201d Within these limits was the proprie-\n tors\u2019 grant, as marked out by their committee, but a mere paper\n grant until the day before Christmas, 1736, when at the instigation\n of Ralph Isaacs, the lot was surveyed, and preparations for its\n occupancy began. During the next few months, (we have now\n reached the one hundred and fiftieth anniversary of these events),\n the parish was organized, and a small church building, which was\n afterward converted into a parsonage, was erected upon the\n extreme northern or north-eastern part of this grant. Here the\n Rev. Henry Caner came, weekly, from Fairfield, and officiated.\n His brother Richard, who succeeded him, was the first settled rector\n of the parish, and, while he was at St. Paul\u2019s, action looking to an\n addition to the church grounds was taken. It was but a short time\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0091/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 163, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0091/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 327, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 549}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0091/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 655, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1099}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0091/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1310, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2198}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0091/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2621, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4396}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0091/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ad/dr/es/sa/tc/en/te/na/00/se/ll/addressatcentena00sell/addressatcentena00sell_0091.jp2", "height": 4396, "width": 2621, "levels": 6, "size": 528894}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"91\">\n<p>\n 85\n</p>\n<p>\n before a second church was built, more toward the south, and in an\n enlarged lot.

His father (James), who was \u201cad-\n mitted an inhabitant\u201d of Norwalk, in about 1685, was a pioneer\n New England settler. He had four sons, Elisha, Isaac, John and,\n J ames, and at least one daughter, Kuth.

He was one of the first proprietors of Rridgefield, and\n was a house-and-land-owner in the colonies of Connecticut and New\n York. With William Smith,* of New ' York, he purchased about\n eleven thousand acres in the latter state. His daughter Mary,\n married Samuel, son of Ralph Isaacs, and his eldest son, James,\n born in Norwalk, in 1720, moved to the State of New York, where\n he was an ardent friend of the church, and gave to it about one\n hundred acres of land. James Brown, the settler, died, some-\n where near 1709; James, 2d., died, in 1769; James, 3d., died Feb-\n ruary 19th, 1786, about five months before the church of 1786 was\n consecrated.\n</p>\n<p>\n There have been a number of St. Paul\u2019s members who have\n borne the name of Hoyt. It is one of the very oldest family names\n in the land. Simon Hoyt landed in Massachusetts as early as\n 1628-9. Remaining some few years in the eastern portion of the\n colony, he came to Fairfield somewhere near 1646. There was, in\n the Seventeenth Century, a small inner island, about five miles\n east of the Norwalk Islands, which was called \u201cHoits Island.\u201d He\n was its owner. It is stated that he left Fairfield for Stamford about\n 1650, although Huntington claims him as a 1642 Stamford pioneer.\n There was a Thomas Hyoute in Stamford, in 1651. (There is\n ground for believing that Hoyt and Hyatt were originally the same\n family name.) Thomas Hyoute \u2014 Hyat \u2014 Hoyt, died, in 1651, and\n Simon, September 1st, 1657. Walter, the first Norwalk Hoyt, was\n Simon\u2019s son, probably, and came to Norwalk, from the same town\n from which Simon, at or near the same time, went to Fairfield.\n He was an ancestor not without a record.

Booking,\n a village in Braintree, Essex county, was the home of Thomas\n Fitch, the progenitor of the American family of that name. He\n had, if the tradition is correct, five sons, three of whom (we have\n no definite knowledge concerning the other two) accompanied\n their mother, after her husband\u2019s decease, to this country.\n Thomas and Joseph came to Norwalk (Joseph remained here but\n a short time, until 1655) and James went to Norwich.

Thomas Fitch, Sr., came from England to America some-\n where between 1635 and 1640, and settled in Norwalk between\n 1640 and 1652 He was one of the forefathers of the town, and\n his house lot was north of, but not a great distance from, the\n present grounds of Henry M. Prowitt, Esq. He had five child-\n ren, viz.: Thomas, Jr., John, Ann, Mary, and Mrs. Bur. His\n oldest son, Thomas, Jr., reported in 1671-2, four children. His\n second son, John,* had three children viz. : John, Jr. Rebecca and\n Nathaniel. In the will of the father, Thomas, Sr., who lived to\n extreme age, occurs this passage : \u2018 \u2018 After great expense in civil\n wars in England, and transportation of myself and family, and\n settling myself in America, and distributing portions to my cliilcl-\n</p>\n<p>\n *John Fitch, second son of Thomas Fitch, Sr., and great-uncle of Governor\n Fitch, married a daughter of Nathaniel Richards. Nathaniel Richards came\n to America, in 1632.

Campbell) as far west as to the river. .The Richards descent\n embraces a large family, including the New Canaan and Darien Richards,\n and also the Richards, of Troy, New York.

He was a business man of the town, and his life-\n day was a protraated one. He died suddenly, upon the grounds\n of his brother-in-law, Isaac Scudder Isaacs. Mrs. St. John was\n sister (so it is supposed), of Captain Hall Fitcli, a resident of\n Norwalk, and later of Troy, New York, and aunt to Mrs. Albert\n P.

Mr. and Mrs. St. John had two daugh-\n ters, Henrietta and Julia Ann. Henrietta married and removed\n to Troy. Julia Ann was the first Mrs. Horace Gibbs, of Norwalk.\n John Cannon, Jr., of St. Paul\u2019s, married Sarah, (sister of Stephen)\n St. John, who was the mother of Antoinette (Mrs. Senator Betts)\n and her sisters Sarah, Harriett and Esther Mary, and their\n</p>\n<p>\n *This city, seated advantageously at the head of navigation on the Hudson,\n attracted, at the close of the past, and during the first quarter of the present\n century, a number of emigrants from Norwalk. These were an element of\n strength in the new city, and contributed, in no small measure, to its wax-\n ing prosperity. Bouton, Cannon, Craft, Kellogg, and Warren have been, and\n are names of influence and of dignity in Troy. Those who left Norwalk were\n kinsfolk, and, previous to their departure, were attached to St. Paul\u2019s. The\n parents (Esaias and Phebe Bouton) of several of them were of deserved repu-\n tation in their native parish. The father\u2019s (Esaias Bouton) descent is alluded\n to in a note on page forty, and his wife, who was from Massachusetts, was a\n descendant of one of the New England governors, (Hopkins), and bore the\n name (so the Norwalk relatives contended) of the governor\u2019s daughter, Phebe.\n This daughter married into a Massachusetts Bay family, one branch of which\n chose Norwalk for its home. Among the children of this branch was Phebe\n (Mrs. Esaias Bouton). They made large purchases of land in Norwalk. Moses\n Byxbee, one of the number, and a member of St. Paul\u2019s, invested to the\n amount of several thousand dollars in one plot. The original home was near\n the summit of Flax Hill, and perhaps no better fruit was ever grown in the\n county than that which grew in the orchards which belonged to this home.\n Esaias Bouton, a not remote neighbor, married Phebe, a daughter. Eliakim\n Warren from the same vicinity, married their (Esaias and Phebe Bouton\u2019s)\n daughter. These were the two (Eliakim and Phebe Warren), who were the\n parents of the Warren family of Troy. The husband (St. Paul\u2019s vestryman\n who has before been alluded to) was the first church warden in Troy, and his\n excellent wife took a deep interest in church matters, and was unremitting\n in efforts to insure the success of the earliest parish planted in the thriving\n city of their adoption.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Cannon and Craft ancestors, as before mentioned, were among the\n most respected and reliable of St. Paul\u2019s early members. LeGrand Cannon\n and Mrs. Moses Craft were brother and sister, and went to Troy about the\n same time. They were children of Samuel, and grandchildren of Commodore\n Cannon. The brother married a daughter of Nathan Bouton, and sister of\n Mrs. Nathan Warren, of Troy. The children of LeGrand Cannon were the\n late Mrs. John B. Tibbitts and the present Mrs. George H. Cramer, of Troy,\n and LeGrand B. Cannon, and Mrs. George Bird, of New York. The children\n of Mrs. Moses Craft were the late Mrs. Sarah Murray, of New York, and the late\n Mrs. G. Parish Ogden, and the present Mrs. Hannibal Green, of Troy. The\n parents attended the mother St. Paul\u2019s of Troy, as the Warrens, and Boutons,\n and Kelloggs did; and, their pews in the church being in proximity to each\n other, they pleasantly, among themselves, designated the portion of the edifice\n occupied by them, as \u201cNorwalk.\u201d The grandchildren of Eliakim and Phebe\n Warren, now living, are : Doctor Nathan B. Warren and his brother Stephen,\n who reside upon the Mount Ida estate, and their brother, George Henry, whose\n residence is in New York City, and Hon. Joseph M.

His name was Ebenezer Church. He was\n possessed of some capital, especially for those days, and select-\n ing, in 1744, a convenient location for the plying of an useful art,\n established himself in this section of the colony. One of the\n mothers of this parish sought, it is said, the stranger out, and\n invited him to attend St. Paul\u2019s, and the result was that he was\n led, first, to take an interest in its services, and then to recog-\n nize the claims of the church. He was evidently a young man of\n character, and became an intimate, almost immediately, of one of\n the staunchest families of Norwalk. He married Susannah,\n daughter of John Fitch, Jr., (cousin of Governor Fitch), and two\n children, Daniel and Richard, were born to them. Mrs. Church\n died early in her wedded life. Her husband, whose clear, calm\n judgment must have won upon his cotemporaries, was elected,\n in 1751, with two such men as James Brown and Alexander Resi-\n quee, to \u201cmake up\u201d parish accounts of years standing. He was\n elected to the vestry very soon afterwards, and, in 1757, was\n chosen church warden. He married for a second wife, the widow\n of Captain Sears. Mrs. Sears was a Ruth Raymond, of South\n Norwalk, (aunt of the late Charles Hoyt and of the mother of\n General William T. Sherman). By Captain Sears she had a son,\n Thatcher, who married a Long Island lady. During the Revolu-\n tionary War, Thatcher Sears removed to New Brunswick, and re-\n ceived a grant from the British Government. His first wife (by\n whom he had several children), died in the provinces, and he\n married again. The three children by the last wife are Robert,\n Edward and John. Robert (the bible publisher) lives in Toron-\n to, and Edward and John in New Brunswick.

In connection with the gift of St. Paul\u2019s\n parish of \u201cMrs. Ogilvie and Mr. Phillips,\u201d as there alluded to, is\n an interesting bit of history. The Hon. Verderych Felypsen,\n Patroon of Philipsborough (a portion of the ancient province of\n New York) came from Holland to America, in 1658. With General\n Stuyvesant and others he was one of the fathers of Nova Belgia\n (New York city.) He made heavy purchases of land in the new\n city, laying out the same in streets, and marking out building lots.\n He also bought a large tract on the east side of the Hudson, some\n thirty or forty miles above the city, and erected thereon an out-of-\n town mansion. His wife was Margaret Dacres, and he had two\n children, a son and daughter, Verderych and Eva. Verderych\n married first, a Hardenbrook, and for a second wife, a daughter of\n Stephen Van Corlandt of the Corlandt manor. Eva married into\n the same family. Verderych died, somewhere near 1700, and left\n Philip, and Adolphus Pliillipse. Phillip, as a child, was in delicate\n health, and his father had purchased an estate at Barbadoes, and\n sent him there. He died at about the age of forty -two, and left the\n son referred to in note on page twenty-seven. The child\u2019s mother\n also died at about the same time, and the grandfather sent the\n young orphan to New York, and that he might not be tempted to\n again return to the Barbadoes the grandfather sold the island estate\n for about fifty thousand dollars. This Frederick died, in 1751, and\n left his property in New York city, and upon the Hudson, to his\n namesake son, Frederick, or in event of Frederick having no heir,\n to his second son, Philip. Frederick, however, married. He died,\n in 1768, and his widow married the Bev. John Ogilvie who had had\n temporary charge, in 1749, of St. Paul\u2019s church, and was the father\n of the Rev. George Ogilvie (see note, page ten) rector of St. Paul\u2019s,\n in 1790. This statement (condensed) is borrowed from an article\n (copied from the English press) in one of this country\u2019s au-\n thentic genealogical works, and it reveals the probable fact that\n the last century \u201cMrs. Ogilvie and Mr. Phillips\u201d donors to St.\n Paul\u2019s Church were \u2014 mother and son \u2014 Mrs. (Phillips) Ogilvie and\n Mr. Frederick Phillips, the latter a descendant in the sixth gener-\n ation from the Knickerbocker patroon of 1658; while the statement\n (one of the Phillips married a Livington) may throw light also\n upon the of late years unaccounted-for \u201cPhillip Livingstones\u201d\n membership, at the same period, of St. Paul\u2019s church.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0126/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 163, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0126/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 327, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 549}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0126/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 655, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1099}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0126/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1310, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2198}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0126/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2621, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4396}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sa:tc:en:te:na:00:se:ll:addressatcentena00sell:addressatcentena00sell_0126/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ad/dr/es/sa/tc/en/te/na/00/se/ll/addressatcentena00sell/addressatcentena00sell_0126.jp2", "height": 4396, "width": 2621, "levels": 6, "size": 501177}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"126\">\n<p>\n 118\n</p>\n<p>\n The old New York Livingstones, and Phillipses, and Jays, and\n Frenches, and Ludlows, and Rutgers, and Van Hornes, were\n relatives, and some of them are of savory memory in Norwalk.\n Several of these families had temporary representatives in this town\n during the closing years of the eighteenth century; and the even-\n ing, or morning, as the case may be of General Tryon\u2019s arrival, in\n 1779, at Fitch\u2019s Point, found General VanHorne and quite a com-\n pany of his connections enjoying (for the time being) comfortable\n quarters (now the Cowles home) on \u201cthe Green.\u201d These facts\n suggest the conclusion that the \u201cPhillip Livingston\u201d of the ancient\n list, page two hundred and two, of the \u201cmembers of the Epis-\n copal Society in Norwalk\u201d may have been of this same family group ;\n and the owner and occupant, consequently, of the Livingston\n mansion which stood towards a hundred years since, in Park Place,\n New York city, and after Mr. Livingston\u2019s death, was purchased by,\n and became the home of Goold Hoyt, of Norwalk, whose benefac-\n tion to this parish has been already mentioned.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mary, daughter of Frederick Phillips, of the afore-mentioned\n distinguished family combination,- married into the family of the\n Hon.

Jacob Jennings\u2019\n sister-in-law (evidently), the widow of Dr. Seth Jennings, married\n John Redfield.

Abigail sold to this brother her\n portion (five and one-lialf acres) of the Roton Hill land inheritance,\n and in the presence of Colonel Thomas Fitch, Jr., deeded to him\n her share of the home heritage. This brother, Eliakim, (vestry-\n man) married, in 1771, Phebe Bouton, to whom several children\n were born. In 1798 the family removed to Troy, N. Y., leaving\n between the covers of St. Paul\u2019s member-register the names of none\n whom the parish has greater cause evermore to hold in honored\n remembrance.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":
