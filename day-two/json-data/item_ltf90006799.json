Again, mysteries tend to\n create religious awe and reverence. Nothing was\n more reverenced by the Jews in their religion than\n the ark not to be touched, and the holy of holies not\n to be entered ; and never is the sun more gazed upon\n and admired than when it labors under an eclipse.\n Again, mysteries tend to the trial and exercise of\n our faith. In the Bible there is light enough to en\u00ac\n lighten believers, yet obscurity enough to try them;\n and, on the other hand, there is obscurity enough to\n blind infidels, yet light enough to leave them with\u00ac\n out excuse. \u201c The word of God,\u201d says an ancient\n writer, \u201c is bread that nourishes some, and a sw\u2019ord\n that pierces others. It is the odor of life to them\n who live by faith, and die sincerely to themselves,\n and it is the odor of death to those who are alienated\n from God, and live shut up in themselves by pride.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6 * \u2022\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0076/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 263, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 449}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0076/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 527, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 898}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0076/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1054, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1797}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0076/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2108, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3594}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0076/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ok/op/en/ed/or/an/al/00/ne/vi/bookopenedoranal00nevi/bookopenedoranal00nevi_0076.jp2", "height": 3594, "width": 2108, "levels": 6, "size": 417284}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"76\">\n<p>\n 66 THE MYSTERIOUSNESS OF THE BIBLE.\n</p>\n<p>\n In it God has so mixed light and shade, that the\n humble and docile find there nothing but truth and\n comfort, whilst the indocile and presumptuous find\n nothing but error and incredulity.

In addition\n to this, an order was issued by the king, making it\n incumbent on all the bishops in the land to inform\n of all such learned men within their several dioceses\n as having special skill in the Hebrew and Greek\n tongues, had taken pains in their private studies tc\n understand and elucidate difficult passages in the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0094/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 263, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 449}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0094/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 527, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 898}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0094/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1054, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1797}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0094/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2108, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3594}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0094/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ok/op/en/ed/or/an/al/00/ne/vi/bookopenedoranal00nevi/bookopenedoranal00nevi_0094.jp2", "height": 3594, "width": 2108, "levels": 6, "size": 514228}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"94\">\n<p>\n 34\n</p>\n<p>\n THE ENGLISH BIBLE.\n</p>\n<p>\n Scriptures, and to charge them to send in their obser\n vations as they might see fit, for the use of the regu\u00ac\n lar translators; so as to bring, as it were, all the learn\u00ac\n ing of the kingdom, so far as it could be of avail in\n the case, to bear on the great and notable under\u00ac\n taking that was now to be commenced.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some delay occurred in entering upon the busi\u00ac\n ness, so that it was not fairly begun before the year\n 160T, and before this time seven of the persons first\n nominated were either dead or had declined acting,\n so as to leave but forty-seven for carrying on the\n translation.

Some\n attribute it to Stephen Langton, archbishop of Can\u00ac\n terbury, in the reigns of John and Henry III., but\n the true author of the invention was Hugo de Sancto\n Caro, commonly called Hugo Cardinalis, because he\n was the first Dominican that ever was raised to the\n degree of cardinal. This Hugo flourished about\n A. D. 1240 : he wrote a comment on the Scriptures,\n and projected the first concordance, which is that of\n the vulgar Latin Bible. The aim of this work being\n for the more easy finding out of any word or passage\n in the Scriptures, he found it necessary to divide the\n book into sections, and the sections into subdivisions,\n for till that time the vulgar Latin Bibles were with\u00ac\n out any division at all. These sections are the chap\u00ac\n ters into which the Bible has ever since been divided,\n but the subdivision of the chapters was not then into\n verses, as it is now. Hugo\u2019s method of subdividing\n them was by the letters, A, B, C, D, E, E, G, placed\n in the margin, at an equal distance from each other^\n according to the length of the chapters.\n</p>\n<p>\n The subdivision of the chapters into verses, as they\n now stand in our Bibles, had its origin from a fa\u00ac\n mous Jewish rabbi, named Mordecai Nathan, about\n 1445.

But though he followed Hugo in\n his division of the books into chapters, he refined upon\n his inventions as to the subdivision, and contrived\n that by verses. This being found to be a much more\n convenient method, it has been ever since followed.\n And thus, as the Jews borrowed the division of the\n books of the Holy Scriptures into chapters from the\n Christians, in like manner the Christians borrowed\n that of the chapters into verses from the Jews.

Very often the chapter\n breaks off in the midst of a narrative , and if the\n reader stops because the chapter ends, he loses the\n connection, as for example, Matt. x. 42. Some\u00ac\n times the break is altogether in the w T rong place, and\n separates two sentences which must be taken to\u00ac\n gether in order to be understood, as, for example,\n 1 Cor. xii. 31. xiii. 1. Again, the verses often di\u00ac\n vide a sentence into two different paragraphs, when\n there ought scarcely to be a comma between them,\n as in Luke iii. 21, 22. And sometimes a fragment\n of a subject is separated from its proper place, and\n put where it is without any connection, (Coloss. iii.\n 25. iv. 1.)

Mr.\n Ames lamented the disuse of the Bible in our schools,\n and thus wrote on this subject: \u201c Should not the\n Bible regain the place it once held as a school book ?\n Its morals are pure, its examples captivating and\n noble. The reverence for the Sacred Book that is\n thus early impressed, lasts long, and probably, if\n not impressed in infancy, never takes firm hold of\n the mind. One consideration more is important.\n In no book is there so good English, so pure, and so\n elegant, and by teaching all the same book, they\n will speak alike, and the Bible will justly remain\n the standard of language, as well as of faith. A\n barbarous provincial jargon will be banished, and\n taste, uncorrupted by pompous Johnsonian affecta\u00ac\n tion, will be restored.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0113/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 265, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 448}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0113/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 531, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 896}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0113/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1062, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1793}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0113/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2124, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3586}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0113/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ok/op/en/ed/or/an/al/00/ne/vi/bookopenedoranal00nevi/bookopenedoranal00nevi_0113.jp2", "height": 3586, "width": 2124, "levels": 6, "size": 313604}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"113\">\n<p>\n TESTIMONY FOR THE BIBLE.\n</p>\n<p>\n 108\n</p>\n<p>\n To a writer in the \u201c Christian Palladium,\u201d who,\n in 1847, made a visit to the Hon.

The Assyrian, the Persian,\n the Grecian, and the Roman empires, are all parti\u00ac\n cularly described under appropriate characters, and\n it is especially declared that the last of them was to\n be divided into ten lesser kingdoms, the time at\n which Christ was to appear is precisely fixed, the\n rise and fall of Antichrist and the duration of his\n power are exactly determined, and the future resto\u00ac\n ration of the Jews, the victory of Christ over all his\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0159/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 265, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 448}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0159/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 531, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 896}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0159/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1062, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1793}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0159/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2124, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3586}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0159/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ok/op/en/ed/or/an/al/00/ne/vi/bookopenedoranal00nevi/bookopenedoranal00nevi_0159.jp2", "height": 3586, "width": 2124, "levels": 6, "size": 455196}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"159\">\n<p>\n THE BOOKS OF THE BIBLE.\n</p>\n<p>\n 149\n</p>\n<p>\n enemies, and the universal prevalence of true reli\u00ac\n gion, are distinctly foretold, as being to precede the\n consummation of that stupendous plan of God, which\n \u201c was laid before the foundation of the world,\u201d and\n reaches to its dissolution.\n</p>\n<p>\n This book abounds with the most exalted senti\u00ac\n ments of piety and devout gratitude; its style is\n clear, simple, and concise, and many of its prophe\u00ac\n cies are delivered in terms so plain and circumstan\u00ac\n tial, that some believers have asserted, in opposition\n to the strongest evidence, that they were written\n after the events which they describe, had taken\n place.\n</p>\n<p>\n REFERENCES IN DANIEi.\n</p>\n<p>\n vii. 10; Rev. v. 11. | ix. 27; Matt. xxiv. 15. | xii. 7; Rev. x. 5.\n</p>\n<p>\n Obadiah.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2022 It is not quite certain when this prophet lived,\n but it is highly probable that he was contemporary\n with Jeremiah and Ezekiel, who denounced the same\n dreadful judgments on the Edomites, as the punish\u00ac\n ment of their pride, violence, and cruel insultings\n over the Jews, after the destruction of their city.\n The prophecy (so Usher) was fulfilled about five\n years after the destruction of Jerusalem.\n</p>\n<p>\n The single chapter of which the book consists, di\u00ac\n vides into two parts\u2014the judgments denounced on\n the Edomites (v. 1-16) the restoration and future\n prosperity of the Jews (v. 17-21).

As the Amorites were\n pre-eminently adorers of the heavenly bodies, it would tend\n to show them how great was the power of the true God against\n those very beings whom they worshipped, if Joshua uttered\n his command as he did, to the objects of their idolatry.

All we are\n told is, that the sun \u201c hasted not to go down for a whole day.\u201d\n The sun slackened its apparent motion, or we may say the\n earth slackened, at the Divine command, its actual motion,\n and thus, though there would be an apparent cessation of the\n motion of the sun, it would be but gradually stayed, and\n stayed only for such a period as, in the exercise of His wis\u00ac\n dom, God thought fit to permit.

It is to be recollected, that, if a man is immor\u00ac\n tal, the death of the body is by no means the greatest calamity\n which can befall him : it is even reasonable to believe, what\n the Scriptures intimate, that death is often a kind dispensa\u00ac\n tion; that, among the wicked, they are sometimes removed\n \u201c in whom there is found some good thing towards the Lord\n God of Israel,\u201d * and that \u201c the righteous is taken away from\n the evil to come.\u201df It were as reasonable then to blaspheme\n the Divine Power which suffered Herculaneum to be over\u00ac\n flowed with burning lava, Lisbon to be swallowed up by an\n earthquake, and the Caribs, and other nations of the West\n Indies, to be exterminated by the Spaniards, and which per\u00ac\n mits thousands of persons to be annually destroyed in Bar\u00ac\n bary and Turkey by the plague, and a third part of the\n human race to perish in infancy, as to revile the Divine Word,\n in which is recorded the destruction of the Canaanites by the\n sword of the children of Israel. Surely, if we would deny\n the God of Scripture for sanctioning the extirpation of a most\n abandoned nation, we must deny the God of nature for per\u00ac\n mitting such multitudes, not only of the wicked, but of the\n good, to perish by war and murder, by shipwreck and famine,\n by the convulsions of nature and the visitations of disease.\n</p>\n<p>\n As to the mode of the punishment in question, it may be\n observed that there was a fitness in making the Israelites the\n instruments, because having witnessed the sufferings of the\n Canaanites, and knowing the cause of them, they would be\n more effectually restrained from imitating their abominable\n practices. Besides, as the people of those ages were affected\n by no proof of the power of the gods which they worshipped,\n so deeply, as by giving them victory in war; there was a pro\u00ac\n priety in ordering that the extermination of the Canaanites,\n</p>\n<p>\n * 1 Kings xiv. 13. t Isa. lvii. 1.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0242/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 263, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 449}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0242/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 527, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 898}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0242/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1054, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1797}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0242/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2108, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3594}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0242/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ok/op/en/ed/or/an/al/00/ne/vi/bookopenedoranal00nevi/bookopenedoranal00nevi_0242.jp2", "height": 3594, "width": 2108, "levels": 6, "size": 273446}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"242\">\n<p>\n *232 DESTRUCTION OF THE CANAANITES.\n</p>\n<p>\n which might have been accomplished by a pestilence, by fire,\n or by earthquakes, should be effected by the Israelites, as\n mere instruments in the hands of a righteous Providence, in*\n asmuch as this was the clearest and most intelligible method\n sf displaying the power and righteousness of the God of\n [srael, his power over the pretended gods of other nations,\n and his righteous hatred of the crimes into which they had\n fallen.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0243/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 265, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 448}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0243/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 531, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 896}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0243/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1062, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1793}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0243/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2124, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3586}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0243/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ok/op/en/ed/or/an/al/00/ne/vi/bookopenedoranal00nevi/bookopenedoranal00nevi_0243.jp2", "height": 3586, "width": 2124, "levels": 6, "size": 405209}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"243\">\n<p>\n DEMONIACAL POSSESSION.\n</p>\n<p>\n Matthew viii. 28, 34.\n</p>\n<p>\n This subject has given rise to much discussion.

And devils\n also came out of many, crying out and saying, Thou art\n Christ the Son of God. \" Now, though common diseases, such\n as palsy, leprosy, and the like, are said to be cleansed and\n healed , when is it, or how could it be said, that they are cast\n out , and that they come out crying and saying anything !\n</p>\n<p>\n In the next place, the language of our Lord was such as to\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0246/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 263, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 449}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0246/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 527, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 898}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0246/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1054, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1797}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0246/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2108, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3594}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0246/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ok/op/en/ed/or/an/al/00/ne/vi/bookopenedoranal00nevi/bookopenedoranal00nevi_0246.jp2", "height": 3594, "width": 2108, "levels": 6, "size": 547555}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"246\">\n<p>\n 236\n</p>\n<p>\n DEMONIACAL POSSESSION.\n</p>\n<p>\n show that demoniacs were not persons merely of disordered\n intellects, but subjects of an alien spiritual might.

The whole religion of societj 7 was\n then in a state of transition, passing from ancient rites, which\n \u2019men saw to be insufficient, to a glorious Gospel which they were\n not prepared to receive; and, hence, they were at sea without\n a chart or compass. 2.

The devils had a particular reason,\n at Christ\u2019s appearance, for exerting their power and malice in\n opposition to the erection and establishment of the kingdom\n of God, and they may have been permitted to do so rn order\n more effectually to display his power and goodness in defeating\n them.

It is our duty not to lean to our own under\u00ac\n standing, but submit to be instructed by God, re\u00ac\n membering that, if Reason were a sufficient guide,\n there would be no need of Revelation. \u201c As new\u00ac\n born babes, desire the sincere milk of the word that\n ye may grow thereby.\u201d \u201c Whosoever shall not re\u00ac\n ceive the kingdom of God as a little child, he shall\n not enter therein.\u201d \u201c God resisteth the proud, but\n giveth grace unto the humble.\u201d \u201c The meek will he\n guide in judgment, and the meek will he teach his\n way.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Bible should be Read as an Inspired Book.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is one thing not to question this, and another,\n and a very different thing, actually and frequently\n to impress the mind with it. I enter not into any\n argument to prove that \u201c holy men of God spake \u201d\n and wrote \u201c as they were moved by the Holy Ghost.\u201d\n I do no more than refer to their profession of being\n inspired, and the sublime and holy truths which they\n uttered, and the mighty miracles which they wrought\n in confirmation of their claim, and the wonderful\n prophecies which their writings contain.

And the\n minister, or learned friend, has most often been obliged to confess ignorance,\n because it is a matter in regard to which the most learned have by no means\n been of one mind. The Targums, and most of the Jewish commentators, give\n to the worcfthe meaning of eternally, for ever. Rabbi Kimcbi regards it as a\n sign to elevate the voice. The authors of the Septuagint translation appear\n to have regarded it as a musical or rythmical note. Herder regards it as indi\u00ac\n cating a change of tone. Matheson thinks it, as a musical note, equivalent,\n perhaps, to the word, repeat. According to Luther and others, it means\n silence. Gesenius explains it to mean\u2014\u201c Let the instruments play and the\n singers stop.\u201d Wocher regards it as equivalent to sursum corda, \u2014 up, my\n j soul! Sommer, after examining all the seventy-four passages in which the\n word occurs, recognises in every case \u201can actual appeal or summons to\n Jehovah. They are calls for aid and prayers to be heard, expressed either\n with entire directness, or if not in the imperative, \u2018 Hear, Jehovah! or, awake\n Jehovah!\u2019 and the like, still earnest addresses to God that he would remem\u00ac\n ber and hear,\u201d & c. The word itself he regards as indicating a blast of trumpets\n by the priests. Selah, itself, he thinks an abridged expression used for Hig- :\n gaion Selah \u2014 Higgaion indicating the sound of the stringed instrument!, 1\n and Selah a vigorous blast of trumpets.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0289/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 265, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 448}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0289/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 531, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 896}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0289/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1062, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1793}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0289/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2124, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3586}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0289/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ok/op/en/ed/or/an/al/00/ne/vi/bookopenedoranal00nevi/bookopenedoranal00nevi_0289.jp2", "height": 3586, "width": 2124, "levels": 6, "size": 475718}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"289\">\n<p>\n Krtj to tjit ^rnmisM.\n</p>\n<p>\n Isa. liv. 11.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ps. xxxiv. 19.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 Cor. iii. 21, & c.\n Rom. viii. 28.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ps. xci. 11.\n</p>\n<p>\n Zech. xi. 8.\n</p>\n<p>\n Matt. xxi. 22\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2014 viii. 7.\n John xvi. 24.\n James ii. 5.\n John xvi. 23.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2014 xv. 7.\n</p>\n<p>\n Matt. xv. 8.\n</p>\n<p>\n Rev. xxii. 17.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2014 xxi. 6.\n</p>\n<p>\n Jer. iii. 12.\n</p>\n<p>\n - 22 .\n</p>\n<p>\n Hos. xiv. 4.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2 Chron. xx. 20.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 Pet. ii. 6.\n</p>\n<p>\n John vii. 38.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2014 vi. 47.\n</p>\n<p>\n IIos. ii. 19.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ps. xxxiv. 18.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2014 cxlvii. 3.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2014 Ii. 17.\n</p>\n<p>\n Isa. xlii. 3.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ps. lv. 22.\n</p>\n<p>\n Isa.

th. < * grace\n of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n For if after they have escaped the pollutions\n of the world through the knowledge of the\n Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ,they are again\n entangled therein and overcome, the latter\n end is worse with them than the begin\u00ac\n ning.\n</p>\n<p>\n For such as turn aside unto their crooked !\n ways, the Lord shall lead them forth with j\n the worker ' s of iniquity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Wherefore let him that thinketh he standeth [\n take heed lest he fall.\n</p>\n<p>\n Beware lest any man spoil you through phi\u00ac\n losophy and vain deceit.\n</p>\n<p>\n The blasphemy against the Holy Ghost shall\n not be forgiven.\n</p>\n<p>\n Behold, the Lord cometh with ten thousand of\n his saints, to execute judgment upon all, and\n to convince all that are ungodly among them\n of all their ungodly deeds which they have\n ungodly committed, and of all their hard\n speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken\n against him.\n</p>\n<p>\n Take heed, and beware of covetousness.\n</p>\n<p>\n For this know, that no whoremongers, Ac., nor\n covetous man, who is an idolater, hath any\n inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of\n God.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mortify therefore your members which are\n upon the earth; fornication, Ac., and covet\u00ac\n ousness, which is idolatry: for which things\u2019\n sake the wrath of God cometh on the chil\u00ac\n dren of disobedience.\n</p>\n<p>\n Your gold and silver is cankered, and the rust\n of them shall be a witness against you, and\n shall eat your flesh as it were fire; ye have\n heaped treasure together for the last days.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Lord Jesus shall be revealed from heaven\n with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, tak\u00ac\n ing vengeance on them that know not God,\n and that obey not the gospel of our Lord\n Jesus Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n For if the word spoken by angels was steadfast,\n and every transgression and disobedience re\u00ac\n ceived a just recompense of reward, how shall\n we escape, if we neglect so great salvation ?\n</p>\n<p>\n See that ye refuse not him that speaketh. For\n if they escaped not who refused him that\n spake on earth, much more shall not we\n escape, if we turn away from him that speak\u00ac\n eth from heaven.\n</p>\n<p>\n For the time is come that judgment must be\u00ac\n gin at the house of God: and if it first begin I\n at us, what shall the end be of those that I\n obey not the gospel of God ?\n</p>\n<p>\n 25\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0300/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 263, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 449}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0300/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 527, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 898}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0300/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1054, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1797}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0300/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2108, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3594}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:op:en:ed:or:an:al:00:ne:vi:bookopenedoranal00nevi:bookopenedoranal00nevi_0300/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ok/op/en/ed/or/an/al/00/ne/vi/bookopenedoranal00nevi/bookopenedoranal00nevi_0300.jp2", "height": 3594, "width": 2108, "levels": 6, "size": 538125}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"300\">\n<p>\n 290 THREATENINGS AND WARNINGS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Deut. xxv.13-16, l Dishonest.\n</p>\n<p>\n Prov. xi. 1.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2014 xx. 23.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2014 xxiii.31,32.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 Cor. vi. 10.\n Gal. v. 20, 21.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 Cor. vi. 10.\n Matt. xv. 14.\n Gal. i. 9.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2 John 9,10.\n</p>\n<p>\n Isaiah viii. 20.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mark iv. 24.\n Luke viii. 18.\n James i. 22.\n</p>\n<p>\n Job viii. 13.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2014 xxxvi. 13.\n Psa. xcvii. 7.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 Cor. x. 14.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 John v. 21.\n Luke xiii. 3.\n Rom. ii. 4, 5.\n</p>\n<p>\n Rev. ii. 5.\n</p>\n<p>\n Prov. xix. 9.\n Rev. xxi. 8.*\n</p>\n<p>\n Drunkards.\n</p>\n<p>\n Extortioners.\n False Teachers.\n</p>\n<p>\n Hearers.\n</p>\n<p>\n Hypocrites.\n</p>\n<p>\n Idolaters.\n</p>\n<p>\n Impenitent.\n</p>\n<p>\n Liars.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thou shalt not have in thy hag divers weights,\n a great and a small, & c.; for all that do such\n things, and all that do unrighteously, are\n an abomination unto the Lord thy God.\n</p>\n<p>\n A false balance is an abomination to the Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n Divers weights are an abomination unto the\n Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n Look not thou upon t he wine when it is red,\n when it giveth its color in the cup, when it\n moveth itself aright.

The Normal Question Book was prepared by an experienced\n teacher.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The questions were selected from the examination papers pre\u00ac\n pared for the examination of teachers in the several states.

It is a valuable book not only for teachers, but for everybody.\n Please read the following notice for proof of this statement: \u201c Hav\u00ac\n ing become possessor of a copy of The Normal Question Book, 1\n am pleased with the same. All who examine the work seem de\u00ac\n lighted with it, even persons who are not teaching and do not in\u00ac\n tend to teach.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. It is a work of great assistance to teachers in preparing ques\u00ac\n tions for reviews. Thousands of teachers are now using this book\n with wonderful success in their schools. Many have adopted it as a\n text-book. Many county superintendents use it in their institutes in\n preparing teachers for examination, and the results accomplished by\n its use are truly wonderful.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6.

Cite them to text-books, authors or per\u00ac\n sons within your knowledge where they will probably obtain the desired informa\u00ac\n tion; iu no case should you give the desired information direct to the individual;\n but should the.school as a body not be able to answer a question satisfactorily, then\n will be the time to help it out of the dilemma by gradually and pleasantly leading\n</p>\n<p>\n the school to see and know the why and wherefore of the subject under\n</p>\n<p>\n consideration.\n</p>\n<p>\n Object of Queer Queries:\n</p>\n<p>\n 1st. To lessen the care of the teacher and make the school more attractive for\n the pupils by adding spice to at least one exercise for the week. ( The last day ' 6\n work should be the most pleasant).\n</p>\n<p>\n 2nd. To form habits of close observation in the growing pupil, and in forming\n these habits which will cling to him through life , give him a fund of information\n which will well repay for all the trouble and time which such a plan imposes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Order a supply at once for your school.

Rules for distinguishing\n the different parts of speech in difficult cases, an explanation of the\n construction of Infinitives and Participles and the relative Pronoun.\n In short, a showing up, in convenient form, of the difficult points in\n Grammar besides the rules of Syntax, explanations and models for\n diagramming sentences and other matter, all of which every teach\u00ac\n er who knows anything about teaching Grammar will recognize at\n once as the most convenient thing imaginable to have in connection\n with the exercise book for use in the preparations of lessons. No\n one but the live teacher of Grammar knows the time and labor re\u00ac\n quired in putting these forms and models on the board from day to\n day. The book is by no means a treatise on Grammar, but is sim\u00ac\n ply matter arranged for the convenience of the pupil to save the\n time of the teacher. Normal teachers will want this little book in\n their schools at once and all who have had, or are having trouble in\n teaching Grammar would do well to adopt it also. It ought to be\n in use in every Grammar class in the land. W hy ?\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. Because by its use you can secure regularity and order in the\n preparation of parsing lessons and steer clear of the old haphazard\n hit or miss style of recitation which makes Grammar \u201cso dull and\n uninteresting.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. It cultivates systematic habits, is a drill in punctuation, pen\u00ac\n manship and neatness, and gives pupils something to do.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The use of written lessons gives great life and interest to the\n recitation through the comparisons, criticisms, & c.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. By having the exercises corrected each day where mistakes\n have been made, the pupil has his work preserved to him in perma\u00ac\n nent form, for future reference.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Good teachers do not pretend to teach parsing, analysis, & c.,\n in any other way than by the use of written lessons to avoid waste\n of time, secure promptness and certainty of preparation. And all\n will prefer the Parsing Book from the fact that it is sold far cheaper\n than the blank paper can be bought at book stores. When these\n points are taken into consideration all must favor the immediate\n adoption of the book. Retail price 20c per copy.\n</p>\n<p>\n Samples to teachers for examination, with a view to introduction\n into schools, 15c\n</p>\n<p>\n Introductory rates by the quantity; 6 copies for $1: 12 copies,\n $1.75.
