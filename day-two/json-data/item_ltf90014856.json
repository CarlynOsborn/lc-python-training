In explaining that great law of\n the new covenant, that God who is a Spirit, must be\n worshipped in spirit and in truth, we have adverted to\n the comparison so evidently instituted by Jesus Christ,\n when he pronounced the law in question, between the\n spiritual and substantial worship thus enjoined on his\n own followers, and that which was customary among\n the ancient Samaritans and Jews. The two systems\n of worship are described as completely distinct; the\n one was about to die away, the other to be established.\n The old worship consisted principally in the perform\u00ac\n ance of typical rites. The new worship was of a pre\u00ac\n cisely opposite character. The ordinance was to cease;\n the shadow was to be discontinued; the substance was\n to be enjoyed; and, in the total disuse of ancient cere\u00ac\n monial ordinances, communion was now to take place\n between the Father and the souls of his people, only\n through the mediation of Jesus Christ, and under the\n direct influences of the Spirit of truth. On the sup\u00ac\n position, therefore, that water-baptism and the Euchar\u00ac\n ist were not of Jewish origin, yet, being shadows and\n types, and nothing more, they perfectly resemble the\n ordinances of the law, and plainly appertain to the\n principle of the old covenant.

Those who would\n prove, that to \u201cbe born of water\u201d in this passage,\n literally signifies to be outwardly baptized , defeat their\n own purposes by attempting to prove too much. If\n the possibility of an entrance into the kingdom of\n heaven, which a multitude of moral sins does not pre\u00ac\n clude, is precludedl^y the infraction of a merely posi\u00ac\n tive precept, and by the omission of a rite in itself in\u00ac\n different, it may almost be asserted that the system of\n Christianity is overturned, and that the gospel falls to\n the ground. To impose on an obscure and ambiguous\n expression a sense which thus contradicts so many\n general declarations made by the sacred writers, and\n which is directly opposed to the fundamental doctrines\n of the New Testament, is obviously very inconsistent\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ba:pt:is:ms:up:pe:rd:is:00:gu:rn:baptismsupperdis00gurn:baptismsupperdis00gurn_0036/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 231, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 347}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ba:pt:is:ms:up:pe:rd:is:00:gu:rn:baptismsupperdis00gurn:baptismsupperdis00gurn_0036/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 462, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 694}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ba:pt:is:ms:up:pe:rd:is:00:gu:rn:baptismsupperdis00gurn:baptismsupperdis00gurn_0036/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 925, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1388}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ba:pt:is:ms:up:pe:rd:is:00:gu:rn:baptismsupperdis00gurn:baptismsupperdis00gurn_0036/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1850, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2776}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ba:pt:is:ms:up:pe:rd:is:00:gu:rn:baptismsupperdis00gurn:baptismsupperdis00gurn_0036/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ba/pt/is/ms/up/pe/rd/is/00/gu/rn/baptismsupperdis00gurn/baptismsupperdis00gurn_0036.jp2", "height": 2776, "width": 1850, "levels": 6, "size": 297461}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"36\">\n<p>\n 30 ON TI1E DISUSE OF ALL TYPICAL RITES\n</p>\n<p>\n with the laws of a just and comprehensive criticism.\n Nothing, one would think, but absolute necessity,\n would compel any reasonable critic to the adoption of\n such an alternative.\n</p>\n<p>\n But, in point of fact, the expressions thus employed\n by Jesus are capable of being otherwise interpreted\n with the greatest propriety.
