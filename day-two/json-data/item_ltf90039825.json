The mission of the followers of art\n is to give pleasure, perhaps instruction, per '\n haps example, but certainly pleasure. Ap-\n plause follows successful effort, fame follows\n applause and dollars follow fame. But over\n and beycnd this, a cherished possession, when\n attained by the artist, is, the compensation\n of an affection bestowed by the public to\n which pleasure is given, peculiar in its kind\n and degree. It differs from the gratitude of-\n fered the public benefactor, or the respect\n accorded the public servant deserving well of\n his country, or the admiration given him who,\n representing us as a nation, has brought us\n glory. Mixed with this affection is a kind-\n ly, tender sentiment such as we give to chil-\n dren. Especially is this so with singers\n end actors with whose personalities the pub-\n lic comes into actual contact and who prac-\n tice their art before the eyes of the public.\n</p>\n<p>\n It has been and is the fortune of Joseph\n Jefferson to enjoy this peculiar affection in\n a degree possessed by no other stage fa-\n vorite. Indeed, it has taken a form of ex-\n pression singular in this case and not ex-\n perienced by others. In addition to the\n crowded houses, the abundant applause and\n the social attentions common to all who have\n attained distinction, his progress through\n the country is almost triumphal, and he is\n solicited to attend local events as a dis-\n tinguished light to make addresses and in\n nearly every city he visits he is besought to\n appear at institutions of learning, presented\n as the first exemplar of the art dramatic of\n the age. And in it is tribute to his life quite\n as much as to his art.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Jefferson\u2019s career on the stage has\n been long. During the month next to come\n he will reach his seventy-second year. Some\n years ago when before a legislative commit-\n tee at Albany with reference to a bill regu-\n lating the performance of children on the\n stage, he presented himself as a specimen of\n a developed stage child, saying that he had\n made his first appearance on the stage at\n the tender age of three years, and had been\n on the stage continuously since. His career,\n therefore, covers a peTiod of sixty-nine years,\n certainly remarkable for its length and with-\n out parallel.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Jefferson was in fact born to the stage.\n He comes of a long and unbroken line of\n actors. In the year 1749 Thomas Jefferson\n</p>\n<p>\n was a comedian of rank at the old Drury\n Lane Theater of London, and subsequently\n manager of a playhouse in Richmond, Eng-\n land. This Thomas Jefferson was the son,\n if not the grandson, of an actor, and it was\n a son of this Thomas who established the\n line of Jeffersons in this country. His name\n was Joseph, and he came to this country at\n the age of 21, arriving one year before that\n</p>\n<p>\n Joseph Jefferson.\n</p>\n<p>\n mighty instrument of another Jefferson de-\n clared the separation of the colonies from\n the mother country. Appearing first in pub-\n lic in Boston and subsequently in Newt York,\n this Joseph Jefferson finally settled in Phila-\n delphia, where he won a fame very similar\n to that enjoyed by his grandson of our day.\n Like that grandson he was a comedian.\n</p>\n<p>\n The father of our Joseph, also named Jos-\n eph, was an actor, though he attained only\n a respectable place as personator of old men\n and indeed died at the comparatively early\n age of 38, when our Joseph was 13. Since\n there is a son of our Joseph of the same name\n on the stage at present there have been four\n generations of Joseph Jeffersons before the\n public of America since 1795. The record is\n without parallel in the annals of the stage of\n America.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Jefferson has been in the possession of\n</p>\n<p>\n a great fame so many years that there are\n thousands of men conspicuous and potent in\n the affairs of our times who cannot recall\n the time -when he w ' as not a distinguished\n figure. His fame was as great in the later\n 60s as it is to-day, though not so wide, and it\n is noteworthy that this supreme recognition\n was obtained in the performance of a single\n part, that of Rip Van Winkle. Yet before\n he essayed this famous creation of Irving\n he was not without standing and recognition.\n In a long apprenticeship and from early years\n he had impressed himself upon the theater-\n going public of the cities of the South and of\n the larger cities of ' Washington, Baltimore\n and Philadelphia. Those were the days of\n the fully equipped stock theater. There were\n stars to be sure, but not so many as when\n later Mr. Jefferson became one of the first\n magnitude. But the combination troupe, de-\n voting its energies to a single play, had not\n then been invented and changes of bill were\n frequent. Each section of the country had\n its own particular favorite. There was Bur-\n ton in New York, Warren in Boston, John E.\n Owens in Baltimore and De Bar in the West.\n \u201cThere were giants in those days.\u201d And with\n these men Mr. Jefferson had to contend and\n in the same round of parts. Yet by the time\n he was 25 he had taken his stand in their\n rank in such parts as Newman Noggs in\n \" Nicholas Nickclby,\u201d Dr. Pangloss in \u201cThe\n Heir at Law,\u201d Dr. Ollapod in \u201cThe Poor\n Gentleman,\u201d Caleb Plummer in \u201cThe Cricket\n on the Hearth,\u201d and Bob Acres in \u201cThe\n Rivals.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In the years after Mr. Jefferson had won\n his secure fame in Rip Van Winkle he re-\n turned to those successes of his youth, Ca-\n leb Plummer and Bob Acres. There may\n have been and there doubtless was a surer\n skill, a greater precision of touch and a\n deepened mellowness in the art with which\n he invested those characters in these later\n days, but the methods employed by him in\n bis youth were the same. That ease and\n simplicity, that absence of traditional man-\n nerism, that freshness and spontaneity\n which has been so abundantly praised in\n these later years marked his performance\n of the parts in his younger days and differ-\n entiated it from that of his contemporaries\n of that time. This is to say that Mr. Jeffer-\n son has always been the artist he is to-day\n so widely recognized to be. We are accus-\n tomed to regard Mr. Jefferson as the last\n survivor of the old school of acting.

It is nearer the exact truth to say,\n however, that he was the precursor \u2014 the\n herald of the art that possesses the stage of\n this day and that he has lived long enough\n to see the art from the trammels of which he\n escaped pass away and his own to become the\n modern school. That he was the originator\n of the school cannot be said in the face\n of the statement already made that the\n methods employed by him were the same\n that characterized the art of his grandfather.\n Nor when he began their practice was he the\n sole exponent of these methods. There was\n on the stage a young man, his stepbrother,\n Charles Burke, who greatly influenced him in\n his early years. This young man, who died\n too young for his fame, who w ' as a genius\n whose memory and that of his art was long\n carried in the minds of old theatergoers and\n old actors, was a conspicuous instance of\n the natural school of acting in defiance of\n the old traditions. He preceded Mr. Jef-\n ferson, who has never failed to acknowledge\n his influence. But the stepbrother did not\n make an artist of Mr. Jefferson, nature did\n that, for his intuitions, tastes, inclinations\n and temperament w r ere all in the direction\n of art. The influence of the stepbrother\n may have been directory, it was not\n molding. The natural expressions of his\n mind are through artistic channels. Gifted\n with a keen intellect, a high degree of intel-\n ligence, vigorous in its comprehension and\n grasp, not \u2022without a strong philosophical\n cast, reflective and imitative, it is yet in all\n its parts attuned and, indeed, instinctively\n to the principles of art. Whatever else Mr.\n Jefferson may be he is first and always the\n artist. It Is this quality with perfection in\n its practice on his chosen lines that has lift-\n ed him to the exceptional position he occu-\n pies to-day. Others may have excited\n greater laughter or struck a deeper note of\n pathos, but none has given us in the range\n of comedy such exquisite art. Here he\n stands pre-eminent and unapproachable.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Jefferson ' s career as a stock actor\n practically ended in 1859. When in 1857 he\n became a member of that extraordinary band\n of players gathered by Miss Laura Keene,\n which included such names as William\n Rufus Blake, George Jordan, Edward A.\n Sothera, Charles W. Couldock, John H. Stod-\n dart, Dion Boucicault and his wife he had\n reached the height of his growth as a stock\n actor. When amid such surroundings he\n had so maintained himself in the practice of\n his art that he was the most conspicuous\n member in the group of artists there was no\n future for him as a stock actor than in a\n repetition of a success he had already se-\n cured. Destiny seems to have played her\n part here. His health failed him in 1859, if,\n in fact, it could be said that up to this time\n he had ever known what really good health\n was. He sought under the advice of his\n physician a long sea voyage which ended in\n Australia in 1860. The dividing line in his\n life may be drawn at this year. Previous to\n that time he had been a man of many parts;\n subsequent thereto he was to be one of few.\n Theretofore he had demonstrated a versa-\n tility and a many sidedness, playing innum-\n erable and often widely contrasted charac-\n ters and with almost uniform success and\n applause which as the years rolled by he was\n to lose the repute of in a belief not unnat-\n ural under the circumstances, that he was\n one of limited power in characterization.\n Before 1860 the whole field of Shakspearean,\n classical and modern comedy had been his\n field; after that year he was not to be seen\n in more than five. Rip Van Winkle, Caleb\n Plummer, Bob Acres, Dr. Pangloss and Go-\n</p>\n<p>\n lightly in the farce, \u201cLend Me Five Shil-\n lings.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n One of these alone, Rip, was destined to\n lift him to the highest fame and to result-\n ing wealth. Mr. Jefferson was not as is\n commonly believed, the original player of this\n part. An old dramatic version had been in\n existence almost from the day Washington\n Irving told the story. It had frequently\n been played by James H. Hackett, the\n famous Falstaff of his day and by Charles\n Burke, Jefferson\u2019s stepbrother. For years\n its representation had been a dream with\n Mr. Jefferson and he had studied it in his\n leisure hours without opportunity to play it\n presenting itself. Arriving in Australia he\n was seized upon by the manager of the day\n as the needed novelty and he thought of his\n loved Rip Van Winkle, which he had never\n been able to play. He was counseled against\n presenting a play so distinctly American\n and advised to present himself in one of the\n characters of a standard play. But he was\n insistent and the result was a marked tri-\n umph, so great that his stay in Australia was\n prolonged to five years. It was the old\n stage version that he had presented \u2014 a ver-\n sion far from good.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was in London, whither he went from\n Australia in 1865, that he fell in with Dion\n Boucicault, who advised him to have the\n play reconstructed and who in fact did re-\n write the play in the shape it has been\n seen by hundreds of thousands since. In\n tbis new version Mr. Jefferson appeared in\n London with a success that was a precursor\n of that to follow in the United Spates when\n he arrived home the following year. That\n was thirty-four years ago and if since a sea-\n son has passed that Mr. Jefferson has not\n appeared in it it cannot now be called to\n mind. During the greater part of that time\n more people have crowded the houses in\n which it has been produced than any other\n play known. The statement that more peo-\n ple have seen the performance of Rip Van\n Winkle than any other play known to the\n boards is probably very near the truth. If\n there is an exception it is probably that of\n Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin, which has been on the\n stage some years longer.\n</p>\n<p>\n Rip has been the medium through which\n Mr. Jefferson has attained his wide and pe-\n culiar recognition. His performance of the\n other characters named, Bob Acres, Dr.\n Pangloss, Caleb Plummer and Golightly, while\n they have not detracted from his fame, in\n fact in the minds of the critical and severe\n few have lifted it, yet in the general estima-\n tion have not contributed to it. The vitality\n of the representation is astonishing. In 1866\n it was settled that Mr. Jefferson\u2019s perform-\n ance of Rip was the most artistic of the\n dramatic efforts of the day. That judgment\n has not been reversed at this writing thirty-\n four years later. A literature has gathered\n about his rendition of the character greater\n than has grown up about the work of any\n other actor of this or any previous time. In-\n deed the unique position has been attained\n when his effort has passed beyond the pale\n of controversy and criticism. That Mr. Jef-\n ferson\u2019s delineation of the character is very\n great, that it is most artistic, and that it is\n no longer subject to criticism seems to be\n irrevocably settled.\n</p>\n<p>\n The time was, less now than in former\n years, when there was a disposition to at-\n tribute his indisputable success more to his\n personality than to his art. That his per-\n sonality is most charming, that it has aided\n in establishing his wide popularity and that\n it has drawn to him hosts of friends from\n those ranks of men and women from which\n ail of us could wish to take our friends is\n</p>\n<p>\n no doubt true. No doubt some of that qual-\n ity which has ever made him a delightful\n companion and a cherished and trusted friend\n has crept into his work. The man is the\n instrument of the actor, and we may admire\n the violin as we listen to the sweet tones\n the master elicits from it. But that his per-\n sonality, agreeable and charming as it may\n be, wholly accounts for the triumphial pro-\n cession of the years of his active dramatic\n life cannot be accepted. His attained posi-\n tion rests upon a solid foundation of a fine\n and perfect art, illumined and worked by in-\n tellectual powers, which justifies the fame\n and distinction he enjoys and which will con-\n tinue to be one of the cherished possessions\n of the American stage when he shall have\n passed from it forever.\n</p>\n<p>\n A complaint has not infrequently been\n made that Mr. Jefferson has done little in\n his long career to advance American dra-\n matic art. It must be admitted by his most\n ardent admirers that beyond contributing his\n own personal art, developed and perfected in\n his own country, to the history of our stage,\n he has done nothing. And for that contri-\n bution he has been rewarded by unstinted\n applause, unbounded fame and abundant\n riches. In the range of the characters pre-\n sented by him there has been one only that\n can by any ingenuity be tortured into the\n American and that is of the Catskill legend.\n No budding dramatic author of America has\n been developed by him, nor any who can be\n said to have arrived has been encouraged\n by him. Many years ago it came to be well\n understood that it was useless to send him\n a manuscript for consideration. He has him-\n self said recently that he had been petted\n by the. public so many years on the lines on\n which he traveled that he could not under-\n take to go to the risk of a criticism of a\n new endeavor. His friends and apologists\n have contended that there was no use of\n trying anything new since the old filled all\n the requirements and that the public would\n not permit him to abandon his old and tried\n parts. Without approving or condemning a\n course which has unquestionably avoided the\n risk of pecuniary loss and adhered closely to\n that which has been most remunerative, th9\n regret can be sincerely expressed that an\n art so exquisite, a power so great, and an\n experience so rich, could not have been wit-\n nessed in a wide round of characters delin-\n eative of American character and civilization\n and that in the gallery of our stage there\n could not have been hung among those\n Owens, Chanfrau, Florence, Mayo, Raymond,\n Crane and others have attempted with greater\n or less success, some drawn by Mr. Jeffer-\n son\u2019s master hand.\n</p>\n<p>\n One picture he has contributed which will\n be immortal and that is Rip Van Winkle.\n It will live on canvas and in stone long after\n it exists only in tradition. He has also con-\n tributed to the traditions of the stage a con-\n sistent art life, an upright and blameless\n life in public and in private, which, while it\n has given him personal respect, has brought\n its measure of respect for the profession of\n which he has been an ornament.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Jefferson has a side -which is little\n known to the public and which, while he\n has not sought to conceal it, he has been at\n no pains to exploit, and that is as a painter.\n In the pursuit of this branch of art he has\n attained a degree of excellence which would\n have given him a high place had he devoted\n himself exclusively to it. He has also made\n a single excursion into literature \u2014 his auto-\n biography \u2014 and in doing so has made a most\n charming addition to our literature which\n having we would be loth to part with..\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0007/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 348, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 496}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0007/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 697, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 992}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0007/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1394, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1985}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0007/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2788, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3971}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0007/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0007.jp2", "height": 3971, "width": 2788, "levels": 6, "size": 791992}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"7\">\n<p>\n Richard Mansfield.\n</p>\n<p>\n A REPRESENTATIVE AMERICAN ACTOR : : HIS\n CONCEPTIONS OF ART, AND SOME OF HIS FAULTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n T HE TIME Is not so long ago in this\n wagging world of ours that record of\n it cannot be found, when the posses-\n sion of sterling qualities of mind was denied\n the actor \u2014 when the exercise of rational intel-\n lectual process in the practice of his art was\n far from being conceded. In public esteem\n the qualities, displayed were more entertain-\n ing than admirable, more agreeable than re-\n spect-inspiring, for the actor was regarded\n as one apart, deficient In those senses which,\n possessed, would have set him on proper\n and respectable lines \u2014 that is to say, those\n of convention. In short, he was thought to\n have such an eccentric and abnormal twist as\n removed him but a step from \u201ca natural.\u201d\n His position was lowly, and everybody\u2014 the\n man who tilled the soil, bartered and sold,\n handled money, wielded a sword, hammered\n out tools \u2014 all were accorded a respect, not\n alone for mental attributes, but for character\n that was withheld from him who contributed\n to the interest and amusement of the world\n in its hours of relaxation. The actor was\n taken seriously only by himself. Little dif-\n ference was made in the general mind be-\n tween him who juggled balls and sang funny\n songs on a carpet spread on the village green\n and the other, who, on the boards of an\n equipped stage, took captive the imaginations\n of his auditors and lifted them into realms\n of thought and emotion to which, without his\n aid, they would have been strangers. All\n were mimes, differing only in degree and that\n degree was established not by discrimination,\n but by environment \u2014 regarded with plainly\n expressed, if kindly and good natured, con-\n tempt. In this he stood, on a lower plane,\n to be sure, with his cousins in art, the poets,\n authors, musicians and the artists. On the\n one side he was bitterly denounced as a ser-\n vant and instrument of the devil and on\n the other good naturedly and contemptuous-\n ly tolerated.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is something of this left in this day,\n less of bigoted denunciation than of con-\n temptuous toleration. Within a generation\n good and well meaning people have hid as a\n disgrace the fact that members of their\n families have adopted the stage as a pursuit.\n Once in much vogue was a practice, passing\n away rapidly now, and obtaining in no other\n walk of life, whereby the actor hid his birth\n and connection under a nom du theatre. Some-\n times it was an effort to escape a cognomen\n the reverse of euphonious, as in the case\n of Irving, who shed the unromantic name\n of Broadrib, but as a rule the assumption\n was a concession to family pride: In this\n abandonment of the practice is evidence of\n the recognition of the standing that the actor\n has finally secured. Recognition has come,\n</p>\n<p>\n not so much through an improvement in the\n practice of the art, progressive as that has\n been, or in the advancement in character and\n morals of the persons engaged therein, as\n through the broadening effects of wider edu-\n cation and higher culture of the world bring-\n ing about a realization of the value of the\n influence of true art and a comprehension of\n its mission.\n</p>\n<p>\n The prizes in fame and material prosperity\n for those reaching the higher stations in\n their pursuit were never so great as now,\n but the real triumph secured is not in indi-\n vidual achievement, but in that recognition,\n respectful and considerate, given to all fol-\n lowers of the dramatic art. That unusual\n qualities of mind must be possessed by him\n who wins a place on the stage, and that\n those qualities must be trained, disciplined\n and educated into a skill to be measured by\n a high standard, is now generally conceded.\n Intelligence and culture is now pre-supposed,\n and that respect and admiration ever ac-\n corded to intellect has followed. If the dra-\n matic art has not reached the plane of the\n learned professions it is within hailing dis-\n tance; if it never will reach that plane it\n will be because of its peculiarity that no\n permanent record can be made \u2014 that its deeds\n are \" writ in water\u201d and can live in tradition\n only. But if this is so the actor has his\n own advantages. He comes into actual con-\n tact with his public, and his triumphs are ad-\n mired in the presence and under the acclaims\n of his admirers. This condition, in which he\n is in singular enjoyment, results in an active\n interest in himself. His personality is im-\n pressed on hi3 public and there is a curiosity\n about him, his life, his doings, his plans,\n that is consistent and continuous. No man\n on the American stage to-day enjoys this in-\n terest and curiosity to a greater degree or\n has a stronger hold on his public than has\n Richard Mansfield.\n</p>\n<p>\n With M\u2122. Joseph Jefferson Mr. Mansfield\n divides the leadership of the American stage.\n They are not in the same field, and there is,\n in fact, no rivalry between them; their orbits\n lie far apart and a generation or more marks\n the difference of their ages. Mr. Jefferson\n is of the old school of dramatic art, and its\n best, if not its only, exponent. Mr. Mansfield\n is distinctly of the new school, and assuredly\n its best exponent. That there is mention of\n leadership is due solely to the fact that the\n two artists stand out in advance so far from\n all others that they are conspicuously alone,\n and their leadership is observed of all who\n may look.\n</p>\n<p>\n The place Mr. Mansfield occupies is not an\n inheritance, nor a gift, nor the result of step-\n ping into the shoes of a predecessor. No\n</p>\n<p>\n mantle descended to him. With new meth-\n ods, with original processes, indifferent to\n traditions, he walked in and took his place.\n His recognition as a singular and superior\n artist was not slow, neither was it instan-\n taneous. He is to-day what he was fifteen\n years ago, only more skilled in his art, more\n precise and skillful of touch, broader, deeper\n and more mellow, but his methods and pro-\n cesses are the same. Whether his art be con-\n demned as a few seek to condemn, or is com-\n mended as the many do commend, it must be\n admitted that hi3 success has been continu-\n ous and consistent, and that in all parts of\n the country he has a following essentially\n his own. There is not a local manager in\n the country who will not tell you that Mr.\n Mansfield draws to the theater those who are\n never seen at any other time, and that they\n are of the more cultured. This support has\n been unbroken in the years that have elapsed\n since he was first recognized, and that it is\n not dependent entirely on the play he pre-\n sents is seen in the fact that the attendance\n is the same whether it is a new and unknown\n drama or a round of his old parts. Devotion\n to the actor and his art Is the manifestatien\n With a single exception Mr. Mansfield is\n the most intellectual actor of the day. His\n mind is energetic and enterprising; strong\n and vigorous in its processes; his powers of\n analysis and deduction something remark-\n able. Those who have stood in relation to\n him close enough to see him at work report\n that his grasp of a new play presented to\n him, his rapid absorption of it, his complete\n analysis of it is truly wonderful, and that its\n first reading is sufficient on which to base\n judgment of it and action as to it. His judg-\n ment of a play in the manuscript is rarely at\n fault. He has been known to say of an un-\n tried play: \" This play ought to be acceptable\n because of its merits. I doubt, however, if\n it will prove so to the public; but that is no\n reason why it should not be produced.\u201d It\n was under such circumstances that Bernard\n Shaw\u2019s \u201cArms and the Man\u201d was presented,\n the cynicism of which so puzzled the astute\n critics of the day, and which is yet in his\n repertoire. When he produced \u201cThe Devil\u2019s\n Disciple,\u201d by the same author, he pro-\n nounced it a trifling thing which would\n doubtless catch popular favor for a time, since\n it was a smart quip only, and experience jus-\n tified his judgment. His synthetical powers\n are equal to his analytical and he builds and\n puts together as easily as he takes apart. It\n is his possession of these two opposing quali-\n ties controlled and guided by taste, judgment\n and masterfulness, that makes him the rare\n stage director he is.

In this division of labor he\n ' displays a capacity for leadership, for control\n v and an executive quality which is seen in him\n nowhere else. It begins and ends with the\n stage. Arguing from his results it might be\n supposed that he could accomplish similar\n results in other relations of life. But that\n executive quality seems to depart when he\n lays down the baton of the conductor. The\n explanation lies in the fact that on the stage\n at rehearsal he is the artist on his own do-\n main, performing artistic work with all his\n artistic qualities in play. And at such times\n all considerations other than those of artistic\n results are lost sight of. It is reported that\n on such occasions he is a particularly disa-\n greeable person, forceful, arrogant, domineer-\n ing, intolerant of suggestion and opposition,\n impatient of dullness of comprehension, ex-\n citable, sarcastic, and, as an actor who was in\n his company for some seasons once said, \u201cso\n devilish that if you did not know it was all\n through his earnestness in getting at a result\n you would want to knock him down once\n every minute.\u201d \u201cHe is a whirlwind in the be-\n ginning,\u201d said another, \u201cand he only simmers\n down when things begin to be licked into\n shape to his satisfaction.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n But the analytical and synthetical powers\n are not the only ones of his mental make up.\n His mind is almost philosophically reflective,\n is receptive and constructive; inventive and\n ingenious; it is also adroit, ductile and mallea-\n ble. Quick to receive impressions it is rapid\n in their ordering and reduction to use. Im-\n aginative, of course, he is, or he would not be\n an artist, yet his imagination is not of the\n highest order and is under the dominion of\n has reasoning faculties. In some aspects and\n under certain circumstances so rapid are his\n mental processes that his results would some-\n times pass for those of intuition and inspira-\n tion, but as a matter of fact he is neither in-\n tuitional nor inspirational. Everything is the\n result of thought and reason and study. What\n he knows he knows well, and he knows much,\n fo! - that which he has acquired at any time is\n retained and always ready for use. He has\n a reason for all that he does on the stage\n which he could give if he chose, but he rarely\n chooses. Utterly without tact, having no\n diplomacy in his composition, never seeking\n to employ either, he yet possesses a pro-\n found knowledge of the motive springs of hu-\n man nature. But in his case that knowledge\n is confined to human nature in the abstract.\n It is arrived at and determined in the study\n with all human nature before him in imagin-\n ation, never in the street or in the mart with\n the individual in contact. Its application is\n to his art and its expression, never to the in-\n dividual specimens that come under his pur-\n view.\n</p>\n<p>\n That he ha3 the mimetic faculty goes with\n the saying that he is an actor. But however\n largely developed, like every other faculty,\n it is subordinate to his higher mental pow-\n ers. All who go upon the stage have this fac-\n ulty, and in more cases than the public can\n conceive its possession is the only reason for\n their appearance thereon. Nothing is more\n common than for the director on taking the\n stage to find that the minor parts, and some-\n times the more important ones, are intrusted\n to persons unable to comprehend or to grasp\n from the manuscript the meaning of a scene\n in which they are to bear a part. Nor will\n any amount of explanation or description in-\n form them. Yet, let this director once act the\n scene for them, they comprehend instantly\n and reproduce with a fidelity certainly aston-\n ishing after the previous failures and produce\n effects in acting incomprehensible under the\n circumstances. They see only through their\n eyes and hear only by their ears. They are\n</p>\n<p>\n of that class of persons who fail to compre-\n hend the purpose and intent of a work of fic-\n tion, yet seeing it in its theatrical version on\n the stage understand it perfectly. In as great\n a degree as any one of these who have noth-\n ing else, has Mr. Mansfield the mimetic fac-\n ulty and mention of others is made only in\n order to emphasize the fact that to Mr. Mans-\n field comprehension of a scene must first\n come to him through the reasoning faculties,\n when his physical parts become a wonderful\n instrument of expression under the direction\n and command of his keen, highly trained and\n</p>\n<p>\n disciplined intellect. He is a student of all\n literature and of all that concerns man. He\n acts upon the principle laid dotvn by the late\n Mr. Mayo, who on one occasion said; \u201cThe\n drama is life. The stage is universal. Noth-\n ing that concerns man in any way but is of\n concern to the actor if he would be equipped\n for his work.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In view of this it is remarkable that he has\n not impressed himself to a greater degree\n upon the younger members of hia profession.\n In England and, indeed, in this country, where\n his influence has reached, humble followers\n of Sir Henry Irving are found emphasizing\n his hems and haws and grunts, making con-\n spicuous his mannerisms of stride and gest-\n</p>\n<p>\n ure. When Edwin Booth dominated our\n stage, a bit of him here was seen and a sug-\n gestion of him there in nearly one-half the\n young leading and juvenile men and his in-\n fluence has not wholly passed even in this\n ddy. Yet, though Mr. Mansfield has his ad-\n mirers by the scores in the profession, and\n though imitation is the sincerest flattery,\n little of him is reproduced by other actors\n and his influence, apparently, is not opera-\n tive. Not without mannerisms and tricks of\n intonation, in view of his leading position,\n one might expect to see these, at least, wide-\n</p>\n<p>\n ly copied, since in the effort to adopt the\n methods and technique of a superior artist\n the defects are attached and imitated. \u2022 Mr.\n Mansfield himself imitated no one; his mind\n is too original and independent in its pro-\n cesses to permit him. Yet, markedly orig-\n inal and forceful as are his methods, it is to\n be noted that as a result a school of acting\n of which he is the exemplar has not sprung\n up. From this it has been argued that when\n his own interesting personality is removed\n from it, the technique he employs will not\n stand-the test of analysis. As there are no pu-\n pils avowedly his and no one but himself em-\n ploys his peculiar technique, the contention\n can neither be proved nor disproved.

Mr. Mans-\n field is not a genius, but he is a consummate\n artist. His effects are not born of impulse\n or of inspiration, but are the matured out-\n come of a thoughtful and logical brain work-\n ing through a technique that is his servant,\n not his master, and which he does not hesi-\n tate to thrust aside when it becomes ob-\n structive. An accurate judgment of the man\n can be reached only from that view-point.\n The man is an artist, having the artistic tem-\n perament, with all its foibles and defects, and\n he is a dramatic artist because the mimetic\n faculty is in him largely developed and shaped.\n Over this artistic temperament presides a\n strong, clear, logical mind, swaying, direct-\n ing and controlling its impulses. The chief\n quality in Mr. Mansfield ' s make-up is the in-\n tellectual and all his results, in the first in-\n stance, are reached through patient mental\n processes, a fact, which, however inconsistent\n with some of his expressions and actions it\n may appear, must not be lost hold of in the\n consideration of the man and his methods.\n</p>\n<p>\n Those who decry the technique of Mr. Mans-\n field and find in it a frequent abandonment\n of settled principles of dramatic representa-\n tion seem to forget, or if they do not, re-\n fuse to admit, what ie plain, that the artist\n secures to a greater degree than any one\n now on the American stage that which is\n the purpose and end of dramatic represen-\n tation \u2014 illusion. The art of the stage is il-\n lusion. To that end all things should tend\n and it is the end sought by all concerned,\n from the writer of the piay through all the\n varied divisions of production to the one\n who speaks the lines. To that end every-\n thing must bend and when the manager says\n dogmatically that \u201cyou cannot spend too\n much time or too much money in getting\n an effect\u201d he means that you do not waste\n time, pains nor money in securing a strong\n aid to illusion. If time-honored methods\n fail to secure it at critical points the meth-\n ods, however time-honored or however much\n intrenched in precedent, must be thrown\n aside and those employed, rude, awkward\n or apparently illogical though they may be,\n that will secure it. It is only when it is se-\n cured and the auditor is madq to forget for\n the time that he is looking upon a mimic\n scene and loses himself in what seem to be\n actualities, that triumph is achieved. It is\n a criticism, and a just one, that the mod-\n ern stage in its strife for realism forgets\n that illusion is secured rather in the ap-\n</p>\n<p>\n peal to the imagination than to the eyes\n and the ears. It is here that Mr. Mansfield\n is regnant. It is here that the artist\n shows himself and here that he triumphs.\n And it is also just here that the self-suffi-\n cient critic, resenting that his imagination\n was taken captive, sits down and studies\n out the methods by which the triumph was\n achieved and assuages his irritation by the\n determination that the methods employed\n were stagy and theatrical. Nor is this great\n art confined to himself and his part. Mr. Mans-\n field is the head of his own company, his own\n stage director and in all parts and depart-\n ments of his productions dominant and per-\n vasive. making everything tell for illusion\n and with invariable success. Impulse and\n caprice have no place in the production he\n controls. If they do have play in other\n things and relations. In the play everything\n shows the result of patient study and pre-\n vision, and everything is ordered with art\n acute intelligence and a thorough under-\n standing of the meaning, intention and end\n of the play, extending to all parts, however\n minute. The result is a work of art.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Mansfield has many of the defects of\n the artistic temperament, notably in his irri-\n tability, sensitiveness, vanity and intolerance.\n He is arrogant and self-sufficient; moreover,\n he takes eccentric shoots and liberties with\n his public that are neither pleasant, agree-\n able nor commendable. His speeches before\n the curtain are often little but a string of\n sneering reflections upon the public that has\n been faithful in support of him, undeserved\n by that public and undignified in the utterer.\n In the course of time the idea has grown up\n that these speeches are but a pose instituted\n for the purpose of advertisement and are so\n treated by the audience, laughed at good hu-\n moredly and even called for. If it be true\n that they are a mere pose, as there is good\n reason to believe, then it is an exhibition of\n charlatanism that is separated but little\n from the attitude of the \" barker\u201d in front of\n a Coney Island show. Some time ago he rang\n down the curtain in the middle of a scene at\n the Garden Theater in Manhattan on the plea\n that some noise somewhere annoyed him.\n His eccentricities have been many and no-\n where was he more amusing or more charac-\n teristic than in Philadelphia, where he de-\n nounced in scathing terms the theatrical syn-\n dicate from the stage of the theater of one of\n the chief members of the syndicate. But it is\n in these aspects that Mr. Mansfield appears\n to the least advantage; and he grieves\n the judicious among his many well wishers\n who appreciate his sterling abilities and su-\n perior faculties.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nature has done more for Mr. Mansfield in\n</p>\n<p>\n mental than physical equipment, and this may\n be one of the reasons why. he has rot ven-\n tured on some of the more heroic characters\n of the classic drama. However, the artist\n may have a very accurate perception of his\n own limitations. One thing is quite certain,\n that his great triumphs have been achieved\n in the delineation of strongly defined char-\n acter. And whether these be broadly con-\n trasted or keen distinctions; whether they\n are the old roue in the \u201cParisian Romance,\u201d\n the double personality of Stevenson ' s con-\n ception, the Georgian dandy in \u201c Beau Brum-\n mel\u201d or that old Shakspearean villain, Rich-\n ard the Third, the result has been the same,\n a veritable triumph. In \u201cThe Devil\u2019s Disci-\n ple\u201d he showed a command of comedy that\n the critics had been prone to deny Mm, and\n yet are not disposed to yield him, for they\n point out what there was of comedy was grim\n and bizarre, such as he revels in, and that he\n had not traveled out of a line in which there\n was not true comedy. Into the romantic com-\n edy, in which so many think he would achieve\n new triumphs, he has never ventured. In\n fact, he has confined himself to a class of\n parts so closely related that a new term has\n come into existence which describes a kind\n of parts as \u201cMansfield parts.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n At no time in his career has Mr. Mansfield\n confined himself to a single play simply be-\n cause it was a money maker. No man in the\n same space of time has contributed so many\n new characters to the stage as he has done.\n In this he has enriched the stage and ad-\n vanced art. Never a year passes that he does\n not present one or more new plays, and often\n from new authors, the merit of whose work\n ho has detected without reference to whether\n or not it had a successful predecessor from\n the same pen. He has what is rare in a pro-\n ducing manager, the courage of his convic-\n tions, and he rarely if ever awaits the pro-\n duction of a play on the other side to see\n whether success attends it before he makes\n the presentment here.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Mansfield has had his battles to fight\n and he has fought and won his place \u2014 won it\n without a sacrifice of his independence or\n his dignity. He has bowed before no powers\n and has maintained his own course. In the\n language of the booking office, he is recog-\n nized as the \u201cleading attraction \" of the day,\n and that means that he has secured a place\n in the dramatic world of America similar to\n that held, though not in the same field, by\n the late Edwin Booth. He has not yet reached\n the prime of life; youth still lingers with him.\n Progressive in his nature, of energetic mind\n and unbounded physical energy, it is safe to\n predict for him future triumphs that shall\n be an advance upon what has preceded.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0010/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0010/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0010/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0010/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0010/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0010.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 706204}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"10\">\n<p>\n William Dean Howells.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE CHAMPION OF REALISM IN LITERATURE : : A\n PROPHET NOT WITHOUT HONOR IN HIS OWN COUNTRY.\n</p>\n<p>\n T HE war of realism and Idealism in lit-\n erature has raged these many years.\n As aggressively prosecuted as it has\n been by the realists it cannot be said that\n the bays of victory are theirs. They found\n the idealists in possession and, entrenched\n in popular favor, disposed to resist attempts\n to dislodge them, and they have not been\n dislodged. But it were idle to deny that\n some trophies hang in the tents of the real-\n ists. They have captured some outposts,\n have even pushed into the enemy\u2019s country,\n and. though they were beaten back, it was\n not with a total loss of all that had been\n gained.\n</p>\n<p>\n To drop the metaphor, while the realists\n have not secured all they have contended\n for, nor effected the revolution they counted\n on, yet they have made an impression on\n the literature of their day, and their influ-\n ence is not unfelt even in the fields of ro-\n mance. They have established a school and\n obtained recognition for it. They are not\n without recruits from afiang the writers\n who have come up during the past decade\n and who are now coming up, some of whom\n have been received into popular favor,\n though by far the greater number have at-\n tached themselves to the older school, and it\n is among these that the recipients of the\n highest favor will be found. After all the\n gains made by the realists are more in the\n details of treatment, in workmanship,\n rather than in the adoption of the princi-\n ples of their school. They will decline to\n admit this, perhaps, insisting that advance\n is not to be measured by multiplied editions,\n but by the applied judgment of the critical\n and discerning. It is not, however, what\n the learned critic says to-day, but what will\n be read twenty years hence that will tell\n the tale and record the final judgment.\n But if the realists have not driven the ideal-\n ists from the field, they have secured a re-\n spected place, have their school, their dis-\n ciples, their leader, and that leader is Will-\n iam Dean Howells, their doughty champion\n as well.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Howells is something more than the\n head and champion of the realistic school.\n He is the foremost novelist of the country,\n a place conceded him by all whether of his\n or the romantic school, and the fact con-\n stitutes the great feather in the cap of the\n realist. Why it was given or whether justly\n it is not the purpose here to argue; it is\n enough to say that it was given him at the\n outset of his career as a flctionist, largely\n based on his previous triumphs in other lit-\n erary fields and before he had put forward\n his claims as a realist or had entered the\n lists as a champion of realism. Mr. Howells\n</p>\n<p>\n had received literary recognition before he\n ventured on his first novel. His advance, if\n advance it was, to the station of a writer of\n fiction, was deliberate, and, one might even\n say, cautious. It may surprise some of iiis\n admirers, who have found their admiration\n in his novels, to know that his first effort\n to secure recognition was in the field of poet-\n ry \u2014 a poem, \u201cBy the Dead,\u201d printed in the\n Atlantic Monthly. This was in 1859, when\n he was twenty-two years old. At that time\n James Russell Lowell was the editor of the\n magazine, and admission to its pages carried\n with it a greater literary distinction than\n any similar publication could then give, or\n that the same one of this day can. That\n the keen and discriminating keeper of the\n gate of the magazine saw more in this poem\n than the accidental striking of a plane of\n merit is seen in the fact that during the\n year following five other poems were ac-\n cepted and published. Turning back to\n them one finds much that is characteristic\n of the elder Howells in the simplicity of\n diction and the neatness of workmanship,\n but must admit, after all, that there was\n more of promise than of performance in\n them; they were intensely youthful, and in\n nothing more than in their hopeless gloom\n so suggestive of Heine as to suggest that the\n youthful poet had for the time taken that\n reveler in sadness for his master.\n</p>\n<p>\n No doubt to-day Mr. Howells would re-\n sent with annoyance, even deep indignation,\n that his next literary effort, and the one that\n brought him in the largest return of money\n he had up to that time received, was a\n campaign life of Abraham Lincoln, who had\n just been nominated for President. The\n book perhaps had a larger circulation than\n any subsequent book of his career, but that\n was due less to the merit of it, however\n great that may have been, than to the efforts\n of the campaign committees. It has not been\n heard of since except by title in the list of\n his published works. But that is the fate\n of all campaign literature. However the\n author may now regard it, it had an impor-\n tant influence on his career, since it gave\n him the money to visit Boston, where he\n made the acquaintance of James Russell\n Lowell. This gentleman, who had given him\n his first recognition, further aided the young\n man by standing sponsor for him in intro-\n ducing him to the literary circle of the\n \u201cHub,\u201d then a real and potent influence in\n American . letters. The life did more, for\n it afforded a basis of political service, on\n which his friends could stand to urge his\n appointment as consul to Venice. Those\n were unholy days compared with the im-\n maculate purity of these; Lincoln was a\n</p>\n<p>\n spoilsman judged by the standards of these\n times, the claims of political services were\n recognized, and Mr. Howells received the\n appointment.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Howells\u2019 official life of four years in\n Venice has not left a deep mark on the poli-\n tics of the world, but had he not been ap-\n pointed there would have been a distinct loss\n to American literature. From that residence\n came those delightful papers embraced in\n book form under the title of \u201cVenetian Life,\u201d\n which not only put him forward as a writer\n of uncommon power, with a styje as vivid\n as it was original and as flexible as it was\n subtle, but sent him into distinctly literary\n pursuits of a broader and more popular kind\n than had up to that time engaged his at-\n tention. Henceforth he is a prose writer.\n The influence of those four years in shaping\n the course of his life is unmistakable, yet\n it is doubtful if on his return to this coun-\n try he purposed a career other than that of\n a journalist. He was a working newspaper\n man when he received recognition in the At-\n lantic. He began at the case when he was\n twelve years old, setting type in his father\u2019s\n weekly paper, published in Hamilton, O. He\n continued to set type in his father\u2019s office\n and on the Ohio State Journal, published at\n Columbus, until he was 19, when he was\n made the legislative correspondent of the\n Cincinnati Gazette. Two years later he was\n made news editor of the Ohio State Journal,\n at Columbus. It w r as w T hile he was serving\n this paper that his poems were published in\n the Atlantic, and much more of this sort of\n work found its way into the columns of the\n Journal.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this hasty review there are some facts\n unexpressed. The first is that his real work\n with letters was begun as a reporter; that\n is what he is to-day. The other is that Mr.\n Howells\u2019 education was achieved in news-\n paper offices and not in schools and colleges.\n The record shows that he began setting type\n at the age of 12, assiduously devoting himself\n to the trade until he was 19, when he plunged\n into active reporting. During these years he\n saw the inside of no school, nor in after\n years that of aDy institution of learning ex-\n cept as a visitor. His home, however, seems\n to have been a most excellent university.\n His father, was a man of liberal education and\n superior cultivation, possessing a goodly col-\n lection of books, largely made up, however \u2014\n mark the fact \u2014 of poetry and the lighter\n forms of literature. \u2022 The atmosphere of the\n home life was distinctly literary, and the\n inclination of the lad tow\u2019ard literature. It\n is related that almost as soon as he could\n read he began to w r rite verses, which he him-\n self put into type in his father\u2019s printing\n office.

It is not known, nor\n is knowledge likely to be obtained from those\n papers, that Mr. Howells wishes it to be un-\n derstood that therein was all the education\n he received in those years, but one cannot\n rise from the reading of the papers without\n being impressed that the boy, lad and young\n man was an omnivorous reader and that he\n was such almost wholly in poetry, fiction\n</p>\n<p>\n diligent, unregulated reading, in the home\n association and in the newspaper office, the\n educational influences of which are admitted.\n At all events, it was not academic. A critic\n a few years ago sneeringly declared that Mr.\n Howells ' style was the reverse of academic. It\n was not clear in the exposition what it lacked\n in not being so, or what it would have been\n had it been, but if his style is the result\n of not being academic, let us be profoundly\n grateful, for no writer of English to-day pos-\n sesses a style more graceful, more limpid,\n more flexible or more capable of expressing\n</p>\n<p>\n WILLIAM DEAN HOWELLS.\n</p>\n<p>\n and the lighter essays. The lad who worked\n at the case during toil hours had but those of\n his leisure for reading, and the number that\n he tells he waded through must have ab-\n sorbed all not given to labor and sleep \u2014 in-\n deed. he must have encroached on those due\n the latter. The papers are not at hand for\n reference, but, if memory is not treacher-\n ous, there is little record of dipping into the\n scientific and philosophic. Mr. Howells\u2019 edu-\n cation seems to have been secured in this\n</p>\n<p>\n the minutest shade of the idea set forth\n than does this writer not schooled in the\n schools or disciplined in the curriculum.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Howells is quite evidently the product\n of self-education and self-cultivation, per-\n haps guided and advised by one who had un-\n dergone the training of regulated study.\n Whether or not in these years attention w.as\n given to those studies that aid in strengthen-\n ing the mind and in directing its processes\n there are no means of accurately ascertain-\n</p>\n<p>\n ing, but there is ground for the assumption\n that at that time, when the mind is more re-\n ceptive and impressionable, littte tvas given;\n that the imaginative forms of literature ab-\n sorbed all; and that such efforts as were\n made in those studies were after the\n years of manhood were attained and\n the author already well launched on the\n sea of literature. What is clear is that\n by the time he had reached the years of\n manhood he had exhaustively explored the\n fields of English literature, in which he was\n thereafter to labor and attain distinction.\n Quite evidently, too, he was gifted with the\n reasoning and ruminating faculties to such\n a degree that a study of the formulated sci-\n ence of thinking and argument would have\n resulted in increased benefit only in the\n acquirement of the technical terms of the sci-\n ence. These gifts, with his concentrative\n power and tenacity of grasp of idea, * are\n abundantly manifest in his writings from the\n first, nor less manifest is that clarity, so\n characteristic of his mind, that leaves his\n reader in no doubt of just the shade of\n meaning he wishes to express. His great\n powers of expression proceed from these\n qualities, native gifts, whether in any part\n of his formative period they were cultivated\n to a higher degree of efficiency or not. It\n is suspected, however, that what there was\n of cultivation was in the practice of his facul-\n ties,. not in the study of extraneous aids.\n What also seems to be established is that\n Mr. Howells\u2019 is an essentially literary tem-\n perament.\n</p>\n<p>\n The four years of life in Venice were de-\n veloping. There Mr. Howells acquired the\n French and Italian languages and there he\n studied foreign literature \u2014 again the forms\n in which he was to work\u2014 and foreign civili-\n zation. Returning to this country he en-\n gaged as an editorial writer on the Tribune,\n the while contributing to other publications,\n but his stay was brief, for before the expira-\n tion of the year of his return, 1866, he took\n the post of assistant editor of the Atlantic\n Monthly in Boston, succeeding to the full\n editorship six years later, the responsibilities\n of which he carried for nine years or, until\n 1881, when, desiring to engage on a career of\n fiction, he relinquished the editorship to\n Thomas Bailey Aldrich. These years of edi-\n torship were busy, industrious years, bring-\n ing him little personal fame, but during\n them he developed into a critic of power and\n acumen. Indeed there are admirers of the\n man who believe that his best work was\n done in this department of effort and that\n his fame would rest on a more enduring ba-\n sis were it put on this work if properly\n gathered and presented in permanent form\n than on his novels, with which now it is whol-\n ly associated. It is here that his analytical\n powers are displayed. They are of no mean\n order, and when applied amount to virtual\n dissection. With him analysis is less a res-\n olution of a matter into its primary princi-\n ples than it ie > a dissection into its various\n parts. And herein we have a charge against\n him directly in opposition to that claimed\n for him as set forth above, that the critic\n with the parts spread around after dissection\n is quite apt to leave us to do our own syn-\n thetical work, a charge based on the belief\n he is lacking in that power.

And here, too,\n more than in any other relation he displayed\n the results of his profound study of the lit-\n erature of modern times again, of that por-\n tion in which he labored, for science and phi-\n losophy seem to have received scant atten-\n tion.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was while he was conducting the Atlan-\n tic Monthly that he made his first essay into\n fiction. He had been a recognized worker in\n literary fields for twelve years and had behind\n him the published works, \u201cNo Love Lost,\u201d a\n poem of travel, \u201cVenetian Life; \" \u201cItalian\n Journeys\u201d and \u201cSuburban Sketches,\u201d works\n that had established him. His first effort in\n fiction was \u201cTheir Wedding Journey,\u201d and it\n appeared serially in the Atlantic. As a\n novel it was unconventional in that it had\n the slenderest sort of a plot, if, indeed, it\n could be called a plot, for it was a series\n of incidents occurring while a young couple\n were on a wedding journey, many of them un-\n related to each other, or the couple, and\n none of them articulated except as they hap-\n pened under observation. The story ended\n only because the young man must get back to\n the practical occupations of his life. A more\n modest essay into story-telling or a more\n cautious attempt never was made. But all\n the charm of the writer, of the master in the\n use of pure, clear, simple English, with his\n skill in revealing character and hie delightful,\n Illusive humor, now so well known and ad-\n mired, was there, but the critics declined to\n accept it as a novel, for they could see none\n of the machinery of one in it. Tet what-\n ever it W T as, it met with instantaneous and\n abundant success, so great that it changed\n the career of the author who subsequently\n abandoned the desk of the editor for that of\n the fictionist.\n</p>\n<p>\n This was in 1871. Since then Mr. Howells\n has given to his public one, sometimes two,\n in each year. By a faithful clientele each\n successive publication is hailed as a literary\n event over which much acclaim is made. But\n the fact remains that his public has been a\n limited one, large perhaps w T hen considered\n of itself, but not large compared with others\n who measure their circulation by the tens of\n thousands rather than by the thousands. His\n admirers and disciples, forced to the admis-\n sion of this, content themselves with point-\n ing out the high degree of cultivation of\n those w r ho so faithfully buy his books. The\n subsequent publications of Mr. Howells have\n differed only in degree, in form or in char-\n acter of plot. It is true that in later efforts\n there has been more of an approach to the\n form of the conventional novel, but in all\n the plot is slender and the interest of the\n reader is solicited not in the complexity and\n development of plot or in the course of the\n story, but in the manifestation of the charac-\n ter, the truthful treatment of phases of\n society, vivid portraiture and in the literary\n charm of treatment. In fact, Mr. Howells\n concerns himself little with plots; he has\n said that all the plots have been invented\n and used and that a new one cannot be pro-\n duced. Indeed, he regards with ill disguised\n contempt a plot-maker. This has led to\n the retort that, unable himself to make a\n plot, he, therefore, concludes they are use-\n less. That the novelist is singularly de-\n ficient in constructive power is now conceded.\n This deficiency, however well concealed in\n his novels under the plea of uselessness, was\n made apparent when he attempted to write\n plays. As a dramatist, Mr. Howells is a\n failure, and his failure is in that construction\n Which if not missed when absent in the novel\n hi fatal when not found in the play. His dis-\n regard of a plot with its complexities is ac-\n aeuntatf foCiir that his genius is the reverse\n</p>\n<p>\n of the dramatic. He is fond of the stage and\n fond of writing about it. He saw in \u201cThe\n Old Homestead\u201d the very perfection of play-\n writing, and asserted it to be a model for\n playwrights to follow, in that it was a series\n of connected sketches performing their whole\n function in a truthful revelation of character.\n In like manner he found a high degree of ex-\n cellence in the crude efforts presented by\n Harrigan in that they were truthful exposi-\n tions of types to be found in the life of the\n metropolis. In his efforts for the stage he\n seeks to carry out the principles he has out-\n lined in his essays and put into practice in\n his novels. He can do so in his novels with\n certain degrees of success, perhaps of the\n highest, through the speeches of his charac-\n ters, reflecting their mental and emotional\n phases and processes. In the novel Mr. How-\n ells manages this with exquisite skill. But\n the art of the actor stops at the psycholog-\n ical. The actor is on the stage to act, and\n we must have action. There are some phases\n of mental action that the actor\u2019s art will ex-\n press; but in the main the language of his\n art is the language of the emotions and pas-\n sions. While the revelation of character and\n its phases are quite as necessary on the\n stage as in the novel, such revelation must\n be made rather by what they do than by\n what they say, and to do so they must have\n situations; and situations with clashes, con-\n flicts and complexities must come out of con-\n structed plots. \u201cThe Old Homestead\u201d proves\n nothing for Mr. Howells; it has not been so\n abundantly successful because of what elic-\n ited his unstinted praise, but because it pos-\n sesses that very thing which he says it has\n not \u2014 a plot. Says the author of a book on the\n \u201cTechnique of the Drama\u201d: \u201cThe plot of\n \u2018The Old Homestead ' is perfectly clear and\n consistent, and entirely dramatic. Its unity is\n the ever present glorification of rural sim-\n plicity. Surely the parable of the Prodigal\n Son is a drama, and old Joshua Whitcomb\u2019s\n search in the city for his boy is a variation\n of it. * * * It is a play of character and\n local color, but accurate in movement, with\n purpose in every part of it; organic all the\n way through.\u201d The comment is technical, for\n the work is one treating of technique.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Howells is not dramatic, though he\n does portray character and phases of com-\n mon nature with a skill and vividness ad-\n mirable and truthful. He is a reporter; he\n began as such, he is such to-day, and will\n be to the end. And a supremely skillful re-\n porter he is. He records what he sees and\n he misses little. His powers of penetration\n and observation are great, and therefore he\n sees much hidden from the blind and pur-\n blind. He reproduces with fidelity and a\n strict regard for truth, with an art that is\n consummate and a humor that is\n the outcome of his kindly philosophy, in\n which there is no trace of the cynical. He\n has a keen sense for the poetic in the com-\n mon life about him, for there he is sympa-\n thetic since he is himself poetic. In the field\n he has chosen to explore and report, life\n flows smoothly and placidly, disturbed, if\n disturbed at all, only by ripples. It is not\n vexed by the large affairs of men, clash of\n high endeavor or the conflicts of strong pas-\n sions. There may be tears sometimes, but\n the clouds that drop them are, after all, thin\n vapors that soon float away; there may be\n even irritability, but in the end it will be\n found there was no real reason for it. Only\n the ordinary, commonplace affairs of life oc-\n cur in that world. The men struggle in an\n eventless sort of a way to get on in life, and\n earn their bread and butter, and the women\n keep the house in order, emerging when the\n men come home from their places of work to\n</p>\n<p>\n mingle in innocent pleasure of a strictly con-\n ventional kind, to fall in love, to marry, to\n be jealous, and to fail in their purposes just\n as they do in real life, and all the time they\n are moving in these placid scenes they are\n under the microscopic observation of their\n creator, who sets down every thought and\n phase of thought, every emotion and their\n consequences, every method of expressing\n or repressing their manifestation, as shown\n through their disposition and temperaments,\n with an entire disregard of their degree or\n significance. All this is very vividly done,\n is very real very truthful and not the least\n delightful part is the humor that plays over\n it all \u2014 a humor unmistakably appreciated,\n but most difficult to fix. No one is more suc-\n cessful \u2014 indeed, the superlative is justified \u2014\n no one is as successful in his portraiture of\n women as is Mr. Howells\u2014 at least, the\n women of the world he labors in. Their foi-\n bles, and he has a keen eye for them, are\n held up relentlessly, but by no means ill\n naturedly. Withal, there is such kindly\n sympathy that one feels that the author re-\n joices with them in their possession as he\n holds them up for us to smile at.\n</p>\n<p>\n There can be no quarrel with the author\n in the selection of the field he has chosen\n to work in. Indeed, all will admit that the\n work done therein is on a high plane of art;\n that in its performance he displays keen\n penetration, minute observation, a deep\n knowledge of human nature, fine powers of\n analyzation and wonderful facility of ex-\n pression; that he has brought to his work\n great literary skill, a thorough mastery of\n the English language \u2014 a poetic temperament\n and an imagination which, if not brilliant,\n is at least vivid. And all of us will con-\n cede that he is a literary artist worthy all\n the fame he is in the enjoyment of. The\n quarrel begins when he insists that the life\n he depicts is the only life worthy depiction.\n He has gone so far in this direction that he\n would seem to say that the commonplace\n only should be dealt with and that the\n stronger passions of men. when in operation\n or conflict produce heroic or wicked results,\n should have no place; that the man returning\n to the bosom of his family after a day\u2019s\n contact with the whirring world should only\n relate the ordinary occurrences that he\n could dissect and set forth the cause of,\n resolutely casting aside all mention of the\n extraordinary, the astounding and the acci-\n dental, of which he could tell only the ef-\n fects. This would seem to be the logical out-\n come of the pursuit of Mr. Howells\u2019 conten-\n tions to the last result. In lifting the gon-\n falon of realism Mr. Howells has fallen foul\n of the gods of cur youth \u2014 Dickens, Thack-\n eray, Scott \u2014 in fact, ali w-ho preceded him-\n self, Henry James, Tolstoi, Maupassant, etc.,\n and has given offense to us all, with the\n result that he has been fairly deluged -with\n protest and condemnation of those refusing\n to let go their hold on the ideal and the\n romantic. He has fought his battle well and\n strenuously, but not victoriously, for in this\n day there is a most decided movement back\n to the old forms.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Howells\u2019 genius is chaste. Nothing\n of the equivocal, the fleshly, or the erotic\n has flowed from his pen \u2014 not \u201cone line which,\n dying, he could wish to blot;\u201d but his bat-\n tle for realism has led him. into singular\n support of other writers of whom this could\n not be said and into assailable positions on\n account of them. A man of unusual powers,\n he is not of profound emotions or deep pas-\n sions. While in some of his more recent\n works he has seemed to go down deeper into\n the complexities of human nature, no great\n depths have been reached, and it is difficult\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0013/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 348, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 496}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0013/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 697, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 992}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0013/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1394, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1985}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0013/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2788, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3971}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0013/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0013.jp2", "height": 3971, "width": 2788, "levels": 6, "size": 693171}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"13\">\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11\n</p>\n<p>\n to escape the conviction that it is because\n there are no great depths in himself to be\n sounded.

If\n they do, it will be ouly with the students\n of the future, looking back into our times for\n faithful pictures of certain and limited phases\n of life of the day in which they were drawn,\n and perhaps of his beautiful English and the\n style of it.

During fif-\n teen years much in the nature of the labor\n was ephemeral, but a good deal of that time\n that went to the public nameless would, if\n gathered, be a welcome addition to current\n literature even in this day of much book-\n making. He is still active, blessed with\n health and strength, the rewards of a whole-\n some life. That life has been one of dig-\n nity and respect, and in it he has been what\n he shows himself to be in his works \u2014 ear-\n nest, sincere, conscientious and honorable.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMark Twain.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n EARNESTNESS THE MOST DISTINGUISHING\n CHARACTERISTIC OF THE FAMOUS WRITER.\n</p>\n<p>\n T HIRTY or thirty-five years ago there\n were various ways of getting to and\n from California, but the railway was\n not one. People did go and come and as a\n rule, to do so, went \u201cdown to the sea in\n ships.\u201d Though a part of us, California\n was apart from us\u2014 an isolated section, of\n whose civilization we had hazy notions,\n rather inclining to the belief that the social\n conditions therein were such as made a\n prompt and executive vigilance committee\n a normal necessity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Hence, when the few who wandered thither\n came back to tell us that in San Francisco\n life in some of its phases was often lay and\n sometimes lawless, we were ready to Incline\n a believing ear. But, when they went on\n to say that it had an artistic and literary\n side, which if limited would compare favor-\n ably with that of the East; that there were\n actors on its stage in the stock putting to\n their best trumps the stars of the East, wan-\n dering thither in quest of miner\u2019s gold; that\n these were then making literature which\n would sooner or later come into general recog-\n nition, wo cooked our heads and perked our\n noses in fine scorn over such travelers\u2019 tales.\n</p>\n<p>\n Yet the railroads had not spanned the con-\n tinent when San Francisco sent Frank Mayo,\n Agnes Booth, Charles R. Thorne, Louis Aid-\n rich, as a few years before it had sent the\n great tragedian, Edwin Booth, to take the\n very first places on our stage. And when\n \u201cThe Jumping Frog\u201d and \u201cThe Heathen Chi-\n nee\u201d floated in on us by a favoring western\n wind and we stopped long enough in our\n laughter and delight to consider whence they\n came, we found there were others than Mark\n Twain and Bret Harte, in the persons of\n Charles Warren Stoddard, Charles H. Webb\n and Prentice Mulford, to sustain the claim of\n high character for the Pacific coast litera-\n ture.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of the earliest to gain fame was Sam-\n</p>\n<p>\n uel Langhorne Clemens, much better known\n to the English-speaking world by his pen\n name, \u201cMark Twain.\u201d Perhaps in the history\n of literature there ijs not a case where an\n author\u2019s baptismal name has been so thor-\n oughly submerged in an assumed cognomen.\n The .nearest approach is to be found in that\n of Charles F. Browne, in Artemus Ward,\n but in his case his intimates invariably ad-\n dressed him as Charlie, while in the case of\n Mark Twain, it is only the friends of his\n youth who give to him his real name. The\n pseudonym is an outcome of the days when\n he tried to be a pilot on the Mississippi Riv-\n er \u2014 days of which he has written delightfully\n in a series of papers published in the Atlan-\n tic Monthly, \u201cPiloting on the Mississippi.\u201d\n These were the days when he was drifting,\n before he had found his true trade. He was\n born in the little village of Florida, in Mis-\n souri, on November 30, 1836. At 13 he was\n apprenticed to a printer in the Town of Han-\n nibal; at 16 he became a \u201cpilot\u2019s cub\u201d (ap-\n prentice); by the time he had \u201clearned the\n river\u201d he abandoned it to go back to the\n types, and it is recorded that he worked at\n his trade in St. Louis, Cincinnati, Philadel-\n phia and New York.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1861 he was back again in Missouri and\n in a company enlisted for the confederate\n side, which seems, however, not to have at-\n tained the dignity of recognition, for, though\n it was in camp three weeks, it was dis-\n banded. If it served no other purpose, it\n gave life, years later, to one of Mark\n Twain\u2019s most humorous papers, describing\n his experiences therewith. In that year he\n seems to have experienced a revolution of\n political sentiment, for he went with his\n brother, who had been appointed by Lincoln,\n Governor of Nevada Territory, as private sec-\n retary. He resigned soon, trying to be a\n miner, but, if he found not gold, for he was\n far from successful, yet he accumulated that\n</p>\n<p>\n which has proved to him much more valu-\n able, knowledge of and experience in a world\n then largely unknown and which it was to\n be his mission, with Bret Harte, to reveal.\n Failure took him into the office of the Vir-\n ginia City Enterprise, as a local editor. It\n was the turning point in his life, though he\n knew it not. The editor and proprietor of\n that paper was Joseph Goodwin, a man of\n rare ability and penetration. He it was who\n W\u2019as the first to discover the rare and pe-\n culiar mental qualities of the young man\n who had drifted into his office and whose\n influence in shaping and directing the exer-\n cise of them, Mark Twain gratefully acknowl-\n edges. And it was in the service of this\n paper that the now famous pseudonym was\n first used, as the legislative correspondent,\n at Carson.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1867 a person of considerable local re-\n nown in Brooklyn of that day, connected with\n Plymouth Church, an old seaman, Captain\n Duncan, organized the expedition or excur-\n sion to the Holy Land, known as the Quaker\n City excursion. Though purely Brooklyn in\n its inception, its fame spread to . California\n and Mark Twain was engaged to accompany\n it by the Morning Call of San Francisco. The\n record of that trip is to be found in \u201cThe In-\n nocents Abroad,\u201d which he published on his\n return in 1869. Its success was instanta-\n neous and fame was his. It is quite evident\n that even with the extraordinary success of\n the book Mark did not see his way clear to\n the path he has in fact since followed, for he\n entered into relations with the Buffalo Ex-\n press. His stay in that city, however, was\n limited. The work he was to do, became\n clearer. Married, as he was, about this time,\n he settled himself down to a career of liter-\n ature, broken in on from time to time by the\n demand for his appearance on the lecture\n platform. The years following were indus-\n trious. His fame grew and fortune followed\n fame.

His popularity In England was as great\n as in the United States, while his works were\n all translated and published in Germany.\n ' There seemed at this period to be little left\n out of his life to make it a supremely happy\n one \u2014 a wide and growing fame, the respect\n and esteem of the world, troops of friends, a\n happy home and a fond family.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1884 he established a publishing house\n under the firm name of C.

But now the clouds gathered.\n A short time after this achievement the\n</p>\n<p>\n firm failed, ruining Mark Twain, stripping\n him of fortune, placing him, at the age when\n most men are looking forward to retirement\n and ease, in the position of beginning life\n over again. To the creditors Mr. Clemens\n turned over all his property and assumed the\n indebtedness it did not satisfy.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then he went to work again, laboriously\n and industriously, making no moan of it.\n Facing his disaster bravely and independent-\n ly, he refused, with a firmness and a spirit\n that could not be understood, the public\n subscription a leading journal had put under\n way in the assurance that a widespread sym-\n jNtthy for the author wohld make it highly\n</p>\n<p>\n successful. Some time ago it was announced\n that in his own unaided efforts every cent\n of that indebtedness had been paid and that\n a comfortable beginning of another fortune\n had been made.\n</p>\n<p>\n The parallel between himself and Sir Walter\n Scott is too obvious to receive more than a\n mention. It was a similar case. The brav-\n ery and courage was the same in both great\n authors. To those who knew the man well,\n there -was no surprise in his determination\n nor was there any in his refusal to receive\n extraneous aid. The honesty, the courage,\n the self-reliance, the independent spirit, the\n dogged determination and the intense ear-\n nestness is all a part of the man and no esti-\n</p>\n<p>\n Twain.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n mate of the man can be accurate that does\n not take in these qualities as moving and\n influential in his makeup. There are moral\n qualities as opposed to the mental, and to\n them should be added an unswerving loyalty\n to friendship and intense affection toward\n the objects of it. But this earnestness finds\n its influential place in his mental equipment.\n It is not too much to 6ay that it is abso-\n lutely the distinguishing characteristic of the\n intellectual Mark Twain. He is truly re-\n garded by the world at large as a humorist.\n He often is deliberately humorous, some-\n times laboriously so, less now in these mellow\n years of his than formerly; the machinery\n</p>\n<p>\n of humor sometimes creaked, but it is ven-\n tured that the world has quite as frequently\n laughed at his unconscious humor as at his\n deliberate efforts. He is never more uncon-\n sciously humorous than when he is most in\n earnest. He is not easy of analyzation in\n his mental and moral compound. He has an\n odd way, wholly his own, of observing the\n things and happenings of this life. He may\n see what others see in the same things but\n that which is the most vivid and striking to\n him is not seen by others. So, too, his\n mental processes are odd, leading to odd con-\n clusions and sentiments oddly expressed,\n which expressions have a most ludicrous ef-\n fect or rather the effect of ludicrousness on\n the hearer and this not infrequently when his\n own sense of humor is not excited.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the occasion of his first visit to wit-\n ness the play of \u201cPudd\u2019nhead Wilson,\u201d dram-\n atized by Mr. Mayo from Twain\u2019s novel of\n that title, his presence was detected and\n he was compelled to make a speech. The\n audience roared over it and it was spoken of\n subsequently as being exceedingly humor-\n ous. The possession of certain knowledge,\n not that of those who heard his remark, jus-\n tifies the statement that Mr. Twain had\n neither the intention nor made the effort\n to be funny. As a matter of fact, as the\n play was unfolded, he was subjected to a\n surprise that was almost bewildering to him.\n He had been sincere in the conviction that\n a play could not be made from his book and\n he had said so strenuously to Mr. Mayo\n when first approached on the subject and\n had continued in the same mind when he\n had yielded to Mr. Mayo\u2019s solicitation, who\n had said he saw a play in the book and how\n to bring it out. Hence when he saw it and\n saw how deftly Mr. Mayo had supplied the\n gaps, the existence of which he. Twain, had\n recognized as prohibitive of play-making, he\n was struck with wonder and surprise and\n admiration and expressed himself quite seri-\n ously and without the intention of humor\n when he said that the most wonderful thing\n about the play was the thoughts and ideal\u2019\n in it he had entertained, but not expressed\n in the book, but which had been faithfully\n recorded by Mr. Mayo. The audience thought\n he was humorous and laughed, but he was\n quite as serious and earnest as he was when,\n in yielding to Mr. Mayo\u2019s importunities to\n be permitted to dramatize the book, he said:\n \u201cFrank, many years ago I recognized the\n futility of attempting to prevent you from\n making a damned fool of yourself, so at 59\n years of age, on a wet night, in a damp street,\n with a hot dinner awaiting, I am not going to\n stultify myself. Go ahead with your dram-\n atization.\u201d A listener laughed, but Twain\n had no intention of causing the laugh. If any-\n thing he was rather annoyed at Mayo\u2019s per-\n sistency in urging that there existed in his\n work what he was certain there was not.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mark Twain suffers, as all humorists must\n suffer, in being denied by the large world the\n possession of the more serious intellectual\n qualities.

It is an entity with whose influence\n on man and society the publicist and political\n economist must reckon and enters as a factor\n into the problem of self-government we are\n w r orking out. The Methodist Episcopal\n Church of America is such a body.\n</p>\n<p>\n Within it, as leaders, instructors, exem-\n plars, executants, especially trained in school\n and disciplined in probation for their work,-\n reaching their stages only by the process of\n the survival of the fittest, are 18,000 men,\n each laboring for the same end with his shoul-\n ders well up against the collar of the guiding\n and carefully constructed harness. They\n are the ministers of the Methodist Church.\n Now, when in that army of 18,000 there is\n one man who, while confining his labors to\n the activities of the church, serving it and\n laboring for it, has grown to such stature\n that he has become a towering figure, regard-\n ed with interest and admiration from beyond\n the lines of his church, inquiry as to the sort\n and manner this man is is natural and cur-\n riosity need not be apologized for. James\n Monroe Buckley, D. D., LL. D., ordained\n minister and editor of the official organ of the\n church, the Christian Advocate, is the one\n who has grown to such stature.\n</p>\n<p>\n Within a few weeks the general conference,\n the governing body of the Methodist church\n in this country, has adjourned its quadren-\n nial session after sitting some four or five\n weeks. This convention, made up of nearly\n seven hundred delegates, lay and clerical,\n elected by the various conferences of the\n Union, embraced the brain of Methodism.\n What a council consisting of the representa-\n tive clergymen of each Catholic diocese, mar-\n shaled by the bishops and led by the cardinal-\n archbisop-primate would be? What a nation-\n</p>\n<p>\n al convention of lawyers, each state choosing\n its brightest lights and presided over by the\n justices of the Supreme Court of the United\n States might be in point of developed abil-\n ity, the general conference of the Methodist\n church is. One-half its membership consisted\n of a learned and highly trained ministry and\n the other half of a laity which embraced in\n its ranks jurists, lawyers, statesmen, men of\n national reputation, men who have attained\n distinction in legislative halls and men who\n are not without experience in dealing with\n large representative bodies. Of this large,\n able, unwieldy body that has but recently ad-\n journed, the members of which were human\n because they were men, which discussed ques-\n tions of religious opinion for which in the\n past men have sacrificed their lives and na-\n tions have been embroiled in war, wherein,\n if passions and ambitions did not sway,\n cultured consciences and the conviction of\n strong minds made obstacles and bulwarks,\n Dr. Buckley was easily the leader, emerging\n from the conflict its most conspicuous figure.\n It has not required the testimony of those\n in attendance, abundantly and widely given\n since adjournment, to make this clear. The\n records of the daily sessions in the public\n press have made the fact plain.\n</p>\n<p>\n But Dr. Buckley\u2019s fame does not rest alone\n on his service in that great representative\n convention, nor on that in its predecessors,\n in which he has been quite conspicuous.\n Little is ventured in the assertion that in the\n great Methodist body of three million of laity\n and eighteen thousand of clergy, Dr. Buckley\n is the most considerable figure, exerting an\n influence no other single person does, feared\n in controversy, respected for his abilities and\n admired for his attainments. \u201cHe is the big-\n gest man in Methodism,\u201d said a brother\n minister. A leading journalist, a thoughtful\n observer of men and things of the day, look-\n ing upon him with no special sympathy, \u00abaid\n the same thing of him in precisely the same\n words. A Methodist minister said to a cler-\n gyman of another denomination; \u201cI presume\n it is generally conceded in our church to-day\n that Dr. Buckley is our largest man.\u201d \u201cYou\n may add,\u201d replied the other, \u201cin many re-\n spects in the Protestant division.\u201d One of\n</p>\n<p>\n the faculty of a theological seminary said?\n \" There has not been in our church for some\n years now a man of such abundant intellect,\n combined with such force of character and\n such capacity for achievement.\u201d Within the\n church the favorite term applied to Dr. Buck-\n ley is that of \u201cthe watch dog of Methodism.\u201d\n He seems to have reached that stage when\n envy has ceased its detractions and jealousy\n its intrigues, for the voice of the church\n seems to be in practical accord in conceding\n this place to him and the world at large ac-\n cepts him at the value his own people have\n placed on him.\n</p>\n<p>\n The personality of Dr. Buckley is inter-\n esting. Meeting him casually in the street,\n or, in a throng, the more careless even\n would be attracted and impressed by him,\n yet in outward appearance he is far removed\n from the popular ideal of a great man. It\n would not be said of him as was said of\n Daniel Webster in London that \u201cno one was\n ever so great as he looked to be.\u201d He does\n not measure up to that ideal so finely ex-\n pressed in Bismarck, nor even in Gladstone,\n who, if he had not the height, had the bulk.\n As a matter of fact. Dr. Buckley is rather\n insignificant as to frame. It is his head and\n face that take and hold attention. Candor\n compels the statement that it is not the\n beauty and regularity of his features that is\n impressive, but rather the massiveness of\n the head, the intellectual strength and power\n stamped on the face and those remarkable\n eyes \u2014 glowing, absorbing, penetrating, all\n embracing. It may be surprising to those\n who have never seen Dr. Buckley, but know\n of him as a controversial gladiator who re-\n ceives the hard blows he invites gayly and\n returns them with a joyous laugh, that he\n is a man of under size, of a frame so slight\n that it would seem as if his head had gotten\n astray from its proper body and had been\n joined to one barely, if at all, able to sup-\n port it. Yet withal there is no suggestion\n of feebleness or want of vigor. Indeed, vigor\n is characteristic of every motion and ges-\n ture. Dr. Buckley has fought a battle for\n health and strength, his whole life long.\n Consumption carried off two generations of\n his forbears, and when as a child his frail\n body and disproportionate mental endow-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0016/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0016/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0016/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0016/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0016/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0016.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 845986}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"16\">\n<p>\n 14\n</p>\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n ment were observed, it was feared the dread\n disease would be his inheritance. Predictions\n that he would not reach manhood were rife\n in his family. In these later years, as he\n has approached and passed the 60 mark, he\n has taken on more flesh, and this condition,\n as well as his age, has been reached after\n his long battle has been won, and won by\n subordinating his life, rigorously, to the\n laws and practices that make for health and\n strength. And in the waging of this long\n battle may be found two great qualities of\n the man \u2014 devotion to purpose and thorough-\n ness. During forty years he has permitted\n nothing to interfere with the scheme laid\n out for his battle for life and strength and\n usefulness. Before that scheme was laid he\n had fortified himself with knowledge of the\n requirements so thoroughly that he had be-\n come as learned on the subject of conserving\n health and promoting strength as a specialist,\n and this scheme once determined upon has\n been strictly adhered to throughout a life\n that has been studious and laborious,\n charged with duty and freighted with re-\n sponsibility, carrying burdens from which\n most men would shrink. Starting life so\n heavily handicapped, he has by his own ef-\n forts won the battle, shirking no duty, avoid-\n ing no obligation, evading no labor and ac-\n complishing what men blessed with native\n strength do, until, reaching the age when its\n signs might be exhibited on his body, he\n looks to be ten years younger than he is.\n His physical condition of to-day is a tri-\n umph of thoroughness.\n</p>\n<p>\n Like most men who accomplish many things\n in this world. Dr. Buckley seems never to be\n pressed for time or so absorbed in any one\n thing that he cannot readily turn to the con-\n sideration of another. He is approachable,\n always cheerful, and possesses the great gift\n of an equable temper, working without fric-\n tion. If he has nerves, which might well be\n supposed from his vivacity and alertness, he\n has suppressed them, or at least subjected\n them to absolute control. Singularly free\n from affectations, there is in him never the\n assumption of superiority or of ministerial\n authority. Frank and open in his address,\n his manners are simple without humility. He\n is positive without dogmatism and inquiring\n without curiosity. Every man approaching him\n Is an oyster for him to open to obtain the\n pearl of information the man may contain.\n Stupid and ignorant indeed must that man be\n from whom Dr. Buckley cannot in a ten min-\n utes\u2019 conversation extract something of value\n to himself. In all this theTe is no posing, but\n the utmost simplicity and sincerity. Few can\n spend even a few r moments in conversation\n with him without being impressed with the\n energy of his mind, Its alertness, its swiftness\n and precision of movement. There is a sug-\n gestion of camaraderie in his manner that\n puts the humblest at ease with him. In the\n realms of politics he would have been a great\n leader, for he knows well how to get down\n to the hearts and understanding of men with-\n out loss of dignity to himself.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Buckley is not a genius in the sense\n \u2018he word is usually employed. If the defini-\n tion that it is a capacity for taking infinite\n pains be accepted, or, as Horace Greeley puts\n it, the ability to do hard work, then he is.\n But he is blessed with certain native girts. A\n marvelous memory is chief among them. This\n is almost phenomenal, if certain feats per-\n formed by him are accurately reported. It\n is alleged that he can permit one to open at\n random a volume or Shakspeare and read a\n speech therefrom, when he will take up the\n following speech and recite the play to the\n end of the act. What, it is asserted, makes\n this the more remarkable is that this knowl-\n</p>\n<p>\n edge of Shakspeare was acquired before he\n reached the age of manhood, and has not\n since been a study with him. It is also re-\n ported of him that he can read a column of\n advertisements of a paper once attentively\n and repeat it accurately. Whether these re-\n ports be true or not, those closely associated\n with him know that his head is a tar barrel\n in which everything that goes in sticks and\n ever after is ready for instant use. How-\n ever, it is the reasoning faculty that is the\n predominating feature in Dr. Buckley\u2019s men-\n tal make-up. He is a natural logician, and\n would reason directly and accurately had he\n never read a page of logic. But he has had\n a love for the science, and his natural powers\n have been so trained and disciplined in that\n study that the technique of the science and\n his natural mental impulses have become one\n and inseparable. His power to order, arrange\n and classify a question or subject presented\n for consideration is intuitive and instantane-\n ous. The two faculties are closely related,\n and when taken with his concentrative pow-\n er explains that ability to think and reason\n and speak so clearly on his feet. Indeed,\n in debate, where he shines to the greatest\n advantage, his speeches are largely the out-\n spoken processes of his reasoning faculties.\n With him it is reason always. Appeals to\n him must be made through these faculties.\n He must understand before he accepts. The\n creed he practices, preaches and promotes is\n based on faith. It is not to be determined,\n perhaps, but a knowledge of the man suggests\n that faith came to him only after he had\n been convinced by logical deduction that there\n is one God and Jesus Christ, His Son. No\n irreverence is here intended or attempted.\n The man treated could not believe without\n proof. Not that he called for a sign, but his\n way to faith was through the mazes of log-\n ical process, step by step. His father was\n a minister of the Methodist church; his\n mother, a woman of very superior mind, was\n devoted to her faith, and from the earliest\n consciousness he breathed in his home the\n atmosphere of the doctrines of the Christian\n religion and of the Methodist church, yet\n it is ventured confidently that he held all in\n abeyance until he had been convinced\n through his own intellectual processes of the\n truth of that which had been instilled in his\n earliest teachings. It is the man, and must\n be so in all things. The emotional side is\n dominated by the intellectual, and he must\n reason. As he demands, so he gives. He\n proves what he states. He seeks in all his\n efforts to convince, and rarely if ever ap-\n peals, and when he does it is after he knows\n he has proved his position and believes that\n conviction should have resulted. As all things\n must appeal to his intellect to receive consid-\n eration, so he appeals to the intellects of oth-\n ers. This has led to the assertion that he is\n cold. It is not so, and is only stated ac-\n curately when it is asserted that the intel-\n lect is the outer wall and the impulses and\n emotions the citadel.\n</p>\n<p>\n Consider this feature with the thoroughness\n which knows no limit till the last result is\n explored, which can be content with nothing\n less than all there is to be known of the sub- !\n ject in hand, together with his wonderful\n memory, and something of the power of the\n man can be comprehended. When you add to\n this thb results of a wide reading and inves-\n tigation which seems to have touched nearly\n every branch of human interest, force of char-\n acter, will, courage, self control, a flashing\n wit, keen humor and an extraordinary power\n of repartee, one comes to understand why\n he is feared in controversy and is so powerful\n in debate. A voice clear, resonant and power-\n ful and an enunciation well nigh perfect, are\n</p>\n<p>\n efficient aids. \u201cA great lawyer spoiled in a\n minister,\u201d said a former jurist, who had\n heard him in the statement of a case which\n related more to the organization of his church\n than to the end for which the organization\n was made. \u201cWere he in the Senate he would\n be omnipotent there,\u201d said a United States\n Senator, who, listening, saw him emerge tri-\n umphant from debate which had begun with\n the deciding quantities arrayed against him.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is nearly a quarter of a century since he\n was elected by a general conference of that\n time to be the editor of the Christian Advo-\n cate, the church paper. Every four years\n since he has been re-elected, as he was this\n year for another four years. Under his hands\n the journal has come to rank with the best\n of the religious newspapers. He has thor-\n oughly impressed himself upon the paper and\n its qualities are his own \u2014 vigorous, contro-\n versial and aggressive. And as he is in de-\n bate, so is he in the conduct of the paper,\n imparting to it his own scholarliness, his ac-\n curacy and his learning. Apart from the aid\n and support it may give to the denomination,\n the organ of which it is, the Christian Advo-\n cate is a distinct force in the country for cul-\n ture, morals, right living and right thinking,\n and is so recognized. The man in his catho-\n licity may be read in that paper. The greater\n portion of his life as on ordained minister\n of the Methodist church has been spent in the\n editorial chair. Prior to that time he was in\n the ranks of the itineracy as a pastor of\n churches, passing from one to the other, as is,\n or was, the custom of that church. And in\n that time he was pastor of both the Hanson\n Place and the Washington Avenue M. E.\n Church of this city. And here he was recog-\n nized as a power in the pulpit. This is a side\n that has not been considered \u2014 and is some-\n what difficult to treat properly.\n</p>\n<p>\n One great equipment as a speaker in public\n that he possesses is a voice clarion-like in its\n clearness, resonance and power. Exquisitely\n trained, it is his obedient servant, under his\n perfect control. Here, in the pulpit or on the\n lecture rostrum, which he often mounts, the\n qualities noted above appear. His is not fer-\n vid oratory. Eloquent, in the sense that he\n embellishes his speech wdth opulent rhetoric,\n flights of fancy, captivating periods, warm\n imagery, he is not. That profound intel-\n lect there appears in its most satisfying guise,\n still arguing, still presenting proof, still forc-\n ing argument with irresistible logic, still\n seeking to convince rather than to plead and\n persuade. Dr. Buckley could not, if he tried,\n be a popular preacher, as the term goes. He\n is too sincere, too much in earnest to resort\n to efforts to tickle the fancy. He has a mes-\n sage to bear and he sets about it in a way\n that wili carry that message with the great-\n est force and power. In this effort he has\n achieved a style that is the perfection of sim-\n plicity, pure and chaste, w ' hieh with his lu-\n cidity makes dark things plain to the hum-\n blest intelligence, while he holds the rapt at-\n tention of the learned and the thoughtful.\n Never, in the sense that Beecher, or the re-\n cently mourned Storrs were, is he an orator.\n Yet he commands and sways vast audiences.\n An humble m an of little education and no\n piety listened to him within a year, through\n i the accident of a funeral ceremony at which\n Dr. Buckley pronounced the address, with\n open-eyed interest, and said at the end, \" If\n I heard that man many times I\u2019d be going to\n church every Sunday. He\u2019d make me. And\n if I heard him all the time I\u2019d believe just as\n he does.\u201d It was an unstudied and impulsive\n tribute and a revelation of the personal power\n of the man. This chaste and simple style is\n an attainment, reached through effort and\n rigid self disciplining, and while it was being\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0017/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 348, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 496}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0017/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 697, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 992}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0017/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1394, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1985}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0017/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2788, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3971}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0017/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0017.jp2", "height": 3971, "width": 2788, "levels": 6, "size": 849651}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"17\">\n<p>\n STUDIES IN ' AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15\n</p>\n<p>\n THE REV.

Blessed with some rare gifts,\n he has not been satisfied with their mere\n possession, but by sedulous cultivation has\n brought them to the highest degree he could.\n</p>\n<p>\n Other faculties he did not possess in the same\n degree he has nourished and educated and\n skilled until he is a fine specimen of the all-\n round man of rare culture and a conspicuous\n instance of what self-examination and self-\n cultivation will do.\n</p>\n<p>\n His activities are not confined to appear-\n ances in the pulpit and the conduct of the\n paper in his charge. He bears his part in\n the organizing work of the church as a\n member of several controlling committees,\n notably the missionary, and is intensely in-\n terested in the educational work, being on\n the boards of several institutions, his closest\n identification being with the Drew Seminary\n of Madison, N. J., the leading divinity school\n of the church. With a Brooklyn institution,\n the Seney Hospital, he has been identified\n since its inception, and its establishment\n was, in fact, inspired by him when pastor\n here. In addition, for ten years he has been\n one of the medical committee of the board of\n managers of the State Hospitals for the In-\n sane of New Jersey, president of the board of\n trustees of the New Jersey State Epileptic\n Village and of the Medico Psychological As-\n sociation of the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n In morals he describes himself as a Puritan\n of Puritans. If he is it is without the nar-\n rowness and intolerance supposed to accom-\n pany that character. He is too much of a\n philosopher, too great a student of human\n nature, not to recognize the tendencies and\n inclinations of mankind to be intolerant and\n proscriptive. Those who have followed him\n in the recent debates will discover that he\n believes that men are to be led into better\n ways of life rather through moral develop-\n ment than through restrictive laws. His\n own life has been a strict adherence to moral\n lines, but he freely admits that he has had\n temptations. So human a man could not have\n been without them, but they have been of the\n minor or carnal, for his tendencies toward\n the higher moralities are unmistakable. From\n these it is doubtful if there has been devia-\n tion. for he sees too clearly the dividing line,\n even when it is faint, to deviate without hy-\n pocrisy and there is none in his makeup.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the effort t < #point out the predominating\n feature in the intellectual equipment of Dr.\n Buckley it was said above that by it his emo-\n tional side was dominated. By this it is not\n to be understood that that side has been\n repressed out of existence. He is not an\n emotional man, nor one of impulses, nor of\n quick sympathies, but he is a man of strong\n affections. He was a dutiful and affectionate\n son, is a devoted husband and father and\n grips his friends to himself \u201cwith hoops of\n steel,\u201d many of whom he has in all walks of\n life and in many countries. He is generous\n and benevolent, efficient and frequent in aid-\n ing the struggling and the unfortunate, never\n from caprice and rarely from impulse, yet he\n possesses many of those virtues supposed to\n have their home and motive power in the\n sympathetic impulses. Over all is a judicial\n temperament acting on his character as the\n governor does on an engine. As a companion\n he is delightful. With a temper under control,\n he may be stern, imperative and determined,\n but he is always just and never angry.\n Jovial in the private circle, he is never sen-\n sitive as to his dignity, nor concerned lest\n people should not know how learned he is.\n Vivacious, witty, humorous, he abounds in\n anecdote and is always interesting.\n</p>\n<p>\n Preacher, journalist, author, moralist,\n teacher, philanthropist, scientist, orator,\n debater; strong in character, profound in in-\n tellect, learned in books, in men and in the\n world, in active sympathy with civilization,\n and an efficient aid in its progress, supreme\n in some of his aspects and superior in all,\n james Monroe Buckley is, indeed, what Is\n too often carelessly termed a great man.\n</p>\n<p>\n accomplished it was through extemporaneous\n speaking, which he has brought also to per-\n fection. On this he is an authority. Not\n long ago he published a work on the subject,\n which was accepted as an exhaustive treat-\n ment wherein the last word has been said,\n and which has been adopted as a text book in\n most of the divinity schools and in some of the\n universities. When it is realized that he\n never writes his sermons or even carries\n notes into the pulpit, the chastity and sim-\n</p>\n<p>\n est pitch and in which clarity and perspicuity\n when dealing with the most abstruse sub-\n jects are noticeable qualities. These books\n are not all dealing with church or religious\n topics, not a few being the records of his\n travels, which have embraced nearly the\n known world, led thereto not in the curiosity\n of a sightseer, but that he might investigate\n and study the various phases of civilization\n at first hand. The subjects are singularly\n broad, as the following titles indicate: \u201cSup-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0018/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0018/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0018/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0018/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0018/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0018.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 768951}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"18\">\n<p>\n Michael Augustine Corrigan.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE ARCHBISHOP OF NEW YORK,\n SCHOLAR, ADMINISTRATOR, FINANCIER;\n</p>\n<p>\n T HE Arch Diocese of New York is the\n greatest Catholic see in Christendom.\n The degree of this statement is sus-\n tained by comparative statistics. In im-\n portance it far exceeds that of any other on\n this hemisphere, because, if for no other rea-\n son, of its location, its area and of the vast\n interests, civil, social, financial and com-\n mercial, embraced within it. Its location, sit-\n ting as it does at the gateway of the repub-\n lic, alone makes it important. Its area is\n co-existent with the counties of New York,\n Westchester, Putnam, Dutchess, Ulster, Sul-\n livan, Orange, Rockland and Richmond, and\n it embraces as well the Bahama Islands.\n This district is of itself so important that\n anything significant within is thereby im-\n portant, for within that district is found\n three of the five boroughs \u2014 Manhattan, Bronx\n and Richmond \u2014 of the second city of the\n world, and four distinct cities \u2014 Yonkers,\n Poughkeepsie, Kingston and Newburgh.\n There is a greater population, a greater civ-\n ilization, a greater commerce and a greater\n wealth than can be found in any area of\n similar extent in the new world. It is\n not alone great among the sees of this new\n world, but it is of the first rank and of such\n superior importance in the consideration of\n matters purely churchly and of achievements\n toward the end which are tlfe reasons of its\n existence, among all the dioceses of the\n Christian world.\n</p>\n<p>\n Th9 facts set forth above contribute to its\n standing, but its greatness is chiefly due to\n its wonderful spiritual energy and the ae.\n tive charitable and educational work done by\n it. It is the labor performed on this line\n and the triumphs achieved that have placed\n the diocese among the first, if not in advance,\n of all others. Within it is a Catholic popu-\n lation of 1^00,000. The central and radiating\n point of influence is the magnificent cathe-\n dral in the Borough of Manhattan, but apart\n from it there are over three hundred\n churches, in connection with which six hun-\n dred ordained priests minister to the spirit-\n ual needs of this enormous population, com-\n forting in affliction, advising in health, in-\n structing in morals, burying its dead, marry-\n ing its young, baptizing its infants. Some\n idea of this activity can be gained from an\n authoritative statement of the head of the\n diocese that within the space of a single year\n 3,090,430 communions were distributed and\n that during the ten years that ended with\n 1899, 136,823 children and adults had been\n prepared for confirmation and 1,320,029 con-\n fessions heard; of baptisms, 330,434; of mar-\n riages, 75,142. Great as this spiritual work\n is, with its constant and beneficent influence,\n unceasingly exerted, it is not all the labor of\n the church within the diocese.\n</p>\n<p>\n The educational scheme, instituted, guided\n</p>\n<p>\n and sustained by it, is vast. There is a\n theological seminary wherein 200 young men\n are trained for religious work; there are\n four colleges with over 1,500 students, their\n ample corps of instructors mostly drawn\n from the clerical ranks; 20 academies for boys\n and 35 for girls, with over 3,500 scholars;\n and 200 parochial schools on whose rolls are\n the names of 68,000 children, under the guid-\n ance of 500 brothers and at least a similar\n number of religious women. With these are\n classed, though they could properly be\n ranked in the charities organization, eight\n orphanage schools with over 3,000 pupils and\n nine industrial and reform schools, with 3,500\n inmates. In the consideration of these opu-\n lent figures one is apt to lose sight of the\n fact that they are those of a single diocese of\n a single religious denomination.\n</p>\n<p>\n The scheme of charities is even greater.\n Maintained through the efforts of the church\n within this diocese are 20 homes for destitute\n children with nearly 10,000 annually cared\n for; ten orphan asylums wherein 3,000 par-\n entless children are sheltered; ten hospitals\n where 6,000 sufferers are ministered to; a\n foundling asylum with 2,000 inmates worse\n than parentless, for they would ' be friendless\n but for the tender care of the church; three\n houses for the aged, where the declining lives\n of a thousand are made comfortable; and an\n insane asylum in which there are rarely less\n than 150. In immediate attendance on these\n institutions are about 2,500 religious women\n who, under vows, have devoted themselves\n to works of charity and mercy. Nor is the\n tale of this work of beneficence ended here.\n During the year 1899, 160,633 Catholic emi-\n grants landed in this country. All of these\n have been watched over and cared for by\n organized effort. Fostered by the church, in-\n spired by it, are societies and associations,\n aids in one way or another to the organized\n works of the church, whose membership can-\n not be far from 25,000.\n</p>\n<p>\n These figures, which are rather an under-\n statement than otherwise, since they are not\n absolutely the last statistics, may be com-\n pared with those of any see in Christendom i\n and the result must be a demonstration that,\n in the work of church advancement, of char-\n ity, of education, and, as a distinguished lay-\n man of the diocese recently put it in a\n speech, \u201cin whatever might be to the credit\n of God and the church,\u201d it is indeed the\n greatest see in Christendom. Others, in\n older countries, may present finer temples,\n but none roofs covering a greater multitude\n of worshipers and none can show broader\n or such efficient schemes for the educatien\n of the masses and the care of the destitute\n and helpless. Yet bare statistics do not\n inform as to the magnitude of this work,\n uor the anxious and almost superhuman la-\n bor that lies back of it. Here are over three\n</p>\n<p>\n hundred church edifices ranging in degrees\n of size and cost from the stately cathedral\n on Fifth avenue to the humble little frame\n structure that raises its cross among the\n trees of the countryside; large structures\n sheltering twenty-five thousand souls \u2014 more\n than constitute the population of many a\n city; buildings to bouse for given hours of\n the day from sixty to seventy thousand, all\n of which if grouped together would make a\n superb and large village, in all a property,\n the material value of which, in land and\n brick and mortar, is not less than $50,000,000,\n built from nothing but charity \u2014 from the\n gifts of the faithful. The state and its civil\n divisions has its charity institutions, but\n their erections have been begun in the se-\n curity of the taxing power. The church au-\n thorities of this diocese have built up this\n magnificent property secure only in tbe\n energy and devotion of the clergy and in\n faith in the fruits of the teachings of the\n church and the charitable impulses of the\n taught. Out of this has come this great prop-\n erty of $50,000,000, the debt on which does\n not exceed $6,000,000.\n</p>\n<p>\n But when built, when in successful opera-\n tion, with debt removed, as it coustautly is\n being reduced, it is not like other great\n properties, income producing. It was not ac-\n cumulated for that purpose. On the contrary,\n its maintenance and the purpose for which\n it w r as brought into existence, is a constant\n and an ever pressing burden. The mere la-\n bor of conducting and managing such a vast\n educational and charitable scheme is prodigi-\n ous, but to it must be added the task of\n financiering for it, made all the more diffi-\n cult in its condition that it must alw r ays be\n problematical and one of emergency, and\n when it is considered that no matter how the\n work may be divided and systematized, it\n finally comes to one mind for final approval,\n disposition and order \u2014 that one mind must\n give actual impulse and direction to the\n whole of the intricate machinery of church\n government as well as to the motion of the\n educational and charitable institutions, and\n can do so only by having at his ready com-\n mand the details of these many and complex\n interests, the wonder is what sort of man\n must be Michael Augustine Corrigan, who is\n that man \u2014 the Archbishop of this great dio-\n cese, the motive spring, the source of all\n power ecclesiastical, within it.\n</p>\n<p>\n It goes with the saying that, as he is\n Archbishop of the diocese, he is a great man.\n There never was a greater democracy than\n the Catholic Church. Positions and digni-\n ties in that church are reached only after an\n ordeal that makes sure that the fittest sur-\n vive; There is, then, no royal road to prefer-\n ment.

The priest who is advanced to high\n places is, in my observation, the one who dis-\n charges his functions, responsibilities and of-\n fices with all the powers of his mind and\n heart and without regard or thought as to\n what follows their discharge. An acute and\n anxious intelligence is watching, measuring\n and weighing us all for the glory and progress\n of the church, and it is not the aspiring, but\n those who do greatly what they have to do,\n who are led up to and installed in the higher\n places. Men only do things greatly when they\n do them with a single heart and a mind un-\n</p>\n<p>\n accompanied by a capacity to meet and mas-\n ter every responsibility that is put upon him.\n Such timidity as may result from such modest\n self-appreciation is shown in the anticipation\n and not in the conflict. Once in action, the\n powers of that keen and masterful intellect\n are discovered, equal to any task that has\n been set before it, gripping it with strength\n and energy, inspiring confidence, and enlist-\n ing obedient and devoted aid. The most con-\n spicuous traits of the Archbishop are bis mod-\n esty, gentleness and tenderness. These are\n apparent to the most careless observer. But\n if such observer were thereby to argue weak-\n ness or vacillation as concomitants a most\n egregious error would result. Under this gen-\n tle demeanor and tender speech there is a\n firmness that is strength itself. A brother\n</p>\n<p>\n (Photo by Anderson, 258 Fifth avenue, New York.)\n</p>\n<p>\n ARCHBISHOP CORRIGAN.\n</p>\n<p>\n corroded by ambitious desires. Thus it is\n that, almost universally, the higher the dig-\n nity the more modest and self-repressed is\n the man who wears the dignity.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This gentleman might have had in mind\n the Archbishop of New York, for the latter\u2019s\n modesty and single-heartedness have not been\n lost in assuming the burdens and heavy re-\n sponsibilities of the See of New York. It is\n related and on the best of authority that\n when Bishop Corrigan \u2014 as he was then \u2014 of\n the Newark diocese w\u2019as advised by Cardinal\n McCloskey that he had been selected as arch-\n bishop-coadjutor for the See of New York,\n with the right of succession, the bishop\n shrank from his new honors and responsibili-\n ties and actually beseeched his Eminence, the\n Cardinal, to reconsider the determination,\n since he felt too strongly his unworthiness for\n such great responsibilities as were involved\n in the direction of the See of New York.\n Modesty is an essential characteristic of the\n prelate. But it is not in his case, as it is\n in some, obstructing and enervating, for it i3\n</p>\n<p>\n prelate happily described him as \u201ca moss\n covered rock.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In an attempted analysis of the Archbishop\n one is met with complexities that at the out-\n set seem like contradictions and incongrui-\n ties: nor can this complex character be prop-\n erly estimated and understood without first\n realizing that it is one perfected, disciplined\n and chastened in a piety that is profound, self\n denying and rigorous in its self application.\n With that fact held ever in view much that\n seems contradictory and incongruous can be\n adjusted into perfect relationship. A pe-\n culiar assertiveness under conditions that he\n deems necessary does not seem to comport\n with the other statement that he evades the\n applause of the public or of his followers;\n that gentleness is a most conspicuous trait\n in him, yet on conclusions he is so immova-\n ble that attack is considered useless; that he\n is an executant of marvelous facility and yet\n is a scholar so .learned in the recondite as to\n be the marvel of other scholars. One cannot\n describe with even an approach to accuracy,\n</p>\n<p>\n this extraordinary character without going\n into the subtleties. It is so nicely rounded,\n so perfectly adjusted that there are few an-\n gularities or irregularities that can be seized\n upon and so the picturesque and spectacular\n elements are out. His native gifts were\n those of a most vigorous understanding, an\n indefatigable energy, extraordinary powers of\n concentration and an aggressive force that\n acknowledges ro obstacle. These, in his train-\n ing and upgrowth have been so cultivated or\n repressed or disciplined that they must now\n be reached for under an exterior of profound\n culture and exquisite refinement.\n</p>\n<p>\n He is a man of scholarly attainments, broad\n and deep, which has not stopped at the litera-\n ture of his church, as enormous as that is,\n but embraces the efforts of the ages. This\n attainment was reached con amore and it is\n believed that the most congenial service\n of his life was while he was at the head, as\n president, of that celebrated school of learn-\n ing, Seton Hall College. His translation to\n the See of Newark was perhaps an interrup-\n tion in his scheme of study, but only an inter-\n ruption. When he was elevated to the arch-\n episcopal see of Petra and made coadjutor\n to his Eminence, Cardinal McCloskey, pos-\n sibly his career as a student came to an end\n in the surging sea of practical duties rolling\n in on him. But that was only ten years ago,\n and by that time, it is the belief of many,\n that if he had not accomplished all learning,\n he had explored all its fields. This great\n scholarship is manifest in all his writings and\n public utterances, not in the ostentatious dis-\n play of learning or abstruse illustration, but\n in the disciplining that has resulted in a sim-\n plicity of utterance and an elevation of\n thought. As an orator the archbishop lacks\n some of the physical qualities, but there is\n no want of logic, of orderly presentation of\n ideas, of thought, of language perfect in sim-\n plicity and felicity. Fervor there is in his\n speech; but it is the fervor of piety, not of\n emotions. His appeals are to the heart, the\n conscience and the moral understanding; not\n to fancy or to imagination. It is believed by\n those in close relationship with his Grace that\n if he found he had been betrayed into a rhetor-\n ic that had appealed solely to the imagination\n and had given pleasure purely as a literary\n execution, it would be a sorrow with him to\n be endured until time presented an opportun-\n ity for correction. But whether with the pen\n or the tongue his outputs are models of En-\n glish, the style of which seems to have been\n chastened to the last point and the very per-\n fection of simplicity; if there be illustration\n it is not for display, but to make clear a\n doubtful passage or sustain a point of argu-\n mentation and when made seems to be the\n most apt that could have been chosen.\n</p>\n<p>\n With this profound scholarship it is hardly\n expected to find a rare executive capacity.\n The union of the reflective and executive\n faculties is a rare one. But it is found in\n Archbishop Corrigan. Indeed, those brought\n into close contact with the head of the diocese\n are wonder-struck over his administrative\n abilities. He is method itself.

Once set forth, the\n enormous and ever present difficulties can\n be appreciated for they appeal forcibly to\n the understanding \u2014 these large asylums and\n homes for the destitute and helpless. But\n there is yet another side and another pres-\n sure that is not so w r ell known. In the or-\n ganization of the practical work of the church\n every parish priest must make frequent re-\n ports at stated intervals of the material as\n W\u2019ell as spiritual condition of his parish to\n the Archbishop. It may not be known even\n to the strict churchman that when a parish\n priest receives permission to undertake an\n improvement or an addition in his parish\n which incurs debt, the Archbishop goes on the\n bond. The fact that he dpes do so is the ap-\n proval of the work suggested; that he docs\n not, its condemnation and suspension. Either\n decision is only reached after an exhaustive\n examination and as the work w-ithin every\n one of the three hundred parishes of the dio-\n cese is active, energetic, indeed, aggressive,\n the work in this department alone, prepara-\n tory to determination, is seen at a glance\n and must call for an exercise of financiering\n ability, the grade of which is attested in the\n fact that with the end of 1899 there is shown\n a property the value of which is between\n $50,000,000 and $60,000,000, on which there is\n now only a debt not exceeding $6,000,000; the\n interest is so promptly met that in money\n lending circles such security is marked \u2018\u2018gilt\n edged.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n To find a man who is at once a profound\n scholar, a great administrator, a successful\n financier, and in himself an efficient provider\n of ways and means is certainly to find one who\n confounds settled conclusions and presents a\n unique and interesting study.\n</p>\n<p>\n The reasoning faculties are the strongest\n in the mental make-up of this prelate and his\n processes are by no means slow. His grasp\n of all subjects presented to his consideration\n Is strong, vigorous and masculine and yet\n</p>\n<p>\n so rapid are his conclusions, so intuitional,\n that the quality seems to be almost feminine.\n But if a conclusion of moment is demanded\n of him his utterance of it is only after a care-\n ful deliberation. Perhaps he himself is aware\n that if his stand is once taken it is taken for\n all time. Firmness and decision seem to be\n the strong qualities. He is a strict construc-\n tionist of the tenets and laws of the church.\n The habit of his mind is conservative. Group\n these things and one can see w r hy he is\n thought to be a strict ruler. As he has given\n in himself to the supremacy of the church\n and its higher authorities, obedient to every\n law and absolutely submissive to every tenet\n of faith, so he expects all this from those\n over whom he is in authority. This has more\n than once brought about conflict. When the\n philosophy of Henry George came under con-\n sideration the Archbishop\u2019s interpretation of\n it was that it was inconsistent with the teach-\n ing of the church. That conclusion once\n reached it became law to be observed.\n Whether his interpretation was true or not\n is not here discussed, but it is but just to set\n dow-n that his views v T ere adopted by Rome.\n A controversy arose over the application of\n his interpretation to the clergy of the diocese,\n which was most emphatic in the McGlynn\n incident. Through it certain qualities of the\n Archbishop were strongly impressed on the\n general public and these were his firmness\n and determination, which have led to his\n being likened to a moss covered rock.\n</p>\n<p>\n . If any one were to infer from this that the\n Archbishop is intolerant of opposition and ar-\n rogant of opinion, grievous error would be\n made. After all his frame of mind is judi-\n cial. He listens during the time preceding\n conclusion with patience, is never impetuous\n in reaching the end, and in momentous af-\n fairs approaches such conclusions only with\n great deliberation and much weighing and\n reduction of conflicting opinion and argument.\n But the conclusion reached and the decision\n made he is adamant. The Archbishop is not\n ambitious. His interests, hopes and aspira-\n tions begin -with his diocese and end with it.\n He has no life apart from it. Recently there\n has sprung up a sentiment within the church\n of which Archbishop Ireland seems to be the\n conspicuous representative, called American-\n ism. It is difficult to understand just what it\n contends for. It appears to be one of those\n contentions which the more mistily it\n is talked about the more profound and\n important it appears to be. It seems\n to bo a sublimated regard for liberty,\n but which does not contemplate the throw-\n ing off of a single shackle or obligation to the\n authority of the church. It would give a de-\n votional regard for American liberty and\n American institutions, but it is difficult to\n see that greater liberty of action to priest or\n prelate is contended for. The movement and\n end of it i3 illusive \u2014 difficult to fix and has\n met with opposition first, perhaps, in the in-\n sinuation, latent or concealed, that those who\n do not move with it are opposed to American\n institutions, which is by no means a logical\n conclusion, yet is vexatious and annoying; and,\n secondly, that in its tendency it is danger-\n ous, leading to conditions that were seen in the\n French Revolution. To a man of the mental\n make up of Archbishop Corrigan, so embued\n with a profound piety, so convinced of the di-\n vine mission of the church in the salvation of\n souls and whose intellect i3 of such a prac-\n tical cast, the movement could have no at-\n traction for him, but rather his condemnation.\n \u2019Phis has led many to believe that he is not\n only in opposition to Archbishop Ireland, but\n is endeavoring to advance to a leadership in\n the affairs of the church without his diocese,\n on this continent This is complete error.\n</p>\n<p>\n As was said before, he has neither ambition\n nor life apart from his diocese. His only\n wish is to be permitted to advance the work of\n the church within it, to meet its needs and\n promote its interests there. And he wishes\n to do this quietly without the blare of trum-\n pets and the beating of drums.\n</p>\n<p>\n He has not been free from attack from this\n country at Rome. Some time it has assumed\n formidable aspect, sufficient to give his\n friends and well wishers alarm for the conse-\n quence, but they report that he has moved\n through it all with a serene and lofty cour-\n age, answering w r hen required by the author-\n ities and in such a way that respect for him\n was gained in the very places where it was\n hoped to do him harm. In the end the point\n is reached wherein it is clear that he is held\n in the highest esteem by the Pope himself\n and the authorities surrounding him. This\n was made conspicuously plain very recently.\n The Archbishop is now on his prescribed visit\n to Rome, known as the visit ad Limina, made\n by the American bishops every ten years to\n report to the Holy Father the condition\n of the diocese. This summer Rome is filled\n with prelates and church dignitaries, and in\n order to expedite the audiences, as well as to\n conserve the health and strength of Pope Leo\n XIII the bishops have been received by him\n in groups of four or eight and none given in-\n dividually. Yet in the case of Archbishop\n Corrigan, by the express direction of the\n Holy Father, an individual reception rvas\n given to him and he was detained an hour.\n Subsequently he was summoned to a second\n individual audience, again held an hour and\n on this occasion permitted to present such\n as he desired should accompany him. In the\n form and etiquette of the Vatican this was\n such an unusual and conspicuous mark of re-\n gard as to excite widespread comment in\n Rome.\n</p>\n<p>\n The gentleness of manner of the Arch-\n bishop, his modest se ' .f-appraisement, and his\n priestly and churchly virtues, have been\n placed in contrast with his adamantine firm-\n ness. In a dispassionate examination of bis\n character it is impossible to escape the con-\n viction that this quality of strength and forco\n is native and that the qualities which now\n shine conspicuously on the surface are the\n result of a profound piety that has sweetened\n his nature and increased his humility. He is\n a man of strong affection, bound firmly to hi3\n friends, but so high is his devotional regard\n for his office and the church and so sharply\n defined to him is his judicial relation to his\n high office that he sees solely in his love for\n his friend no reason for bestowing the\n church\u2019s favor on him. \u201cIndeed,\u201d said a\n church dignitary of him, \u201cif your qualities\n were such as did not commend you to Ms\n liking aud could not excite his love of you,\n you would never know it by his manner, nor\n would it prevent him from advancing you to\n the work wffiich in his calm judgment you\n were fitted to do.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It is the ambition of his friends within his\n cioces 9 that the red hat of the cardinal\n should be ' bestowed on the Archbishop. In-\n deed, by them it is believed that the time\n is not far distant when it w-ill be conferred.\n While they hope and would rejoice in the\n consummation of their wishes, it is known, to\n them that the Archbishop shrinks from the\n additional honor and would have it pass to\n others who in his humility he believts to be\n more w ' orthy to wear it. The importance of\n his see justifies the expectation and the\n character, abilities and attainments of the\n priest justify its bestowal, though he wishes\n for no higher title than that of Chief Pastor\n of the Diocese.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0021/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 345, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 493}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0021/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 691, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 987}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0021/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1383, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1975}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0021/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2767, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3950}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0021/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0021.jp2", "height": 3950, "width": 2767, "levels": 6, "size": 714585}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"21\">\n<p>\n Janies, Cardinal Gibbons*\n</p>\n<p>\n MARVELOUS RAPIDITY OF HIS ADVANCE.\n HIS INTELLECTUAL BRILLIANCY AND FORCE.\n</p>\n<p>\n T HERE is distinction in the Catholic\n diocese of Baltimore. It is the old-\n est and the primary see of this\n country; it is an arch diocese; its chief\n pastor is Archbishop-primate of America\n by virtue of his holding; its adminis-\n tration has been distinguished by a long\n line of able prelates; and it has traditions\n inseparable from the history of its region \u2014\n for its area, in its settlement, was as surely\n devoted to the faith of the Roman Catholic\n Church, as was the region of Plymouth in\n Massachusetts to the maintenance of the\n faith and contentions of the Puritans.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many things have combined to elevate the\n see of Baltimore into a position of peculiar\n and singular distinction among those dioceses\n which have grown up behind it. Others may\n in the lapse of time have become greater in\n population, in wealth, in the number of its\n churches and its institutions, but so much of\n the history of the growth of the Catholic\n Church in America is bound up in its history,\n such distinguished prelates have directed its\n course, such energy in promotion of the\n church interests have issued from it, that not\n alone because it is the primate see is it\n the most important diocese of America. And\n it follows that the chief pastor of so import-\n ant a see must thereby be the most distin-\n guished among the hierarchy. In the case\n of the present head there is another and ad-\n ditional reason and that is that he is a prince\n of the church, a member of the sacred col-\n lege, for he is James, Cardinal Gibbons,\n Archbishop of Baltimore, primate of America.\n</p>\n<p>\n His eminence was early marked for distinc-\n tion, and his rise was astonishingly rapid.\n Born in Baltimore, in 1834, he is now 66\n years old, but as he has now worn the red\n hat for fourteen years, it will be seen that\n he was but 52 when he reached the highest\n dignity which, in this era, it is likely an\n American priest can attain. In childhood he\n was taken by his parents to Ireland, where\n he remained until he was 17. Returning to\n Baltimore he determined to devote his life\n to the priesthood, and entered the seminary\n to prepare himself for the work. He w ' as 27\n when he was ordained. Appointed at once\n to a curacy, only a few months elapsed be-\n fore he was placed in charge of a parish in\n the suburbs of Baltimore as rector. Three\n years later he was called by Archbishop\n Spaulding of the Baltimore Diocese to be his\n private secretary, and appointed chancellor\n of the diocese. Two years after, in 1866, the\n second plenary council of the American Ro-\n man Catholic Church was convened at Balti-\n more, and the young priest was made assist-\n ant chancellor of this august body, repre-\n senting the hierarchy of the United States.\n Two years later, when but 34, be was ap-\n</p>\n<p>\n pointed vicar apostolic of North Carolina,\n with the rank and title of bishop. Four years\n later, in 1872, he was translated to the im-\n portant see of Richmond, and five years later,\n when but 43, upon the application to the Pope\n of Archbishop Bayley, whose health was fail-\n ing, he was made bishop-coadjutor in the pri-\n mary see of Baltimore, with the right of suc-\n cession. As Archbishop Bayley did not live\n out the year, the bishop-coadjutor became\n archbishop-primate in 1877, attaining the\n highest dignity in the American church at\n the age of 43, a comparatively young man,\n and sixteen years after he had entered the\n priesthood.\n</p>\n<p>\n The rapidity of this rise is almost without\n parallel. The nearest approach is that of the\n Archbishop of New York, Corrigan, who was\n 24 years old -when ordained and attained the\n archbishopric when 41, his rise covering a pe-\n riod of seventeen years. Between his ordi-\n nation and the assumption of the charge of\n the archdiocese of New York, in the case of\n the great Archbishop Hughes, twenty-four\n years elapsed; of Cardinal McClusky, thirty;\n of Spaulding, thirty; of Bayley, twenty-eight;\n of Ryan, thirty; of Ireland, at least twenty-\n seven. In the case of Cardinal Gibbons only\n seven years elapsed between his ordination\n and his assumption of the purple and the\n title of bishop. These comparisons empha-\n size the extraordinary rapidity of his eleva-\n tion. In other walks of life such rapid ad-\n vancement is not uncommon. In 1880 Grover\n Cleveland was a private citizen, practicing\n law, unknown without the borders of his own\n city of Buffalo; in 1881 he was chosen mayor\n of his city; in 1882 governor of his state, in\n 1884 President of his country. In three years\n he had leaped from obscurity to national\n fame and power. But in the case of the\n Catholic church affairs are far different. Im-\n pulse, caprice, popular favor have no place\n or power in uplifting a man. Popular en-\n thusiasm, political exigency or personal pow-\n er or popularity have no efficiency. Cool,\n calm, able judgment, jealous of the dignity of\n the priesthood, anxious only for the prog-\n ress and advancement of the church, and en-\n thusiastic only in the choice of an instru-\n ment to minister to the glory of God, deter-\n mines the rise. All the qualities that make\n for the service required are weighed and\n tested and weighed again. And in this view\n the rise of the priest who was not ordained\n until he wms 27 years of age becomes all the\n more remarkable. The ordeal of preparation\n for the priesthood is a severe one and only\n the really fit survive. In the case of the stu-\n dent Gibbons it would seem as if the powers\n he has so amply displayed in his higher sta-\n tions must have been early discovered and\n carefully observed and judgment of him early\n</p>\n<p>\n reached, for his advancement began a few\n months after his entrance into the work.\n Within seven years he wears the purple;\n within sixteen he is at the head of the Roman\n Catholic church in America. Nor do his hon-\n ors cease there. At 50, seven years later, he\n presides over the third plenary council of the\n American church, and two years later, twen-\n ty-five years after entrance into the priest-\n hood, he is made a cardinal. There is but\n one more step for him to take, and that is to\n the papal throne. It is a possibility, not a\n probability.\n</p>\n<p>\n His eminence is a great man. His face\n displays his qualities. A person need not\n be an expert in physiogonomy to read it ac-\n curately. Force and power are its domi-\n nant characteristics. A broad, high, full\n forehead proclaims the intellectual qualities;\n brilliant and deep eyes that appear deeply\n set only because the perceptive organs are\n so prominent, their activity; a broad, prom-\n inent and rugged nose, energy; while the\n straight mouth and square set chin denote the\n will and determination of the man. In his\n street costume he is an impressive figure\n and one would say at once on looking upon\n him that he wa3 a man accustomed to the.\n exercise of power and authority. In his\n sacerdotal robes he is imposing \u2014 a true\n prince of the church in appearance and car-\n riage.\n</p>\n<p>\n His personality is masterful and his type\n Napoleonic. He was born to command, and\n his rise in any other walk of life would have\n been as certain and sure as~ it has been\n within his church. Had he not chosen the\n church, he would naturally have chosen or\n drifted into the executive lines. He would\n have made a great general had opportunity\n been given him, a great builder of railroac\n systems, a great administrator of anything\n that had engaged his mind and energies. He\n would have been a statesman, and a con-\n structive one, had politics been his choice,\n and the management of parties would have\n fallen into his hands. Had his birth been in\n monarchical countries, and statecraft his\n line, he would have been chief among the dip-\n lomats and courtiers as well. He is rather\n of the Bismarck than the Gladstone type.\n Pitted against those men he would have\n shown more subtlety of intellect than the\n German statesman and more force and per-\n sonal power than the English leader. Had\n his priestly lot been cast in Italy, he\n would have been, without question, one of the\n politicians and ministers of state of the\n church. All this is to say that he is a man\n whose mental forces are profound, subtle,\n keen and discriminating; that in operation\n they move with force and momentum that are\n irresistible.

He could\n not pass a group of boys playing a game of\n one old cat without having an idea about it,\n and if he exploited it, which is not at all\n likely, it wmuld be discovered that that idea\n embraced all that there w\u2019as of it \u2014 the mean-\n ing and intent, its influence on the players for\n good or evil and the purpose of the impulse\n that had set them at the playing of it. Keen-\n ly penetrative in his mind also, his perceptive\n faculties are largely developed; he weighs\n men and their motives with an accuracy quite\n frequently disconcerting to those who come\n in contact w ' ith him. He is a man of large\n executive capacity and can dispose of his\n business with facility. He has that capacity\n < hat all great executives have of impressing\n his ideas and purposes on his assistants and\n forcing them to labor on a given subject as\n he would do and thus can so divide his duties\n that they shall never overwhelm him. Meth-\n od he has to a high degree of course or he\n would not be truly executive.\n</p>\n<p>\n His eminence is a learned man, a profound\n theologian, an authority on the law of his\n church and skilled in its polity. A student,\n his reading has not stopped at the literature\n of his church, and that he is a man of letters\n is clearly evident in his papers and addresses.\n He has marked power as an orator, and,\n though it partakes of the solid qualities of\n his mind, his oratory is not without rhetori-\n cal embellishment and a strong literary flavor.\n His vocabulary is rich, not in the simple\n Saxon style, but in the opulent and orotund\n \u25a0Latin. Like the man, it is dignified and mas-\n sive. That he is imaginative is already evi-\n dent, but it seems as if by will its suggestions\n were kept under control and subjection. The\n union of the reflective, the administrative and\n Imaginative powers is unusual, but It is found\n</p>\n<p>\n in Cardinal Gibbons. Those who have enjoyed\n free intercourse with hirh say that he is\n peculiarly susceptible to the charms of music,\n delighting in it and uplifted by it in its re-\n ligious and devotional forms. He is not with-\n out artistic perceptions, finding pleasure in\n the pictorial art, and one of the cloth is an\n informant in that the ceremonials of the\n church and their symbolic meanings appeal\n strongly to his imagination, and yet he is\n far from being an emotional man. He is a\n man of deep piety; that piety is not of the\n emotional kind. As the intellectual quali-\n ties dominate the man, his piety is the re-\n sult of a conviction of mind that duty de-\n mands a complete and submissive subjection\n of self to the laws\u2019 of God, to a belief in the\n Unity and all that that imposes on man as a\n</p>\n<p>\n dinal has devoted himself assiduously to the\n material side of this archdiocese, and the\n result has been seen in the growth of its\n charitable and educational institutions, all\n of which are maintained at a high pitch of\n efficiency. His constructive powers, however,\n were called into greater play at an earlier\n period of his life, w r hen he discharged the\n duties of vicar apostolic of North Caro-\n lina. In 1868, when he took charge, there\n w r as a general population of 1,000,000, of whom\n only 1,000 were professed Catholics. There\n were but five priests in the district, few\n churches, no schools and no asylums. In a\n few years he changed all this, built churches,\n increased the worshipers, opened schools,\n instituted asylums and other benevolent in-\n stitutions, and the flourishing condition of\n</p>\n<p>\n JAMES, CARDINAL GIBBONS.\n</p>\n<p>\n consequence. It is the piety of the man of\n intellect who has inquired, investigated, has\n been convinced and has found faith and is\n secure in it.\n</p>\n<p>\n In manners his eminence is suave, bland,\n courtly and stately \u2014 away from the altar, a\n graceful and polished man of the world, emi-\n nently fitted to fill the high position he has\n attained and one of whom all of his faith\n can be justly proud as the representative\n Catholic of America.\n</p>\n<p>\n Aside from his spiritual duties, the Car-\n</p>\n<p>\n that denomination in that state to-day is di-\n rectly attributable to his zeal and the energy\n of his powers. Transferred four years later\n to the see of Richmond, he found much to\n be done and did it, and it is certain that the\n great advancement, the revolution he then\n effected and the high plane to which he\n forced the diocese led Archbishop Bayley\n five years later to appoint him coadjutor in\n his own archdiocese.

His\n father was Alonzo Potter, bishop of Penn-\n sylvania, and his uncle, Horatio, whom he\n succeeded, was bishop of New York when that\n diocese included the territory since set off\n for the dioceses of Long Island and Albany.\n</p>\n<p>\n Distinction seems to have been the com-\n mon possession of the family from whence\n he sprang. The Potter family is as signifi-\n cant in that respect as the famous Field fam-\n ily, from which came David Dudley, Cyrus\n W., Stephen T., Henry M., or that other Mas-\n sachusetts line of Adams, which included two\n Presidents of the United States, Charles\n Francis and the later John Quincys, or the\n \u25a0Lee 3 of Virginia, or the Hamptons of South\n Carolina.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Potters have been singularly prominent\n in their relation to the Episcopal Church of\n America and the title of bishop has not\n been uncommon among them. They have\n also been prominent as educators, several of\n them holding eminent professorships. And\n it is curious to note how identified they all\n have been with old Union College of Schenec-\n tady. Alonzo Potter, the father of Henry\n Codman, was a tutor in Union in 1819, and,\n when he was hut 21, was made professor of\n mathematics and natural philosophy.- Leav-\n ing this chair to take orders when ordained,\n having married the daughter of President\n Nott of Union, he served as rector of a\n church in Boston, but came back to Union\n in 1882 to be professor of moral and intel-\n lectual philosophy and political oconomy. In\n 1838 he was made vice president of the col-\n lege, being practically its head, owing to the\n advanced age of Dr. Nott, so continuing un-\n til 1845, when he was consecrated bishop of\n Pennsylvania.\n</p>\n<p>\n His son Eliphaiett Nott, a brother of Henry\n Codman, who was also an Episcopal clergy-\n man, began his educational career as pro-\n</p>\n<p>\n fessor of ethics at Lehigh University, but in\n 1871 became President of Union College, con-\n tinuing as such until 1888, when he resigned.\n During his incumbency the college was\n changed to a university. He might have\n been bishop of Nebraska, to which honor he\n was elected, had he not declined in order\n to take the presidency of Hobart College, to\n which he had previously been chosen. Hora-\n tio, a brother of Alonzo and uncle of Henry\n Codman and Bishop of New York, a graduate\n of Union, was professor of mathematics and\n natural philosophy in Washington, now Trin-\n ity, College. Horatio\u2019s son, William Bleecker,\n has been, since 1871, professor of mining\n and metallurgy in Washington University\n in St. Louis.\n</p>\n<p>\n Clarkson Nott, a son of Alonzo, brother- of\n Henry Codman, a distinguished member of\n Congress from New York for a number of\n sessions, and for years a possible Democrat-\n ic candidate for governor, was a graduate\n of Union; so was Edward Tuckerman, another\n brother, a famous architect, and Eliphaiett\n Nott, of whom mention has been made above,\n and Robert B., who won fame as a soldier\n in the Civil War, coming out of it with the\n rank of major general and the hearty com-\n mendations of his superiors. Generals Han-\n cock and Grant.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is certainly a distinguished array\n of names and honors, accomplished by two\n close branches of the family in two genera-\n tions. And thus is the Potter family lifted\n as a whole into a distinction enjoyed by few\n American families.\n</p>\n<p>\n From the above record, except as connect-\n ing him with the members of the family,\n the name of Henry Oodman is emitted. The\n present Bishop of New York \u2014 though his\n grandfather was president of Union College,\n his father occupying a prominent chair in\n the faculty and vice president (practically\n for years the president), and his brother,\n Eliphaiett Nott, president of the same col-\n lege; though he was bow in Schenectady\n</p>\n<p>\n while his father was a member- of the facul-\n ty and he spent a portion of his boyhood\n in the shadow of those old college buildings \u2014\n is not a graduate of Union, not even an\n undergraduate, nor, as a matter of fact, the\n graduate of any college or university.\n</p>\n<p>\n In view of the relations and records of\n the male members of hiB family as educa-\n tors, of the traditions and influences about\n him in his upgrowth, of his own rise to dis-\n tinction in a church wherein the training\n of its clergymen for the work engaged upon\n is of serious consideration, this is a state-\n ment so remarkable as to necessitate in-\n quiry and explanation. It is simple when\n reached. The youth of Henry Codman was\n marked by such Ql health, his constitution\n so frail and his frame so delicate, that hte\n physicians would not permit him to be sub-\n jected to the confinement of a studious life\n and a regular eourse of study was denied\n him. As he approached the years of man-\n hood he gained his strength and health and\n entered the business world, receiving a mer-\n cantile training In \u2019Philadelphia. Yet the\n family tendency seems to have been strong\n within him, for, whether it was a deoiared\n policy or not, the fact was made manifest\n when he was about 19 that he bad been\n in private preparing himself for a theologi-\n cal oourse. Strict collegian and rigid church\n disciplinarian as he was, it can readily be\n understood that Bishop Alonzo Potter did\n not look with favor upon this projected de-\n parture of his son. Another, Eliphaiett Nott,\n was already pursuing his studies with a\n view to entrance into the ministry, but\n that fact did not influence the father. It\n wets the fear that his son, Henry Codman,\n had not been sufliciently and fundamentally\n grounded in the education ha deemed neces-\n sary for such a life as the young man as-\n pired to.\n</p>\n<p>\n But with that devotion to purpose which\n has been so conspicuously manifested In his\n after career, Henry persisted and won his\n way.

From this time the growth\n of the youthful minister was rapid, for he\n advanced with great strides to general recog-\n nition of the possession of viril.e intellectual\n powers and, what is the more surprising,\n to that of a ripe and solid scholarship.\n</p>\n<p>\n A year later he was transferred to St.\n John\u2019s Church in Troy, where he remained\n for the seven years following. It was dur-\n ing these seven years that the church awoke\n to the fact that a son clothed with power\n had grown up in it, not so much under its\n fostering influences as through his own pos-\n session of rare powers of mind, indomitable\n energy and superlative powers of labor. In\n 1863 he was called to Trinity in Boston as\n assistant minister and five years later, or in\n 1868, to be rector of Grace Church in New\n York, in which position he remained until\n 18S4. To what stature he had grown as early\n as 1S63 is shown in that he was offered the\n presidency of Kenyon College of Ohio, a trib-\n ute to the scholarship he had attained.\n While rector of Grace Church in 1875 he was\n elected bishop of Iowa. But both of these\n honors he declined. In 1883, however, ad-\n monished by the burden of years that had\n accumulated on him. Bishop Horatio Potter\n asked of the authorities an assistant, which\n was given him, and Henry Codman was\n elected as such assistant bishop, being con-\n secrated in October of 1883. Four years\n later, on the death of the uncle, Henry Cod-\n man became bishop.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this record, so full of honor, some of the\n traits of the man may be read. That which\n will seem to be the more conspicuous and\n striking is the indomitable energy and per-\n severance which has marked every step of\n his career. Rising superior to the disadvan-\n tage of ill health and frailty in youth, it is\n found that in his leisure hours, almost un-\n known to his family, he had overcome the\n deficiencies of a collegiate training in pri-\n vate study. He had gone about this w r ork\n in the years when pleasure is most alluring\n to youth with a reliance upon himself and\n his belief in his own industry and achieved\n a basis of education few emerge from col-\n lege with, though aided by direction, verbal\n instruction and a systematized regulation of\n studies and reading. It is related that when\n that stern old theologian and philosopher,\n his father, learned of his son\u2019s desire to\n prepare himself for the ministry and had\n rather waived the notion aside with a re-\n mark that unfortunately the young man\n was not prepared for a theological course,\n and the young man had stoutly contended\n that he was, the old bishop, in order to shovr\n his son how utterly unfit he was, put him\n under a rigid examination, Dringing to bear\n all the trained powers that had been exer-\n cised into perfection in Union College, the\n educator rose from the examination astound-\n ed over what the son had achieved by his\n own efforts, compelled to acknowledge that\n the lad had -withstood a test which, in a col-\n</p>\n<p>\n his family regarded his step that anused him\n to enter upon his theological studies in the\n minor Seminary of Virginia rather than in\n the genera! Theological Seminary of New\n York, where it would be supposed a young\n student who had for a father the Bishop of\n Pennsylvania and for his uncle the Bishop\n of New York, and whose family history was\n so intertwined with that of Union College\n would naturally have enrolled himself. The\n modest institution of Virginia, however, was\n the scene of his preparation for the minis-\n try, and from which he graduated in 1857.\n Ordained the following year, he was imme-\n diately elected rector of a church in\n</p>\n<p>\n legiate test, would have landed him in an\n honor place.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this ordeal to which, prompted by his\n aspirations, he had voluntarily subjected\n himself, may be seen the early manifes-\n tations of certain qualities which are well\n appreciated by those who have been in close\n touch with him \u2014 absorbing industry, a mar-\n velous capacity for labor, devotion to a pur-\n pose that sees nothing else until that pur-\n pose i3 achieved, an energy that is indomit-\n able and knows no tiring and a confident\n</p>\n<p>\n sane common sense. Hence it is conserva-\n tive, hence his firm stands against exagger-\n ations of ritual. Indeed, his attitude as to\n all questions presented to his ken is conser-\n vative. Conservatism is the habit of the\n man and it is the habit of his mind. The\n cast of his mind is philosophic and he is\n all the more potent and efficient in his work\n because of it. To all that concerns man and\n is of concern to man he is keenly alive,\n but his wisdom shows him plainly the lim-\n itations of mankind, therefore he is never\n</p>\n<p>\n THE RT. REV.

But back cf them is a strong, clear,\n vigorous mind which in its sanity and poise\n directs and governs all. Intellectually Bish-\n op Potter is strong. His brain has been\n marvelously disciplined and to a great de-\n gree. indeed it may be said wholly, in self-\n culture. Endowed with rare faculties of\n comprehension and concentration, of ready\n grasp and wide scope, that brain has been\n well disciplined as it has been well stored.\n It is of an enterprising nature, it has al-\n ways sought to know, but it engages on no\n enterprises that lie without the realms of\n</p>\n<p>\n asking impossibilities, but it will be found\n that in all his efforts he is pushing on to\n the very verge of those limitations.\n</p>\n<p>\n Notwithstanding the disadvantages of his\n ill health in his early years, Bishop Potter\n has become not only a cultivated but a learn-\n ed man. He is a profound theologian and is\n so recognized in his church relation. In all\n those studies which are supposed in their\n practice to strengthen and discipline the mind\n he is proficient; in all those that touch the\n polity and government of church he is learn-\n ed; but apart from this he has been a pro-\n found student of literature for its own sake.\n His public utterances amply attest his famil-\n iarity with the advance of science and art\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0025/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 345, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 493}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0025/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 691, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 987}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0025/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1383, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1975}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0025/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2767, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3950}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0025/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0025.jp2", "height": 3950, "width": 2767, "levels": 6, "size": 571770}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"25\">\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n 23\n</p>\n<p>\n and the general progress of civilization and\n that he is a thoughtful observer of the life\n about him, whatever face it takes.

His style is simple, but finished to a\n high degree, yet it is evident that matter is\n of more moment to him than Style. The\n conservatism and self control that is a part\n of him are here shown markedly, but yet\n there are times when he permits himself to\n display a warmth and ardor that raises his\n utterances to a high plane of eloquence, but\n these moments are rare. At all times he is\n engaging and interesting.\n</p>\n<p>\n In point of wealth, activity and the multi-\n plicity of church interests the diocese of New\n York is the most important of the country,\n making more demands on its constituted au-\n thority perhaps than any other. In the ad-\n ministration of his diocesan work the Bishop\n has shown marked capacity of execution. It\n is reported of him that he executes affairs\n rapidly, turning off business with a facility\n and dispatch that his associates are disposed\n to attribute to the business training he re-\n ceived in his.youth. Since that training was\n limited to a very few years, the grasp of de-\n tail and of affairs he possesses is more likely\n due to his rapid mental comprehension, the\n decisiveness that is a part of him, the rapid-\n</p>\n<p>\n ity with which he passes through the logical\n processes to a conclusion and to the orderly\n methods of his mind. All these qualities\n must be impressed on those in contact with\n him, as being possessed by him in a marked\n degree. They certainly were impressed on\n the house of Bishops whose secretary he was\n for seventeen years and account in no little\n degree for the respect in which he is held\n by the members of that house in which he\n now has a seat as a legislating member.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of the great undertakings of his dio-\n cese is the building of the stately cathedral\n of St. John, on Morningside Heights. It is\n a vast undertaking even for so wealthy a\n diocese as that of New York. The burden of\n its progress, which is that of raising the\n funds, and providing the ways and means,\n rests largely, if not wholly, on the shoulders\n of the Bishop. That means financiering in\n its highest sense, for it means the creation\n of a fund from nothing. The progress this\n stately temple has already made is rare tes-\n timony to the efficiency of the Bishop in this\n respect.\n</p>\n<p>\n In person the Bishop is a perfect type of\n a prelate, moving with dignity and carrying\n with him the authority of his church and his\n holy office. His manner is reserved and self\n contained, so much in fact that he has been\n called cold and even haughty. Neither term\n is just in its application. It is known that\n he holds his family in a warm degree of af-\n fection and those who have won his friend-\n ship can testify as to the warmth of his re-\n gard for them. The mannerism that has been\n called haughtiness by the inconsiderate is\n merely the outcome of hia rigid self-disci-\n plining and self-repression. Despite these\n assertions the Bishop is sympathetic and\n there is no part of his work that receives\n more attention or absorbs a greater part\n</p>\n<p>\n of his thoughts than that which deals with\n the amelioration of the condition of the poor\n and the assistance of the unfortunate and\n the suffering. That conservatism of nature\n and mind seen in other relations here appear\n to prevent him from wearing his heart upon\n his sleeve, and it has ever been his custom\n to do more than his promise of words would\n indicate.\n</p>\n<p>\n A distinguished minister of his church,\n though not of his diocese, in speaking of the\n Bishop, said:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018\u2018The soldier of the regular Army is prone\n to regard with doubt any officer who comes\n not up through West Point. There is some-\n thing of this among us. We are apt to\n look for the best results only from among\n those who have come through the rigid train-\n ing of the classical schools, the universities\n and the great seminary, but here we have\n what? Facile princeps, shall I say? Well,\n if not that, then at least a most remarka-\n ble man who without that training, but fair-\n ly through self culture, is a great pulpit ora-\n tor, a profound theologian, a most polished\n writer, a learned man, a great administrator,\n a man of affairs and withal is spiritual and\n reverently pious and deeply, intensely or-\n thodox.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Though Bishop Potter is not one of her\n sons. Union has delighted to honor him, and\n by conferring on him the degrees of A. M.,\n D. D. and LL. D., to mark her appreciation\n of his scholarship. And Trinity has also con-\n ferred the degree of LL. D.\n</p>\n<p>\n Bishop Potter has not behind him as long\n a list of publications as his father left, but\n his pen has not rusted for want of use.\n Perhaps the best known of his works is \u2018\u2018Sis-\n terhoods and Deaconesses at Home and\n Abroad: History of Their Rise and Progress.\u201d\n In authorship he has not stepped outside of\n churchly matters.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0026/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0026/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0026/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0026/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0026/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0026.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 788428}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"26\">\n<p>\n John Pierpont Morgan.\n</p>\n<p>\n RULER IN THE REALMS OF FINANCE.\n A GREAT RECONSTRUCTIVE POWER.\n</p>\n<p>\n T O the vast majority of people, finance\n Is an abstruse science which attracts\n the imagination while it repels com-\n prehension. He who, practicing the science\n as a profession or pursuit, attains a place in\n the front rank and earns the title of financier,\n becomes an object of intense interest and re-\n gard \u2014 of a curiosity not unmixed with ad-\n miration. That he is also at times an object\n of attack does not lessen interest in him;\n rather it enhances his importance and the\n attack is accepted as evidence of the power\n resident in the financier \u2014 a power not seen,\n perhaps not directly felt, but of which con-\n sciousness is vital.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is something captivating to the gen-\n eral imagination in the thought of the man\n who tosses millions about as the juggler does\n his spangled spheres \u2014 something mysterious\n in the way moribund properties suddenly be-\n come fortune giving investments through pro-\n cesses not unlike financial legerdemain. Hi!\n It is nothing. Presto! It has life and is\n moving. Change! It is a great property\n and the country is so much the richer. There\n are minds, singularly constituted, that may\n comprehend it all, but we, who labor and by\n the sweat of our brow accomplish common-\n place results, stand aghast at the great for-\n tunes apparently materialized out of thin air\n by the wave of the wand, regarding with awe\n and admiration the magician w\u2019bo has wrought\n so momentous a change.\n</p>\n<p>\n But the power exerted is not occult; it is\n the outcome of the application of a high or-\n der of intellect reinforced by certain moral\n characteristics, all of which are skilled and\n educated to a superior degree of efficiency.\n This pow T er is net so spectacular or so visible\n to the public eye as some other forces of\n potentiality \u2014 for instance, the executive of a\n large city, a state or the nation in official\n panoply administering the authority of the\n people, or the head of an army around whom\n the imagination may group pictorially deep\n ranks of men in flashing armor, with waving\n colors and rumbling guns, in the clash of\n conflict. But, if the exercise of financial pow-\n er loses something of dramatic quality it gains\n in the breadth of the area of its activity, for\n it is not confined to a district or a nation;\n the civilized w T orld, even the semi-civilized,\n is its domain.\n</p>\n<p>\n A power among powers, the leader of finan-\n ciers here, is John Pierpont Morgan of this\n city. His place is unquestioned. That he\n stands single and alone in his leadership is\n conceded, and that place is not the result of\n accident or favor, but because it was taken\n by right of the possession of the qualities\n which entitled him to it\u2019s possession and jus-\n tified him in its assumption. Mr. Morgan\n</p>\n<p>\n was brought up in a financial atmosphere.\n He is a son of J. S. Morgan, who was a part-\n ner in the great banking firm of George Pea-\n body & Co., which, in 1854, after the retire-\n ment of Mr. Peabody, was styled J. S. Morgan\n & Co., ranking as one of the great banking\n houses of the world. Mr. John Pierpont Mor-\n gan was born in Hartford, Conn., through\n the accident of his father\u2019s temporary resi-\n dence in that state. Early in his life his\n father removed to Boston, and in that city,\n in the English high school, John Pierpont\n was educated. Completing his course there,\n he went to the University of Goettingen,\n Germany, remaining there until he was 20\n years of age, when he returned to this coun-\n try to enter the banking house of Duncan,\n Sherman & Co. Three years later, when 23\n years of age, he became the agent and at-\n torney in the United States of the banking\n house of George Peabody & Co., in w ' hich at\n the time his father was a partner, continuing\n in the same relation after the retirement of\n Mr. Peabody, when the firm name was\n changed to J. S. Morgan & Co. He is now\n the practical head of the London house, as\n well as that of New York, and as a conse-\n quence spends a portion of each year in Lon-\n don, where he maintains a residence as well\n as in New York.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1860, when Mr. Morgan became its agent\n for the United States, the banking firm of\n George Peabody & Co. -was one of the most\n prominent houses in the world. It had been\n of long standing and great respectability. Mr.\n Peabody and Mr. J. S. Morgan, the second\n partner, w r ere Americans, if all the other\n partners were not, and their transactions in\n this country were many and vast. Its agent\n and attorney in the nature of things was\n charged with heavy responsibilities, in the\n administration of which must have been de-\n manded the exercise of an acute and sound\n judgment. That so young a man, with but\n three years\u2019 experience in the financial world,\n should have been selected argues either that\n the firm of Peabody & Co. made a reckless\n appointment to care for their vast interests in\n America, or that John Pierpont- Morgan had\n at a very early age developed and exhibited\n extraordinary qualities for the career he had\n set out upon. In view of the standing, impor-\n tance and conservatism of the house of Pea-\n body the former alternative must be dismissed\n and we are driven to accept the other, with\n the conclusion that an astonishing precocity\n must have been shown by the young man.\n Knowledge of the elder Morgan precludes the\n idea that the fact that the agent was a son\n weighed in the balance and the decision was\n made in his favor on that account. Notwith-\n standing this early advancement, the position\n he has attained at this day is the result of a\n</p>\n<p>\n gradual growth and not an achievement of a\n single bound or a great coup. Forty years\n have passed since he plunged into the trou-\n bled waters of finance, and for thirty-seven he\n has been a figure of greater or less promi-\n nence. No doubt his environments, his con-\n nection with powerful concerns and the great\n reputation of his father have been aids in his\n uprise, but if the qualities demanded for\n maintenance of the position attained had not\n been inherent in the man there would have\n been retrogression rather than advancement\n to the heights on which he now stands.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Morgan has never been known in Wall\n street as a speculator or operator. He is not\n a stock gambler and never a bear. No\n charges of wrecking property or depressing\n values that gain might result have been made\n against him. On the contrary, his reputa-\n tion has been that of a constructor and a re-\n pairer. His efforts have been in the direction\n of the maintenance of credit, and in times\n of threatened panics his labors have been to\n the end of prevention and upholding. Per-\n haps no one man in the history of our finances\n has rehabilitated property threatened with\n ruin and final extinction to the extent\n that he has. Of him a short time ago the\n president of one of the largest banks of Man-\n hattan said: \u201cMr. Morgan\u2019s office is the\n great repair shop to which the crippled must\n go.\u2019\u2019 The record of his successful reorganiza-\n tions is growing to great length, and under\n his touch properties that were practically\n moribund have been lifted into new life and\n pilt upon a new career of usefulness and\n value. The West Shore and the Reading\n Railroads are conspicuous instances of what\n his skill has accomplished. Failures in this\n sort of effort are not to be charged against\n him. It may be that he refuses to undertake\n the hopeless, but if it be so, the great qual-\n ity of perceiving possibilities and detecting\n fatal weaknesses must be conceded to him.\n As it is, his decision is final. The reliance\n on his judgment is implicit and complete. If\n he declares in favor of a proposed undertak-\n ing it becomes in the minds of promoters and\n investors merely a question of time when suc-\n cess will crown the enterprise; if against it,\n its doom is pronounced, for no sane capital-\n ist in these days will advance money where\n Pierpont Morgan has condemned. His in-\n dorsement of a new scheme insures its suc-\n cess; his financial backing of it gives it high\n standing, and there are investors and specu-\n lators who seek to know no more than Mr.\n Morgan\u2019s opinion and relation to a fresh\n money-making proposition to justify them in\n action as to it. This confidence in his judg-\n ment and reliance upon it accounts in a great\n degree for his wonderful success in reorgan-\n izing moribund properties and giving\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0027/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 345, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 493}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0027/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 691, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 987}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0027/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1383, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1975}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0027/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2767, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3950}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0027/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0027.jp2", "height": 3950, "width": 2767, "levels": 6, "size": 950887}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"27\">\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n - - -\n</p>\n<p>\n Morgan went into finance it was a case of a\n neatly fitting square peg inserted In a square\n hole filling exactly the place. It Is easy to set\n down that the remarkable success attending\n his career is proof of the truth of the asser-\n tion, but the degree is not precisely expressed\n thereby. It is something more. Contact with\n him reveals an extraordinary fitness of that\n mind for the work it has engaged upon that\n is in the superlative degree. There is, to\n those who have observed or been concerned\n in its operations, a satisfied sense of com-\n pleteness, and therein is explained one of the\n features of his career, the confidence in him-\n self that he inspires.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Morgan might have made a powerful\n writer. The attributes of his speech, sim-\n ple, direct, logical, terse, condensed to a\n point that has cast out every unnecessary\n word, yet losing nothing in informing and\n illuminating quality, would indicate his pos-\n sibilities, not as a poet or a romancer, but\n as an essayist. He might have been a speech\n maker had he accomplished the technique\n of the platform, certainly a debater, especial-\n ly on the floor of the House of Representa-\n tives, where it is rough and tumble, where\n the blows are delivered more with regard\n as to where they should land than with a\n view of graduating the force impelling them;\n indeed, there are indications that therein\n he would have been a Jeffries with knock-\n outs to mark the close of the contest; an\n orator he hardly would have been. But\n whether writer of debater must remain a\n speculation, as there are not efforts on rec-\n ord by which to determine, but there is no\n manner of doubt concerning his fitness for\n labor in the line he has chosen.\n</p>\n<p>\n The qualities exercised therein are not so\n easy of statement that they can be described\n with a word. This is not because they are\n confused or indistinct, but because they are\n not showy or striking. The first marked\n feature is his wonderful mental grasp of his\n subject. That is complete and * tenacious.\n That hold is so vigorous that it cannot be\n weakened or slackened by however many\n presentations of various and complex sides.\n Once taken, it cannot be confused to him.\n The quickness with which he seizes the es-\n sentials and discriminates between the wheat\n and the chaff is sometimes confusing to\n others in relation to him. During the forma-\n tive period he is open to suggestion, can see\n and consider all sides, is an attentive listener\n to the presentation of all phases, restive un-\n der discursiveness, grateful for terse order-,\n liness of statement, but when decision has\n been reached he sees but one side and one\n phase. Here is to be noted a faculty possess-\n ed by him in a wonder exciting degree. Pos-\n sessing an absorbing power of concentration\n by which he can converge all the powers and\n energies of his mind upon a given question to\n the exclusion of everything else, yet upon\n the presentation or the Interruption of\n other questions he can remove himself from\n the one under consideration and centralize\n himself at once on the new one with the\n same power and intensity, and arriving at a\n decision, return to the one under former con-\n sideration or to a new one with the same\n power, the same epergy and the same ab-\n sorbing concentration.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI have seen, not once, but several times,\u201d\n said a financier, himself of great reputation,\n the other day, \u2018\u2018Mr. Morgan walk up and\n down a room of the size of this we are talk-\n ing in, a dozen seated about at desks, and as\n he walked they flung up at him questions as\n to momentous affairs, diverse, unrelated,\n calling for determination as to action, on\n which the security of thousands depended,\n and the fate of organized industries hung.\n</p>\n<p>\n JOHN PIERPONT MORGAN.\n</p>\n<p>\n awaited and whose course when the winds\n blow adversely and the storm beats violently\n is watched so eagerly? For a man who has\n achieved the peculiar distinction he has,\n whose name is so familiar to his country-\n men, his person is little known to the public.\n His relation to the international yacht races\n of last autumn resulted in making his fea-\n tures better known than they had been previ-\n ously through the counterfeit presentments\n of him in the illustrated press. Yet even now.\n</p>\n<p>\n Morgan need carry neither truncheon, baton\n nor sword to indicate his habit of command.\n</p>\n<p>\n Abraham Lincoln, in describing his diffi-\n culties to an intimate friend during the Civil\n War, said that he had a lot of round and\n square holes and round and square pegs to\n put in them, but the round pegs had a ten-\n dency to get into the square holes; the square\n pegs into the round holes, and that much of\n his time and energy was absorbed in guiding\n the right pegs into the right holes. When Mr.\n</p>\n<p>\n strength and vitality to its later issues of se-\n curities.\n</p>\n<p>\n The concern of J. S. Morgan Co. of Lon-\n don (and he is the dominating force there as\n here), is the great medium of the approach\n of English capital to this country. This is\n due to the confidence reposed in Pierpont\n Morgan, for it is he who commands this con-\n fidence, and his name is a synonym for in-\n tegrity of judgment, as well as integrity of\n character.\n</p>\n<p>\n W hat manner of man, then, is this person\n whose word in times of crises is so anxiously\n</p>\n<p>\n away from Wall and Broad streets, Mr. Mor-\n gan could pass block after block unrecognized.\n While he carries himself with dignity and\n bears that air of authority consequent upon\n the habits of exercising it, he is not a man\n of striking and distinguished appearance. It\n would be the thoughtful only \u2014 those accus-\n tomed to read the faces of passersby, who\n would conclude that one of unusual qualities\n had gone by, but the more indifferent ob-\n server would not fail, because he could not,\n to observe that there was power, strength\n and masterfulness in the passing face.

It is\n a marvelous faculty and its exhibition never\n ceases to fill me with wonder. It is almost a\n daily occurrence with him. He seems to\n have the power to marshal at will all that\n he has ever thought on a question instanta-\n neously, present the essence and the con-\n clusion, dismiss it completely, substitute the\n some thing on another question without ef-\n fort or friction, with a rapidity that is\n hieath-taking. The man is a genius and not\n to be measured by ordinary standards.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n To this quickness of apprehension, rapidity\n of logical processes, breadth of grasp, te-\n nacity of hold and ease of mobilization of\n mental forces, must be added a precision\n and accuracy of judgment ' well nigh infallible.\n A conclusion reached means a dismissal of\n all that has preceded it; a decision made\n means that the time of argument is passed,\n and that of execution arrived, whereupon\n enters the motive power of mental and moral\n energy and the matter is impelled by a force\n that knows no loss of movement until the\n end is achieved.\n</p>\n<p>\n All of these concerns engaging his mind\n are in their nature adventurous. A bank may\n loan money, but in their practices the loans\n are protected by ample collateral security.\n A banking house such as that of which Mr.\n Morgan is the head, loans money or backs\n enterprises differently and largely on the\n judgment and knowledge of the deciding\n quantity. The borrower may be in possession\n of a concession of a government, the profits\n of which may be unmistakable, but back of\n it, and the doubtful quantity, is the integrity\n of the government making the concession.\n The point is made clearer by the supposition\n that a concession, valuable and lucrative, has\n been granted by the Chinese government; the\n one receiving the concession needs money for\n its operating; the concession in itself is a\n sufficient collateral for a loan; the loan is\n made and the operation is in progress when\n the Boxer rebellion breaks out; the govern-\n ment, the grantor of the concession, is im-\n periled and the concession is either valueless\n or diminished in value. Under this statement\n it will be seen wffiat a wide scope of view the\n banker must maintain, what strains he is\n under, and what tests he must go to and\n something of the burdens and the responsi-\n bilities which Mr. Morgan carries can be com-\n prehended. There is required a broad mental\n back and the mental shoulders of a giant to\n . bear up under them and this is what for\n years Mr. Morgan has done.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Morgan is a man of detail. Some men\n of affairs, having generalized their matters,\n leave the details of execution and adminis-\n tration to others. Not so Mr. Morgan. All\n the details of any enterprise he is engaged\n on are arranged and classified in that capa-\n cious brain of his and he maintains a super-\n</p>\n<p>\n vision and an administration that are the\n wonder of his associates and the marvel of his\n instruments. In him the reflective and execu-\n tive qualities are united, a combination mark-\n ing the great man, and he is unique in this\n respect, that he employs the confidence of,\n and is counseled with by the capitalists and\n investors of the two richest and the two great\n commercial countries of the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n He has always been the builder and never\n the wrecker. In times of financial disturb-\n ance his counsel is eagerly sought and his\n labors and efforts are unstintingly given to\n the maintenance of a balance that will in-\n sure safety and promote security, and his\n services in this respect have been felt if they\n have not been appreciated.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Morgan is not a man of profound\n health. He is afflicted with a constitutional\n infirmity which, if it does not impair his ac-\n tivity and energy, affects his moods. He is\n often irritable and is most impatient of op-\n position. He is a leader by nature and he\n brooks no rival leadership. If he labors in an\n enterprise it must be as its head, to whom\n when the period of action arrives there must\n be obedience implicit and unquestioned. He\n is even imperious and demands at such times\n subordination to his fiats and promulgations.\n When decision has been made his marvelous\n energy is put in motion and neither diplo-\n macy, tact, policy, compromise, nor conces-\n sion has place. Matters go by force and bar-\n riers erected or accidentally in the path go\n down with a rush, A railroad operator of re-\n nown was asked by what methods Mr. Morgan\n accomplished his results; he made answer by\n the significant gesture of striking out vio-\n lently from the shoulder.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMorgan is called a bulldozer,\u201d said a man\n of large affairs. \u201cIt is hardly the truth. He\n is courteous and receptive at the times previ-\n ous to action, but then look out. When\n a course of action has been decided on, get\n out of the way. He\u2019s worse than a locomo-\n tive at high speed. Everything must go down\n before him.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Devotion to purpose, adherence to design,\n obstinate tenacity to an idea, force and de-\n termination are -written on his face, and\n altogether he presents as forceful and mas-\n terful a personality as any other man before\n the public. It is difficult to consider him as\n a negotiator or a diplomatist; rather he is a\n dictator. He w r ould be with his combative-\n ness and his force a great general and a\n tremendous fighter, who could employ the\n arts of strategy; a great executive, to whom\n the other arms of government would be sub-\n ordinate; a powerful leader and debater in\n a deliberative assemblage, but one cannot\n imagine him as a minister of state, ductile,\n politic, diplomatic, suave and bland, accom-\n plishing his results by indirection and com-\n promise. He could not live with equals in\n power, whose rights he must constantly rec-\n</p>\n<p>\n ognize. He is without ambition apart from\n his business, and there he seeks, as a friend\n said of him, \u201cto w T ear the crown of his house\n in a manner that shall redound to its credit\n and to the dynasty of the Morgans.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n He has a life apart from his vast busi-\n ness affairs that is little known to the world.\n It should not be forgotten that Mr. Morgan\n received the basis of a liberal and thorough\n education, of which the classic was the\n foundation. A course in the University of\n Goettingen could not otherwise be obtained.\n The tastes then developed for study, litera-\n ture and the sciences have not been lost\n in the whirl and conflict of the financial\n world. The recreation he seeks from dis-\n turbing cares he finds in his ample library,\n among his books, of which he is much fonder\n than his business associates have compre-\n hension. Of this he makes no parade. His\n diversion is yachting, and not far from his\n reach is always in the season a commodious,\n even palatial, yacht, with steam ever up that\n he may snatch the strength renewing mo-\n ments of relaxation his multifarious enter-\n prises permit. He served for a few years\n as president of the New York Yacht Club,\n and the term of his incumbency will be long\n remembered, for he brought to bear on its\n fortunes and future the rare powers of his\n mind for organization. He bore the brunt\n of the expense incurred in defending the\n America\u2019s Cup against the efforts of Sir\n Thomas Lipton to \u201clift\u201d it, and it was char-\n acteristic of the man that, having made\n himself thus responsible for its retention,\n though he had conditioned that Mr. Iselin\n should be the manager, yet he lost no grasp\n of the details that led up to satisfying vic-\n tory.\n</p>\n<p>\n Socially, Mr. Morgan is an uncertain quan-\n tity. As a companion he is dependent on his\n moods, and his moods are dependent on his\n condition of nerves and health. But when\n the mood is right he can be and is compan-\n ionable in the extreme, the rarity of which \"\n is the chief charm.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Morgan is a generous man and unos-\n tentatious in his benefactions. Some of his\n gifts to public charities and institutions* creep\n out into public knowledge, but the vast\n amount of hie charities are unknown and\n often given under the condition that no pub-\n licity shall attend them. His life, in view of\n his great wealth, is not ostentatious. Within\n his home in this country he maintains a\n modest art gallery, gathered not for display,\n but for his own gratification, which is far more\n significant in quality than in extent.\n</p>\n<p>\n When his career is done his proudest boast\n will doubtless be that he has maintained and\n ever increased the power, reputation and im-\n portance of the Morgan house, and in doing\n so his efforts have been not to the diminishing\n of properties, but to the increase of the wealth\n of the world and to the maintenance of credit.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0029/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 345, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 493}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0029/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 691, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 987}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0029/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1383, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1975}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0029/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2767, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3950}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0029/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0029.jp2", "height": 3950, "width": 2767, "levels": 6, "size": 769584}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"29\">\n<p>\n William Collins Whitney\n</p>\n<p>\n POLITICIAN AND FINANCIER.\n HIS DIPLOMACY AND ENERGY.\n</p>\n<p>\n i\n</p>\n<p>\n I T IS often at the expense of the world\u2019s\n good will that men achieve conspicuous\n wealth. Whether this is due to methods\n necessarily employed in vast and rapid accen-\n tuation, to characteristics of the money get-\n ter himself, or to the envy of less fortunate\n mankind, matters not here. The fact is an es-\n tablished one. But there are exceptions to\n the rule and one of them is found in the per-\n son of William Collins Whitney, who is a man\n of many millions, of many great enterprises j\n and yet he counts his friends by troops and\n possesses the good will of tens of thousands\n of his countrymen, who have never touched\n his hand or exchanged a word with him.\n</p>\n<p>\n To inquire why this is so is to be enter-\n tained and instructed. Mr. Whitney has not\n reached this station by employing the arts of\n a demagogue or by avoiding contact and con-\n test. A forceful and aggressive leader in the\n affairs of the political party of his adherence,\n he has been as well, at times, energetic and\n prominently active in the interests of a fac-\n tion within his party. None may say with\n truth, looking back over his career, that he\n has ever declined battle when the interests\n he represented or had espoused were at stake.\n His opponents have felt the force of his blows\n and know they were inflicted by a stalwart\n . arm. Such, also, has been his course and\n character in the world of finance and newly\n developed industries. In short, his has been\n what our present Governor preaches \u2014 a stren-\n uous life. Yet from his warfares and his bat-\n tles he emerges into assured strength, with\n the respect and hearty good will of his\n whilom foes and opponents and the loyal af-\n fection of his allies. Credited by the one and\n relied upon by the other, and, in later years,\n in the constant battle of millions and for\n millions, his standing in the world of our day\n is unique.\n</p>\n<p>\n Before Mr. Whitney had won fame as a\n financier and constructor of large enterprises,\n he had achieved as much power and influence\n as would have satisfied the ambitions of most\n men. This record is in danger of being, it\n it is not already, obscured by that luster sur-\n rounding vast monetary manipulations, which\n is so captivating to the world at large, though\n it does excite its envy and often its enmi-\n ty. The energies of that part of his career no\n longer engage Mr. Whitneyls attention, and\n doubtless are made impossible in the absorb-\n ing demands of his later lines of endeavor;\n yet it is the belief of his friends that the\n triumphs of those years constitute for him a\n record in which he takes a greater pride than\n in those of his later occupations. If there\n</p>\n<p>\n is not about them the glamour of gold, there\n must be the satisfying consciousness of duty\n to country well done, of obstacles overcome\n for good of country and of services to the\n countrymen of his generation which merit ap-\n plause.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are three epochs in the career of Mr.\n Whitney \u2014 that of lawyer, politician and\n statesman, and financier. When he became the\n latter he ceased being a politician and when\n he became a politician he abandoned the law\n as a profession. His retirement from the of-\n fice of corporation counsel of New York City\n marked the end of his legal career, in which,\n perhaps, there had been more of promise of\n distinction than of actual attainment \u2014 the ne-\n cessity of an income from his profession not\n being present as an incentive.\n</p>\n<p>\n A movement to curb the power and domi-\n nation of Tammany Hall in New York City\n threw Mr. Whitney into the turmoil of poli-\n tics and rapidly bore him to the forefront. In\n the building up of that great organization,\n the County Democracy, which had the sym-\n pathy and advice of Samuel J. Tilden and the\n active support of Abram S. Hewitt and Ed-\n ward Cooper, Mr. Whitney was a power in\n formulation and organization, as well as in\n direction and policy after organization, until\n it may be said in its days of power and prog-\n ress, he was its dominating force. The qual-\n ities of mind and power that later made him\n a force and power in .the nation were then\n first made known and that organization was\n the medium through which those qualities\n were impressed on the country at large. In it\n that trust and confidence, never since lost,\n were first given to him\u2014 trust in the integ-\n rity of his character and confidence in the in-\n tegrity of his mind. To a position of com-\n manding Influence in the political affairs of\n his state was but a short step and he ad-\n vanced at the same time to a similar one in\n the political affairs of the nation; respected,\n deferred to and trusted.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Whitney\u2019s appointment as Secretary of\n the Navy by President Cleveland in 1885,\n however, was less a recognition of the stand-\n ing of the appointee in his party, or of a\n valiant service in the advancement of the\n political fortunes of the newly elected Presi-\n dent, than the result of an earnest desire on\n the part of the executive to give to the serv-\n ice of the country one with whose abilities he\n had been deeply impressed and to obtain\n himself, in his venture in untried fields, the\n aid of one who had shown such power at the\n council table. Mr. Whitney\u2019s consent was re-\n luctant and he yielded only when pressed as\n a duty. How brilliantly he justified the judg-\n</p>\n<p>\n ment of Mr. Cleveland is now a matter of his-\n tory. The United States would have lost\n much had Secretary Whitney followed the dic-\n tates of his inclinations rather than those of\n duty. Under his administration of the de-\n partment, the Navy was revolutionized and\n rehabilitated and those who followed him\n have done little more than complete the edi-\n fice, the foundations of which he laid and for\n which he designed the plans. He may, with\n justice, be called the founder of the Navy as\n it now stands, and in the four years of his\n occupancy Manila and Santiago were made\n possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is to be recorded that in twenty years of\n conspicuous leadership Mr. Whitney has held\n but two offices. This is not because he has\n striven and failed to attain office, but because\n he has avoided it. There have been times\n when movements to make him the guberna-\n torial, senatorial and presidential candidates\n have sprung up seemingly of themselves;\n movements needing only formulation to\n make them formidable; -when his consent and\n encouragement would have taken them be-\n yond the control of leaders. His consent was\n not given; rather was earnest labor done to\n prevent these movements from going beyond\n the initial stages. Yet the ambitious and\n self seeking, not understanding his attitude,\n or measuring it by their own aspirations, for\n ten years have kept a weather eye on him as\n a potential possibility threatening their for-\n tunes.\n</p>\n<p>\n W ' hen Mr. Cleveland was elected President\n a second term Mr. Whitney was pressed to\n take a place in his Cabinet, and what place\n that should be was left to his otvn choice.\n This was after a heated campaign, in which\n peculiar conditions in the Democratic organi-\n zation of this state had been shown \u2014 a cam-\n paign following a nomination that had been\n preceded by another campaign in w ' hich had\n been developed the causes for such conditions.\n The delegation chosen by the organized De-\n mocracy of New York opposed the nomination\n of Mr. Cleveland and presented the name of\n David B. Hill as its candidate. An element\n of the Democracy of New York State, repudi-\n ating the action of the organized Democracy\n and supporting the candidacy of Mr. Cleve-\n land, was present in force at Chicago. It had\n not the hall mark of regularity, the fetich of\n all machine politicians, or even of organiza-\n tion. If it had, as indeed it did have, repre-\n sentatives and sympathizers in the regular\n delegation from New York, it had thereby\n no voice, for such was stifled by the unit rule\n and the vote of instruction of the state con-\n vention, whose credentials the delegation\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0030/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0030/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0030/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0030/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0030/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0030.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 873591}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"30\">\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n bore. Yet this element, organized, dominated\n and directed by Mr. Whitney, as the events\n showed, having in its ranks men of the first\n ability, speaking in the national convention\n if it spoke at all, through the voice of another\n state, accomplished the unheard of and the\n unprecedented. It completely destroyed the\n prestige and influence of the accredited dele-\n gation, rendered the vote registered in oppo-\n sition innocuous, made ridiculous the protest\n framed, signed and circulated, declaring Mr.\n Cleveland couldn\u2019t carry the state, and accom-\n plished the success of its candidate over the\n machine chosen voice of New York. To the\n pangs of defeat was added the bitterness of\n humiliation. The delegation from New York\n returned to the organization that sent it, dis-\n credited by the Democracy of the nation. As\n to whose brain had organized this defeat and\n whose diplomacy had accomplished this hu-\n miliation, men in Chicago had no doubt. Mr.\n Whitney was everywhere credited with the\n feat, and justly. His associates, allies and\n instruments were as loud in according this\n meed to him as anyone else. In view of what\n followed in subsequent weeks and of the pres-\n sure on Mr. Whitney. to enter the Cabinet\n of Mr. Cleveland ' s second term, the attitude\n of the gentleman at the close of the conven-\n tion becomes important and curious.\n</p>\n<p>\n The state organization was sullen and in\n an ugly temper after Chicago. Nor was this\n frame of mind confined to the state leaders.\n It was found in the local organizations in\n the interior of the state. The wounds of\n Chicago gaped for weeks after. A disposi-\n tion to let those who had \u201cmade the nomina-\n tion elect the candidate,\u201d while holding fast\n to all parts of the machinery of organization,\n was manifest. Nor was there at this time\n much disposition shown on the other side,\n flushed with triumphs as it was, to woo the\n machine \u2014 and none at all on the part of the\n candidate, who rested in his faith in the peo-\n ple and the ballot box of November. But\n it was not long before the practical and hard\n headed leaders became satisfied that such\n conditions, if permitted to continue, would\n end in the loss of the state. As November\n showed. New York could have been lost and\n yet victory secured; but in August it seemed\n as if New York was necessary, and to the\n astute the acquiescence of the state organiza-\n tion in the nomination, its co-operation and\n its sincere support of the candidate must be\n secured to bring about success. Effort to\n that end was determined upon, and the diffi-\n cult enterprise of placating and winning the\n organization was confided to the one man\n who, more than any other one person, had\n made the condition he was asked to change\n and overcame \u2014 Mr. Whitney.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is history now that he succeeded beyond\n the most sanguine hopes of those who coun-\n seled with him and who awaited with bated\n breath the results of his diplomacy. The\n organization, in time, came into a support\n which, if it was not ardent, was at least sin-\n cere and \u2018efficient, and to labor inspired by\n a sense of self-preservation suggested by\n Mr. Whitney in his statement to the leaders\n that control of the machinery of the party\n \u25a0would not survive their active or even pas-\n sive antagonism to the national ticket. Dur-\n ing all the days that followed until Novem-\n ber Mr. Whitney was the trusted medium of\n relation between forces that were in the\n nature of things hostile. The final result, of\n course, was triumph at the polls, and the\n thunders of victory had not rolled away\n before Mr. Whitney was pressed to take a\n place In the Cabinet by Mr. Cleveland, and\n urged to consent by the mdn from all parts\n</p>\n<p>\n of the nation who had been his associates\n in the great battle.\n</p>\n<p>\n Stranger still, he was even more strongly\n pressed to accept by the men he had fought\n and humiliated in Chicago and had cajoled\n and persuaded in New York. He was almost\n begged by them to accept and to choose the\n Treasury, that there might be one In a hos-\n tile camp, as they regarded it, whom they\n could trust and on whose word they could\n rely. It was a singular situation and flat-\n tering to the man. However, he was proof\n against pressure and blandishment. It all\n ended in the selection of Daniel S. Lamont,\n as suggested by Mr. Whitney and accepted by\n the President, though the latter preferred\n Mr. Lamont in the closer relation of private\n secretary. Previous to this Mr. Whitney had\n become interested in financial enterprises of\n moment, and his activity in Chicago, and in\n the months of campaign, was but a temporary\n excursion into politics. When the pressure\n was at its height Mr. Whitney said to a\n friend, who would carry the remark to the\n quarters where he desired it to lodge, that\n his acceptance of a Cabinet place was im-\n possible for the reason, if for no other, that\n certain capitalists with whom he was in as-\n sociation had invested largely in enterprises\n under the condition and with the understand-\n ing that he would direct those enterprises to\n the end; that he was bound in honor by the\n trust and confidence reposed in him to do\n so; that it would be a breach of faith on\n his part to abandon them, as he must, were he\n to take office. And the leaders of the oppo-\n sition, when they learned that he so regard-\n ed himself as In honor bound, knew he would\n not commit what he believed to be a breach\n of faith, and forthwith ceased further efforts\n at persuasion as futile.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was asserted above that when Mr. Whit-\n ney became a financier his career as a poli-\n tician ceased. The incident related would\n seem in contradiction of the statement. It is\n not, however, for his career must be measured\n by intent. When he retired from the office of\n Secretary of the Navy it was his intention to\n retire from politics and, plunging at once into\n private enterprises, he believed that he had\n done so. The unprecedented occurred when in\n 1892 the demand for Mr. Cleveland\u2019s third\n nomination came up from the people of the '\n nation. As a rule the leaders of the various\n states were opposed to such nomination, chiefly\n because it was contrary to tradition. Even\n those who were attached to Mr. Cleveland\n doubted the wisdom of it, while many failed\n to appreciate the strength and power of the\n ground swell. It was not until after the lead-\n ers in the movement had oonfessed the neces-\n sity of an organizing force at the head, had\n become alarmed over the array of forces in-\n trenched in power and seeking to thwart the\n will of the majority of the people that anap-\n peal was made to Mr. Whitney to take the\n lead. It was an appeaTdifficult for him to re-\n sist, for* it was an appeal to his loyalty and\n to his duty. So he threw aside, for a time,\n his personal affairs and- devoted himself to\n the task of making it possible that at the con-\n vention, the will of the Democracy should be\n expressed and recorded, and at the ballot box\n the choice of the majority of the people.\n Thoughts of personal advantage or advance-\n ment had no place -with him; all he asked was\n to be permitted to return to his private and\n personal affairs when that work was done.\n There was a repetition of this in 1896. Then\n the appeal made to him was on behalf of the\n old and tried doctrines and principles of the\n Democracy threatened by the uprising of\n demagogues urging wild and fantastical the-\n ories repugnant to- the conservative and dan-\n</p>\n<p>\n gerous in their application. If insanity were\n rampant and sane counsels would not prevail\n it was not because of the want of effort on\n his part and of those -who joined with him.\n When the battle was fought out and the ver-\n dict w r as given he retired to his enterprises\n and since no one has heard of his participa-\n tion in politics. That was four years ago, and\n his friends believe that he will not again be\n a towering figure in the field of politics.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the preceding there is much that ex-\n plains the character of the man.\n</p>\n<p>\n That he is a man of principle and of stead-\n fast conviction, that his endeavors have been\n against the baser and for the better, must be\n conceded in even a hasty glance over his\n career in politics. His advent was in a move-\n ment against the domination of Tammany\n Hall of that day, fallen under criticism and\n condemnation. An ally and supporter of Mr.\n Tilden in that great man\u2019s warfare against\n wrong in the state and for reform in politics,\n he stood afterward in the front rank in the\n battle for the maintenance of what had been\n won by Tilden. When Cleveland arose and\n became the representative and rallying point\n of all that was best in the Democratic party,\n if not, indeed, in politics, no one gave to him\n greater support or encouragement by coun-\n sel than Mr. Whitney. When opposing forces\n seized control and would have overturned\n all that Mr. Cleveland stood for, Mr. Whitney\n was the most powerful single figure in the\n battle against them. W\u2019hen Bryanism, Pop-\n ulism and demogogism engulfed the party Mr.\n Whitney was still fighting for the better, for\n sanity, for honor, going down only when the\n colors fell. In all this time office holding was\n an incident, an accident, never an aspiration.\n His career acquits him of self seeking, and\n as no one has yet been found to charge him\n with seeking material advantage in politics it\n would follow that he was inspired and guided\n by principle. About him during this epoch of\n his life there was nothing of the fanatical or\n impracticable reformer. He knows the world\n and human nature too well not to know that\n men must build with the materials they can\n secure and that real good is accomplished by\n securing what can be attained rather than by\n striving for and failing to reach perfection.\n Whatever of criticism has attended this part\n of his life is found in this relation and has\n come from the \u201cunco\u2019 guid\u201d who dwell ip\n the airy and imaginative realms of the just\n and the perfect.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. W\u2019hitney\u2019s qualities and abilities are\n not of the showy order. Few, if, indeed, any-\n one,. in twenty-five years, has heard him in\n a set speech. Yet his faculty of clear, direct\n precise, logical statement amounts to posi-\n tive genius. Of this faculty a man of large\n affairs said in conversation not long ago:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI sat a few days ago in consultation with\n a group of men over an intricate and vexed\n matter of moment in which all present had\n a direct interest and dependent on ^which was\n a large investment. There was not a man\n present who was not accustomed to handling\n large affairs, but in this matter everyone\n was apparently muddled by the confusing\n and Inconsistent aspects the question p re-\n seated.

Then he drew a resolution of a\n hundred words that directed our course,\n made our determination and fixed our policy.\n He had made everything as clear as the noon-\n day sun and yet when he entered the room\n he had little or no knowledge of the matter\n and had learned all from the blundering state-\n ments of the rest of us.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The testimony of this gentleman reveals\n some of the more significant qualities of Mr.\n Whitney \u2014 a vigorous penetration, a faculty\n of rapid deduction, a comprehensive grasp of\n essentials a capacity for casting out non-\n</p>\n<p>\n essentials that confuse and complicate, to-\n gether with a power of rigorous generaliza-\n tion. It is these qualities that make him\n such a power in the council chamber, his\n abilities in which are conceded by all who\n have been in association therein with him.\n But his abilities are not limited to these\n qualities. His is a common sense almost su-\n perlative. His knowledge of human nature\n is intuitive and his judgment of men rapid\n and accurate. Mr. Whitney probably never\n made a mistake in the choice of an instru-\n ment, and there are some thoughtful men in\n his entourage who are inclined to attribute\n in great measure his success in life more to\n this faculty than to any other. His mind\n is constructive and finds congenial play in\n formation and organization. But above all\n these qualities is his skill as a diplomat.\n</p>\n<p>\n Significant as may be his other qualities, in\n this he is pre-eminent; and whether negotia-\n tions be with the individual, the mass or a\n state his powers are potential and persuasive,\n guided by a tact never at fault and enforced\n by statement and argument without limit of\n resource. To these qualities must be added\n a temperament always under self-control,\n level and equable, a magnetism that is win-\n ning, an address that is engaging, a presence\n that is impressive, a manner that is polished\n without arrogance and kindly without con-\n descension. It is not an uncommon criticism\n among his friends that Mr. Whitney is indo-\n lent. A man who has accomplished as much\n iu this world as Mr. Whitney has is not in-\n dolent. Rather what is taken for indolence\n is the inertia of force quiescent in absence of\n</p>\n<p>\n incitement, for when the impulse is given, as\n those who have served under him can strong-\n ly testify, the momentum is powerful.\n</p>\n<p>\n For tho past teu years Mr. Whitney has\n been engaged in many and vast enterprises\n of an industrial and financial character. The\n same success that attended him in the po-\n litical field has attended him in his later en-\n deavors, and by reason of the possession\n of those qualities which lifted him to dis-\n tinction in public walks he is now enrolled\n in that limited band of Americans of great\n and conspicuous wealth. The fact Is not to\n be avoided that in thus devoting himself to\n accumulation of wealth so much in excess of\n the needs of any man, Mr. Whitney lost a\n certain amount of esteem. Not that criticism\n or condemnation goes to the method or prac-\n tices of his accumulations, but that io-order\n</p>\n<p>\n to devote himself to the amassing of great\n wealth he should have abandoned pursuits\n and ideals far nobler. The time was when\n his name was associated with all the higher\n honors a republic may confer upon the deserv-\n ing of her sons. It is so no longer, and there\n is something significant in the fact. It is re-\n gretted by vast numbers that he has aban-\n doned efforts that would have assuredly led\n him into that realm of higher statesmanship\n in which he was so well equipped to shine,\n to be of great and important service to his\n day and generation and country. Vast num-\n bers of his countrymen were eager to assist\n in cutting deeply his name on that scroll of\n fame which in their patriotism and pride of\n country i3 their legacy to their children;\n those who come after them; the American\n citizen yet unborn. To have him depart from\n a path leading to such heights and devote\n himself to the ignobler pursuits of money\n getting is too much like retrogression, too\n much of deterioration, to be gratifying to\n those who would have delighted to have\n honored him and who would have taken pride\n in seeing him in the high seats, employing\n his superior faculties in the advancement and\n progress of his country.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Whitney is now out of the category of\n political possibilities. He has become too\n rich. It is as difficult for a rich man to\n reach the presidency as It is for \u201ca camel to\n go through the eye of a needle.\u201d It is not\n what the individual thinks of a rich man as\n a candidate, but what he thinks the other\n individual thinks of it, and the result is a\n general verdict of unavailability. Multi-\n millionaires, as a rule, are not popular.\n People are prone to make millions and\n aristocracy synonymous terms. It is\n the aristocrat who is not popular. Yet\n though Mr. Whitney is a man of many mill-\n ions, perhaps luxurious in his mode of life,\n even ostentatious, if it must be said so, he\n is a Democrat, and in tne true Jeffersonian\n sense; believing in the rule of all the people,\n not of a class; believing in the division and\n imposition of responsibility of government to\n the last result as important and potent in\n the progress, advancement and uplifting of\n the American man, and he believes in the\n broadening and not the restriction of Ameri-\n can citizenship. To these principles he has\n been true, and those who have been enabled\n to observe him at close range in these later\n years affirm that the influence of them or\n their pursuits have not abated his sympa-\n thies with the people. Naturally a kindly,\n humane and generous man, it is the testi-\n mony of the officers of detail in his enter-\n prises that, though in the multiplicity and\n vastness of them he raxely comes in personal\n contact with the rank and file of the employes,\n his thought and consideration for them are\n constant and consistent. Kindliness, gener-\n osity and gratitude are characteristics of his\n emotional side. In the matter of the regard\n in which Mr. Whitney is held in his later\n relations in life, a man of large wealth and\n distinction gives this testimony, and it serves\n as a summing up:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMr. Whitney,\u201d he said, \u2018\u2018Is an outcome of\n the modern conditions of finance and com-\n merce. We no longer see the individual\n working out his end alone. Ends are now\n attained by groups of men, often contending\n against other groups of men. Mr. Whitney\n is the leader in a very powerful group who\n are buiding up and extending great capital-\n istic formations. It used to be said of the\n great money kings, Jay Gould, for instance,\n that they were selfish, that they used a man\n so long only as he was fruitful and then cast\n him away. If that were so of individuals it\n Is much more likely to be True of groups of\n</p>\n<p>\n WILLIAM C.

Yet of my own knowledge I\n know it is not true of Mr. Whitney. He is\n a kind man, of generous impulse and warm\n heart, serving loyally thc6e who have served\n him. Now, a man situated as Whitney is\n has brought to him constantly schemes of\n Investment for the development of which his\n capital is wanted. I have observed when\n such a proposition commends itself and\n Is taken up by him that he divides his op-\n portunity with a great many people who\n have served him in the past, when he might\n have selfishly taken it all to himself to a\n greater increase of his wealth. This credit\n is due him; he has made more men inde-\n pendent in circumstances, even wealthy, than\n anybody I have ever known. And it is not\n a pose of hie either. He likes to do it and\n In doing so gratifies his own kindly nature.\n</p>\n<p>\n As a result, he has an army of friends, not\n alone made up of those he has benefited\n and aided, but among those who do not need\n his aid or assistance, yet know his disposi-\n tion. The result is that the other day when\n he got a setback in the street and it was\n rumored that he was far more badly hurt\n than in fact he really was, he had a rush of\n proffers tending to him the use of an enor-\n mous capital, inspired only in friendship\n and a desire not to see that sort of a man\n go down.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Popular distrust of the vastly rich is\n based on the belief that riches are accumu-\n lated by wrecking measures and in indiffer-\n ence to, if not the destruction of, the rights\n of others. An instance of this not long ago\n engaged public attention. A Western capi-\n talist was charged with a lucrative turn in\n</p>\n<p>\n the market by temporarily depreciating the\n value of interests with which he was con-\n nected, accomplishing his great turn by de-\n priving thousands of wages. The same gen-\n tleman touching upon this case further said:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI am fairly well acquainted with the\n methods of the Whitney group of capitalists\n and know I am right in saying that they\n have made their wealth while developing and\n increasing the wealth of the country \u2014 in de-\n veloping resources by which thousands have\n benefited, especially in the matter of wages.\n I am not of his clique; have nothing to do\n with his group, in fact, in a way and degree\n I am a rival of Whitney; but I do think\n that he is the type of an American citizen\n and a capitalist of whom Americans, no mat-\n ter what their degree, may be justly proud.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Joseph Hodges Choate.\n</p>\n<p>\n BRILLIANT ADVOCATE AND JURY LAWYER.\n PUBLIC SPEAKER, RACONTEUR AND WIT.\n</p>\n<p>\n I T SOMETIMES occurs that so far from be-\n ing a benefit, or an advantage, the super-\n lative fame gained by a man in his pur-\n suit is a positve disadvantage to others of\n his name and blood who come after him.\n Especially is this so if the same pursuit or\n profession is engaged upon. The world man-\n ifests a disposition to measure the abilities\n and qualities of the upcomer by the achieve-\n ments of him who has arrived. The inherit-\n er of the glorified name finds himself at the\n beginning, by reason of his inheritance, in\n the lime light where he can be closely and\n particularly observed. The cruelty of his\n position would be far less were those as-\n suming to sit in judgment, to measure him\n by the abilities and qualities displayed by\n his illustrious relative in a similar stage\n of life. But no, the neophyte is compared\n with the master rich in acquired skill and\n In practice. So, though the world to win is\n a vast undertaking for the ablest and strong-\n est of youth, he who sets out in the shad-\n ow of a great name assumes an additional\n burden to struggle under \u2014 a burden unjustly\n imposed.\n</p>\n<p>\n Something of this must have been appre-\n ciated by Joseph Hodges Choate, the great\n lawyer and present ambassador to the Court\n of St. James. A nephew of Rufus Choate,\n he must have gloried in the fanje and won-\n derful eloquence of that great advocate, in-\n deed may have been inspired by the example\n of that relative to tread in his footsteps\n since he entered upon the study of the law\n Immediately on his graduation from Harvard,\n but he seems to have been at pains to dis-\n associate himself and his career from that\n great relative as much as possible. No\n sooner had he completed his legal studies and\n</p>\n<p>\n been admitted to the bar of Massachusetts\n than he removed to New York and applied for\n admission ,to the bar of that state. There,\n at least, he would not be in constant and\n daily association with the traditions of Rufus\n Choate; there the measuring rod would not\n be so closely applied. If he lost something\n in the way of influence with which he might\n have been surrounded, he gained far more\n in not being forced into the lime light while\n developing and growing.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Choate was born in Salem, Mass., in\n 1832, the old town which was then the resi-\n dence of Rufus Choate. He was but 20\n when he graduated from Harvard and but\n 24 when he graduated from the Dane law\n school, but 25 when admitted to the bar\n and but 26 when he cast in his fortunes\n with the City of New York, since which time\n he has been closely identified with New\n York City and a conspicuous figure in its\n life. His career covers a period of forty-\n two years and it is one of almost unparal-\n leled activity at the bar.\n</p>\n<p>\n Such fame as Mr. Choate enjoys, and it is\n of a high degree, has been won wholly in\n the practice of his profession. Early asso-\n ciated with the firm of Evarts, Southmayd &\n Choate he has been a conspicuous figure in\n almost every case, on one side or the other,\n of superior importance or notoriety during\n these years and wholly in cases nisi prius.\n This statement carries with it more mean-\n ing to members of the bar than it does to\n the laymen. It is to say that Mr. Choate is\n a trial lawyer in civil cases of fact before a\n jury. There seem to be degrees of rank in\n the esteem of the profession, if not in fact,\n which puts those who argue issues and\n questions of law before the court in bench\n</p>\n<p>\n in the first grade; those who try civil causes\n before a jury in the second, and those who\n try criminal cases before a jury in the third\n grade. During his long career at the bar\n Mr. Choate has been a trial lawyer in civil\n cases before a jury and ranks as high therein\n as any man in the country, if not a notch\n or two higher. This has not made him the\n leader of the bar of New York, despite his\n fame and public reputation. Such leader\n must be looked for among those in the front\n rank who argue issues and questions of law\n before the court in bench. The position of\n the leader of the bar is not one of appoint-\n ment, election or even formal designation,\n and when the dignity is attained it seems it\n is by reason of the unanimity of opinion\n and concession of bis brother members of\n the bar. Charles O\u2019Conor in his day was the\n undisputed leader, and was succeeded on\n his death by William ' M. Evarts, who on his\n retirement was succeeded by Francis M.\n Bangs, whose reign was short because of his\n death. Perhaps the bar was slow in center-\n ing on the successor of Mr. Bangs, but in\n time Mr. James C. Carter loomed up as such\n figure impelled by the invisible force of the\n unanimous opinion of the bar and so stand*\n to-day.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now while a leader wins his leadership by\n his efforts before the court ih bench, it is\n not to say that he will not be found an advo-\n cate in civil causes before a jury or as a trier\n of criminal cases. One of Charles O\u2019Conor\u2019s\n last appearances ih court was as counsel for\n the grandson of his old friend. Chancellor\n Walworth, who had killed his father, Mans-\n field Walworth, and he saved him from the\n gallows. Mr. William M.

Such wealth of\n resources and power over them it is difficult\n for me to comprehend. As a matter of per-\n sonal experience I should like to undergo the\n sensations of a man who possesses them and\n puts them into action. They must wheel\n into action with a series of mental shocks akin\n to mild dynamite explosions.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n As an examiner of witnesses Mr. Choate Is\n far reaching and ingenious. There is in him\n that quality possessed by a chess player who\n moves his pieces with reference to one a\n dozen moves ahead. His question is asked,\n the answer recorded and the next one seems\n so remote and irrational as to be illogical\n that it is only when a dozen questions more\n have been asked that the important bearing\n of the singular question is seen and if the\n witness be an unwilling one, it will be found\n that the information he was so carefully\n guarding has been wrested from him to his\n confusion and bewilderment as to how it oc-\n curred.\n</p>\n<p>\n He appears to have an intuitive perception\n of the state of the minds of his jury and to\n play upon them as if they were the strings of\n an instrument. He perceives their prejudices\n and uses his knowledge with a skill often be-\n yond- the understanding of those associated\n with him in the conduct of his case. In for-\n ensic eloquence he is a master and the arts\n at his command are many. Wit, fancy, hu-\n mor, sarcasm, imagination, argumentation and\n persuasion are all instruments at his com-\n mand and he employs them with a skill born\n of a delight in their exercise and the practice\n of many years.\n</p>\n<p>\n Apart from his side as a brilliant advocate\n Mr. Choate is an orator. His appearance on\n the platform during these forty years of close\n identification with the life of New York has\n been frequent. On the political rostrum in\n advancing the principles of the party of his\n adhesion he has often appeared, but on other\n occasions and with other subjects where\n usage demands a greater dignity of utter-\n ance he has won applause. And he is finely\n equipped for the role. An engaging and im-\n pressive presence is one of his fortunate pos-\n sessions and a voice, musical and of wide\n power, cultivated into absolute obedience to\n his will. His rare scholarship here makes it-\n self apparent.\n</p>\n<p>\n As a wit and humorist he is noted. Over\n the dinner table his contests with Chauncey\n M. Depew and Horace Porter have been many\n and sharp. In keen repartee, in sharp, lanc-\n ing thrusts and in sustained flights of humor\n he excels. His reputation for wit and humor\n preceded him, much to his annoyance and\n embarrassment, to foreign lands and his ad-\n vent at the court of St. James was heralded\n by columns of anecdotes of his witty retorts.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Choate, as was remarked previously, has\n found his fame in the courts as a trial law-\n yer. That he had the capabilities for success\n before the appellate courts none who know\n him doubt. He is a man of superior intel-\n lectual faculties, and had he demoted him-\n self to the study of the Intricacies of the law\n and its philosophy would have been as fls-\n</p>\n<p>\n defense against the charges of Theodore Til-\n ton, in that case in Brooklyn that lasted for\n six months. It is sought to make the point\n that it is in the practice before the court in\n bench and not before the jury that the dig-\n nity of leadership is attained in order that it\n may be explained why Joseph Hodges Choate,\n the most widely known and most conspicuous\n practitioner at the bar, is not by his fellow\n members regarded as the leader. His\n practice has been almost wholly in civil cases\n before a jury and his appearances before the\n court in bench have been so few compared\n with his life\u2019 work that they cut small figure\n in his career.\n</p>\n<p>\n Frankly stated, Mr. Choate has not shone\n to the same advantage before the court in\n</p>\n<p>\n others and is avoided, the shrewd and mas-\n terful knowledge of human nature, the dra-\n matic power that effects a sure lodgment in\n the untrained mind in the jury box and the\n emotional eloquence that sways men in the\n mass, all of which are the sure possessions\n of Mr. Choate, are made manifest.\n</p>\n<p>\n Perhaps inclination, but unquestionably\n the possession of mental attributes especially\n fitting him for the career he has so famously\n followed drifted him into and continued him\n in the practice where his triumphs have been\n achieved. A most agile mind which moves\n with power and force is clearly his. The ra-\n pidity of his comprehension is something most\n disconcerting to his opponents when they find\n</p>\n<p>\n JOSEPH HODGES CHOATE.\n</p>\n<p>\n bench as before the court and jury. But in\n the latter stand he has been almost without\n peer.

During his long career he has\n borne himself -with honor and without stain.\n No breath of scandal has touched his gar-\n ments in this long and most active career,\n and his standing as a citizen, apart from the\n bar, is attested in his years of presidency of\n the Union League Club and of the New Eng-\n land Society.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Choate has not been without political\n aspirations, but they have not been gratified.\n His activity in politics has been rather spas-\n modic than continuous. At times and when\n the campaign has interested him he has been\n on the stump and has been a power when so\n aroused. But when the issues have not ap-\n pealed strongly to him he has been a laggard\n in the rear. Back in the seventies he was an\n active and able participant in the movement\n which overthrew the Tweed ring and drove\n its members into prison or exile. He was a\n member of the Committee of Seventy in those\n years. His aspirations have been in the di-\n rection of the United States Senate, and his\n friends more than once when the chances\n seemed promising have made efforts to have\n his ambition advanced. But the forces that\n controlled have been against him. There have\n</p>\n<p>\n been times when his name has been promi-\n nent for .gubernatorial honors, but the same\n forces have promptly been exerted in oppo-\n sition. The truth is that Mr. Choate politi-\n cally is a very independent quantity, and by\n no means given to lower his crest to any\n commander. This independence and sense of\n superiority is a part of the man. He has\n not the ductility nor that sort of thrift that\n follows fawning, and does not know how,\n or, if he does, does not find that it com-\n ports with the ideas of dignity to \u201ccrook the\n pregnant hinges of the knees.\u201d It is more\n in his way to command success than to win\n by sycophancy. A man of the utmost tact\n in the practice of his profession, he seems\n to lose it all in his touch with politics, and\n permits himself to sit in judgment on and\n speak with plainness of those who have arro-\n gated the reins of party control. In short,\n Mr. Choate is not a machine politician, and\n instead of regarding the machine as the\n arbiter of destiny he looks upon it simply as\n a means to a proper organization, and that\n when it steps out of those lines it exceeds its\n prerogatives, becoming a menace to good\n order. In these days of \u201cboss\u201d control such\n sentiments, however admirable, are distinctly\n</p>\n<p>\n suicidal to all who would shine in public\n place.\n</p>\n<p>\n His appointment as Ambassador to Eng-\n land was a surprise. Few believed that such\n a place was within his ambition or even his\n liking. When his selection W ' as made known\n it was freely ventured that he w T ould not\n forego his lucrative practice, perhaps the\n most lucrative of any single lawyer, for a\n place that could hold out such little induce-\n ments to a man of his mental activity. Yet\n he accepted it to the surprise of his friends\n and the w ' onder of his associates. It is the\n only office he has held in his dotable and\n conspicuous career. The explanation offered\n is that Mr. Choate, born in 1832, was ap-\n proaching the scriptural limitation of age of\n man, that he desired to retire from a practice\n that w r ould be burdensome and wearing on\n a younger man, and having amassed a large\n competence in his forty years of practice,\n saw in the acceptance of this highly honor-\n able and distinguished diplomatic place an\n easy means of doing so. It crowns an hon-\n orable career and it is the belief of his friends\n that when he returns from the service, which\n may be delayed four years yet, it will be\n found that his acceptance of the place was\n the beginning of his retirement from the\n active affairs of men.\n</p>\n<p>\n John Wanamaker.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00ab\n</p>\n<p>\n r\n</p>\n<p>\n INDUSTRY AND ADVERTISEMENT: : : :\n ANALYTICAL AND CONSTRUCTIVE GIFTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n M ERCHANT prince, statesman, orator,\n writer and Sunday School superin-\n tendent \u2014 sucii are the titles of John\n Wanamaker, ex-Postmaster General of the\n United States, and one of the most interest-\n ing and striking figures of contemporaneous\n history. Indeed, it is doubtful if the annals\n of Americans who have achieved promi-\n nence present a more picturesque career\n or one which demonstrates more fully\n how a determined man may triumph\n over natural disadvantages and how com-\n pletely success is at the mercy of talent\n and industry. Wanamaker\u2019s career is unique\n in many respects. Born of humble parentage,\n he has been absolutely the maker of his own\n fortunes, and has advanced himself on entire-\n ly original lines and in direct contrast to the\n methods usually deemed essential to prog-\n ress by most self made men.\n</p>\n<p>\n By a careful perusal of the biographies of\n those men who are prominent in the- world\n of business, finance, statecraft and politics,\n it will be found almost invariably that they\n owe their success to one of four factors. Fre-\n quently they are the fortunate scions of fam-\n ilies of wealth and position, and the ' natural\n advantages of birth and training push*them\n rapidly to the fore; or, if born poor, they\n study law and gain prominence through the\n short and spectacular route of brilliant per-\n formances at the bar; again, the typical poli-\n tician usually; owes hie success to the fact\n</p>\n<p>\n that he has made politics his life business\n and devoted himself exclusively to the task\n of making an easy living at the public ex-\n pense. In the fourth class may he mention-\n ed those who have come to the front through\n accident and fortunate combination of cir-\n cumstances, such as speculators who have\n had the luck to make fortunes at one stroke\n or politicians who have unexpectedly been\n swept into power by the inexplicable fluctu-\n ations of public preference.\n</p>\n<p>\n None of these rules holds good, however,\n in the case of John Wanamaker, and his suc-\n cess cannot be explained along ordinary lines.\n He had no advantages of birth, his family\n having been only humble brickmakers, who\n lived in that primitive section of Philadelphia\n knowm as the Neck. He never studied law\n and his entire education was limited to a few\n brief years in the lower grades of the public\n schools. He did not use politics as a stepping\n stone to advancement; indeed, he never be-\n came a factor in public affairs until long after\n his life fight had been won. Finally, no luck\n entered into his life, no fortunate phenomena\n made him master of the fickle goddess of for-\n tune and pushed him to the front in spite of\n himself.\n</p>\n<p>\n How. then, has this illiterate brickmaker\n succeeded in making his fame international\n as one of the greatest merchants this country\n ever produced? How r has this business man,\n untrained in the devious ways of diplomacy,\n been able to produce his masterly speeches\n</p>\n<p>\n and writings, marked by a trenchant direct-\n ness and a power of cleanness and logic\n worthy the best efforts of a skilled lawyer?\n What strange gift has enabled this mere mer-\n chant, ignorant of all the tricks and manipu-\n lations of practical politics, to enter public\n life when late in years, achieve the high\n office of postmaster general, discharge its\n onerous and complex duties \u25a0with a skill com-\n manding the unqualified tribute of men of\n all shades of political opinion, and finally to\n inaugurate in Pennsylvania the greatest fight\n for political reform known in years; a fight\n which has resulted iu the exclusion of the\n once all powerful Quay from the Senate, and\n has made the discredited machine tremble\n for its very existence? What is this secret?\n What has made Wanamaker a success in\n everything he has attempted? Why is he\n such a power, and what are the lessons to be\n drawn from his life?\n</p>\n<p>\n To sum up briefly, it may be answered that\n the secret lies in an indefatigable capacity\n for hard work, an invincible confidence in his\n own ability, the marvelous and rare capacity\n of combining the faculty of seeing things in\n a big way with a phenomenal mastery of\n smaller things \u2014 the details; the genius of\n shrewd, judicious advertising, and finally the\n analytical gift \u2014 the faculty of judiciously con-\n sidering all problems, business and political,\n from a purely impersonal standpoint and ar-\n riving at an equitable \u2018decision, best calcu-.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0035/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 345, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 493}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0035/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 691, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 987}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0035/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1383, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1975}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0035/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2767, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3950}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0035/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0035.jp2", "height": 3950, "width": 2767, "levels": 6, "size": 933059}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"35\">\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n 33\n</p>\n<p>\n lated to meet with popular approval and to\n bring about the desired results.\n</p>\n<p>\n Among all his army of employes, reaching\n into the thousands, no one is constantly\n busier or works harder than Wanamaker.\n For all his various interests, business and\n political, he manages to find time for per-\n sonal supervision. He manages in person\n the two largest department stores in the\n United States, if not in the world, his Phila-\n delphia and his New York emporiums, and\n is thoroughly in touch with all the working\n details and knows exactly to what extent\n the various departments are proving remu-\n nerative or otherwise.\n</p>\n<p>\n Moreover, he finds time to take an active\n part in public affairs and his entrance into\n</p>\n<p>\n the putrid pit of Pennsylvania politics has\n offered the reputable element of the Key-\n stone State its first chance of successfully\n combating the octopus of discredited ma-\n chine domination. He keeps a close eye on\n political events, takes personal charge when-\n ever his assistance is necessary and can de-\n liver an offhand stump speech, which for sar-\n casm, clearness, biting invective, logic and\n the ability to compress vital truths into\n short, trenchant epigrams which linger in\n the memory, cannot be surpassed by any ex-\n temporaneous speaker of our day.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this manner, though a novice in prac-\n tical politics, he has fought experienced heel-\n ers to a standstill. It is the consensus of\n opinion among those in a position to best\n</p>\n<p>\n judge, that Wanamaker has done more. to\n break down machine power in Pennsylvania\n than any man of our generation. He has\n compelled the withdrawal of disreputable\n candidates; has forced the dismissal of dis-\n graced and incompetent officials who owed\n their public life to a venal governor; has\n conferred a genuine sewice on the entire na-\n tion by his successful effort to prevent Quay\u2019s\n re-election to the Senate, and, finally, within\n the last few weeks, by his prompt and coura-\n geous expose of the attempt of the Phila-\n delphia administration to gag the press and\n stifle criticism, has vindicated the freedom of\n the press and brought down on the heads of\n the offending officials a storm of universal\n and scathing denunciation, almost unprece-\n</p>\n<p>\n dented, and the final results of which_cannot\n be adequately measured.\n</p>\n<p>\n Probably the most striking feature of the\n man\u2019s personal side is his lack of ostenta-\n tion. There is absolutely no pose ' about him,\n he is perfectly natural, and although there are\n an infinitude of demands on his time, he is\n always prepared to accord an interview to\n any one, and he makes it a rule of conduct\n to always treat all visitors uniformly. Great\n or small, young or old, always receive the\n same courteous, concentrated attention.\n</p>\n<p>\n In appearance there is little about the man\n to indicate his extraordinary capacity, al-\n though the head is well shaped, the forehead\n high and the eyes clear and penetrating. It\n is distinctly a face of the true Quaker type,\n</p>\n<p>\n the kind that would cause its owner to be rec-\n ognized as a Philadelphian in almost any\n principal city of the United States. He has\n never worn a beard and his face is round and\n smooth as a baby\u2019s. He has large features\n and plump, ruddy cheeks, which indicate that\n their owner has mastered the problem of liv-\n ing without permitting his multitudinous\n cares to fret him. The predominant expres-\n sion of his face is mild and kindly, though\n there is a hint of sarcastic humor there in the\n fine, clear eyes, and a suggestion oT indomit-\n able will power in the firm, forceful lips.\n</p>\n<p>\n In conversation he speaks rapidly, in a low\n tone of voice, looking his auditor straight\n in the eye and with a penetrating glance that\n seems to command deference and frankness.\n He usually \" accompanies his remarks, especial-\n ly when engrossed in his subject, by gesticu-\n lating with his eyeglasses, balanced between\n the thumb and index finger of his right hand.\n</p>\n<p>\n His public speaking ' is very similar in-\n deed to his private utterance. In addressing\n an audience he does not strive \u2022 to ' confuse\n them by indulging in grandiloquent theoreti- '\n cal flights. He does not believe in obscuring '\n his meaning by the employment of tlie stock\n devices of the typical orator. ' Instead; he\n concentrates his every effort on the selection\n of plain, direct words which will ' convey brief- 1\n ly and forcibly exactly the idea he wishes to\n present and will leave an indelible impression \u2019\n on the minds of bis -hearers. As a conse-\n quence he is conceded to be probably the best\u2019\n all around speaker in the- state \u2014 a- speaker\n much in the style of ex-President Harrison :\n or ex-Speaker Reed. He has an inimitable \u25a0\n faculty of blunt, homely, ' forceful speech and\n in a few pithy, biting sentences can prove the '\n fallacy of the most elaborate and artfully pre-\n pared argumentative structure.\n</p>\n<p>\n As examples of his characteristic disregard\n for appearances, it may be mentioned that he\n dresses modestly, even plainly, and ' has his\n office fitted out comfortably, but without the\n least attempt at display. In going around '\n the city he seldom calls a carriage \u25a0 into\n requisition and may be seen frequently rid-\n ing in ' the democratic street car, just as\n though his fortune did not run into the ' mill-\n ions. \u25a0 \u25a0\n</p>\n<p>\n Yet ' it must not be understood that this\n naturalness, this lack of the pedantic and\n awe-like gravity which public men so fre-\n quently affect, indicates a lack of dignity.\n There is about the man a sense of power that\n commands instant respect and wins instinct-\n ive deference even from his close associates\n and business connections..\n</p>\n<p>\n The statement is frequently made that no\n man ever amassed a million dollars as a re-\n sult of his own efforts in mercantile pursuits,\n and that it is only through stock operations\n that the accumulation of great fortunes is\n possible. Wananiaker\u2019s career is a standing\n and practical refutation of this theory, for,\n although he is a millionaire several times\n over and has the distinction of being the\n moat heavily insured man in the world, he\n has never dabbled in stocks or gambling\n ventures, but has made every dollar of his\n fortune through the channels of legitimate\n trade. In this respect he is unique and his\n career has no parallel.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is, therefore, interesting to trace the\n method by which he succeeded in building up\n his business pre-eminence, especially as it\n affords a valuable insight as to his character-\n istics; and mental operations. It may be\n briefly mentioned that there was nothing in\n \u2022his ancestry to foreshadow his wonderful\n business talent.

He\n had not a cent in the world and his first sal-\n ary for working in a hook store was $1.50 a\n week. Later on he secured employment as a\n clothing salesman and proved himself within\n a short time so shrewd and keen and such\n a good business man that his appreciative em-\n ployers raised his wages again and again.\n During this time the future creator of the\n department store was carefully husbanding\n his scanty resources in order to secure the\n modest capital necessary to a start in life.\n</p>\n<p>\n With the self control so characteristic of\n him in later years he practiced the most rigid\n economy, and eternly denied himself all\n the diversions and amusenreffls which young\n men usually deem indispensable. In this way\n he succeeded in amassing $2,000 by the time\n he was 20, and in 1861 embarked in the retail\n clothing business with Nathan Brown. The\n partnership prospered from the first, and as\n evidence of Mr. Wanamaker\u2019s industry and\n devotion to business an occurrence of this\n period is full of interest. Almost the first\n order which the new firm received came from\n the Custom House, and for a considerable\n quantity of employes\u2019 uniforms. The uni-\n forms were wanted in great haste and ac-\n cording to . specifications were to be finished\n in the short space of twenty-four hours. The\n order was received at 3 o\u2019clock in the after-\n noon and Mr. Wanamaker unhesitatingly\n agreed to have them finished by 3 o\u2019clock the\n next day.\n</p>\n<p>\n In order to achieve this feat it was neces-\n sary to work all night, but the suits were\n ready on time, and in the rush Mr. Wana-\n maker, the future Postmaster-General of the\n United States, helped to deliver them and\n personally pushed around a large quantity\n in a big wheelbarrow.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many of the systems now in use at his de-\n partment stores in New York and Philadel-\n phia had their inception at this period. His\n first care was the devising of a systematic\n method of ascertaining the wants of the pub-\n lic, in order that he could successfully ca-\n ter to them and thereby advance his busi-\n ness. This was achieved in many clever\n W ' ays. Careful records were kept of the prefer-\n ences and peculiarities of all the customers.\n In addition to this each clerk was compelled\n to keep a record of the comments of each\n person who came into the store and, in case\n they failed to purchase, the reason. More-\n over, in a large book were written all sug-\n gestions received from any source whatever\n and calculated to increase the business.\n</p>\n<p>\n Beside these measures for finding custom\n the young merchant introduced many reforms\n calculated to keep it after it had been se-\n cured. Among these may be mentioned the\n system of returning goods when not satisfac-\n tory. Wanamaker was the first to inaugu-\n rate this system, which is now so generally\n in vogue.\n</p>\n<p>\n The main factor, however, in the phenom-\n enal success of John Wanamaker may be said\n to be his wonderful understanding of the pos-\n sibilities of advertising. Early in his busi-\n ness career he recognized that while advertis-\n ing is absolutely essential to the success of\n a modern business, nevertheless it must be\n \u2022judiciously handled and that as much good\n money has been wasted on ill considered ad-\n vertising as has ever been made through it.\n Accordingly, as soon as his business warrant-\n ed, he employed a man specially to write his\n ads, and secured the best, regardless of cost.\n It is said that he pays his present advertise-\n ment writer more money yearly than he him-\n self received when he was Postmaster Gen-\n</p>\n<p>\n eral. The same method is pursued in his\n stores, and as long as a man can produce the\n desired results he can command almost any\n salary within reasoh. Wanamaker contends\n that no man is cheap if he is not good, and\n never stands on the question of expense in\n the selection of his various department chiefs.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is doubtful if there is any store in the\n United States whose organization is as com-\n plete and ingenious and as thoroughly cal-\n culated to bring out the full producing quali-\n ties of the enterprise as the store at Thir-\n teenth and Market streets, Philadelphia.\n Every detail emerged from the fertile brain\n of the versatile Wanamaker. and when the\n system was explained to General Grant some\n years ago, and the grim warrior was afforded\n an opportunity to admire its working, he re-\n marked: \u201cMr. Wanamaker, you are the great-\n est organizer I ever knew. You would make\n the greatest quartermaster of all time.\u2019\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n The business is divided up into depart-\n ments and at the head of each department\n is a specialist who frequently receives a sal-\n ary which even a United States Senator\n might consider princely. Each one of these\n heads depends, however, for his term of of-\n fice absolutely on the results he can achieve.\n In order to get at this exactly, each of these\n chiefs is actually compelled to rent his de-\n partment from Mr. Wanamaker and to run it\n as a sort of private enterprise. At the end\n of the year the keen-eyed proprietor care-\n fully balances up the accounts, and if the\n fortunate department chief has been success-\n ful and returned a good profit, he is fittingly\n rewarded; but if the reverse is true, and the\n returns are not commensurate with Mr.\n Wanamaker\u2019s conception of the producing\n possibilities of the department in question,\n then a new man is secured and the old head\n is either degraded or dismissed. Results!\n Results! Results! is the sole demand of the\n firm, and no man is permitted to stay unless\n he can produce them.\n</p>\n<p>\n No partiality is shown; a man must stand\n absolutely on his merits and is given the\n fullest possible latitude in the management\n of his department. He is allowed to dictate\n the policy of his advertising, has almost un-\n limited sway in the ordering of stock and is\n permitted to introduce any new ideas and\n schemes calculated to produce business.\n Every person in the entire establishment\n from the chief assistant down is taught to\n consider himself or herself as an integral\n part of the enterprise and Mr. Wanamaker\n would put into practice a good suggestion\n received from the office boy with quite as\n much willingness as he would avail himself\n of the idea of his ten thousand dollar adver-\n tising man.\n</p>\n<p>\n An interesting feature of the day\u2019s regime\n and one which graphically illustrates the\n close personal supervision which Mr. Wana-\n maker maintains over the business, is the\n daily report of the various department chief-\n tains. At 6 o\u2019clock all the heads assemble\n in his private office and present to him a\n carefully prepared and detailed account of\n the day\u2019s business, including each sale, the\n total receipts, the amount of stock remain-\n ing unsold, and the probable profits of the\n day\u2019s business. These reports Mr. Wana-\n maker scans rapidly and is able to tell al-\n most at a glance whether the returns are\n satisfactory. He adjusts hi3 eyeglasses,\n scans the reports and in crisp, short sen-\n tences expresses his opinion and makes com-\n ments and suggestions.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cExcellent!\u201d \u201cVery good!\u201d \u201cA decided im-\n provement!\u201d \u201cNot quite up to your standard,\n Mr. Blank; what is the matter?\u201d \u201cA fine\n showing; evidently your new advertising\n plan was a winner, Mr. Smith!\u201d \u201cRather un-\n</p>\n<p>\n satisfactory, Mr. Jone\u00ab, not up to last year.\n You must improve your department some-\n how,\u201d are some of the comments he passes\n as he weighs the results. He never departs\n from his accustomed courtesy and even when\n the returns are notably unsatisfactory never\n humiliates the department head by castiga-\n tion in the presence of others. All his em-\n ployes are personally devoted to him and in\n return he has established many plans of prac-\n tical philanthropy, such as employes\u2019 insur-\n ance, lodging house, eating rooms, library,\n etc.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the general public, however, there will\n be greater interest in that phase of Wana-\n maker\u2019s character that has brought him to the\n front rank of the better class of politicians,\n men of affairs, who from disinterested mo-\n tives enter public life in an honest endeavor\n to better existing conditions and to supplant\n political manipulation with business methods\n in administration of public office.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is only in recent years that Wanamaker\n has become a factor in politics and his success\n has been little short of remarkable. As a\n matter of natural qualification, no man could\n have seemed less likely to succeed in the po-\n litical arena. A business man by preference\n and training, entirely unfamiliar with the\n trade of politics, he also had to face the vin-\n dictive enmity of petty shopkeepers and small\n business people, who fancied they had a griev-\n ance against the enterprising merchant who\n had done more than all her public men com-\n bined to give to Philadelphia a standing and\n reputation in the world of trade.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nevertheless, Wanamaker, with customary\n courage and daring, broke ruthlessly into pol-\n itics and began a determined crusade against\n the folly of turning the state over to the ten-\n der mercies of mere mercenaries, whose sole\n interest in public affairs was the secural of a\n comfortable living with a minimum of honest\n toil. In other words, he advocated the appli-\n cation of every day business principles to the\n selection of public officers and his simple,\n blunt statements of fact made a deep impres-\n sion wherever he spoke.\n</p>\n<p>\n He was the organizer and the prime spirit\n of the Business Men\u2019s League, which did such\n effective service for McKinley and Hobart\n in 1896. The defeat of his senatorial ambi-\n tions did not dampen his ardor, and he still\n maintains the fight for good government and\n has gone the length and breadth of Pennsyl-\n vania, at his own expense, in his efforts to\n improve existing conditions.\n</p>\n<p>\n His methods are unique. In small towns\n he refuses to mount the rostrum, but instead\n sits down and talks the matter informally\n over with the assembled farmers, making all\n his points forcibly and clearly, and cheerfully\n answering all questions which may be pro-\n pounded. This is not only an evidence of\n Wanamaker\u2019s democracy; it is also a strik-\n ing demonstration of his shrewdness, for it\n is doubtful if any more efficacious method of\n winning the confidence of the suspicious\n farmers could be devised.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another striking trait of his character and\n one which would scarcely be expected in this\n cool, calculating man of business, is a certain\n peculiar daring. This manifests itself in\n the most unexpected ways and has frequent-\n ly turned the tables, and thrown opponents\n into a panic, when they thought they had\n him surely and finally defeated. For in-\n stance: Some years ago rumor connected\n his name with a scandal involving the spoli-\n ation of the City Treasury and the failure of\n several banks. There was absolutely no evi-\n dence to support the accusation, but mali-\n cious enemies, hoping to cripple him, did their\n best to stir up private feeling and to circu-\n</p>\n<p>\n (\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0037/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 345, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 493}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0037/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 691, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 987}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0037/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1383, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1975}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0037/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2767, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3950}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0037/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0037.jp2", "height": 3950, "width": 2767, "levels": 6, "size": 549233}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"37\">\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n late damaging insinuations. They had reck-\n oned without their host, for as soon as he\n grasped the situation, Wanamaker turned\n on his traducers with magnificent courage\n and, standing boldly forth, simply demanded\n that they prove their accusations or be si-\n lent under penalty of the law. He offered\n to do everything calculated to aid an inves-\n tigation; offered to submit his private books\n and papers to any experts who might be\n selected and to vindicate his honesty before\n any court which might be chosen. The re-\n sult was that a complete and absolute victory\n and the surreptitious and malice inspired\n charges collapsed like a house of cards.\n</p>\n<p>\n Later an attempt was made to involve him\n in the defalcations of Gideon Marsh, the fugi-\n tive cashier of the Keystone National Bank,\n whose failure in Philadelphia some years ago\n involved many unfortunate depositors. It\n was slyly insinuated that Wanamaker knew\n more about the matter than he cared to tell\n and that if Marsh ever returned he would se-\n riously involve the ex-Postraaster General.\n Once again Wanamaker proved too much for\n his opponents and completely discomfited\n them by one of his bold, characteristic\n strokes. Standing on the stage of the Acad-\n emy of Music in town meeting, he solemnly\n requested the fugitive cashier, who had been\n absent for ten years, to return and tell all\n he knew, promising that when justice had\n been satisfied and Marsh had served his term\n he would aid him in securing a new start in\n life.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was a dramatic scene, although but few\n persons expected that the offer would ever be\n accepted; consequently, there was general\n surprise when, a few days later, Marsh did\n come back, having read Wanamaker\u2019s speech\n in a Western paper, and weary of evading\n justice. In his subsequent examination and\n trial, though the fullest investigation was\n made, not one scintilla of evidence was pro-\n</p>\n<p>\n duced which tended in any way to incrimi-\n nate Wanamaker and the attempt to involve\n him fizzled out as dismally as all its prede-\n cessors.\n</p>\n<p>\n Behind the quiet, unassuming exterior and\n the round, kindly face, there are an iron\n nerve, an invincible determination and re-\n fusal to be browbeaten, which have often dis-\n agreeably surprised those who have attempt-\n ed to awe him.\n</p>\n<p>\n The unwarranted attempt of Director En-\n glish to frighten him, in order to suppress\n newspaper criticism, is an excellent illustra-\n tion of this quality. Accompanied by another\n city official he called on Mr. Wanamaker at\n his office and threatened that unless the at-\n tacks of a certain Philadelphia paper on the\n administration were immediately stopped he\n would inaugurate a systematic attempt to de-\n fame the character of the merchant. Under\n stress of such exasperating circumstances,\n many another man would have called his por-\n ter and had the offending visitor thrown bod-\n ily from the office. With customary coolness,\n however, Mr. Wanamaker maintained com-\n posure, called in his secretary, thereby se-\n curing a witness to the interview, and after\n Mr. English had seriously involved himself\n ordered him quietly from the office. Then,\n instead of evading the issue or trembling at\n the promised exposures, he came boldly out,\n rested his case with the people and defied the\n administration to make good its threat. Since\n that time nothing has emanated from the\n City Hall, although the public has expectant-\n ly waited for the incriminating revelations\n concerning Mr. Wanamaker.\n</p>\n<p>\n Not only can Mr. Wanamaker run a de-\n partment store, deliver a political speech and\n manage the affairs of a cabinet office, but\n he is also deeply interested in religious mat-\n ters and is superintendent of the largest Sun-\n day school in Philadelphia, if not in the\n Unied States. Every Sunday afternoon he\n</p>\n<p>\n delivers a Bible talk and the building is al-\n ways crowded by those desirous of hearing\n him. These discourses are models of prac-\n tical Christianity, good, sensible^ advice,\n marked by that fine sanity and moderation\n so characteristic of all his deliverances.\n</p>\n<p>\n Each Sunday, as he enters, a little scene is\n enacted, which probably finds no counterpart\n in any other Sunday school. Ascending the\n pulpit and taking his place at the speakers\u2019\n stand he turns to the congregation and says,\n \u201cGood afternoon, friends.\u201d In one mighty\n voice the entire congregation answers back,\n \u201cGood afternoon, Mr. Wanamaker.\u201d There\n is semething very attractive about this little\n episode, it establishes an instant harmony\n between the speaker and the audience and\n there is a genuine heartiness in the unani-\n mous reply of the congregation, which well\n bespeaks the affectionate esteem in which\n they hold their superintendent.\n</p>\n<p>\n Wanamaker makes it a fixed rule, however,\n not to mingle his three dominant life inter-\n ests\u2014 business, religion and politics. Each\n has its separate and distinct place. In his\n church and in his employ and among his\n closest associates are men of diverse political\n opinions; but the clearheaded thinker never\n permits his judgment to be harassed and he\n considers people simply and solely on their\n merits. He has no personal machine in the\n sense that most public men have. Ilis prin-\n cipal associates and co-thinkers and business\n men who, like him, have civic pride and the\n best interests of the municipality, state and\n nation at heart, work without desire Of par-\n tisan reward to advance it.\n</p>\n<p>\n His charity is extensive, but of the unos-\n tentatious type, and he is an art lover and\n devoted collector. He is a fine judge of\n paintings and has one of the finest collec-\n tions in the city, including probably the\n most famous work of the recent deceased\n Munkacsy, \u201cChrist Before Pilate.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n /\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0038/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0038/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0038/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0038/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0038/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0038.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 750487}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"38\">\n<p>\n V\n</p>\n<p>\n William Jennings Bryan.\n</p>\n<p>\n r\n</p>\n<p>\n * i\n</p>\n<p>\n HIS CO-EDUCATIONAL CAREER : : :\n MOULDED BY FEMININE INFLUENCE.\n</p>\n<p>\n W ILLIAM JENNINGS BRYAN, who was\n for the second time the presidential\n nominee of the fusion element of the\n United States, is 41 years of age. Should the\n fortunes of war place him in the White House\n next March, he will enter upon the dignity\n of the highest office in the gift of the people\n as one of the youngest of American Presi-\n dents.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Bryan must be accepted as a type of\n the young American of good underlying moral\n principles, with plenty of energy, and a facile\n gift of speech, with intelligence and with a\n definite aim in life early conceived and con-\n sistently pushed forward. There is more to be\n said for him and in this he again typifies a\n peculiarity of the American spirit and Ameri-\n can institutions, which some affect to deplore\n as rapidly vanishing from our national life \u2014\n the fact that he owes his position to no favor\n of birth or of wealth. At the close of the\n nineteenth century Mr. Bryan\u2019s career is a\n vindication of the American doctrine of equal-\n ity to all and favor to none, and is a strong\n arraignment of the implied protest of his\n own party against the destruction of individ-\n ualism by the corporations.\n</p>\n<p>\n The unique feature of Mr. Bryan\u2019s intellec-\n tual temper is that it is a peculiar and an in-\n teresting product of the co-educational meth-\n ods of the last twenty-five years. His most\n marked characteristic is sentimentalism\u2014 a\n sentimentalism that is feminine, or that can\n be found only in feminine types and in men\n who have been profoundly influenced by as-\n sociation with women. He is intuitional,\n also, and appears to jump at conclusions with-\n out going through the ordinary logical pro-\n cesses. Indeed, logic, with all its rigid rules,\n does not seem to have appealed to him. He\n stumbles over the various pitfalls which pro-\n duce fallacious reasoning when he attempts\n to use logic. He is strongest when he pro-\n claims the conclusions that he has reached\n by the exercise of what may be called his in-\n sight. And it must be admitted that some-\n times these conclusions are pretty sound.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is probably no other man in political\n life to-day who shows so clearly the effect of\n co-education. His wife was a classmate in\n the same college with him. The two decided\n to marry while they were still in college, and\n worked and recited together. The admira-\n tion for the woman which he felt evidently\n made him hospitable to her point of view,\n and it is undoubtedly without any knowledge\n on his part that the feminine point of view\n has become his own \u2014 the impulsive, senti-\n mental point of view \u2014 in distinction from\n the one of hard headed reason, which does\n not shrink from a surgical operation, even\n</p>\n<p>\n |hpv\u00a3^ it,l\u00bba^ijdaBsetl.ha life of {\u00a3\u00a7 pa-\n</p>\n<p>\n tient. During the early days of the canvass\n of 1896 Mr. Bryan was accompanied by his\n wife w T herever he went, and he deferred to\n her and made no decisions till she had con-\n sidered the matter. This showed a splendid\n confidence in the woman\u2019s judgment, but it\n was not the w-ay political battles had been\n won in the East. \u2022 It was not on his own in-\n itiative, or in accordance with his prefer-\n ences, that the wife was sent back to Lincoln\n to remain, w ' hlle he conducted his negotia-\n tions with the party leaders alone.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is not likely that he will have to send his\n wife home this year. He has learned that\n the ways of co-education have n\u2019ot yet been\n adopted by the party managers. But his\n speech of acceptance in Indianapolis shows\n the same feminine point of view which char-\n acterized his previous utterances. Indeed,\n before the speech was finished the news re-\n ports from Lincoln said that as he completed\n each paragraph he would read it to his wife\n for her approval. The speech was actually\n the joint product of the Bryan family. This\n is not to its discredit. It is simply proof that\n the Bryan mind and the feminine mind -work\n harmoniously in conjunction when dealing\n with large questions. When one reads the\n speech in the light of this fact it is not diffi-\n cult to point the finger at paragraph after\n paragraph and say: \u201cThere was feminine sug-\n gestion here, and here, and here.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The feminine intellect perceives the imme-\n diate and the concrete and it fails to grasp\n the deep, underlying principles. What it\n may do after generations more of the higher\n education is still for the future to decide.\n But to-day it has not the characteristics\n w r hich are commonly regarded as masculine.\n And Mr. Bryan lacks those in the present\n stage of his development. It is not unfair to\n him to say that he would doubtless be\n troubled to answer the old question which is\n frequently put to young law T ydrs touching the\n force of a contingent verdict in the suit of a\n lawyer against one of his students. It seems\n that the student was instructed on the condi-\n tion that he should pay to his tutor the fee\n received for the first case which he won. The\n young man studied and began to practice. He\n had clients ahd was prosperous, but he had\n not yet appeared in court. Finally his tutor\n grew weary with waiting and sued him for his\n fee. Now, the question is what would the tu-\n tor get if he won his suit? If Mr. Bryan un-\n raveled this complication at all, it would be\n by intuition rather than by analysis. All this\n is said by way of characterization, for with-\n out it any estimate of him ivould be incom-\n plete.\n</p>\n<p>\n The feminine influence can also be traced\n in Mr. Aryan\u2019s most notable accomplish-\n</p>\n<p>\n ment, his power of oratory. His rich and\n cultivated voice, his dramatic gesticulation,\n the emotionalism of his appeals do not ac-\n cord with the conventional and restrained\n methbds of men who have had Mr. Bryan ' s\n education. The college bred man and Mr.\n Bryan is a college bred man \u2014 usually loses\n in his sophomore year the ideals, which\n Mr. Bryan has so assiduously and so suc-\n cessfully cultivated. Mr. Bryan has retained\n it and has perfected his endeavors to at-\n tain it by constant practice for many years.\n Who that has heard the best of our woman\n platform speakers\u2014 Emma Willard, Mrs. Bal-\n lington Booth and the rest\u2014 does not recog-\n nize the resemblance between their methods\n and those of Mr. Bryan. He and they have\n the same artificial enrichment of voice, the\n same love for dramatic effect, the same be-\n lief in the power of an emotional appeal, the\n same fondness of quotation, the same delight\n in the mention of historic names, the same\n inspiration that God is working for their own\n ends and the devil for their opponents and the\n same facility of speech and delight in it.\n Undoubtedly the debates and orations in the\n little co-educational college where Mr. . and\n Mrs. Bryan were students together formed\n their ideals. Most men would have out-\n grown this. Under the circumstances Mr.\n Bryan has found this impossible. His oratory\n has been rehearsed and molded to please a\n woman. Now it pleases all feminine and\n emotional men.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Bryan started life as a poor boy. Born\n at Salem, Marion County, 111., March 19, 1860,\n he attended the public schools until 1875, see-\n ing something of farm life in the meantime\n at odd periods. He then entered Whipple\n Academy at Jacksonville, 111., and in 1877 en-\n tered the Illinois College at Jacksonville,\n from which he graduated in 1881. Mr. Bryan\n was a good student, from all accounts, and\n early in his college term managed to secure\n something of a reputation as an orator.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of his fellow students was Dick Yates,\n son of the Illinois War Governor, and Re-\n publican nominee for governor of Illinois this\n year. Mr. Bryan and Yates were strong com-\n petitors for the oratorical college honors, but\n m the final college debate Bryan was worsted\n and the medal was given to Yates, Mr. Bryan,\n however, graduating with highest honors on\n completing his classical course.\n</p>\n<p>\n While at college at Jacksonville he met an-\n other fellow student who was destined to play\n a most important part in his life, for it was\n here that he formed the acquaintance of the\n young woman who is now Mrs. Bryan, the\n marriage taking place after Bryan had been\n attending the Union College of Law in Chi-\n cago for two years.

The\n results of his practice were not munificent.\n Much of his time was devoted to speechmak-\n ing in the outlying country districts. It is said\n that whenever an orator was wanted at a camp\n meeting or a pumpkin show, and everything\n else failed, young Bryan was to be relied upon\n to respond to an order for a speech. There\n was a certain grocery, too, in Jacksonville,\n</p>\n<p>\n where the sages of the community exchanged\n views in an idle sort of way as becomes the\n typical corner grocery crowd, and it is said\n that Bryan was fond on occasions of holding\n forth to the town cronies as they foregather-\n ed around on sugar barrels and nail kegs to\n gossip over the events of the times and en-\n gage in bitter polemics over religion and poli-\n tics.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u25a0In 1887, Mr. Bryan decided to try his luck\n in the West.

It\n</p>\n<p>\n was represented in Congress by John A. Mc-\n Shane of Omaha, a Democrat, who was elected\n by 7, (100 plurality. Bryan began at once to\n put his skill as an orator to practical account.\n He made some reputation in the district, but\n this renown did not extend far over the state\n for some time. His new acquaintances, how-\n ever, had faith in him. They predicted he\n would be heard from. The opportunity alone\n was lacking.\n</p>\n<p>\n The district underwent a sudden political\n revolution in the election of 1889. William J.\n O\u2019Connell was the Republican and J.

Morton had\n vaguely heard of some such man as Bryan at\n Lincoln, but, though they had not met before,\n he accepted the young lawyer\u2019s offer of help\n and Bryan took the stump. The Fifty-first,\n the famous Reed Congress, was Republican\n by a narrow margin. Events were re-\n versed in the First district of Nebraska; Mor-\n ton was defeated and O\u2019Connell elected\n by a majority of over 3,000. If that campaign\n had left Mr. Cleveland\u2019s future Secretary of\n Agriculture high and dry on the rock of po-\n litical disappointment, it gave Mr. Bryan\n the opportunity of his life to become known\n over every part of the district as a young\n speaker of unusual ability. Politicians had\n begun to get interested in him, and public at-\n</p>\n<p>\n tention had been called to him as a brilliant\n exponent of Democratic doctrines relating to\n tariff matters and the coinage question.\n</p>\n<p>\n With that talent for taking advantage of\n opportunity which Mr. Bryan possesses to a\n marked degree, no one who knew him was sur-\n prised to learn that he was in the field to\n claim the Democratic nomination for Con-\n gress in the approaching election of 1890.\n O\u2019Connell was renominated by the Republi-\n cans, and Bryan captured the Democratic\n nomination after a vigorous fight.\n</p>\n<p>\n That was the year of the Republican slump.\n The old First district of Nebraska, under the\n influence of the prevailing spirit of reaction\n against Republican autocracy, as exemplified\n in the arbitrary government of the House, and\n against the McKinley tariff, returned to its\n former allegiance, repudiated O\u2019Connell and\n elected Bryan by its old time Democratic plu-\n rality of 7,000. And, accordingly, Mr. Bryan\n went to Congress just three years after mov-\n ing to Nebraska.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Bryan owes his first leap into national\n fame to an unusual combination of luck and\n intelligent employment of his opportunities.\n</p>\n<p>\n The election of 1890, resulting in a Demo-\n cratic tidal wave in protest of the McKinley\n bill and of Reed\u2019s czarism, deposited in the\n House of Representatives one of the most mot-\n ley combinations of so-called statesmen in the\n history of the American House. In this, the\n Fifty-second Congress, Populism reached its\n high water mark. The third party was repre-\n sented in the lower branch by upward of a\n dozen members. In the Senate men of the in-\n tellectual caliber of Ingalls were retired and\n men like Peffer took their seats. In the House\n Mr. Bryan\u2019s colleagues from Nebraska were\n McKeighan and Kem, both Populists.\n</p>\n<p>\n Aside from this element, amid the flotsam\n and jetsam of the great political tidal wave\n cast high and dry into the House, were num-\n erous representatives from hitherto hope-\n lessly Republican districts, who had been\n nominated with no expectation of election.\n Wisconsin returned eight Democrats and but\n one Republican; Kansas returned five Popu-\n lists out of a total of seven districts; in Iowa\n a Democrat defeated future Senator John Gear\n and five additional members of that party\n were elected. The joint opposition to the Re-\n publican party in that Congress figures up a\n majority of about 127, much of this element\n conforming in a general way only to definite\n party leadership, and as a whole, constituting\n a mass of indefinite force and inscrutable pos-\n sibilities. *\u25a0\n</p>\n<p>\n Amid such surroundings of mediocrity as\n regards a majority of the newly acceded mem-\n bership, the opportunity for distinction among\n the few new members of merit was certainly\n great. And it came to a few of the younger\n element. That Congress developed amons\n others Bailey of Texas, Watkins of Georgia,\n Williams of Massachusetts and Bryan of Ne-\n braska \u2014 one soon to be a United States Sen-\n ator, another a vice presidential candidate in\n 189S and another twice the Presidential can-\n didate of his party.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Bryan\u2019s chance came when the Demo-\n crats began to tinker with the tariff. There\n had been a dearth of doings, endless talk,\n spiritless discussion, all for home consump-\n tion; columns and columns of statistical and\n polemical matter on the tariff under the\n convenient and conventional \" leave to print, \"\n swelling the Congressional Record out of\n all bounds of reason, and much of it fur-\n nished by men who could not, to save their\n souls, have made an intelligent speech on\n their feet; much drivel by persons whose\n individual horizon had been circumscribed\n by the confines of a county court room, and\n now and then only a wholesome adtaixtur*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0040/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0040/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0040/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0040/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0040/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0040.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 624227}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"40\">\n<p>\n as\n</p>\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n of practical statesmanship by men of estab-\n lished fame. It was the era of impracti-\n cable leadership, with William M. Springer\n of Illinois and his popgun policy of attack\n on tho tariff in ' command of the situation.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was in this environment and under\n these circumstances that a young man,, who\n had jiithdrto attracted no particualr atten-\n tention, modestly arose one afternoon in\n his place on the Democratic side and deliv-\n ered a free trade speech that aroused the\n House from its torpid condition of nervous\n collapse as by an electric shock, and sud-\n denly filled the press gallery with an audi-\n ence of attentive and discriminating listen-\n ers. This young man, combining with a\n mobile expressive face the striking art of\n an accomplished orator, precise in his words,\n graceful in his manners, convincing in his\n logic and playful in his delivery of sarcasm\n and irony, relieved a long nervous strain of\n suspended mental and physical animation,\n holding the House as under a pall. Here,\n at least, was a sunbeam in the night of\n shadows, a current of refreshing air in the\n overheated atmosphere. It as not so much\n what he said, as how he said it, that com-\n pelled attention to his remarks.\n</p>\n<p>\n And there was this in his favor: With\n the discriminating eye of their ilk for nov-\n elty, every correspondent in the press gal-\n lery instinctively detected a subject capa-\n ble of being expanded into a hero, the re-\n deemer of a spiritless and unprofitable de-\n bate that had made everybody drowsy for\n W\u2019eeks.\n</p>\n<p>\n William J. Bryan awoke the morning after\n the delivery of his speech and found himself\n famous.\n</p>\n<p>\n The newspaper notoriety that followed his\n oratorical coup made him one of the best\n known men in Congress, and fairly launched\n him upon his future political career. It is\n a maxim that every statesman owes his\n fame to at least one speech. Mr. Bryan\n owes his to two, each of which marks a\n distinct stage of his political development.\n If his first tariff speech made him famous,\n his noted \u201ccrown of thorns\u2019\u2019 speech before\n the Chicago convention made him the nomi-\n nee for President.\n</p>\n<p>\n Those who know Mr. Bryan best admire\n him and speak affectionately of his genial\n disposition and , kindly nature. His ability,\n his magnetism and general commanding in-\n fluence over the minds of men are qualities\n no one challenges. His home life is almost\n ideal. Those who probe deeper into a man\u2019s\n</p>\n<p>\n character refuse to concede to him that\n depth of insight into questions which mark\n the highest form of statesmanship.\n</p>\n<p>\n One who recently by invitation inspected\n Mr. Bryan\u2019s library was struck by the fact\n that his shelves abounded in works on modern\n political economy and the standard hooks on\n American questions, but failed to reveal the\n trfie fountain lights of a broader philosophy\n that should supplement the information of a\n political pathfinder. A source of unfailing in-\n spiration to Mr. Bryan is a collection of Jef-\n ferson\u2019s political works, of which he possess-\n es a handsome and costly edition. The books\n most liberally quoted by Mr. Bryan while in\n Congress were the Bible and Jefferson. But\n he was then only 31 years old; and it is un-\n deniable that a marked change has gone on in\n his entire system of mentality ever since 1896.\n He has matured in mind as well as in body.\n In 1891-93 his character was to a predom-\n inant degree timidly receptive. He was still\n a student.\n</p>\n<p>\n A perceptible change had taken place early\n in 1896, when he returned to Washington as\n a private citizen, but in the recognized capac-\n ity of a party spokesman, to urge upon Dem-\n ocrats in Congress the necessity of emphasiz-\n ing free coinage as an issue in the Dem-\n ocratic platform and to forestall any com-\n promise on the Dingley bend bill. The Re-\n publican House, as will be remembered, had\n substituted a bond provision for the free\n coinage clause which the Senate had passed.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Bryan had ceased to be a subordinate\n in the ranks, and in his interviews with a\n dozen Senators and Representatives on that\n occasion he made it plain that he was doing\n his own thinking, by citing that any deviation\n from free coinage would be hurtful to the in-\n terests of silver and the new silver party.\n Mr. Bryan even went to the extent of urging\n them to bolt the Democratic party if free\n coinage were not incorporated in the Dem-\n ocratic platform. In this he encountered a\n serious obstacle in ex-Senator Crisp, who de-\n clared that the Georgia delegation would go\n to Chicago and do what could be done for the\n recognition of silver, but. would, under all cir-\n cumstances, be bound by the action of the\n party.\n</p>\n<p>\n It showed, however, that Mr. Bryan had\n matured in thought and action, and had fairly\n embarked upon a policy of his own. He was\n powerless in point of influence in his second\n term of Congress to prevent what he regarded\n as the surrender of his party to the dictation\n Of the White House on the financial question.\n</p>\n<p>\n and toward the close of the Fifty-third Con-\n gress identified himself more closely with the\n third party in the House than with the Dem-\n ocrats. Herein lies one of Mr. Bryan\u2019s par-\n ticularly salient characteristics \u2014 that he has\n adhered with remarkable consistency to his\n policy. That which he was powerless to carry\n out in 1S94-S5 he resolutely made the sine qua\n non of his nomination in 1900, when he was\n able to dictate the 16 to 1 plank in the Dem-\n ocratic platform against an adverse majority.\n</p>\n<p>\n The high points that most impress one who\n knows Mr. Bryan for any length of time are\n the evidences of a fine moral nature, supported\n by religious convictions; the undoubted pos-\n session of courage; a decided talent for a dip-\n lomatic career, and the characteristic mind\n of a veteran disputant, and the gift to turn\n the phrase of a political opponent to damaging\n account. One of his critics declares, howbeit\n In no spirit of fault finding, that he is always\n prepared beforehand with an apt reply to any\n argument calculated to assail or undermine\n bis position, and that his entire course of read-\n ing is shaped with a view to beating off at-\n tack.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Bryan has an unmistakable individual-\n ity and independence of will. He ceased to be\n In harmony with his party in the Fifty-third\n Congress when he considered that it had\n passed under the domination of Mr. Cleve-\n land\u2019s influence. As a result, he was not en\n rapport with the Democratic leaders, and he\n and Speaker Crisp met as little better than\n indifferent strangers for some time prior to\n the end of the final session. But he was not\n one of those who appealed for sympathy to\n his party\u2019s political opponents. Mr. Bryan\n and cx-Speaker Reed cordially disliked each\n ocher, though outwardly friendly. They met\n one afternoon in the members\u2019 lobby, back\n of the House, toward the end eff the session.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBryan,\u201d drawled Reed, in his laziest ac-\n cents, \u201cwhy didn\u2019t your party slay the hydra-\n headed monster while you had a chance?

But he has a personal and an\n official self. They are entirely distinct. The\n one is not an index to the other. The exist-\n ence of these two different natures in the\n same man accounts alike for his friends and\n his enemies and for the fact that some of his\n former friends have become his enemies.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thi3 fact of a dual and diametrically oppo-\n site character in the man .or of two wholly\n antithetical sides of the same character will,\n if capable of being made plain, explain a\n great many things in his actions and in the\n estimate of those actions. Mr. Cleveland,\n regarded by those meeting him as an indi-\n vidual, is frank, chatty, cheerful, hearty and\n generous. Mr. Cleveland, regarded as an\n official, whether regarded by himself or by\n others, wholly suppressed Mr. Cleveland, the\n individual, and became Mr. Cleveland, the\n trustee. As some men are born soldiers,\n poets, artists or musicians, so are some men\n born trustees. They have the ability to feel\n the sense of delegated power and they can\n act in a representative capacity as imper-\n sonally as if they were mechanisms and not\n men at all. These men are very rare. George\n Washington was one of them. He is the only\n one of them that ever was in the presidency,\n except, perhaps, Abraham Lincoln, and cer-\n tainly, Grover Cleveland. No intention of\n flattery is designed in uniting the name of the\n last Democratic executive with those of his\n two predecessors who have crystallized into\n acknowledged greatness and who divide an\n homage which they share with no one else.\n The purpose is simply to note a moral qual-\n ity, which has existed in but three Presidents,\n assuming it to have existed at all in Abraham\n Lincoln, in whose administration Stanton,\n Seward, Chase and other Cabinet officers, de-\n void of this quality, impaired the reputation\n of the trait, so far as they themselves were\n concerned.\n</p>\n<p>\n An incident will illustrate this truth, and\n illustrations sometimes throw more light\n than general statements, no matter how dis-\n criminating they are. While Governor Cleve-\n land was running for President a man in Buf-\n falo was pressing him for an office in the\n Governor\u2019s direct gift. The income was small,\n but enough for the man\u2019s wants. He was\n recommended by nearly all the persons in\n Erie County who, by virtue of living on the\n party, called themselves the leaders of it.\n Mr. Cleveland declined to give the office to\n the man. The man soon after put himself\n into communication with those who were\n</p>\n<p>\n I saying and doing all they could to defeat\n Mr. Cleveland, then the Democratic nominee\n for President. The words and actions of the\n man, who stopped literally at nothing to\n which he could lend his tongue, or hand,\n came very directly to the Gove rnor. He\n would not allow the letters requesting the\n position, which the man had written, to be\n printed or referred to as a reply to or ex-\n planation of his malignant opposition. He\n received, in the course of the man\u2019s public\n abuse, a private letter from him asking the\n renewal of a note for $250, which the Gov-\n ernor had carried and renewed for several\n years. \u201cIt was my intention to renew that\n note,\u201d said the Governor, \u201cbut I will send my\n check and pay it outright. It is best to close\n the matter up. He is mad at me for not ap-\n pointing him to a place for which I do not be-\n Iteve him to be qualified. His anger and dis-\n appointment are natural. He can never pay\n this note. I have omitted to take it up and\n consented regularly to renew it heretofore, to\n make him feel as if he was going to pay it,\n some day; but since he has become an enemy\n because I have acted as an official and not as\n a good fellow, in regard to his application for\n a place, it will be pleasanter for him and for\n me to bring the matter to an end.\u201d This in-\n cident sets forth the personal self and the\n official self of the man admirably. It is\n given literally as it occurred.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another incident, like the foregoing one,\n hitherto unpublished, reveals this dual and\n distinct nature. After Mr. Cleveland had\n plainly been chosen by the people to be Pres-\n ident a distinguished lawyer was commended\n to him as Attorney General. The friends of\n that lawyer, if not the lawyer himself, took\n grave offense at Mr. Cleveland for not select-\n ing him. The argument of ingratitude, so\n often brought against Mr. Cleveland, wa3\n barbed in this instance with the personal\n specification that a relative of this distin-\n guished lawyer, then deceased, had been a\n partner of Mr. Cleveland in Buffalo, and, it\n was alleged, had supplied much of the talent\n and labor which went to some of Mr. Cleve-\n land\u2019s successes at the bar. One may not see\n the relevancy of this as an argument, but\n politicians in a rage are neither logical nor\n nice in their methods. The facts of the case\n were that the deceased partner referred to\n had been a dear friend of Mr. Cleveland, but\n they were as unlike in qualities as could be\n imagined, and Mr. Cleveland had won his\n way by no one\u2019s help.\n</p>\n<p>\n One day a friend of the dead man found\n himself in a small city on the banks of New\n</p>\n<p>\n York\u2019s greatest river, with some time on his\n hands. He bethought him that it was the\n place to which the man then dead had moved\n in his last illness and where he had been\n buried. He drove out to the graveyard, found\n a handsome monument over the place of se-\n pulture and every evidence that the sacred\n spot was regularly and tenderly cared for.\n Noting the beauty of the monument, the visi-\n tor sought out the man who had executed it,\n and, to his surprise, learned that Mr. Cleve-\n land had ordered and paid for it and had set\n aside a stated sum to have the plot kept in\n order. He had come all the way from Buf-\n falo, over 300 miles, to have it done, had re-\n quested that no publicity be given to his act,\n had paid the bill in advance and had then\n departed. Mr. Cleveland did this after he\n was elected Mayor in 1881, but before he was\n inaugurated in January, 1882. In the winter\n of 1885 he had refused to name the dead man ' s\n distinguished relative for attorney general,\n had silently received a storm of charges of\n ingratitude, based on untrue and malicious\n allegations, that to that man\u2019s dead relative\n he had owed an ever neglected debt of assist-\n ance, and to this he had never replied ft\n word. The fact of tender memorial tribute\n which he had rendered over three years be-\n fore \u2014 a tribute unthought of by the dead\n man\u2019s relatives\u2014 he had carried in his mind,\n but he had spoken of it to no one. The gen-\n tleness which prompted the act and the delica-\n cy and strength of character which keeps si-\n lence about it, under abuse to which the men-\n tion of the act would have supplied a signal and\n withering retaliation, are at once realized by\n every mind of sensibility. There are, to the\n credit of human nature, not a few men who\n could have performed such an act. The menar#\n not numerous who could have withheld men-\n tion of it, under the provocation to do so\n \u2022 which was furnished. You may be sure that\n Mr. Cleveland acted from public motives in\n not selecting the relative of his former part-\n ner for attorney general. When this good\n deed in a naughty world was discovered and\n Mr. Cleveland was charged with it, he\n blushed like a girl at the recital, but reso-\n lutely requested and insisted that the matter\n be not published at the time. It has never\n been published until now.\n</p>\n<p>\n If the personality of the man be differen-\n tiated from his sense of trusteeship, a key\n will be furnished to many of the courses\n which were a conundrum to some of his\n friends. So self-critical was he that the fact\n of his intimate social knowledge of and fel-\n lowship with men was a bar to th?ir appoint-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0042/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0042/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0042/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0042/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0042/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0042.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 867968}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"42\">\n<p>\n 40\n</p>\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n ment by him.

It is doubtful that the quality\n of the standard will ever be widely appre-\n ciated; but those of the finest susceptibilities\n will appreciate it.\n</p>\n<p>\n The fact accounts for the frequent saying\n which in form was a paradox, but which in\n reality was true of him while President: \u2018\u2018So\n and so is too intimate with the President to\n get anything out of him. The President\n thinks too much of him to do anything for\n him. He knows Mr. Cleveland too well for\n you to ask him to request the President to\n appoint you.\u201d The man would have rejoiced\n to place all his friends and to make all right\n</p>\n<p>\n meaning persons his friends. The official re-\n garded public office as a public trust.\n</p>\n<p>\n Beyond doubt, there were cases of former\n intimates whose appointment would have done\n no harm to the government and would have\n greatly pleased Mr. Cleveland. But the .idea\n of their appointment by some other President\n appeared to him to be very different from the\n idea of their appointment by him. He did not\n like his friends for the qualities which would\n or would not make them good officials. He\n liked them for the qualities which attached\n them to him when he was a private citizen.\n In instances-some -of those qualities would\n not shine in official station. He would not\n trust himself enough to have one set ' of\n friends for appointments and another set to\n be refused appointments, while he was acting\n for the people. He realized that the policy\n of barring them all would cost him. misinter-\n</p>\n<p>\n pretation, enmity and accusations of ingrati-\n tude or heartlessness. He was as sensitive to\n such consequences as any man is who unde-\n servedly receives them. He, however, had to\n choose between his sense of duty to his trus-\n teeship and the effect that would follow if he\n stocked up the offices with his personal\n friehds. The effect, he believed, would be\n hurtful to the morale of the service. The\n personal hostility and accusations which his\n well defined course engendered he had to en-\n dure, acquitted by his conscience then and be-\n lieving that the people en masse would even-\n tually pass a juster judgment on than cronies\n or partisans when turned down.\n</p>\n<p>\n He, however, found cases of personal friends\n</p>\n<p>\n who did not misconstrue his personal motives\n They were not many, but they were bound to\n him by hooks of steel. They were as proud\n of their freedom from the necessity of not\n having to ask aught of Mr. Cleveland for\n themselves as they were of their record of\n never asking aught of him for others, except\n as he and they both recognized the public in-\n terest. They entered into Mr. Cleveland\u2019s con-\n science of action as thoroughly, clearly as he\n entered into and respected their independence\n of his favors. They recognized that in offering\n them nothing but his inmost confidence they\n were honored above those to whom he ten-\n dered places. The spiritual pleasure of their\n friendship needed no alloy of patronage to en-\n able it to pass current between him and them.\n They were devoted and disinterested both.\n The riches of faith and counsel they ex-\n changed with him outweighed all the dignities\n and profits he could confer. Some of these\n friends, not many, Mr. Cleveland made and\n kept in Buffalo. More of them he has in the\n various parts of the United States in which,\n consequent on the separations of life, they set-\n tled. Most of them he made as Governor and\n as President.\n</p>\n<p>\n They know that never a poet loved his\n muse and never a man loved wife or children\n more than this man- loved his sense of duty\n and more than ; he loved his country. That\n love they knew made him impersonal in his\n action. It required him to avoid the very\n shadow of personal predilection in appor-\n tioning public \u2022 places. It remitted him to\n methods outside of his affections and prefer-\n ences in selecting federal agents. He may\n have made mistakes. He asserted no claim\n to infallibility. He may have been misin-\n formed, misled, lied to by those who com-\n mended men to him on record facts. He did\n not pretend to divination. Erroneous some\n of his conclusions may have been. Deceived\n by others he was, but no judge in trying to\n get at the facte ever more completely elim-\n inated his own wishes and desires from his\n actions or tried to act judicially by litigants\n more truly than he tried to act by the party\n and the country, too. The standard of his\n motives was kept ideally high without diffi-\n culty. He found it easy to want to do right.\n The average of his appointments in honesty\n and capacity was superior to that of any ex-\n ecutive of his time. His innermost circle of\n friends clearly knew this. The generous\n country at large is beginning to know it.\n That is why after every election\u2019s sediment\n of facts settled down and after the inevitable\n half views of hasty judgments were correct-\n ed by the perspective of time and reflection,\n his personality and trusteeship were reveal-\n ed as true, strong, intact\u2019 and the trimmers,\n doubters and the thriftily prescient withal\n ran into his strength for strength. Whatever\n record leaps to light, his never will be\n shamed.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are two other respects in which the\n ex-President\u2019s course was much better under-\n stood by the people than by the politicians.\n He would not recognize that great labor or\n large money put forth to elect him constitut-\n ed any ground for his repayment of those who\n gave it in patronage. Of his means and labor\n he gave to the full to have Democrats elected\n all his life. He never did so to create a\n claim for an office. He never made the doing\n of it. a claim for an office. He never thought\n of doing so. He is not constituted that way.\n He does not think much of those -who are.\n You never heard of this friend who fell away\n from him or that politician who became his\n enemy without hearing of how much he did\n or of how much he gave as a reason why the\n President should repay him out of the treas-\n</p>\n<p>\n (Copyright, 1900, by George Grantham Bain.)\n</p>\n<p>\n GROVER CLEVELAND.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0043/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 345, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 493}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0043/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 691, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 987}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0043/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1383, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1975}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0043/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2767, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3950}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0043/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0043.jp2", "height": 3950, "width": 2767, "levels": 6, "size": 784544}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"43\">\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n 41\n</p>\n<p>\n ury in office or contracts; and as warrant or\n justification for hostility the fact is pro-\n claimed that the President did not do so.\n Startling as it may appear, Mr. Cleveland\n never asked for a nomination and never asked\n an individual to vote for him. When a can-\n didate, his labor and appeal? were all for\n the party whose cause he personified, but\n never for himself personally. There is a flat\n Inability in him to understand how a man\u2019s\n labor for the principles of his party and for\n the party of his principles should form a rea-\n son for giving to him office, unless he is\n also fit for that office. Fitness is the last\n thing thought of by clamoring spoilsmen.\n Claims are their continuous plea. Fitness\n was the first thing thought of, asked about,\n and sought for by Mr. Cleveland\u2014 albeit in\n the fitness he rated the fact that agreement\n with the politics and party voted into control\n was indispensable. It took many years for\n political organizations to find that they must\n name partisans, if they would, but fit parti-\n sans in order to receive attention. If they\n did not, the President was very likely to go\n outside of them and pick for himself. When\n repeatedly told \u201cMi. B. is worth over $4,000,-\n</p>\n<p>\n 000,\u201d Mr. Cleveland replied, \u201cWhat I want\n to know is, is he worth anything else.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The other respect in which Mr. Cleveland\n would have himself plainly understood was\n this. Those whom he appointed to office\n could not draw the salaries paid out of the\n taxes of both parties by working pernicious-\n ly or offensively for the success of one of\n them. He was very positive on this point.\n Caucuses, conventions and nominations be-\n longed to the members of the party that\n were not in federal office. So did campaign-\n ing. Trained bands of official janissaries\n could be recruited from among local or state\n officers. From among federal officeholders\n they should not be in his terms. Mr. Cleve-\n land regarded this and the orderly adherence\n to the merit system in appointments, deter-\n mined by competitive examination, as the\n greatest tasks laid on his administration.\n He believed that if his administration ad-\n hered to them a public opinion would be cre-\n ated which would require every other admin-\n istration, no matter of what party, to do\n so, too. He adhered to them, and that fact\n is getting to be plainly understood.\n</p>\n<p>\n As to nomination or renomination, it is\n</p>\n<p>\n absolutely certain that he hardly gave\n to it a thought. It would have been quite\n like him to renounce renomination at any\n time, and his Cabinet would not know of\n it until all the world did. His ability to\n reach and keep to himself the most im-\n portant conclusions is signal and unique.\n He justly concluded that renomination was a\n thing he should not concern himself about\n at all, but left that wholly to the people.\n That he was taking the best course in the\n world to insure nomination without effort\n more perfectly than effort itself could insure\n it for any one else, all who were not blind to\n the signs of the times saw, whether they\n liked to see it or not. Every honor came\n to him unsought. It came to him because\n he did not seek it. It came to him because\n the baser or stupider interests of politics\n opposed the broad moral desire and deter-\n mination of the people for him. The world\n now recognizes this. The knowledge makes\n him in the opinion of the world the fore-\n most of living Americans, who in his re-\n tirement at Princeton enjoys a respect equal\n to that extended to any man who made gov-\n ernment better than it was when first com-\n mitted to his hands.\n</p>\n<p>\n Richard Croker.\n</p>\n<p>\n TAMMANY HALL\u2019S FORCEFUL DICTATOR.\n A PICTURESQUE POLITICAL QUANTITY.\n</p>\n<p>\n T HE boss is an outcome of our peculiar\n political system. He exists nowhere\n else. He is an American product, of\n which we are not proud and which we would\n be glad to export with a pledge against fur-\n ther production, if the promise would be of\n avail. But the boss is an American institu-\n tion, come to stay as long as there shall be\n parties, politics and universal suffrage. He\n may be found in all degrees of rank and im-\n portance, from the ruler over an election\n district to that over the nation. He may be\n all in one and one in all. but wherever or\n whatever he Is, he is a man of power. He exists\n by reason and because or power. The possi-\n bility of pow ' er brought him into existence;\n the possession of power permits him to per-\n petuate himself. In the wielding of power\n lies the life of the boss, for he is such no\n longer the moment power passes from him.\n While power nerves his arm he is more\n potent than a king on his throne; when it\n does not he is more abject than a dethroned\n bearer of a crown, for dignity attaches to the\n latter, while the overturned boss is a has-\n been, learned in the ingratitude of those who\n fawned on him in the days of his power and\n in the bitter hatred of those he had arro-\n gantly turned down.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are bosses of degrees, links in the\n chain that lead up to the state boss. Thus\n we have the boss of the election districts,\n</p>\n<p>\n the majority of whom within an Assembly\n district, subservient to one of their number\n and dependent on him, make the Assembly\n district bosses, who in turn make the ' county\n bosses, and they the state boss, all mutually\n dependent. \u201cAll for one and one for all,\u201d they\n make the machine. Supreme over all is the\n national boss and, as a rule, he achieves his\n position by reason of the possession of su-\n perior qualities for leadership. To-day, in\n the Republican party, the boss is Hanna of\n Ohio; in the Democratic party it is Bryan,\n the candidate, insistent, imperious, auto-\n cratic and dictatorial. In this state that\n easy one, Platt, is the Republican bos6, whose\n reign has been long and vindictive; the crown\n of Democratic boss-ship is in dispute and a\n fierce war of rival claimants is imminent.\n</p>\n<p>\n Occupancy of these places is less a matter\n of selection than of seizure. Sometimes the\n boss holds an official position within his party\n organization; sometimes he holds a powerful\n public position; sometimes he has neither, yet\n is dominant. It is not always plain how the\n boss reached the authority he exercises; the\n methods by which his mounting has been\n accomplished are not always clear. The\n anomalous thing is that quite often the ruler\n does not rule through the consent of the\n ruled, yet receives implicit obedience from\n his slaves, for they are little better. One or\n two qualities in the man who has seized or is\n</p>\n<p>\n possessed of the reins may be reckoned on\n and these are force, aggression and firmness.\n Intellectual qualities may or may not be\n present, the genial qualities are rarely, if\n ever, present in a successful boss, and mag-\n netism, that convenient word by which we\n designate something attractive and winning\n without explaining it, is not necessarily a\n constituent part of the boss\u2019 equipment. The\n qualities sought for in a candidate are not\n usually found in him who has assumed to\n make candidates. The boss rule is one of\n fear and he nicely adjusts the balance be-\n tween submission to his behests and opposi-\n tion to commands, following the one with\n favor, perhaps, and the other with punish-\n ment, invariably.\n</p>\n<p>\n The degree of power and rank enjoyed is\n not always in proportion to the grade occu-\n pied. Location and the area of activity\n rather determine the rank. Mr. Richard Crok-\n er, in all respects the most conspicuous and\n in some aspects the most powerful boss,\n is so because New York, the largest, most\n important and the wealthiest city of our\n country, is the district of his activity and\n yet he is a county boss. It is true that he\n has discovered recently aspirations for an-\n other grade of boss-ship.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Croker is without official position, yet\n few men exercise a wider or greater power.\n He is absolute in the matter of the govern-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0044/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0044/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0044/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0044/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0044/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0044.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 883814}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"44\">\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n ment of New York City. In the Tammany\n organization he is chairman of the commit-\n tee on finance, a position usually occupied by\n him who assumes the leadership of the or-\n ganization. There is something in this akin\n to the practice in the Legislature of the\n state that makes the chairmen of the finance\n committee of the Senate and the ways and\n means committee of the Assembly the lead-\n ers of their respective houses. Doubtless the\n idea was borrowed from that practice. There\n are ill-natured suggestions that another and\n sinister reason exists for the assumption of\n the chairmanship of that committee by him\n who has dominated and would control the\n organization in this, that the possession of\n the strings of the purse is in itself a tower\n of strength since all the contributions by\n the faithful to the campaign fund of Tam-\n many and all the results from the levies of\n the organization on the money-producing\n sources, a prodigious sum, go to that com-\n mittee and are distributed l\u00bby its chairman,\n from whom, in the nature of things, and\n because it is neither wise nor expedient, no\n accounting of receipts and disbursements is\n demanded. Whether or not this be tfie rea-\n son the fact remains that the chairmanship\n of the committee is occupied by the recog-\n nized leader and that the second place on\n the committee is, within the organization,\n accounted a higher honor than the chairman-\n ship of the general committee, by the occu-\n pant of which place the finance committee\n is appointed \u2014 under the dictation of the\n leader.\n</p>\n<p>\n Manhattan and the Bronx are overwhelm-\n ingly Democratic. If all who hold the doc-\n trines of that party living in those two\n boroughs named were to register and cast\n their votes ior the regular ticket a\n Democratic majority of from ninety to a\n hundred thousand might be obtained. But\n there are always defections, side or tem-\n porary issues, obtrusions of personalities that\n enter in to diminish that possible majority.\n Indeed, the application of the percentage of\n those who fail from neglect or indifference\n to exercise the right of suffrage, observable\n as well in communities where the political\n divisions are more nearly equal, to the enor-\n mous aggregate vote of those two boroughs\n would account for the loss of a part of the\n majority running into thousands. So it is\n that 60,000 is more likely to be the high water\n mark and it can, as it has in the past,\n shrink to 40,000 and this, too, in a year\n after 65,000 had been cast.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of this vast Democratic community Tam-\n many is the only real or significant organi-\n zation of Democratic voters, and it has the\n hall mark of regularity. It is its chosen\n members who represent the Democratic party\n of the two boroughs in the state and national\n convocations. It is its nominees for all the\n places electoral in the city government that\n are chosen and it is its members occupying\n official station who make the appointments\n and distribute the patronage. An organiza-\n tion that can contribute sixty thousand to-\n ward the overcoming of the Republican ma-\n jority preponderate in the interior of the\n state is an important factor in Democratic\n politics, and the man who dominates\n all parts of that organization is an import-\n ant figure who must be considered. In the\n machinery of the party the conditions are\n similar. Representation in the state con-\n vention is, like that in the Legislature, based\n on population, and the organization that as-\n sumes to represent the largest aggregate pop-\n ulation of a single civil division sends a dele-\n gation to the convention almost imperial in\n iU numbors, and the man who loads it i%ust\n</p>\n<p>\n necessarily be a large figure, especially when\n that delegation yields up its conscience and\n its individuality to that one man and is obe-\n dient as the needle is to the pole to his slight-\n est signal.\n</p>\n<p>\n When it is further considered that the gov-\n ernment of the magnificent City of New York\n is administered by men who owe their oppor-\n tunity, power and occupancy to Tammany,\n and, to be exact, to the leader of that organi-\n zation whose word in the last instance ele-\n vated them to their places; that they took\n their offices only under the understanding im-\n plied or explicitly stated that they would be\n faithful and obedient to Tammany in such\n administration; that there was no conceal-\n ment of the fact that the powers of appoint-\n ment conferred by the charter on the officers\n elected of the people (but nominated by Tam-\n many) were handed over to the leader for\n him to designate the office holders; that\n Tammany has taken into its keeping\n the consciences of the official and as-\n sumed to be the first judge and arbiter,\n something of the vast power centered in Mr.\n Croker, leader of Tammany, but county boss\n of New York, may be comprehended. And\n that anomalous position assumed by Mf. Cro-\n ker, private citizen \u201cboss\u201d though he is, to\n punish, to regulate, to investigate, to straight-\n en out the acts of public officials who in the\n theory of our government owe their com-\n missions to the electors and their responsibil-\n ity to organized society, can be understood.\n It is a usurpation of prerogatives justified to\n him and to the members of Tammany Hall\n and its adherents in the power he exercises\n in Tammany Hall. It has made him in fact\n and literally what a public singer in jest\n called him, \u201cThe Ruler of New York.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This is an extraordinary condition and\n could exist nowhere but in this country and\n in this country nowhere than in a great popu-\n lous center. A man having no warrant from\n the voters, the source of all power theoreti-\n cally, a private citizen who has devoted him-\n self solely to the interests of a political or-\n ganization whose existence is purely voluntary,\n being neither official, statutory nor constitu-\n tional, Who had not until recently, if he has\n now and if he has, only since he attained\n power, no interest in the material growth and\n prosperity of the city he rules, can, and often\n does, by a word change, direct and control,\n any one of the infinite details of the multifa-\n rious interests of a gigantic community \u2014 the\n wealthiest and in some respects the most\n powerful on the globe.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is no discussion here as to whether\n or not that power, so enormous, so extra-\n ordinary and so purely an unwarrantable as-\n sumption, is exercised for the good or evil\n of the city and its citizens. The fact merely\n is stated that such a man and such a condi-\n tion exist and when it is established, curi-\n osity as to the man who has seized and\n wields such power must inevitably follow.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Croker\u2019s advance toward this condition\n of supreme power was gradual. From the\n moment he grasped with firm and exclusive\n hand the helm of the organization, the pos-\n sibilities of such power were in his hands \u2014\n that is so long as the people \u2014 the voters \u2014\n were willing to support Tammany in its pre-\n tentions and Tammany was willing to sub-\n mit to one man power. Yet to the assump-\n tion of it Mr. Croker advanced slowly, trying\n and testing the safety of each step as he\n went, much as an elephant crosses marshy\n ground. That he had the willingness, that he\n was aspiring toward power, that he was ambi-\n tious to command and to control, that he is\n masterful, aggressive, even domineering is\n no doubt true and these are essential charac-\n teristics of the man. But that none of these\n</p>\n<p>\n traits was conspicuously prominent before\n hij uprise to the control of the Tammany\n machine is quite as true. Whatever the\n qualities now recognized in him are, they\n have been shown impressively only since he\n came to leadership and all that he is ha3\n been developed in Tammany Hall. Of that\n organization he has been a member since\n early manhood. He brought votes with him\n when he entered. He was a leader, a boss,\n then being the head of a gang known as the\n Tunnel Gang. His masterfulness, and in\n those days he was an apostle of force, was\n early recognized. They were turbulent days\n in politics. Tammany had its opponents in\n rival halls and there were men whose follow-\n ings were so great as to be independent quan-\n tities, threatening the success of and some-\n times triumphing over the halls, sometimes\n in alliance with one or more and as often\n alone in the open. Our energetic Governor,\n had he lived in those days, would not have\n sighed for strenuous politics; he would have\n found them on every corner on primary\n nights. Mr. Croker in those wild and rough\n days, literally fought his way to recognition\n and battered down opposition with his fists,\n and in the inner struggles of the organiza-\n tion secured for himself the reputation of a\n vigorous, self-assertive man wffiose claims\n were not to be ignored. Then, as now, poli-\n tics was his occupation and his profes-\n sion and his means of livelihood were the\n rewards that were granted him for services\n rendered. It was a rough school in which\n he graduated. When the late John Kelly was\n the leader of Tammany Mr. Croker had so\n far advanced in the organization that he\n could, claim a place on the county ticket\n and was chosen Coroner. Moreover he had\n become one who was consulted and advised\n with by the chief. But even then his place\n was not such as made him superior to a\n dozen others \" who occupied a similar place.\n In short, he was not heir apparent to the\n mantle of Kel,ly, as so many in this day seem\n to think. Mr. Kelly held the titular leader-\n ship to the day of his death, though for\n months prior to it he was incapable of exer-\n cising Its fhfictions. During this time the\n affairs of Tammany were administered by a\n sort of committee of which Mr. Croker was\n one, indeed, and for some time after the death\n of Mr. Kelly. ' No doubt each one of this per-\n haps self-constituted committee looked to\n the reversion of the dead leader\u2019s power to\n himself and glanced askance and warily at his\n confreres, not one willing to enter into a\n combination with any of the others lest there-\n by his own opportunity be lost. But out of\n this wary, self-seeking committee slowly and\n gradually emerged the figure of Mr. Croker\n to the single handed lead.

A vexed meeting was\n anticipated, because so many candidates\n had been suggested and urged by in-\n dividual members that it was out of\n the question to believe that one name could\n receive the support of a majority of the com-\n mittee. About the last one to enter was Mr.\n Croker. He walked to the table and wrote\n something upon a slip of paper. Then he\n went over to Jimmy Martin, one hoping him-\n self for leadership, and, showing it to him,\n asked him how that name would do. \u201cIt\n won\u2019t do at all,\u201d replied Martin. \u201cIt ' s got\n to do,\u201d replied Croker, forcefully.

An alert jealousy of all and\n everybody seeking to trespass upon any of\n the ground he has taken to himself \u2014 a heavy\n hand laid on the trespasser, without warning\n to him, were the means and methods of his\n maintenance of his leadership.

Gilroy.\n Croker passed on to another, showing the\n paper and commandingly remarking. That s\n the man we name to-day,\u201d and to another,\n and so on until he had shown it to a majority,\n when he took his own place. When the time\n came he rose, offered the name, and, in a\n very few forceful words, practically com-\n manded the committee to choose the name.\n He had gone to the test, he had put his for-\n tunes to the fire. A majority submitted, and\n Mr. Croker not only secured his candidate,\n but took control of the committee. From that\n moment his firm hand has been on the lever.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this there is some insight into the char-\n acter of Mr. Croker. Force, will, aggression\n MU] andae.itv \u2014 these are the Qualities the D0S-\n</p>\n<p>\n acy. In view of his early career, the asser-\n tion that he is not a brave man doubtless will\n be questioned. He has brute courage, es-\n pecially when impelled by anger; but Mr.\n Croker is so cautious a man as to be almost\n timid in arriving at conclusions. He is a\n bold man, yet lacking in high moral courage.\n Bold audacity takes its place. His great\n qualities are audacity, aggression, assump-\n tion and presumption. A man cannot mount\n to and maintain the power Mr. Croker has,\n holding it over ten years as he has done,\n without the possession of strong qualities of\n some kind. A cold, dispassionate, unpreju-\n diced examination fails to discover any other\n qualities making for his maintenance of place\n than those stated. To be sure, he has intel-\n</p>\n<p>\n ligence, but it is neither more rapid nor more\n penetrating than a hundred others who obey\n his orders. His success must be attributed to\n his commanding and forceful personality, his\n self-reliance and his jealous regard for his\n own rights. His personal consequence, a\n sense very strong, is an aid.\n</p>\n<p>\n The success of many a man In a similar\n position has been due in large measure to a\n capacity to read men accurately and to choose\n wisely aids and instruments. In this quality\n Mr. Croker is singularly deficient. Said a dis-\n tinguished Senator from another state: \u201cI\n am astoni shed at hearing that Mr. Croker is\n about to give the nomination of so important\n</p>\n<p>\n a place to . Mr. Croker will regret It\n</p>\n<p>\n within six months. I am astounded that he\n has not read the man better and yet I hear It\n is a purely personal choice.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt is a defect in Mr. Croker that he is a\n very poor judge of men,\u201d replied a former\n Cabinet minister, who claims New York as\n his home.\n</p>\n<p>\n Those who are close to Mr. Croker know\n how frequently he has been disappointed in\n his choice of instruments and how often he\n has been compelled to revise his judgment.\n It is incredible but nevertheless a fact that\n when he had quarreled with Bourke Cockran\n and had turned down that distinguished ora-\n tor, he sought to replace the loss of the or-\n ganization\u2019s spokesman with Sulzer and that\n person is to-day a member of Congress be-\n cause of the effort.\n</p>\n<p>\n What Mr. Croker is not, is far easier to state\n than what he is. He is not literate; he is\n not a thinker; he is not an orator, for he has\n difficulty in expressing his thoughts; he is\n not rapid in the processes of such intellect\n as he has been gifted with; he is a man of\n little profundity and no philosophy; his mental\n scope is narrow and in vision he is not far\n sighted. He is surrounded by some bright\n witted, able men and when he permits himself\n to be ghided by them as to the policy of his\n organization he goes fairly straight, but he\n is too prone to judge of public matters from\n a personal standpoint. He Is intolerant of\n opposition, demands blind obedience and re-\n sents a failure of prompt acquiescence. His\n blunders of judgment are many and occupy-\n ing the position he does have reacted on the\n Democratic party. He has little notion of ap-\n pealing to the imagination and reason of vo-\n ters and believes utterly in the power of or-\n ganization strongly directed, and the potent\n influence of spoils. His course at Kansas\n City in the matter of the attempted humili-\n ation of former Senator Hill is a most excel-\n lent illustration. He believed himself to have\n been affronted by Mr. Hill. It was proper\n then that he should use the state organiza-\n tion to strike Mr. Hill down. Mr. Hill de-\n sired to go on the committee on resolutions\n in order to fight the insertion of the IS to 1\n plank. Accordingly, having the power, Mr.\n Croker turned down Mr. Hill. It never oc-\n curred to him that his displeasure with Hill\n would not be taken as a good reason by the\n party and he was probably the most surprised\n man in the United States that the party by its\n delegates should have resented his action\n toward the former Senator by that astounding\n demonstration. He was less rebuked than an-\n gered and he sought to further punish Hill by\n instructing Judge Yan Wyck to bring in no\n minority report, so that Hill could not take\n the floor of the convention, losing all sight\n of the fact that thereby he had jeopardized\n whatever chance there was for carrying New\n York, New Jersey and Connecticut for Bryan.\n It was a thoroughly characteristic incident\n and displays the man and in its results talilMlt\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0046/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0046/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0046/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0046/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0046/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0046.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 771495}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"46\">\n<p>\n 44\n</p>\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n with many others in his career less signifi-\n cant and spectacular.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Croker\u2019s quarrel with Mr. Hill is of\n long standing, for it began when Mr. Hill was\n Governor and refused to sign a hill at the\n request of Bourke Cockran, who had been sent\n by Mr. Croker to secure the Governor\u2019s sig-\n nature. What the measure was is now for-\n gotten, but it w r as rumored at the time that\n there was profit in it for somebody, if it was\n contrary to public policy. Mr. Croker\u2019s ef-\n fort to obtain control of the state organiza-\n tion began then, and has continued since.\n His alliance with former Senator Murphy of\n Troy, who had been made chairman of the\n State Central Committee by Hill, was for\n that purpose. There was thenceforward a\n running fight in which Hill was usually tri-\n umphant until four years ago when Senator\n Hill by his attitude to the results of the Chi-\n cago convention gave Croker his opportunity,\n or perhaps it were better stated until the con-\n solidation of New York and Brooklyn deprived\n the Kings County organization of its inde-\n pendence and sent it a suppliant to the feet of\n its ancient enemy and out of alliance with its\n old time friends of the interior of the state.\n</p>\n<p>\n The point is made when the bull dog tenac-\n ity with which Mr. Croker clings to an idea\n he has formed, or an enmity, or a grudge, or\n a grievance, is pointed out.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Croker is taciturn, grim and sardonic;\n He is hardly a genial man, yet he likes to be\n surrounded by those whom he regards as his\n friends, though he is usually a mute figure\n among them. He is capable of strong affec-\n tions, but there are not many who excite\n them. Old friends have a strong claim upon\n him and those of his struggling days have an\n approach to his favors and benefactions that\n those of his latter days do not always accom-\n plish. He is merciless in striking down when\n he believes he has been wronged and he re-\n gards treachery to himself as treachery to\n the organization. He objects to being used\n and dispenses the patronage and favors of his\n place as he thinks it redounds to the building\n up of the organization and does not always\n separate hi3 personality from Tammany Hall.\n His admirers insist that he has a great organ,\n izing faculty. It may De so, but he has never\n been called on to exercise it. He has no ca-\n reer apart from Tammany Hall and when he\n came to the head of that body he found a\n</p>\n<p>\n perfectly organized machine, a model of con-\n struction, and it has been his part only to\n see that it did not go to pieces. It is to his\n credit that the machine is as strong and run-\n ning as smoothly as when he took hold of the\n lever. He is a man of temperate habits and\n has been the greater portion of his life. He\n is self indulgent in but few things and prin-\n cipally in tobacco. His recreation has been\n his stable of running horses, his interest in\n which has led him for some years to spend\n a portion of each year in England, where his\n horses have been raced. Until this year it is\n asserted he has paid heavily for his pleasure.\n He is reputed to be a man of large wealth,\n all of -which has been accumulated since he\n came to the leadership of Tammany Hall,\n and concerning which there have been\n charges and allegations of a somewhat scan-\n dalous nature, though nothing has been\n brought home to him directly, yet more than\n one investigating committee has sought to\n probe them and his method of acquiring\n wealth, attempts that he has bitterly resent-\n ed and refused to submit himself to. He is\n a unique figure, a picturesque quantity and\n an interesting study among the men of our\n day.\n</p>\n<p>\n i\n</p>\n<p>\n Chauncey Mitchell Depew.\n</p>\n<p>\n POLITICIAN, ORATOR AND WIT,\n RAILROAD MAN AND FINANCIER.\n</p>\n<p>\n S URELY It must be one of his jests\n that leads Chauncey Mitchell Depew\n to vaunt the praises of the Hol-\n land Dutch stock in a way to suggest\n his descent from it. He rarely lets an op-\n portunity slip to praise the virtues of that\n people, who, settling on Long Island and Man-\n hattan, indelibly impressed themselves upon\n the Hudson and Mohawk valleys, giving hab-\n its, customs and virtues that have not yet,\n and probably never will be, wholly eradicated.\n At many a table where the sons and descend-\n ants of other races have been gathered to cel-\n ebrate the day of the fatherland his voice\n has been heard in dignified praise or jesting\n vein sounding the praises of the Dutch as if\n It was his ancestral race. Slow, stolid, slug-\n gish, deficient in fancy and devoid of humor,\n such is the popular comprehension of that\n race for which, indeed, Washington Irving is\n mainly responsible, but there must have been\n at least a certain basis of truth for. the es-\n timate of the gentle humorist or it would not\n have been accepted as it has been.\n</p>\n<p>\n It would be most difficult to believe that\n Mr. Depew, quick, bright, vivacious, full of\n fancy and humor, ever sprang from that race,\n for he is everything they w r ere not and is not\n anything they were \u2014 is of the French quality\n that his French Huguenot descent proclaims.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Depew is interesting and his career\n has sometimes been dramatic and often spec-\n tacular. This is due not so much to effort as\n</p>\n<p>\n to the possession of qualities and faculties\n that are rare gifts, and to the accident of\n the possession of a conspicuous place putting\n him always in the public eye, and from the\n publicity of which he could not escape, if he\n would. Whether or not it be a subject for\n congratulation, few men have lived so long\n and so constantly before the public. And\n though while this is so, while he has been\n regarded with an almost affectionate inter-\n est by his fellow citizens, as is evidenced in\n the term of \u201cOur Chauncey,\u2019\u2019 yet the pub-\n lic estimate of him is largely erroneous, or\n if not that, at least is only a partial esti-\n mate. Blessed with wit, an abundant vein\n of humor, a fertile fancy and an invention\n not to be exhausted, qualities that have led\n to his frequent employment on festive occa-\n sions, the consequence is that a vast propor-\n tion of the public are prone to regard him as\n wholly a wit, humorist and bon vivant. As\n a matter of fact this is only one side of him\n \u2014 the lighter side \u2014 and is the presentation of\n himself in those leisure hours of a busy life\n when he has exhibited a faculty, most rare,\n of putting aside and completely, for the\n nonce, the weighing and burdening responsi-\n bilities than which few men liave carried\n more. People like to laugh, and, grateful to\n the one who does, are inclined to regard him\n with a degree of affection. That widespread,\n kindly, affectionate interest that has come to\n</p>\n<p>\n be Jeseph Jefferson\u2019s portion is largely ex-\n plained in this. Something of that, if not\n a great deal, has come to be Mr. Depew\u2019s\n possession, and if he has not the peculiar\n and charming personality which is that of\n Mr. Jefferson, he has a happy, joyous and\n winsome temperament which serves the same\n purpose in gaining hearts and kindly inter-\n est. While this side of his character has\n been an efficient aid in his uprise, yet it has\n been a detriment and a retarding quantity\n in his advancement toward the goal his am-\n bition ever has before him, for that part of the\n public which has had it in its power to\n place him on the pedestal he craves, has\n doubted whether the man who so amused\n and entertained it could be trusted to satisfy\n its demands and requirements in the more\n serious aspects of life. Mediocrity, stalking\n about with dignity, always sedate, solemn\n and respectable, mouthing rotund platitudes,\n have received commission for serious public\n affairs denied the more nimble witted. Mr.\n Depew is not the first American who has\n paid penance for the possession of the higher\n mental qualities of wit, humor, fancy, in-\n vention and imagination.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Depew came before the public a very\n young man.

He entered as an\n attorney for the Hudson River Road and in\n three years sas made general counsel for\n the consolidated system, a position the du-\n ties of which he once described as being\n those which it was nobody else\u2019s duty to do.\n In 1885 he was made president of the Cen-\n tral-Hudson Company and two years ago\n chairman of all of the boards of directors of\n the Vanderbilt lines, taking the places for-\n merly held by Cornelius and William K.\n Vanderbilt. Thirty-four years cover his ser-\n vice to these lines, and during it he has ex-\n erted a power and influence difficult to prop-\n erly describe and estimate within the narrow\n limits of a newspaper article. Whether that\n influence has been for good or evil, in its re-\n lation to the public, is a subject that has\n been w ' idely discussed pro and con, but that\n it was for the good of the interests he rep-\n resented there is no measure of doubt, for\n it was purposed for that good. In 1869 the\n consolidation of the New York Central and\n the Hudson River companies were brought\n about by the old commodore, and that year\n saw the rise of the Vandermit power to prac-\n tical domination in railroad affairs in this\n state. It had been preceded and was fol-\n lowed by vast schemes of legislation touch-\n ing the railroad interests. Little of it was\n ostensibly in the interest of the public, all of\n it in in the railroad interest. Much of it haa\n since been condemned, reasonably and unrea-\n sonably. But that which stood on the stat-\n ute books in 1884 was practically the work of\n Mr. Depew. During the twenty years em-\n braced with 1868 and 1888 there was vast\n railroad extension and consolidation. Dur-\n ing these years the matter of transportation\n became a living issue with the people, en-\n tering intimately into their lives and affect-\n ing their earning capacities. The railroads\n became a power, almost supreme, before the\n public had recognized what a power they\n could be. Of this vast power, though direct-\n ly connected only with the Vanderbilt inter-\n ests, Mr. Depew became the practical rep-\n resentative. Subject to legislative regula-\n tion a scheme of railroad legislation became\n necessary. Assuming only to conserve and\n watch over the interests of the Central. Mr.\n Depew in fact became the architect of the\n state\u2019s supervision of its creatures, and\n though since 1884 there has been pucl*\n</p>\n<p>\n balloted for, as a successor to Roscoe Conk-\n ling and against him, for eighty-two days; and\n that this contest, known to political history\n as the half-breed-stalwart fight, bitter and\n virulent to a degree never before or since\n reached in party warfare, was marked by the\n Bradley-Sessions scandal, the statement that\n Mr. Depew\u2019s political career has been some-\n times dramatic and often spectacular, is made\n good.\n</p>\n<p>\n To add that during the years of 1864-5 he\n held the office of secretary of state of New\n York, that he has been a tax commissioner of\n New York City, that he was appointed and\n confirmed as minister to Japan, but resigned\n before taking office, that he was appointed\n but not confirmed as collector of the port,\n has been a regent of the university since\n 1874, was New York\u2019s candidate for the pres-\n idental nomination in 1892 and is now United\n States Senator, is to traverse briefly his ca-\n reer and to show that it has been an active\n one. Yet it is ventured that to the majority\n reading these lines, who think that they are\n familiar with Mr. Depew\u2019s career, the ac-\n tivity of it thus shown will come as a sur-\n prise. It is because it has been over-\n shadowed by another side, in which he has\n gained his more solid fame.\n</p>\n<p>\n he was chosen a member of the Assembly, in\n which body he took such high rank that at\n the next session he was made the leader of\n his party on the floor by being made the\n chairman of the ways and means committee,\n and the next year, in 1863, was made the can-\n didate of his party for speaker of the As-\n sembly. From that time, nearly forty years,\n he has been before the public as conspicuously\n as any American.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Depew was not chosen speaker of the\n Assembly for reasons that will be recollected\n</p>\n<p>\n for Brooklyn, Theophilus C.

This is hardly true, but It is a fact\n that much, if not all. railroad law was en-\n acted only after the interests of the rail-\n roads had been protected, and it is also true\n that not a little railroad law was inspired in\n a desire for protection for and in the in-\n terest of the railroads. Complaints that had\n been growing louder and louder culminated\n in 1883 in the establishment of a railroad\n commission, when the revolution of state\n supervision was practically accomplished and\n a change in legislation tcgdi place, bur even\n then what the railroad inrerests had gained\n under the influence tfl Mr. Depew was not\n lost.\n</p>\n<p>\n But not alone in New York State has Mr.\n Depew\u2019s power been confined. In the trans-\n portation problem of the country Mr. Depew\n has been a factor, consulted and counseled\n with by railroad operators even of lines not\n In alliance with those of the Vanderbilt in-\n terests.\n</p>\n<p>\n Three generations of Vanderbilts have\n reigned since he first cast his fortunes with\n that interest, and a fourth is fast advancing\n to power and will become active before he\n retires. During these years he has been\n guide, mentor and friend of the family, jeal-\n ously guarding their interests, consulted and\n advised with in personal and family matters\n apart from the railroads. This identification,\n while it has aided in impressing financiers,\n merchants, statesmen and public men with\n his superior qualities, has not helped, but\n rather retarded, him in his public career, for\n there has been, if there is not now, a preju-\n dice on the part of the general public against\n railroads and railroad operators, and, as the\n Vanderbilt interests, in many respects, were\n the largest, with greater opportunities for\n power, the man who moved with the weight\n and power and influence of its millions was\n looked upon with some doubts. Yet it is in\n this field of railroad operation that Mr. De-\n pew has won the highest respect for his men*\n tal qualities.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus it presented three sides of the man,\n in each of which he is noted \u2014 wit, states-,\n man and retired operator. There is yet\n another side, and that is the oratorical. His\n efforts are not confined to after-dinner\n speeches, in which perhaps his most popu-\n lar fame has been gained. Were his wishes\n and aspirations consulted, doubtless he would\n have forgotten those \u201cflashes of merriment\n that were wont to set the table on a roar,\u201d\n though they have been embalmed in print,\n for the more labored and dignified efforts that\n have given to him the fame of orator \u2014 rather\n that posterity should judge him by his ad-\n dresses on the unvailing of the statue of\n Alexander, on the centennial of the forma-\n tion of the New York State Constitution, on\n the life and character of Garfield, on the un-\n vailing of the statue of Bartholdi and the\n opening of the Chicago Exposition, which\n have given him the right to be entitled an\n orator.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is not given to many men to win dis-\n tinction in so many and diverse lines, and in\n a consideration of this line, one comes upon\n what are regarded as inconsistent and incon-\n gruous traits. The oratorical mind has been\n defined as the ability to eee so many sides of\n a question as to be sure of not one. It is re-\n ported of Daniel Webster that, notwithstand-\n ing the great fame he won as an orator and a\n debater in the United States Senate, he was\n never able to comprehend and understand\n</p>\n<p>\n the system and daily routine of the Senate\u2019s\n work, and that the detail of the office of the\n Secretary of State was as much of a sealed\n book to him the day he departed from it as\n it was the day he entered upon its duties.\n The vast railroad system of which Mr. Depew\n was the executive head for so many years,\n the multifarious details of which are to or-\n dinary minds an inextricable tangle, was at i\n the finger ends of Mr. Depew, and to-day,\n though his time is now divided between ser-\n vice in the Senate and his railroad offices,\n it is reported that he astounds the railroad\n executives with his unexpected knowledge of\n the details of roads that he has never had\n executive connection with. A capacity for\n grasping and administering detail work is so\n antithetical with the ordinary understanding\n of the oratorical mind that one is staggered\n to find them both in one man.\n</p>\n<p>\n But one runs against these contradictions\n in an attempted analysis of Mr. Depew\u2019s\n mental equipment. It is easy to set down\n that he has wit as nimble and agile as a\n squirrel; that he has humor, which if he had\n stood upon it alone for recognition from the\n \u25a0world would have placed him in the category\n with Mark Twain and Artemus Ward; that\n he is the most celebrated anecdotist of the\n day, and that while ready to accept and re-\n tell the last good story, wheq the supply\n fails does not hesitate to invent one while on\n his feet that has all the point and climax\n of preparation. Apropos of this faculty a\n gentleman who stands in such close relation\n to Mr. Depew as to be able to know all\n his stories as soon as they are acquired or\n minted, said the other day that he w T as well\n satisfied that the story the Senator told the\n Philadelphia convention, and which carried\n it into paroxysms of laughter, was invented\n on the impulse of the moment and when\n he realized that the convention expected\n a new story. This ready Invention is a\n characteristic faculty cff Mr. Depew; the\n writer of these lines recalls a remarkable\n exhibition of it some years ago, when the\n late Senator Wagner of palace car fame in-^\n vited his brother member,? of the state sen-\n ate to a railroad exeursfou to Montreal, in\n which Mr. Depew joined. Returning, the ex-\n cursion came over the Central Vermont line,\n and arriving at Burlington found, what the\n party had no prior notice of, that a lunch\n had been prepared for it. The train, con-\n trary to programme, was held up and the\n party compelled, in all courtesy, to go to the\n hotel. During the lunch Mr. Depew was\n vociferously called on for a speech. He\n could have had no preparation, yet he began\n a humorous recital of the events of the trip\n having no basis in fact, striking good hu-\n moredly at the foibles and weaknesses of each\n one of the party, eliciting roars of laughter\n from the victim as well as the auditors, with\n all the finish and completeness of prepara-\n tion and thought. Even this extraordinary\n and prompt invention is capable of being\n comprehended, as ' well as the wealth of vo-\n cabulary that supplies the word on the in-\n stant required, for it is known what skill\n and practice and study will accomplish. But\n when it is considered that this Is but the\n lighter side of the man indulged in only\n in the few leisure hours of a wonderfully\n busy life one marvels at the duplex quality\n discovered.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI have known Mr. Depew for many years\n and have been in the closest relations with\n him, and I have not yet got done being sur-\n prised and astounded at two of his qualities\n \u2014 quickness of apprehension and his extraor-\n dinary penetration,\u201d said a gentleman who\n enjoys intimate association with the Senator.\n</p>\n<p>\n But the term \u201cquickness of apprehension\u201d*\n</p>\n<p>\n does not describe completely; it is more. It\n is an astounding grasp of the question pre-\n sented in all its aspects and bearings with\n an instantaneous conclusion and judgment.\n This in counsel and conference is so rapid\n and so readily given that he who is not aware\n of his wonderful faculty in this respect is\n inclined to think that Mr. Depew is given\n insufficient consideration to the matter and\n has reached an indifferent and superficial\n judgment. Nor is he likely to be disabused\n of his notion until, questioning the judgment,\n he draws out the reasons for the faith that\n is in Mr. Depew. This rapid comprehension\n of knotty subjects and instantaneous judg-\n ment is well known to railroad magnates of\n the country, and is relied upon. The trans-\n portation question of this country, complicat-\n ed as it is with abstruse financiering, is full\n of knotty problems and it is a common prac-\n tice for the magnates of various roads in a\n section of country to gather for consultation\n and when, in expressive slang, \u201cup against\n it.\u201d quite as common to seek Mr. Depew in\n his office or to call him to them for a solution\n of the problem that has vexed them. If needs\n be when he has considered their problem and\n announced his judgment, he can make the ar-\n guments at length to support his solution and\n in doing so will confound even the executive\n of a line in a remote territory with his knowl-\n edge of the conditions surrounding and con-\n trolling his and connecting lines; but in these\n later years there is less asking for reasons\n than there is of faith and complete reliance\n on the results. Railroad magnates bear this\n testimony cheerfully and voluntarily. The\n vast influence exerted by the Senator in the\n railroad world, which has been such a puzzle\n to the observer, can be comprehended in this\n \u2014 that that world relies upon Mr. Depew for\n guidance when the way is clouded and doubt-\n ful.\n</p>\n<p>\n This peculiar endowment does not seem to\n be a logical process \u2014 more a matter of in-\n spiration and intuition. In fact, the Senator\n . seems te reverse the general order of things.\n He does not apparently reach a conclusion\n by logical steps, each step being a reason,\n but comprehends the question, reaches his\n conclusion, and then starts back over the\n field to find his reasons to support his con-\n clusion, and the astounding thing is that no\n one employing logical processes improves on\n his conclusions. The trait is feminine in its\n intuitiveness. It is a question, perplexing and\n puzzling as it is to the ordinary mind,\n whether it is not of the highest development\n of the human mind.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of like degree is his penetrative faculty.\n Those who are in close association with him\n assert that it is useless to give him less than\n the whole truth when in communication.\n Before you have spoken a half dozen sen-\n tences he has penetrated your motive, your\n purpose, Intention and what you would sav.\n The person meeting him only occasionally\n would discover little of the exercise of this\n power, for Mr. Depew T is a most excellent\n actor, and whatever his thoughts may be or\n the determination he may have reached while\n you are talking to him, you will see nothing\n of it in his man ner or speech. But his spe-\n cial entourage knows it so w ' ell that there is\n no concealment attempted, for it is useless.\n</p>\n<p>\n These tw r o qualities are the dominating and\n swaying ones of his mental equipment and\n with these held in mind and considered with\n reference to his career, its course and the\n reasons for it may be traced and understood.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is only within the past year that Mr. De \u2022\n pew has been in a position where the publij\n could see him in debate, and that is in tfcj,\n United States Senate.

Whether Mr. De-\n pew will take a high place there depends upon\n whether he possesses the qualities of aggres-\n sive force, courage and the power to receive\n with equanimity as fierce blows as he delivers.\n There are moral qualities necessary to suc-\n cess in debate as well as mental, and there\n are those who insist that therein the new Sen-\n ator will be found deficient, and that while he\n will achieve a high place as an orator of the\n body, he will not be that force and power\n which is the result of success in debate, and\n for the reason that he has neither the liking\n for nor inclination toward the fighting that\n is part of it. Inasmuch as the natural ten-\n dency of the man in the matter of dispute and\n opposition is toward diplomacy and compro-\n mise and as his chief triumphs, after all,\n have been achieved through diplomacy, this\n foreshadowing of his senatorial career seems\n to have basis in truth.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Depew has received the degree of\n LL.D. from Yale College, of which he is an\n alumnus. It was conferred evidently be-\n cause he had reached a degree of distinction\n his college desired to recognize in a son, for\n Ife is not a learned man in the sense the\n degree would imply. Nor has he been a stu-\n dent. His life has been too busy and too\n active with too many demands on his time.\n He is not even a thorough reading man, and\n such step as he has kept with modern thought\n has been with attention to the reviews. He\n has not even a fad for one line of thought\n in which he has become proficient, as so\n many of his rank and degree have. Yet one\n cannot read his speeches without knowing\n that there was a time once when he traveled\n</p>\n<p>\n over the field of literature and thought and\n that when the time comes, as, for instance,\n when preparing an address of dignity, he\n knows well where to go for information and\n instruction.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHe\u2019s a sponge,\u201d said one of his friends.\n \u201cHe can absorb more in a given space of time\n than any man I ever heard of, certainly than\n I ever knew.

He probably has more\n newspaper friends than any public man of the\n day, and the confidence he places in them, to\n an extent appalling to some of his associates,\n is rarely, if ever, abused. This is a matter\n of principle with him, for he believes in the\n public press as the great arm of civilization\n and progress of this day \u2014 a power that must\n be reckoned with and an engine for good in\n our particular phase of civilization. But he\n is the most approachable of all the public men\n and his faculty of receiving and disposing of\n</p>\n<p>\n a large number of callers of various purposes\n without friction is great. There is a bon-\n homie about him that seems to say to each\n man who comes, \u201cYou are the man I\u2019ve been\n waiting for.\u201d A cheery laugh and a bright\n word is something that he deals out to every-\n one however humble and the young news-\n paper man coming in timidly into his pres-\n ence, if he shows the quality of appreciation\n and intelligence, is as likely to get the best\n anecdote he has at his disposal as the next\n caller, though he may be a money king and\n a power in the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Senator\u2019s hair and whiskers are whiter\n than they were; he has passed his sixty-\n sixth year, but the years have touched him\n lightly, for his frame is erect as twenty years\n ago, even if there is more adipose tissue on\n it than then. Time has set few marks on\n his face and his eyes are bright and merry.\n He has carried heavy burdens and weighty\n responsibilities in these forty years, and that\n time has dealt so leniently with him is due\n to a happy, joyous temperament, a knowledge\n how to play without carrying work into it, a\n life which, though not one of denial, has yet\n been abstemious and free from self-indul-\n gence. He is a thorough man of the world,\n tolerant, recognizing the weaknesses and ten-\n dencies of mankind, moral in his private life\n and no more moral in his public functions\n than the most moral of public men.\n</p>\n<p>\n He is a picturesque quantity in our public\n life, of many sides, brilliant and showy on\n the platform, solid, executive and efficient at\n the desk, swaying and influential in the coun-\n cil chamber. The meed of praise and ap-\n plause has been his liberal portion in all the\n efforts of his life, but he has one ambition\n toward which everything achieved in the past\n is but a step, which his accomplishments and\n his fame make Impossible for him \u2014 the presi-\n dency.

In his career is to\n be found a reason for that boast of ours, so\n often made, that the accident of birth or\n Inherited station has little to do with the\n mounting of the American citizen, and that\n the highest station is open to all demonstrat-\n ing possession of qualities justifying its oc-\n cupancy, no matter what their beginning, de-\n gree or early environment. Mr. Gorman ' s\n beginnings, in contrast with his later develop-\n ment, were not as picturesque as those of\n some others who have attained distinction\n in our public life, memories of which are\n kept alive by the soubriquets of \u201cthe rail-\n splitter,\u201d \u201cthe tow boy,\u201d \u201cthe mill boy,\u201d\n etc., but, if picturesqueness is absent in his\n case, he yet stands alone among all our pub-\n lic men in singular preparation, begun early\n and long continued, for efficient discharge of\n the functions of the high office he was finally\n called on to fill. In this respect his career\n has not a parallel in our national public life.\n Other men have been called to the Senate\n after having devoted their energies to pur-\n suits far removed from the line of the du-\n ties of the chamber, their call being, in fact,\n an interruption in their chosen labor; or, if\n not that, a departure from their life work.\n Mr. Gorman is the one man who was spe-\n cifically educated, not with purpose yet in\n effect, for the duties of Senator, for his\n occupations from early boyhood were dis-\n tinctly preparatory for that high dignity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Beginning as a page boy in the Senate,\n Mr. Gorman absorbed by contact the theory\n and science of parliamentary law. Some one\n has said that when one is learned in that\n law he is learned In all law and in the sci-\n ence of constitutional government. Com-\n mand of parliamentary practice is not a diffi-\n cult achievement \u2014 that is, to know that in\n a given situation certain motions will apply\n and will have certain results. There are\n plenty of such parliamentarians; but to tell\n why such motions should apply, such course\n should be pursued and what reasons there-\n for are underlying, to state the law, its his-\n tory and reason for existence is a very dif-\n ferent matter. There are but few such par-\n liamentarians. A bright, observant boy.\n young Gorman soon commanded the practice,\n and could have as skillfully wielded thp gavel\n in the direction of debate or the adminis-\n tration of the business under rules of the\n Senate as the one especially chosen for the\n duty. Nor is this so uncommon among page\n boys and clerks in deliberative assemblages\n as to make the statement as to the youthful\n Gorman astonishing. Quite frequently they\n</p>\n<p>\n have been taken into the desk to prompt and\n guide uninformed legislators forced to pre-\n side as chairman of the committee of the\n whole or on the state of the Union. Later,\n attentive to the debates on parliamentary\n law and practices, and thoughtful over it,\n young Gorman became learned in the philos-\n ophy of the law and the accomplished par-\n liamentarian he has so frequently demon-\n strated himself to be.\n</p>\n<p>\n Subsequently translated from the legisla-\n tive to the executive department of govern-\n ment in Washington, further education, and\n in practical administration, was secured, the\n like of which none of his confreres in the\n upper body could boast. All this time he was\n in close touch with practical politics and\n party management, for he was an active par-\n ticipant in the affairs of his party in his home\n state, Maryland, not so far distant that his\n touch with it could not be continuous. Grow-\n ing there in influence and power, the time\n arrived when he was recognized as the undis-\n puted leader of the Democracy of that state,\n so strong and so absolute in leadership as to\n be called its boss. But before this station\n was reached he had left the departments of\n Washington, had taken part in the adminis-\n tration of the government of Maryland and\n had entered the Legislature of that state,\n serving as Speaker of its Assembly and later\n [ in its Senate, when, in the exercise of his\n knowledge of parliamentary law, he learned\n to be proficient in its technique and practice.\n So, when he stepped into the United States\n Senate, he was armed, equipped and\n educated for the discharge of his\n</p>\n<p>\n functions as perhaps no man ever was\n in the beginning in like degree. Yet,\n</p>\n<p>\n profound parliamentarian as he was then,\n able to state his question clearly and the rea-\n sons for it learnedly, Mr. Gorman avoided de-\n bate and set speech, under the conviction that\n there his limitations began, until he came to\n be counted as one of the silent members of\n the body, more efficient in the committee\n room than on the floor, except in times of par-\n liamentary conflict, when the tactician and\n the general was required. However, as time\n went on, he participated more and more in\n the verbal warfares of that body, until one\n day the Senate awakened to the fact that\n there was in it, not only a shrewd tactician\n and a daring general, but a forcible debater\n in the person of the Maryland Senator. That\n was the occasion of the memorable contest\n over the Force bill, the defeat of which was\n credited to him. This was an evolutionary\n period to Senator Gorman, for not only were\n his abilities as a parliamentary tactician and\n general impressed on the country through the\n medium of this debate and result, but he\n emerged a strong, almost heroic, figure from\n among strong men; had demonstrated the\n</p>\n<p>\n possession of power in debate of no mean or-\n der and had acquired an influence in the\n Southern States that has not yet been wholly\n dissipated. It was then that Mr. Gorman won\n a place as one of the strong speakers of the\n Senate, as one cogent, strong in reason and\n clear in statement, whose efforts were models\n of legislative speeches if not of ornamental\n oratory, usually impromptu, but sometimes\n carefully prepared in set phrase.\n</p>\n<p>\n Such is a hasty review of Mr. Gorman ' s\n career in public life, guided to make good the\n statement that he stands alone among our\n public men in a singular preparation for his\n long service in the Senate. It does not set\n forth that for a number of years Mr. Gorman\n has been a possible candidate for the presi-\n dential nomination, that this nomination is\n the consuming ambition of his life, which now\n will never be realized. Nor does it dwell up-\n on his forceful leadership of the Democracy\n of Maryland \u2014 so forceful, indeed, that it lei\n to a revolt against his leadership, ending in\n taking the state from Democratic control and\n removing him from the Senate floor. What\n was then lost by him in Maryland has been\n since regained and his sway to-day seems to\n be as strong as ever. Whether his Senator-\n ial aspirations have been wholly satisfied or\n whether, when opportunity presents itself, he\n will return to the Senate, remains to be seen.\n A man who has arrived at the position Mr.\n Gorman is in is rarely a free agent as to his\n political course. Circumstances and party de-\n mands are quite likely to force him back to\n the Senate, even if he be disinclined to take\n upon his shoulders the activities and respon-\n sibilities of a Senatorial life when it is not\n likely he can add to the fame he now enjoys.\n A guess would have it that he would decline\n further service for, as was said above, his as-\n pirations are presidential and as never yet\n has a President been taken from that body\n there is a superstition to consider.\n</p>\n<p>\n The striking characteristic of Mr. Gorman\n is his poise and command of himself, his\n emotions and his passions. The latter are\n strong, but so disciplined that he can at all\n times assume a calmness if he has it not. He\n has been called cold, calculating and selfish.\n Men who rise to heights in public life usually\n are selfish; an enlightened self-interest is one\n of the aids in the uprise. Calculating Mr.\n Gorman unquestionably is and the policies and\n courses determined upon in the period of cal-\n culation are undoubtedly governing thereafter\n as a matter of will and purpose. But Mr. Gor-\n man is not cold, though he can with strong\n hand repress the affection and the impulse.\n</p>\n<p>\n ! In short, the intellectual faculties of the man\n dominate and control the emotions. He pos-\n sesses an iron hand, but it is covered with a\n velvet glove. A man of will and determina-\n tion, these qualities are hid under a bland.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0051/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 345, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 493}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0051/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 691, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 987}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0051/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1383, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1975}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0051/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2767, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3950}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0051/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0051.jp2", "height": 3950, "width": 2767, "levels": 6, "size": 872192}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"51\">\n<p>\n 49\n</p>\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n suave and politic manner quite apt to deceive\n the superficial observer who might see in him\n only a polished gentleman of courtly man-\n ners and a self-complacent smile.\n</p>\n<p>\n The reasoning powers of his mind are more\n than respectable; its habit reflective and in its\n processes, rapid and sure, rather than other-\n wise. with conclusions direct and safe, but he\n is not tenacious in hi3 conclusions, a defect\n that has influenced judgment of him and rath-\n er erroneously, for it is not so much because\n of the want of strong conviction as it is a\n willingness to bend before expediency. He\n is possessed of but few of the more brilliant\n parts. If he is ductile and adroit he is not\n imaginative; if his wits are nimble, he is not\n inventive. He is not without humor, some-\n what cynical, yet takes himself seriously. His\n mind is not of the creative order, is not con-\n ceptive, but it is absorbent; quick to receive\n an idea and even on mere suggestion grasp\n it in all its bearings, he can quickly digest\n and analyze, penetrating it to the core, and\n turn it out again in such shape that it will\n appear his own, stamped with his individual-\n ity. Whether the idea is his own or some\n one else\u2019s, his grasp upon it is strong and\n forceful; his vision is broad and far reaching.\n Of the art of effect he is a profound master,\n but he has a greater faculty in an intuitive\n knowledge of an effect on the public mind.\n His appreciation of public sentiment, its trend\n and what will influence it, is so sensitive as\n to be almost an attribute of genius. His in-\n sight into human nature is instant and sure\n and he is a profound judge of men. He is\n tactful, employing the arts of diplomacy be-\n fore resorting to force. He seems to have\n learned by heart the Richelieu maxim, \u201cfirst\n all means to conciliate, there failing, all\n powers to crush.\u2019\u2019 Apart from these, his in-\n tellectual qualities are rather those of strong,\n robust, common sense.\n</p>\n<p>\n From another point of view, it is impossible\n to escape the conviction that he is a man to\n whom the success of an undertaking is of\n more consequence than the triumph of prin-\n ciples. Inclined to the use of expedients, he\n seems to be able to persuade himself that\n there are times when principles can be laid\n away in cotton and carefully preserved for a\n more opportune time of exploitation. In the\n same manner he can lay aside his convictions\n and be with his party when it has abandoned\n its tenets and truths, as it did four years ago\n and as it continues to do to-day, supporting\n it when it is wrong, in the hopes that it will\n in time return to sanity, perhaps, at all\n events, rather than, even by passive protest,\n give aid to the enemy, as thfe opposition must\n be necessarily to him. This means that he is\n and ingenious as when he has an intrigue well\n litical intrigue, burrowing deeply, concealing\n his advances and revealing himself and his\n end only at the point of achievement. So in\n Maryland his opponents, and admirers even,\n call him \u201cslide.\u201d As he is never so bland\n an ingenuous as when he has an intrigue well\n in hand and working successfully, they also\n call him smooth. Keen, shrewd and swift in\n his execution, his followers have borrowed a\n phrase from the vocabulary of New England\n and call him \u201cchain lightning.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Though he is best known to the country\n through his service in the Senate and the fame\n he enjoys outside of Maryland is in conse-\n quence of it, yet wherein he is conspicuously\n great is in his administrative capacity. Here\n shine fcrightly sterling qualities of system,\n order, quick comprehension, ready judgment,\n great grasp of vexatious questions, prompt\n decision, minute command of details, clear\n vision, rapid penetration and an astonishing\n power of getting down to and into the real\n facts. In his conduct of the presidential cam-\n</p>\n<p>\n paign of 1884, which ended in the election of\n Mr. Cleveland to the presidency, these quali-\n ties were conspicuously shown on a platform\n whereon the \u201cbright sunlight of publicity\u201d\n shone fiercely. It was the most notable ot\n the campaigns ot our political history in\n many respects, certainly in bitterness, nasti-\n ness, slander and venom, degraded by scandal\n and complicated by great migrations of votes,\n confusing the judgment as it excited the\n deepest animosities. The well wisher of his\n country may well pray that its like shall not\n be seen again. Mr. Gorman had been induced\n reluctantly to take the chairmanship of the\n executive committee, which meant to be the\n campaign manager. The Democratic party\n had been out of power for twenty-four years.\n Six presidential campaigns had been unsuc-\n cessfully waged. Its candidates \u2014 McClellan,\n Seymour, Greeley and Hancock had been un-\n mercifully beaten, and, though Tilden had\n been elected, he had been cheated of his tri-\n umphs. To thinking men, when they put\n aw r ay their enthusiasm and looked calmly and\n judicially into the situation, the promise of\n</p>\n<p>\n Copyright, Clinedinst, Wash.\n</p>\n<p>\n Arthur Pue Gorman.\n</p>\n<p>\n success was not great. The difficulty of turn-\n ing out of power a party intrenched for a\n quarter of a century was, in the outlook,\n great. The days of civil service reform had\n not yet come, and there was a vast army of\n office holders to fight desperately for their\n places; the opposing candidate, though his\n nomination gave dissatisfaction to parts of\n his party, yet w r as one who appealed to the\n enthusiasm, the affections and the imagina-\n tions of the people, and there were elements\n within the Democratic party that he appealed\n to so strongly that from the outset it was\n feared that he would detach a very consider-\n able body of Democratic votes in the doubtful\n or pivotal states. The Democratic candidate\n was a comparatively unknow ' n man, whose\n national fame was yet to be made, all knowl-\n edge of him being confined to his service as\n Governor of New York during two years and\n in his own state, the one essentially neces-\n sary to his success, Tammany Hall, was\n hostile.\n</p>\n<p>\n This w-as the situation Senator Gorman was\n called on to confront. The first question pre-\n sented on his assumption of the place was\n that of organization. Dozens of plans were\n offered and urged. The Senator listened and\n</p>\n<p>\n commended them all, and then dazed his com-\n mittee by his powers of simplification. Tak-\n ing a list of the states, he checked off one\n after another, a number of them saying -that\n they were hopelessly Republican and it were\n a waste of time, money and energy to give\n them any attention. Then he checked off cer-\n tain others, saying they were surely Demo-\n cratic and the state organizations of them\n could be safely trusted to bring about the\n desired results without consideration from\n the national committee. This left five\n States \u2014 New York, New Jersey, Connecticut,\n Indiana and West Virginia. Then he said:\n \u201cHerein lies danger; instead of waging a\n grand national campaign, let us conduct five\n state campaigns, concentrating therein all\n our energies.\u201d It was a new ' method, which\n lopped off all the pomp and circumstance of\n a grand national campaign, but its logic was\n inevitable, and it w r as adopted. Yet, notwith-\n standing the vigorous, concentrated effort,\n well directed and skillfully made. Election\n Day was approached with grave and well-\n founded doubts upon the part of the Demo-\n cratic manager and corresponding elation on\n the part of the Republicans.\n</p>\n<p>\n A very large body of Irish votes had been\n detached from the Democratic party and had\n sworn allegiance to Blaine. Indeed it was\n worse, for it amounted to a stampede. A well\n laid, well-conducted and most successful in-\n trigue, initiated and under way months be-\n fore the nomination of Blaine, had brought\n about the condition. It is true that there\n had been a corresponding migration of mug-\n wumps and Germans from the Republican\n to the Democratic ticket, but it was by no\n means sufficient to overcome the Irish defec-\n tion, and it was most marked in New York\n and New Jersey. The clear vision of Sehator\n Gorman prevented him from being deluded\n as others were with the idea that one migra-\n tion offset the other. He saw the situation\n plainly. Three days before the election he\n said to a confidential assistant: \u201cNew York\n will be lost unless a miracle occurs; that\n means the loss of the Presidency.\u201d But the\n miracle occurred and it was Senator Gor-\n man ' s prompt seizure and direction of it that\n saved the day for the Democrats. Of all\n those concerned in the Democratic manage-\n ment ot the campaign none but Senator Gor-\n man saw its possible effect, what could be\n accomplished by it and how it could be han-\n dled to make it tell for the benefit of the\n Democratic ticket and it was he who took it\n into his own direction. This was the \u201cRuin,\n Romanism and Rebellion\u201d incident.\n</p>\n<p>\n There were many who believed and may\n yet believe that this incident was the Tesult\n ot a successful intrigue on the part of the\n Democratic managers and that they employed\n an old and highly reputable minister whose\n long life iivas without a moral blemish, how-\n ever narrow his view\u2019s may have been. The\n allegation was absurd in the knowledge of\n the Rev. Dr. Burchard\u2019s character. The fact\n is that the Democratic managers had no\n knowledge of the utterance until after it was\n made. These are the facts. Some time earlier\n in the campaign, while visiting Brooklyn,\n Mr. Cleveland had received at the Pierre-\n pont House a body of clergymen who by a\n spokesman had addressed him and he had\n replied thereto. The fact had won the ad-\n miration of the Republican managers, who\n saw in it clever political tactics. When Mr.\n Blaine visited New York a few days before\n the election to attend a dinner a similar\n clerical visitation was organized to take place\n at the Fifth Avenue Hotel as an offset to\n the Brooklyn demonstration. Mr. Blaine was\n informed and told that he was expected to\n reply to the address made him and the aa-\n</p>\n<p>\n )\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0052/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0052/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0052/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0052/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0052/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0052.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 691675}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"52\">\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n S* >\n</p>\n<p>\n novncement of the event was widely circulated.\n The chief of the News Bureau of the Demo-\n cratic Committee was in the practice of send-\n ing a stenographer to Republican occasions\n when permitted.

Though\n nothing was expected from it, yet the sten-\n ographer was sent, who, returning, reported\n that nothing of importance had occurred mak-\n ing it worth while the transcribing of his\n notes.

This\n will beat Blaine and elect Cleveland if we\n can get it before the country in time.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Under the Senator\u2019s immediate direction\n and supervision, an impromptu literary corps\n was organized, as large as time and oppor-\n tunity would permit. Any man who could\n handle & pen was impressed into the service.\n All sorts of articles were prepared \u2014 some rab-\n idly Democratic, some rabidly Republican,\n some neutral, some colorless; but all got in\n the fact that the spokesman of a visiting\n deputation had used the fatal words as de-\n scriptive of what Blaine was contending\n against and as standing as a candidate for\n the reverse of it and that Mr. Blaine did not\n say him nay. The wires were made hot that\n night in carrying to all parts of the United\n States where the telegraph wire reached the\n words that sealed Blaine\u2019s doom. The tele-\n graph bill of the committee for that night ran\n up into the thousands. A return stampede\n followed. The day wa^ carried for Cleve-\n land, and in New York, by barely eleven\n hundred, but sufficient to give him the elec-\n toral dh > te of the state. Mr. Blaine ' s subse-\n quent explanation was that he had not heard\n the fatal words, since his time had been so\n much taken up by callers that he had not\n had time to arrange the words of his reply\n until he was ushered into the presence of the\n clergymen and that while Dr. Burchard was\n speaking he was devoting himself to thoughts\n or his own speech, oblivious to the words of\n the venerable gentleman.\n</p>\n<p>\n To Senator Gorman\u2019s instantaneous appre-\n</p>\n<p>\n i\n</p>\n<p>\n ciation of the effect of the three words \u2014 the\n classing of Romanism with rum and rebellion\n so obnoxiously \u2014 would have on that vote\n which had already been detached from the\n Democratic party, especially in the failure\n of the Republican candidate to render them\n inoeuous by protest and rebuke, together with\n the prompt organization of the means by\n which they could be spread before the coun-\n try and the exercise of the required energy,\n may be attributed a victory won from the\n very jaws of defeat.\n</p>\n<p>\n That he is devoted to his word is the faith\n of bis followers in his own state, but he is\n charged by allies without with a disposition\n toward abandonment of an alliance when suc-\n cess is not probable and of securing his own\n haven without respect to the well being of\n others. Were he less than a state leader\n and a distinguished former Senator, tricki-\n ness is the term that would be applied ti\n him. A prominent member of Congress from\n Mississippi on the night the balloting was\n going forward in the National Democratic\n Convention in Chicago in 1892, when Mr.\n Cleveland was nominated a third time for\n the Presidency, sitting in the headquarters\n of the New York delegation at the Audi-\n torium, related to a disconsolate band of\n Hillites who had already acknowledged de-\n feat and were merely waiting to hear the an-\n nouncement of it, that he had not intended\n being present at the convention, but had\n been strongly urged by Senator Gorman in\n Washington to reconsider his determination\n in order to contend against the \u201cimpending\n calamity of Mr. Cleveland\u2019s nomination.\u201d\n So urged, he complied, and in Chicago\n plunged into the opposition to Cleveland, to\n find that there was sufficient opposition if it\n could be combined and centered on a single\n candidate, and the while he was in constant\n consultation with the Maryland statesman.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the course of time a combination was\n conceived thatpromised success, which, it was\n believed, would prevent Mr. Cleveland ' s nom-\n ination on the first ballot, when so many,\n bound by the instructions of state conventions\n to vote for him on that ballot, would be free\n of their shackles, and thereafter a two-third\n vote for the former President would be made\n impossible. The Maryland delegation was\n necessary to this combination and its leader,\n Mr. Gorman, was sought, the matter laid be-\n fore him and the fact pointed out that in the\n event of success in defeating Cleveland, the\n nomination of Hill was likely to follow. A ' .l\n this received the approval of the Senator,\n who strongly urged his visitors, of whom the\n Mississippi Congressman was one, to go for-\n ward with the scheme. The work was en-\n gaged on and it was proceeding rapidly with\n</p>\n<p>\n large promises of success, when they were\n cast into consternation by the announcement,\n confirmed on inquiry, that Mr. Gorman, with-\n out word of explanation with those he had\n marshaled from, other states to combat Cleve-\n land, had taken himself and his AJarylgnd\n cohorts into the Cleveland < cardp. This tale\n was supplemented by a recital of a New York\n leader, who told that during the days prelim-\n inary to the session of the convention the\n Hill people of New York were in receipt of\n frequent communications from the Senator\n of aid, encouragement and advice. The day\n before the convention assembled, a humble\n and insignificant member of the Hill forces,\n who^e sources of information, however, were\n not to be despised, brought to Mr. Murphy,\n the leader of the delegation, the statement\n that Mr. Gorman had made his peace with\n the Cleveland people. Messrs. Murphy and\n Croker were rather angered by the state-\n ment and proved a communication from Mr.\n Gorman in the lines of his former ones with-\n in the hour. Before midnight the truth\n of the statement was made manifest. It\n was alleged by the Senator\u2019s friends that\n he was justified in this sudden abandonment\n of allies in the conviction that further op-\n position to Cleveland would result in the\n nomination of Mr. Hill and not himself, as\n he had confidently expected.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is insight into a phase of character\n of Mr. Gorman in these anecdotes which will\n go far toward explaining why Mr. Gorman\n has lost that influence in the Southern\n states- which was once his in such large\n measure. Mr. Gorman is not a man of im-\n pressive appearance yet carries himself with\n dignity and sobriety of demeanor. There is\n about him the air of responsibility and au-\n thority which marks him as a man of dis-\n tinction and a glance at his face would as-\n sure one that he is a person of consequence\n and force.

Everybody\n knows him or of him. He is one of the\n most widely advertised, the most extensively\n cartooned and one of the most thoroughly\n misrepresented men in America. This is the\n result of the part he has taken in political\n affairs and the forcible way in which he has\n played that part.\n</p>\n<p>\n Five years ago Mr. Hanna was comparative-\n ly unknown outside of his business associa-\n tions and in local politics, and, to a limited\n extent, among the political leaders of the\n country. The gallant campaign he made for\n the nomination of Mr. McKinley in 1896 and\n the generalship he developed at St. Louis,\n when pitted against such able and experi-\n enced leaders as Platt, Quay, Reed and a\n score of others, marked him as a man of\n power and ability. The resistless energy,\n superb strategy and sweeping grasp dis-\n played in the management of the subsequent\n campaign, which resulted in the election of\n McKinley, confirmed the estimate of his ca-\n pacity and compelled the respect of those\n who had sneeringly predicted his failure. Not\n for a day during that hot and protracted\n fight did the situation get beyond Mr. Han-\n na\u2019s control. He never lost his head and very\n rarely his temper \u2014 though at times he en-\n countered perplexities enough to vex a saint.\n He retained the confidence and loyal co-\n operation of his associates on the various\n sub-committees. An indefatigable worker\n and full of confidence himself, he inspired\n everybody about him with like faith and en-\n thusiasm. He divided his time between\n the headquarters at New York and Chicago,\n yet was in constant touch with each by long-\n distance telephone. The campaign was as\n carefully mapped out and executed in every\n detail as the strategic plans of a military\n commander, and the final result was never\n In doubt to Mr. Hanna\u2019s mind, because his\n conclusions were the result of careful cal-\n culations, based upon positive Information,\n as nearly exact as trusted agents under an\n energetic and resourceful leader could ob-\n tain. For example, in one close state, in\n which the situation was unsatisfactory, three\n distinct and complete polls were made inside\n of six weeks. The thoroughness of this cam-\n paign was demonstrated by the fact that the\n majority for McKinley in November in that\n</p>\n<p>\n state was within less than 2,000 of what the\n final polling showed; and that on a vote of\n nearly half a million.\n</p>\n<p>\n About tw\u2019o weeks before the election a\n delegation from one of the supposedly close\n states called on Mr. Hanna at Chicago and\n urged that with a liberal supply of funds and\n a fresh force of speakers their state could be\n carried for the Republican ticket. The\n chairman heard them through and then,\n without hesitation, gave a detailed review of\n the situation in their state, showing that it\n would be impossible to carry it, and that it\n would be folly to undertake it at that hour.\n He advised them to go home and make the\n best fight they could, concluding with the\n statement that the state would go 6,000 for\n Bryan. And it did, and some over.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the Thursday night before the election,\n after reviewing the situation \u25a0with his ad-\n visers at the Chicago headquarters, Mr. Han-\n na made the statement that McKinley and\n Hobart would have 272 votes in the electoral\n college, and that under no circumstances\n would it fall below 270; or 77 more than\n enough to elect. The vote of the Electoral\n College for the Republican candidates w r as\n 271, notwithstanding the loss of one each in\n Kentucky and California. Whether these\n slumps were anticipated is not positively\n known, though the possibility of such a\n thing was seriously considered. Aside from\n this the results show that the calculations\n were carefully and correctly made and safely\n conservative.\n</p>\n<p>\n For two weeks before the election the\n Democrats, including Chairman Jones, were\n claiming Indiana as certain for Bryan. The\n last canvass at Republican headquarters,\n showed the state safe for McKinley and\n hard money by over 16,000. The official\n count was 18,800. These incidents are simply\n given to show that the campaign of 1896 was\n not one of guess work, but conducted on\n business principles, with every detail well\n in hand. It was nearly as possible a case of\n \u201cknowing\u201d instead of \u201cguessing.\u201d\n Indomitable energy, unflinching courage and\n bulldog tenacity, coupled with clear judg-\n ment and keen perception are the character-\n istics of Mark Hanna. He is a good judge\n of men and motives, quick to comprehend a\n situation, prompt to decide and usually cor-\n rect in his conclusions. He is full of re-\n sources and masterful and methodical in his\n ways. He is positive in his opinions and\n blunt and fearless in expressing them, con-\n sequently, though much misrepresented, he\n is rarely misunderstood.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hanna is not a professional states-\n man nor a professional politician, but a busi-\n</p>\n<p>\n ness man \u2014 a man of affairs, who, from force\n of circumstances, has taken to politics, into\n which he has carried business methods and\n business integrity. He conducted the Presi-\n dential campaign of 1896 as he has managed\n fleets, ship building, mining, railroad and\n other industrial enterprises, which have\n brought him distinction and affluence in the\n commercial world.\n</p>\n<p>\n The campaign of 1900 will undoubtedly be\n managed along the same lines, and in all\n probability, with similar results. He expects\n the Republican party to win, as it did in \u201996,\n and the party looks to him again to carry\n its banner to victory. There is lurking dan-\n ger in over-confidence. Of nothing has Mr.\n Hanna a greater dread. He believes in or-\n ganization and work, and is opposed to tak-\n ing anything for granted. He is a stalwart\n in politics as in business, aggressive and\n exacting in his demands, yet conservative\n and conciliating when those qualities are\n advisable.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hanna inherited a strong personality,\n having in his veins the blood of the ster-\n ling Friends of Virginia and the sturdy\n Scotch Presbyterians of Vermont. The result\n is a marked combination of brawn and brain,\n from which were developed the industry, per-\n severance and pluck that characterize the\n man. He was born in Columbiana County,\n Ohio, September 24, 1837, and spent his early\n life there. He was given a fairly good edu-\n cation at the public schools, with two years\n at the Western Reserve College. His train-\n ing, however, was largely along business\n lines, for which his surroundings were fa-\n vorable and his opportunities good. In 1862\n his father removed to Cleveland and em-\n barked in the grocery and provision busi-\n ness as the head of the firm of Hanna, Gar-\n rettson & Co., the son being installed\n as a clerk. In 1862 the father died, and\n Marcus A. Hanna succeeded to his interest\n in the business, which was continued until\n 1867, when it was closed out, and Mr. Hanna\n became a member of the firm of D. P. Rhodes\n & Co., engaged in the iron and coal\n industry. This was the nucleus of the vast\n enterprises with which Mr. Hanna has been\n and is now identified. Ten years later, in\n 1877, the firm name was changed to M. A.\n Hanna & Co., which name it still re-\n tains. From the requirements of his firm\n Mr. Hanna became a vessel owner on the\n lakes, later a ship builder, at the head of\n the Globe Shipbuilding Company. Then fol-\n lowed coal and iron ore developments, with\n street railway and other interests, in all of\n wtich growing and expanding enterprises,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0054/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0054/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0054/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0054/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0054/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0054.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 890005}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"54\">\n<p>\n 52\n</p>\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n covering millions of dollars, the magic touch\n of the master\u2019s hand has been visible.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hanna has always been active in the\n management of his personal affairs, and has\n them so organized and systematized, under\n a force of competent and trusted lieuten-\n ants, that they move without friction,\n guided largely by his quick \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno,\u201d\n relative to matters brought to his attention.\n Aside from his public and political respon-\n sibilities, Mr. Hanna is to-day president of\n the Cleveland City Railway Company, the\n Chapin Iron Ore Company of Michigan, the\n Union National Bank of Cleveland, and of\n coal companies operating in Pennsylvania,\n and is at the head of the Globe Shipbuilding\n Company, and several other smaller corpora-\n tions. With all these extensive and diver-\n sified interests, he still finds some time for\n relaxation.

Yet all these diversified\n interests are run with but little friction. He\n holds the respect of workingmen because he\n treats them with respect. He has their good\n will because he is always fair with them. It\n is very rarely that a strike occurs in any of\n the concerns in which he is actively interest-\n ed. During the great street r-a Broad strike\n in Cleveland a year ago, every effort was\n made by the strikers and their sympathizers,\n and by unscrupulous demagogues, who hoped\n to profit politically thereby, to induce the\n men on his lines to strike, but W.thout avail.\n They claimed that they had no grievance and\n nothing to strike for, and resisted every effort\n to get them out.\n</p>\n<p>\n The same condition existed at the time of\n the coal miners ' strike in Western Pennsyl-\n vania, in 1896-97, and in the Michigan Ore\n Mines \u2014 the Hanna properties being the ' only\n ones at which there was no disturbance of\n work. The attempt to brand him as a \u201cla-\n bor crusher\u201d during the campaign of 1896,\n and again in Ohio, in 18ST, was < ,-pnceived in\n malice, bolstered by falsehood and misrepre-\n sentation, and has fallen to pieces from its\n own rottenness. Its original purpose was to\n destroy his influence as a leader, and weaken\n his party with the wage earners of the coun-\n try. It had some effect at first, but was final-\n ly smothered by the testimony of employes\n themselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hanna has always been a true friend\n of labor, and has probably paid more to\n working men in fair and liberal wages and\n given more for their relief in times of need\n than all his traducers combined. During\n the prostration in the iron industries, several\n years ago, when all the ore mines in the\n Michigan region were shut dow r n and the\n miners and their families were in distress,\n Mr. Hanna\u2019s mine was kept running and\n over 150,000 tons of ore piled up on the docks\n In order to give the men employment and\n support for their families during a severe\n and protracted winter.\n</p>\n<p>\n At another time, some five years ago,\n there was trouble with t & \u00bb men at the ore\n docks at Ashtabula Harbor. The superin-\n tendent brought two large steam hoists and\n shovels from Detroit and Buffalo to do the\n work of unloading vessels. This was con-\n sidered also as a matter of economy, not only\n saving the firm quite a sum in the price per\n ton for loading, but doing the work more\n rapidly. Mr. Hanna, when this matter was\n brought to his attention, ordered the shovels\n nway 89 the ground that the men were\n</p>\n<p>\n brought there to do this work, that many of\n them had families to provide for, and needed\n the wages. These incidents, amply substan-\n tiated, are characteristics and are given to\n show the Senator\u2019s attitude toward his em-\n ployes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hanna is a striking example of the\n man in politics for his friends. Up to the\n time he became a candidate for United States\n Senator, in 1897, he had held only one public\n office. That was Government Director in the\n Union Pacific Railroad Company, to which\n position he was appointed by President\n Cleveland, unsolicited, in 18S5.

A warm friend and advocate of the\n nomination of John Sherman in 1880, he had\n no part in the nomination of General Gar-\n field. After the convention, however, he par-\n ticipated actively in the canvass, and was\n conspicuous in the Business Men\u2019s Associa-\n tion, w r hich became such a prominent factor\n in that memorable contest, when the great\n Grant and Conkling meetings at Warren and\n Cleveland turned the tide of battle.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hanna was at Cincinnati in \u201984, again\n advocating the selection of John Sherman.\n</p>\n<p>\n been from boyhood interested in mining and\n Industrial development of that region, he\n was naturally a protectionist and a Repub-\n lican, and took a lively interest in the suc-\n cess of that party, as did hundreds of other\n business men.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the same part of Ohio in which he vras\n born and has always lived are the homes of\n John Sherman, James A.

The big\n four from Ohio that year were McKinley,\n Foster, Foraker and Hanna. Hanna and Mc-\n Kinley were joint managers from Ohio for\n Sherman. They were the two to whom,\n more than any others, he gave his confi-\n dence. Sherman\u2019s friends worked faithfully\n for his success, but his position was not\n strong enough to effect his nomination, and\n in the end Harrison was made the choice of\n the convention. The preliminary proceed-\n ings of this struggle brought McKinley and\n Hanna together and made them friends. Mc-\n Kinley stood by Sherman, as did Hanna, to\n the end. There were several attempts made\n at this time to stampede the convention for\n McKinley, and several scattering votes were\n cast for him. Finally McKinley, hale of voice\n and with trembling lips, arose in his place\n and put an end to this embryo McKinley\n movement by emphatically denouncing it and\n declaring that he would, under no circum-\n stances, be considered a candidate. During\n all this struggle the keen eye of Mr. Hanna\n was upon Mr. McKinley, and his respect and\n regard for him was welded into living admira-\n tion, that has resulted in his firm friendship\n for the President. There was \u201cformed the\n liking of the unlike\u201d \u2014 that is, an attraction\n greater than that cast of the same metal.\n From that hour Mr. Hanna has been a de-\n voted and unswerving friend of McKinley,\n</p>\n<p>\n and his greatest ambition was to make him\n President. Gerrymandered out of Congress by\n the opposition, McKinley was made the can-\n didate for Governor of Ohio. There were ap-\n prehensions in the Republican ranks that his\n protective policy would hurt, hut the reverse\n was the result. The influence of Mr. Hanna\n in his behalf was full of force and resist-\n less energy, and counted in the triumphs\n which followed.\n</p>\n<p>\n When Senator Foralcer\u2019s friends made the\n contest for Sherman\u2019s seat, Mr. Hanna again\n showed his esteem for Sherman and became\n a prominent factor in that fight, and Sher-\n man won. Hanna, as a peacemaker, after-\n ward extended the hand to Foraker. and the\n latter was made Senator to succeed Brice.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1892 Hanna and McKinley were again\n of the big four from Ohio at the Republican\n National Convention. An attempt was again\n made to stampede the convention for McKin-\n ley as against the nomination of Harrison,\n but it was promptly checkmated.\n</p>\n<p>\n The facts incident to the nomination and\n renomination of President McKinley are too\n well known to require any elaboration. Mr.\n Hanna, as the friend and champion of the\n President, was in the saddle in his behalf,\n and the masses of the party were behind\n him.\n</p>\n<p>\n From his advent into the campaign of 1896,\n Mr. Hanna has been persistently misrepre-\n sented, yet he stands the slander with equa-\n nimity and his resentment is rarely violent.\n He has been the object of abuse by the op-\n position, but when asked at different times to\n answer some of the charges made against him,\n has invariably replied, \u201cOh, they are not\n true. They can\u2019t hurt me. I am not a can-\n</p>\n<p>\n didate.\u201d It is altogether probable but for the\n denunciation and outrageous assaults upon\n his personal character and business and po-\n litical integrity, he would not have been a\n candidate for the United States Senate. He\n felt, and his friends felt, that he was entitled\n to vindication, and step by step his public\n life and his career, as they become better\n known to the people, are proving his vindi-\n cation. It is a mistake to hold or assume\n that Mr. Hanna is wholly and exceptionally\n a man of dollars. He has proved in every\n station that he is a man of ability, wide ver-\n satility and tact. He is devoid of vanity,\n easily accessible and free from the affecta-\n tion of indifference. The idea of the corrupt\n use of money by Mr. Hanna is absurd. Mark\n Hanna is honest and always was. His bus-\n iness integrity has never been impeached, and\n his political character is as clean as his busi-\n ness reputation. Speaking of Mr. Hanna, in\n a recent interview, Senator Jones, chairman\n of the Democratic National Committee, is\n credited with having said: \u201cFor Senator\n Hanna, personally, I have the highest regard,\n but as a Democrat I am bound to abjure him\n as a scoundrel.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n There Is economy in Mr. Hanna ' s ability,\n and the accusation that he is or ever was a\n purchaser of men is a wild freak of imagina-\n tion, worked up by his enemies for political\n effect. Mr. Hanna enters upon the work of\n the present campaign smilingly, and with\n clear-eyed composure. Collected and vigilant\n as the engineer In charge of an ocean steam-\n ship, he is watching every movement of the\n machinery, ready for every emergency and\n fully prepared to meet every exigency that\n may arise. t\n</p>\n<p>\n David Bennett Hill.\n</p>\n<p>\n I*\n</p>\n<p>\n MORE TRAITS THAN PRINCIPLES.\n HIS HIDDEN AND SECRET SELF.\n</p>\n<p>\n W HEN Lawyer Comstock took his seat\n in the State Senate, emerging from\n the obscurity of Lansingburg, and in\n a speech in that body called David B.

Meet-\n ing on their own ground, with their own\n weapons and methods, a group of men of\n proven resources in the arts and tricks of\n politics, he discovered to them a refinement\n of political strategy so superior that they be-\n came the laughing stock of their own party.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is insight into the character of Mr.\n Hill in this.\n</p>\n<p>\n The admirers of Mr. Hill pronounce his\n methods to be these of superlative diplomacy;\n those who have never stood in a warmer at-\n titude to him than that of armed neutrality\n denounce them as undignified expediency; his\n enemies call them peanut politics. Neither\n friends nor foes accurately determine the man\n or his methods. The truth lies away from\n these characterizations. A distinguished edit-\n</p>\n<p>\n or, a keen observer of public men, knowing\n well all who have put themselves above the\n surface between the years of seventy and the\n end of the century, in private conversation,\n said of Hill: \u201cHe is a man of more traits\n than principles.\u201d There is more of truth in\n this than is usually found in epigram^. As a\n rule, something of the completeness of truth\n is conceded to the completeness of phrase,\n but In this one the comprehensiveness of its\n truth grows with its consideration, and its\n power to inform increases with a broadening\n conception of all that may be embraced by\n the word \" traits.\u201d In a study of the traits\n of Mr. Hill will be found a proper estimate\n of the former Governor and former Senator.\n</p>\n<p>\n Strong, vigorous, assertive, aggressive, Mr.\n Hill, as such men always have, has bitter\n enemies. These would deny to him the pos-\n session of intellectual faculties above medi-\n ocrity. Such an estimate will not be accepted\n by him who frankly and honestly studies the\n career of Mr. Hill.

Hill does, is not\n weak in mind nor in character. Some men\n have reached exalted position as much sur-\n prised as was the public to find themselves\n there, but such men have invariably been\n the products of a compromise made necessary\n by the hopeless conflict of contending forces\n of which they were not a part, chosen be-\n cause they were not. Mr. Hill could no more\n be the outcome of a compromise than he could\n be a meek follower of an easy boss. In a\n conflict of forces he must, by the necessities\n of his nature, be in the fore front of the light\n and, by reason of his qualities, somewhere\n near, if not actually in the lead of, one of the\n clashing factions. He has accomplished\n nothing in his career except through force in\n opposition to contending force. It is true that\n the incident of the election of Mr. Cleveland\n to the presidency elevated him into the guber-\n natorial chair, but he fought desperately for\n his nomination in the following autumn and\n that achievement was in spite of the designs\n of the New York Democrats prominent in the\n Federal administration in the year 1885, yet\n in control of the party machinery, who, if\n they were not united on a candidate to sup-\n port, were at least united in a determination\n that Mr. Hill should not be a successor to\n the terms for which Mr. Cleveland was\n chosen.. Such men do not succeed against op-\n position without the possession of strong\n qualities of mind and character. Weaklings\n do not, and Mr. Hill is no weakling. The po-\n sition he had won at the bar of that part of\n the state whence he came into political prom-\n inence attests the possession of intellect,\n and, if the testimony of a brother practitioner\n at the same bar be taken, the traits of char-\n acter which helped him in his uprise later\n were early shown in this part of his career.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" It was anything and all things with Dave\n Hill to get there,\u201d said this lawyer, \" but at\n all events he generally did get there in any\n cause he had in hand.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The former Governor has been popularly\n regarded as an \u201cextra smart\u201d man, and there\n are those yet who deny to him qualities\n higher than smartness. It is an insufficient\n estimate and an unjust one. Smart in the\n sense meant he may be, but he is a man of\n much higher qualification \u2014 one whose mental\n processes are rapid, direct and naturally\n logical, disciplined by training into surety\n of action; his mental grasp is tenacious and\n comprehensive; his mind is keen, penetra-\n tive and analytic, and, moreover, construct-\n ive and synthetic. If not startlingly original,\n it is yet conceptive; while it is invent-\n ive, It is not fanciful, and it is more adroit\n and nimble than imaginative. His brain is\n well stored, well trained and well disciplined.\n This is a mental compound that helps to\n make a man great, but, without certain moral\n and emotional qualities, does not make great-\n ness. When one advances to a consideration\n of these qualities of the former Governor, he\n needs must step with care, for he enters into\n complexities. No one will deny, after study-\n ing his public career, that he is forceful,\n bold, courageous, audacious and aggressive.\n He leads or he does nothing. Yielding with\n him is not submission to the personality of\n a contestant, but to the force and combina-\n tion of circumstances he has failed to sway,\n and his submission is merely the taking of\n time to exchange his lines and to prepare for\n a renewal of the assault. These are fur-\n ther elements of power when added to a\n vigorous mentality, but just here enter in\n others that are invalidating, that have led to\n distrust, to the exciting of doubts, to the\n charge that he is a man of expediencies, ne-\n glectful of the principles that should guide\n</p>\n<p>\n and sway. These are qualities of ductility\n toward those forces of the body politic that\n are doubtful in their morality and purposes,\n possible of emergent use, but of which use in-\n volves a degree of conservation they do not\n deserve nor should have; of sinuosity as to\n those forces which in their nature and high\n character demand consideration and conser-\n vation, though they are in opposition to the\n more popular forces, and a willingness to\n employ an ingenious sophistry to justify\n courses engaged upon. In short, by those\n who have studied him at short range, who\n appreciate his abilities and admire his force\n and courage, he is believed to be firm-\n ly intrenched in those principles that should\n be sustained, not because they are popular,\n but because they are right. It is significant\n that in his executive period this led to a\n lowering, not so much in the morale, as in\n the personnel of administration and not so\n much in the central administration as in that\n of localities.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hill is a partisan. That is what he\n meant when he said on the stage of the\n Academy of Music, in this city, \u201cI am a\n Democrat.\u201d He might have meant that he\n was of the political school of Jefferson; that\n ho was opposed to the aristocracy and be-\n lieved in the rule of the people. He is a be-\n liever in that school, and in his birth and\n training is of the people, believing in the su-\n premacy of the people. A government admin-\n istered by men of the masses, in his eyes,\n would be better than one administered by the\n classes of wealth and aristocracy. He in-\n stinctively opposes the Republican party. Re-\n publican theories. Republican measures, be-\n cause he believes them all to have had their\n first motive in the doctrines of Hamilton,\n who would have made, if he could, this\n country an aristocracy, and he also believes\n that the followers of that statesman\u2019s theo-\n ries are tainted with a tendency toward class.\n But while he believes all this sincerely, and\n it could all be embraced under his vigorous\n affirmation, what he meant when he made\n it yvas, that he was a partisan. And partisan\n he is. To him a party ts superior to Its\n principles, and with the party he would be\n when principles went into retirement. His\n course as an official, to be accurately judged,\n must be viewed in this light. He is not bo\n different from other men w\u2019ho are leaders\n and representatives of their parties as to\n make the statement surprising. The only dif-\n ference is, that while he is courageous\n enough, audacious enough, aggressive enough\n boldly to assert it, the others, when parties\n and principles part, find, or seek to find, a\n straddle, by which they can appear to adhere\n to the one, while they really follow the other.\n When he had determined on the utterance of\n the phrase, he had measured its effect, had\n discounted the disapprobation and, after ut-\n terance, rejoiced in the increased favor he\n knew he would have from those who are\n Democrats rather by instinct than reason,\n and who delight in a trademark. Just when,\n in his case, adherence to party organization\n took the place of adherence to principle, per-\n haps he would be troubled to determine, but\n it probably was when he first began to feel\n his power for organization and leadership\n and saw his career before him. Nor must\n this characterization be misunderstood. Mr.\n Hill, having the influence or the power, would\n not fail to exert it to keep his party within\n the lines of Its fixed and stated principles.\n This he has shown, but if in despite of his\n best efforts the party departed on deviations,\n he would not do that last thing \u2014 which the\n fear of the doing by men of influence often\n is a restraining force\u2014 separate from it. It\n</p>\n<p>\n is here that the subject of this sketch, while\n having many of the elements of greatness,\n fails to be great \u2014 as Blaine failed and ' Wash-\n ington did not. He does not measure up to\n that standard of rigid moral principle with-\n out which no man ever is truly great.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the first article of this series the point\n was made that Mr. Cleveland, the trustee of\n the people, was differentiated from Mr. Cleve-\n land, the man, and that the trustee in his ad-\n ministration ruthlessly put aside the man, his\n desires and the claims on him and his friend-\n ships. Mr. Hill does not look out on the\n world of politics and official administration in\n the same way. To him parties are arms of\n government. He who labors well, diligently\n and efficiently within the ranks of the party\n deserves, in his judgment, well of the party,\n and, when that party triumphs, deserves the\n offices and honors of government as rewards.\n Nor does he separate the gratitude of a lead-\n ing beneficiary for service rendered from the\n gratitude of party or government. There is a\n notable instance of this in the case of Judge\n Parker, now head of the Court of Appeals.\n When Mr. Hill was nominated for governor in\n 1885 there was trouble at the outset of the\n campaign. The County Democracy, then a\n power, was sullen, dissatisfied with the nomi-\n nation and the outcome of the convention.\n Its leader had expected to succeed Mr. Man-\n ning as leader in the state and chairman of\n the central committee. It had expected to see\n one of its own body, either Edward Cooper or\n Abram S. Hewitt, preferably the former, made\n the candidate. There was influence sufficient\n in the hands of those w ' ho, though officially in\n Washington, had not yet laid down the reins\n of power, but their activity was hampered\n by the stand of the President, Cleveland, who\n assumed an attitude that seemed to be con-\n tradictory, but which was yet characteristic.\n In his judgment, the candidate ought to be\n William R. Grace, but he would not permit\n himself to use his influence to that end and\n opposed the exertion of influence on the part\n of Cabinet officials for any one, on the ground\n of the impropriety of the federal administra-\n tion interfering in the politics of an individual\n state. This attitude was paralyzing to a com-\n bination of influences that might have defeat-\n ed Hill, could it have been gotten into united\n action. One point for Hill in Washington was\n Lamont, who expressed the opinion to Robert\n A. Maxwell, the state treasurer, that Hill was\n the natural candidate. That active and ener-\n getic gentleman accepted this opinion as the\n policy of the administration, and, hurrying\n back to New York, exercised such activity as\n to persuade a hundred reluctant delegates to\n Hill and thus to earn the latter\u2019s confidence\n and gratitude. Hill slipped in through deft\n manipulation, misapprehension and the par-\n alyzation of opposing forces.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then came the stunning blow T of Roswell P.\n Flower\u2019s refusal to accept the nomination for\n lieutenant governor. It was bad enough to\n realize the sullen attitude of the faction in\n New York and the old guard of Tildenism,\n but on top of this came the other disaster.\n Consternation was the result; disaster at the\n polls W ' as confidently predioted. It looked as\n if the campaign had fallen down before it had\n begun. The work of organization became dif-\n ficult. Men refused one after the other to\n take the responsible charge of a losing cam-\n paign. In this juncture Maxwell suggested\n Mr. Parker, then surrogate of Ulster County,\n unknov/n to Hill, and unknown to the State\n Democracy, as one having the capacity if he\n had the willingness to accept the executive\n head. Maxwell was dispatched to persuade\n Payker to the work and to arrange a meeting\n with the candidate. Mr. Parker accepted and\n his conduct at the campaign was brilliant.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0057/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 345, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 493}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0057/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 691, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 987}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0057/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1383, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1975}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0057/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2767, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3950}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0057/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0057.jp2", "height": 3950, "width": 2767, "levels": 6, "size": 917612}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"57\">\n<p>\n STUDIES IX AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n 56\n</p>\n<p>\n unselfish and self sacrificing. What had be-\n gun in disaster ended in triumphant success.\n Mr. Parker won the admiration of his party\n and the gratitude of the successful candidate.\n From that time Mr. Hill made the fortunes of.\n Mr. Parker his concern. The ambitions of\n the latter lay in a judicial career. When a\n vacancy occurred in the judicial district of\n w ' hich Ulster is a part Governor Hill was po-\n tential in lifting Mr. Parker to the Supreme\n Court bench. When a second part of the\n Court of Appeals was instituted by appoint-\n ment of the Governor, from among Supreme\n Court justices Parker was selected by Gov-\n ernor Hill. When a vacancy occurred in the\n</p>\n<p>\n conceded that he invariably led his party to\n victory. While he was always advocating or-\n ganization, a strict and forceful organization,\n yet he did not wholly rely on it. He was too\n intellectual a man not to know and duly ap-\n preciate the value of issues, and every cam-\n paign he supplied them. Since the time of\n Tilden\u2019s domination Mr. Hill has been the\n only leader in the state who has been an is-\n sue maker. Those who deprived him of lead-\n ership abondoned issues, relied on organiza-\n tion and went to continuous defeat. It is said\n that Mr. Hill is in the saddle again. If he\n Is and is unhampered, there will be an issue\n in the campaign, and an aggressive one that\n</p>\n<p>\n DAVID BENNETT HILL.\n</p>\n<p>\n chief judgeship of the Court of Appeals Sen-\n ator Hill never ceased his labors until he saw\n Judge Parker the nominee and personally di-\n rected the campaign that ended with such\n a brilliant victory. This is a trait of David\n B. Hill. For his services in that campaign of\n 1885, Robert A. Maxwell was appointed super-\n intendent of insurance by Governor Hill.\n</p>\n<p>\n An orderly division of consideration would\n have been David B. Hill the official and David\n B. Hill the politician, but his rise to leader-\n ship was coeval with his elevation to the gu-\n bernatorial chair, and after that where the\n one began and the other ended it was difficult\n to determine. That is one of the charges\n against him. As a leader he was one who\n required obedience rather than counsel, was\n arbitrary, as he confessed once in conversa-\n tion, and always self-reliant. During his ad-\n mitted and undisturbed leadership it must be\n</p>\n<p>\n will be vexatious to his opponents. It may\n not be successful, but it will be obstructive.\n</p>\n<p>\n The foregoing is drawn from his public\n career, open to all men who will observe.\n For eighteen years Mr. Hill has been con-\n spicuously before a large public, and he is\n yet a man misunderstood and misappre-\n hended. Personally he is not the man he is\n believed to be. The prevailing opinion is\n that he is cold, austere, selfish and self-iso-\n lated. It is erroneous. He is warm in his\n affections, genial in his chosen associations,\n generous and self-sacrificing with his friends\n and fond of company, especially of that of\n young men. This is so, contrary to the\n general belief that incredulous surprise, even\n from those who think they know Mr. Hill,\n may be expected. The confidence of the\n former Senator is not readily gained, and\n until it is, it is the public Mr. Hill only who\n</p>\n<p>\n is seen, the man who wears a mask and is\n never betrayed into revealing his real self.\n Some men, even those who call themselves\n friends, even lieutenants, have never seen\n him without it. But once that difficult thing\n to achieve is gained \u2014 his confidence \u2014 there is\n something childlike in the way the strong\n man yields himself up to it. Once the late\n Frank Mayo, the actor, visiting a friend\n holding official position in the Capitol, ex-\n pressed the desire to call upon the Governor,\n his curiosity as to the man having been ex-\n cited by reading of him. The friend had the\n entree to the executive chamber, and took\n Mr. Mayo with him. At the moment of en-\n trance a visitor engaged the attention of the\n Governor, and the executive sat at his desk\n solemn, severe and inexplicable. When this\n visitor was dismissed the Governor nodded\n to Mayo\u2019s friend to come forward. His mask\n was on, his face inscrutable. He was the\n personification of coolness and austerity. He\n was prepared for assault. When the actor\n was presented and he saw in his visitor an\n artist who had no concern with politics, gov-\n ernment or gubernatorial functions, the mask\n dropped from his face and he abandoned him-\n self to a half hour of social enjoyment, in\n which only the inner Hill was seen, with all\n the ardor of unrestrained youth, bubbling\n over with joke and wit and anecdote.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThat man, cold, austere,\u201d cried Mayo after\n he had left the executive presence. \u201cWhy\n is he called so? He is the very essence of\n geniality.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Hill has been known to sit in his residence\n surrounded by the young men he was fond\n of gathering about him, fairly reveling in\n their youthful spirits, when, a caller being an-\n nounced, immediately the mask would go up;\n the inner Hill retired and the public Hill\n appeared. The change was instantaneous and\n was a complete transformation. A few young\n men, very young men, some of whom were\n proteges of Hill, camped out on an island in\n Lake George one summer, when Governor\n Hill came to the lake for a few days\u2019 vaca-\n tion. His youthful friends besought him to\n visit their camp. He did so, remaining with\n them two days. Were any one to say to these\n young men that Mr. Hill was cold, forbidding\n and austere the answer would be vigorous\n and emphatic, for they reported that from the\n moment of his arrival to his departure it was\n one roll of fun, in which the usually sedate\n Governor w\u2019as the leader, and when nothing\n better afforded they sat by the camp fire and\n listened to the Governor reel off story after\n story that kept them in convulsions of\n laughter and astonished them with his pow-\n ers of mimicry. Few of those intimately as-\n sociated in affairs have ever seen him in such\n a guise. Many have felt his biting humor\n when they have excited it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Not less surprising will It be to some to\n learn that Mr. Hill is a student. First, he fes\n learned in the law; that is his profession.\n Second, in the history of government, of poli-\n tics and of social economy; that is his avo-\n cation. Third, in the lighter forms of litera-\n ture he is well read. Little of this show ' s in\n his speeches or public addresses, but when he\n reached the United States Senate debate dis-\n covered his stock of information to be precise\n and accurate and he soon gained a respect\n for his statement as great as it was for his\n powers in debate. In which he was considered\n no mean antagonist.\n</p>\n<p>\n Whether it be merited or not in a public\n man, it is a fact that friendship means much\n to Mr. Hill. Perhaps few ' men have been\n quite so unfortunate in his friends as he has\n been and he has constantly been called on to\n sacrifice a great deal in money and reput*-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0058/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0058/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0058/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0058/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0058/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0058.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 727502}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"58\">\n<p>\n 50\n</p>\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n tion for friends and yet none has ever heard\n him murmur under his burden.

Tilden, once said: \u201cYes, he\u2019s an honest\n man because he has the intelligence to know\n that honesty pays in the long run.\u201d Another\n person paraphrased this saying: \u201cHill is hon-\n est because he doesn\u2019t care for money; if he\n</p>\n<p>\n has enough to pay his bills he doesn\u2019t care\n whether there is any more; he has no temp-\n tation to be dishonest.\u201d In a degree this is\n true. Hill was far from being a rich man\n when he reached Albany. It is doubtful if he\n has much more now. While his life is mod-\n erate his funds are at the disposal of those\n to whom he gives his friendship. His life\n is simple. He neither drinks nor smokes nor\n finds pleasure in the delights of the table.\n He has no dissipations; his single passion is\n politics, and base ball; the theater and his li-\n brary are his recreations.\n</p>\n<p>\n A singular man; a set of contradictions; one\n who shows one side of himself to the world\n and keeps another for his few Intimates, who\n is at the mercy of his few friends and does\n not hesitate to sacrifice a devoted adherent\n to a political end. Without magnetism, by\n the sheer force of his intellectuality he has\n achieved great honors, justifying a place in\n this gallery.\n</p>\n<p>\n Daniel\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n A MAN OF AFFAIRS, PURELY AND SIMPLY : : : : :\n ACTION PERSONIFIED, AS OPPOSED TO PHILOSOPHY.\n</p>\n<p>\n T HE possibilities of the American citizen\n are illustrated in the career of Daniel\n Scott Lamont. Neither wealth nor\n distinction was his heritage. His parents\n were farmer folk, held in esteem in their\n community, intelligently doing their duty\n within their sphere. When, in his boy-\n hood, he looked out on his horizon it\n was not rosy with the promise of influence,\n nor gilded with assurances of the aids of\n power. The potentialities were all within\n himself. The heights of power and influence\n he has reached in the forty-nine years of his\n life, and the distinction he has attained and\n enjoys are in strong contrast with the mod-\n esty of his beginnings. There are lessons to\n American youth in the career of Colonel La-\n mont, as he is widely known to-day.\n</p>\n<p>\n Born in Cortland County in this state, of\n Scotch-Irish stock, his traits of character are\n those of the stock from whence he sprang.\n His boyhood life was not different from the\n lives of other boys born on a farm save in\n this, that his delicate constitution and- per-\n haps general health bred a large doubt as to\n his fitness for the rugged life of a farmer and\n insensibly turned the minds of his parents\n and that of the lad toward avocations whereof\n exhausting physical toll was not a part. How-\n much a slight frame and little promise of\n rugged health and strength had to do with\n setting t # he feet of the lad on the path he has\n followed with success must, ' perhaps, remain\n a speculation. It is probable that while no\n definite determination was ever reached in-\n family council the conclusion that ihe lad was\n little fitted for a farmer\u2019s life influenced the\n Barents in the purpose of equipping the son\n</p>\n<p>\n with an education fitting him for functions ly-\n ing far away from the cultivation of the soil.\n So, when the resources of the common school\n of his district were exhausted, he became a\n student in the academy of a near by town,\n where higher branches were taught. And\n here he was fitted for his matricula-\n tion at Union College, in Schenectady,\n which he entered at an unusually early\n age. Mr. Lamont was not then, nor indeed is\n he now, an impressive looking person. Less\n than the average size, so slight in frame as\n to appear frail, it will be seen that he had\n not even those advantages of person that un-\n questionably aid youth in the beginuiug of\n their ascending steps. But back of this ap-\n parent fraility was a clear mind, resolute in\n its purpose, a dogged determination and per-\n sistency, a power of concentration of all the\n energies possessed on a given end, shrewd-\n ness, penetration, sound judgment, profound\n common sense and thriftiness. If these qual-\n ities did not make a notable student and a\n brilliant scholar they certainly did give him\n a place in his class which, if not among the\n honor places, was yet so close as to be em-\n inently respectable.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was in entering upon college life that Mr.\n Lamont\u2019s first real struggle in life began.\n What aid from home he had hitherto re-\n ceived ended when he entered Union. The\n problem was presented to the young man oi\n how to support himself and pay his college\n expenses while pursuing his course. The\n manner of its solution seems to have fixed his\n course in life.\n</p>\n<p>\n He had been in college some two years\n when in January he addressed a letter to\n</p>\n<p>\n John T. Hoffman, then Governor of the state,\n setting forth his condition, the necessity of\n employment for an income to continue his\n studies, and asking for such employment\n abov, the incoming Legislature. Perhaps in\n these years, profound politician as he sub-\n sequently became, familiar with all the in-\n tricacies of political machinery and drifts\n and currents of influence about it, he would\n laugh if he thought of the innocence of hi3\n first efforts to break into the charmed circle.\n But the letter, among the hundreds pouring\n in on the executive desk, arrested the at-\n tention of the Governor. Perhaps it was\n the pathos in the youthful cry for help, per-\n haps it was sympathy excited in the Govern-\n or for a struggling youth that led that high\n functionary to comply. He has said that he\n was struck by the extraordinary character of\n the penmanship. The theory that, in the\n characteristics of the chirography the char-\n asteristics of the man may be read receives\n some support in the case of Colonel Lamont\n and some denials. However, according to\n Governor Hoffman, it was sufficient to at-\n tract his attention and enlist his interest.\n He handed it over to Armstrong, the clerk\n of the Assembly, asking him to inquire into\n the young man and the inquiries being satis-\n factory to employ him. The result was that\n the young Lamont was installed in the en-\n grossing room as an engrossing clerk and\n his entrance into the political world was\n made. His feet were set on the path which\n was to lead him to distinction and success\n in life. He was net yet 19 when his ap-\n pointment was made.\n</p>\n<p>\n The winter and spring of 1870 were educa-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0059/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 345, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 493}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0059/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 691, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 987}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0059/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1383, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1975}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0059/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2767, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3950}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0059/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0059.jp2", "height": 3950, "width": 2767, "levels": 6, "size": 901209}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"59\">\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n 57\n</p>\n<p>\n tional to the young aspirant of reserved\n habits, contemplative moods and penetrative\n eyes. Evidently he studied the motions and\n parts of the political machine, the opera-\n tions of which were in such evidence in\n Albany. When he came up the next year\n for the session of 1871 he was supported by\n the requests and indorsements of the Demo-\n cratic organization of his home county and\n his appointment this time was the more im-\n portant one of assistant journal clerk of the\n Assembly.\n</p>\n<p>\n These times were momentous. When the\n youthful Lamont entered politics Tammany\n</p>\n<p>\n of frauds in the counting of votes. But Tweed\n and his co-thieves were in high glee, believ-\n ing they were in for another long lease of\n power and plunder. The next year the storm\n gathered, the dark clouds rolled up and Til-\n den loomed up a gigantic figure of reform.\n That year of 1871, an effort, in the war within\n the party against Tweed and Tweedism, was\n made by the reform element of the Demo-\n crats to send some of its more conspicuous\n representatives into the Assembly. Tilden\n was chosen and, if memory be not playing\n tricks, Francis Kernan from Utica, while\n Horatio Seymour ran and was defeated in\n</p>\n<p>\n (Photo by Bell, Washington.)\n</p>\n<p>\n DANIEL SCOTT LAMONT.\n</p>\n<p>\n then, as it seeks to do now, dominated the\n Democratic party. Bill Tweed was the pow-\n erful political figure in Democratic poli-\n tics, just as Dick Croker seeks to be now.\n The carnival of political crime was at its\n climacteric point. The year of young La-\n ment\u2019s entrance saw the last political tri-\n umph at the polls of the Tweed hordes. The\n ticket dictated to the Democratic state con-\n vention, with Governor Hoffman at its head\n for re-election, was chosen at the ballot\n box, but the air was full of charges of cor-\n rupt practices, of the reckless use of money.\n</p>\n<p>\n New York City. This year saw the first ad-\n vent of David B. Hill into state affairs, for\n he came up to the Assembly as a member\n from Chemung. Of this Assembly young\n Lamont, then of age, was again the assist-\n ant journal clerk, modest, secretive, reserved,\n clear-eyed, clear-brained and efficient. In\n this Assembly he attracted the attention of\n Tilden, that superb judge of men and of in-\n struments. He cultivated the young clerk and\n attracted him to himself. His penetrating\n eye discovered the qualities of the clerk\n who made no parade of himself but who had\n</p>\n<p>\n the capacity to rise to the level of every de-\n mand made on him. It was in this Assembly,\n too, that Tilden came first to know David\n B. Hill and measured his qualities, for he\n said of him, \u201cWatch that young man; you\n will hear of him in the future; he will rise.\u201d\n Then he gathered him into the band of young\n men from all parts of the state he was or-\n ganizing \u2014 that band which later was dubbed\n by the opposing faction \" nincompoops.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n That year of 1872 the storm burst in all its\n fury on the heads of Tweed and his horde.\n He was driven from power to be a fugitive\n from justice. Tilden mounted into supreme\n power in the state and Lamont became a con-\n fidential agent, one of his chief aids. An al-\n liance was cemented that had a molding\n influence on the young man. In the reor-\n ganization of the party machinery Tilden be-\n came the chairman of the State Central Com-\n mittee, Daniel Manning secretary, and Dan-\n iel Scott Lamont clerk of it. The latter\u2019s po-\n litical education began in earnest, for he was\n a pupil under the guidance and instruction\n of Tilden, that great, supreme master of the\n art of politics of modern times, trusted a\u00bb\n that astute, cautious, even suspicious old\n master trusted few, the medium of com-\n munication between the outlying posts of that\n great army the leader had built up in the\n state. In 1874 Tilden was elected Governor;\n in 1875 John Bigelow was chosen Sec-\n retary of State, and Lamont became\n chief clerk of that department, but\n still he was clerk of the state com-\n mittee, still the trusted servant of Tilden,\n still his confidential messenger. Two years\n later in a revolt against Tilden, Bigelow was\n deposed and Lamont went out of office, when\n Daniel Manning, who, in the meantime, had\n come to the control of the Albany Argus, of-\n fered the young man a place on the editorial\n corps of that paper, which, accepting, he oc-\n cupied for the ensuing five years. Still he\n continued to be clerk of the state committee,\n even when Manning was chosen chairman and\n became state leader in the retirement of Til-\n den. In this long service of clerk, the actual\n executant of the policies the party adopted,\n Mr. Lamont grew to a large influence in the\n state and an acquaintance not only with all\n the men of the parties prominent in their af-\n fairs, but with the political conditions exist-\n ing in each civil division of the state, and\n accumulating an acquaintance with the citi-\n zens of the state such as no man of the pres-\n ent day has attained.\n</p>\n<p>\n This was his condition when Mr. Cleve-\n land was elected Governor. Mr. Cleveland\n was a comparatively unknown man without\n his city of Buffalo and his nomination was\n due rather to the intensity of the contest be-\n tween General Slocum and Mr. Flower than\n to any individual strength he possessed in the\n state. Nor was it only that he was unknown;\n he was unknowing. His acquaintance with\n the active men of the state of the day was\n small, a fact which, after his election and he\n faced the responsibilities of office, gave him-\n self and friends much trouble and apprehen-\n sion. The campaign preceding the election,\n on the Democratic side, practically had been\n conducted by Mr. Lamont. Mr. Bissell, sub-\n sequently Postmaster General, was Mr. Cleve-\n land\u2019s representative at the state headquar-\n ters and had been greatly impressed with the\n ability and organizing capacity of Mr. La-\n mont, but more particularly with his wide\n acquaintance with men and things of the\n state. He returned to Buffalo strong in the\n idea that Mr. Cleveland should attach Mr.\n Lamont to himself in a clos% (confidential\n capacity, in order that the 01*1?

How he became a staff of\n strength and a rod of reliance to the Gov-\n ernor is known of all men familiar with the\n executive chamber of that day. How the\n newly elected President insisted that Mr. La-\n mont should accompany him to Washington,\n against the latter\u2019s wish and plan, is also\n well known. And how after an interregnum\n of four years Mr. Cleveland insisted on his\n taking the portfolio of the War Department is\n recent history.\n</p>\n<p>\n This makes the public record of the man.\n His public career is ended, if he is permitted\n to follow his own plans and inclinations.\n From time to time his name crops up for\n this position and that dignity, but against\n his wish. In the recent Democratic en-\n tanglement his name was presented as\n an available gubernatorial candidate.\n What the movement in this direction\n would have grown to unchecked, it Is\n idle to speculate, but in the most positive\n and emphatic way he could employ Mr.\n Lamont took all the means and steps to\n stamp it out. When he left the White House\n as the secretary of the President in 1889\n he looked upon his political career as closed.\n He was 38 years old. He had been active\n in politico and public office for nineteen\n years, and it had brought him nothing but\n a living, fame and notoriety for which he\n cared little, and the consciousness of duty\n well done. About him was growing a fam-\n ily of his own bringing up and upon him\n had devolved the care of those who had\n cared for him in his youth. He had ac-\n cumulated nothing against that rainy day\n which always comes to those unprovided\n with the financial umbrella. Leaving Wash-\n ington he associated himself with that syn-\n dicate of capitalists who saw in the con-\n solidation of the street railways of New\n York City into one great system a means\n to great wealth. To that interest he de-\n voted himself for the following four years.\n The syndicate of which he was the represen-\n tative, indeed the voice, was one of almost\n limitless capital and resources, and was\n in many fields other than the street railway\n transportation of New York. In this new\n relation that great organizing faculty and\n executive capacity which had been so abun-\n dantly show\u2019n in political party management\n and in public office were conspicuously made\n manifest again, even in a higher degree.\n In the many and great enterprises that\n this enormous syndicate engaged upon Mr.\n Lamont bore not a conspicuous part, f. < r\n he never works conspicuously, but the la-\n boring one, and he rapidly advanced to\n competence, even wealth. In this relation\n he remained until, the country having re-\n turned his old chief to the presidency again,\n he was summoned to the Cabinet of Mr.\n Cleveland ' s second term.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Lamont returned to Washington and\n political turmoil reluctantly. This is set\n down advisedly. As he said to a friend, he\n was making more money each -year than at\n the outset of his career, even at the close\n of his public life in 1889, he had ever hoped\n to have, and it seemed to him that duty to\n his family and his obligations demanded that\n he should gather his crops while harvest\n was so promising. The pressure on him,\n however, was of a nature he could not\n resist, and yielding, became Secretary of\n War, once more in the harness of public\n ttfe. Four years of this life and he was\n</p>\n<p>\n once more free to go back to the world of\n lijrge private enterprises. But he did not go\n back to the old relations. His abilities as\n financier and executant had been impressed\n on the world of finance and commerce. The\n Northern Pacific Railroad Company claim-\n ed his services, and he became what he is\n to-day, the vice president of that company,\n with his offices in New York, in charge of\n its Eastern affairs, which is to say, in prac-\n tical charge of its finances.\n</p>\n<p>\n This record, in its various details, sketches\n in a certain degree the manner of man he is.\n In the lines he has followed, the places he\n has occupied and the duties he has discharged,\n it follows that he is a man of large abilities.\n These abilities are, however, not at all of\n the showy or brilliant order. Eloquence is\n not one of his gifts. It is manifest neither\n in pronounced orations, nor in conversation.\n No one, during his thirty years of public life,\n has ever heard of Colonel Lamont making a\n set speech, and it is doubtful if ever in his\n whole life he has detained an audience, how-\n ever small, for five minutes. Yet in affairs\n he has the faculty of clear statement of a\n matter, which shows that he has thoroughly\n exhausted it on all sides in consideration and\n from this statement all the non-essentials\n have been rigidly excluded. The great qual-\n ity of the man is his profound common sense\n and almost as great, if not equal to this qual-\n ity, is his excellent judgment, which seems\n unerring. He is a conservative in habit and\n thought \u2014 so much so that he has been called\n cautious and timid. This is a great mistake,\n for when he has reached his conclusions, and\n his mental processes are by no means slow,\n and he has determined on the course to pur-\n sue, Tie is both bold and aggressive. He has\n tbgt mental and moral courage which enables\n him, when he has determined, to put fortune\n to the test and the trial, not letting \" I dare\n not wait on I would.\u201d He is tenacious of his\n opinions, and though circumstances and op-\n posing forces may compel him to forego their\n execution, yet it will be found in the end that\n he has not changed them. In this he is as\n constant as he is in other things. His rea-\n soning faculties are large, but those of argu-\n mentation small. He gives the results, not\n the processes by which he reaches them. No\n one could be less of a controversialist than he\n is. He will give you his conclusions on a\n given matter and his reasons for them; if\n they are opposed he does not go to combat,\n but contents himself with reiteration, believ-\n ing that his reasons should carry by reason\n of their truth.\n</p>\n<p>\n If aggressive in action, he Is not pugna-\n cious. If he is not fond of contest, he does\n not yield a point determined on until he is\n fairly beaten off, and he likes not to fight in\n the open. His favorite methods are not those\n of the open field, but rather of the still hunt,\n fiat invention of his great master in the craft\n of politics. All this is to say that he is diplo-\n matic and tactful; would rather cajole than\n contest; would persuade rather than force;\n but when his favorite methods fail, he can\n with vigor enter the fight and bear himself\n bravely.\n</p>\n<p>\n The comments preceding, if accepted, will\n show that he is a man of not a great imag-\n ination, nor of great originating faculty. His\n tendency is to deal with things as they are\n presented to him and use the materials at his\n hands, neither seeking for others, nor new\n ways. He is no* inventive, yet he is a re-\n sourceful enemy, and the same as an ally.\n Eminently practical must be the judgment\n as to the cast of his mind. He is, moreover,\n secretive in his habit of mind, as well as in\n ! his methods. Reserved in his communica-\n</p>\n<p>\n tions, when he abandons his reserve it\n can - be assumed that he is most strongly\n moved. His sense of honor is not small, but\n he is not given to its expression.\n</p>\n<p>\n He is true to his friends. This may be com-\n bated by some, but the adjustment between\n the statement and the dispute will be found\n in that Lamont is slow in taking on friend-\n ship and that in all his associates and allies\n he does not see friends. He is true to his\n word; he rarely gives it, evades the giving,\n but given, it is sacred. Fidelity to those in\n whose service he has enlisted is a marked\n characteristic and has been in great meas-\n ure potent in his uprise. He was faithful\n to Tilden so long as that great man needed\n or demanded his service; he was faithful\n to Manning until death, and his devotion to\n Cleveland is a matter of history. With this\n travels in him a lively sense of gratitude.\n This, too, is a statement that may be disputed\n but the adjustment will be found in this,\n that Mr. Lamont has a very clear notion of\n all the motives lying back of service and\n great power of distinction. He is a superb\n judge of men, with a faculty for the selection\n of instruments and agents amounting almost\n to genius. And with his diplomacy, his tact\n and his power of impressing those about him\n with the accuracy of his views and a quality\n that draws to him the unquestioning service of\n men under him, he is a leader and a master.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is little of the philosophic in his\n make up, but rather he is a man of action.\n His place is at the executive desk rather than\n in the forum or in the deliberative assem-\n blage. In council he is strong; particu-\n larly in laying his fingers on the weaknesses\n cf statements made. In execution he is\n .prompt and strong. Hopeful in his tempera-\n ment, he is not sanguine. His disposition is\n to underestimate the strength of his cause\n and overestimate that of his opponent, but\n that disposition does not prevent him from\n building until he makes his cause stronger.\n</p>\n<p>\n This peculiarity of temperament made Mr.\n Cleveland the President-elect in 1884. When\n the returns on that election day of that year\n were received it was early manifest that all\n depended on New York State. As that state\n should cast it3 vote so would the national\n election be decided. At the executive man-\n sion in Albany those concerned in the man-\n agement of Mr. Cleveland\u2019s campaign and\n many friends were gathered to hear the re-\n bult. The earlier returns seemed to be\n abundantly in favor of Mr. Cleveland and\n everybody was in high glee except Lamont.\n He was looking solemn and absorbed, gnaw-\n ing at his mustache and examining and re-\n examining the figures as they came in. Tele-\n grams of congratulation began to pour in\n from prominent people and these, with every\n manifestation of annoyance, Lamont tossed\n aside. Finally, he exclaimed: \u201cIf this thing\n keeps up, they\u2019ll beat Cleveland.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Then came a change in the figures. The\n apparently comfortable majority of twenty\n thousand ran down to ten, then to five and\n there everybody nailed it fast as if certain.\n Every one but Lamont was happy. True, the\n majority was not so large as had been hoped\n for, but, like Mercutio\u2019s wound, it would do.\n Lamont said to one present: \u201cThis majority\n is running down so fast that it will be run\n cut if we do not prevent it.

Its occu-\n pants are elected for a short term, and in\n cases where important national policies are\n undertaken by an administration, the time is\n too limited for the full test of their wisdom\n and the complete recognition of their value\n desired by those who have at heart the in-\n terests of the country. But, in even so short\n a time as four years, there may be crowded\n the solution of problems so momentous as\n not only to call for the critical Judgment and\n dispassionate estimate of our citizens, but to\n engage the attention of the civilized world.\n</p>\n<p>\n The administration of William McKinley\n has been one of the most Important in the\n life of the republic. Taking office in a time\n of general industrial depression, with the\n vexed questions of finance and tariff still un-\n der discussion and pressing for settlement,\n his assumption of his new duties was cause\n for anxiety on the part of those who had op-\n posed the doctrines of the Republican party,\n and for the most sincere congratulations and\n enthusiastic hopefulness from his political\n associates and from those who, casting aside\n party ties, had supported thecandidate standing\n for sound money and a protective tariff. Men\n often become great by embracing an oppor-\n tunity presented for accomplishing beneficent\n results for a people. Opportunity and respon-\n sibility will draw out the best that is in a\n man if his character and preparation are of\n the right kind. Our great men have come\n from the people, and have been equal to great\n emergencies. American history is full of\n such examples. The highest places In the re-\n puollc have been sought and won by those\n whose beginnings were the lowliest, and in\n times of national emergency the people have,\n with unerring Judgment, made wise selec-\n tions for their public servants. Following\n the Civil War came the days of reconstruc-\n tion. Troublesome questions which are yet\n with us were then the cause of bitterness and\n</p>\n<p>\n discontent, but for several administrations\n the problems confronting the government of\n the United States were largely those of do-\n mestic affairs and did not call for wide ac-\n quaintance with international conditions, nor\n did they enlarge the field of statesmanship,\n as in the time of President Cleveland and his\n successor. International questions, like the\n adjustment of Samoan affairs, and now and\n then insistence upon redress for an American\n citizen maltreated or injured in his property\n rights, called for little more than the ordi-\n nary routine of international intercourse.\n During the latter part of Mr. Cleveland\u2019s\n second administration, however, the threat-\n ening conditions in the Island of Cuba gave\n intimation that the country would have to\n meet, at no distant date, questions designed\n to bring it into the arena of world politics,\n and requiring the attention of its ablest\n statesmen. The United States has been, since\n its foundation, a liberty loving nation. It\n was knit together more firmly as such by the\n great fraternal struggle of the 60s, and when\n the terrible four years\u2019 experience had passed\n the spirit of liberty emerged brighter and\n steadier, to become more and more the spirit\n of the nation.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was not of our seeking that through ab-\n horrence of conditions in Cuba we entered\n upon the conflict with Spain. During the\n latter part of Mr. Cleveland\u2019s administration\n he properly exerted every honorable resource\n to prevent war. His able Secretary of State\n seconded him in this patriotic American pol-\n icy. But events, crowding one another rapid-\n ly, bade fair time and time again to sweep\n aside the conservatism with which the ques-\n tion was handled. This condition of great\n unrest and danger confronted William Mc-\n Kinley when he assumed the Presidency on\n March 4, 1897. From the day he entered the\n White House he saw that it would take all\n the resources of the government to prevent\n war with Spain, and while he employed\n every resort of diplomacy and w ' as frequently\n</p>\n<p>\n encouraged to hope that a peaceful solution\n of the problem would be found, the increas-\n ing difficulties experienced by Spain In Cuba\n brought the crisis constantly nearer. Pub-\n lic clamor breaks out unthinkingly at such\n times. It is not that the people are at heart\n unreasonable, for they are not. But they are\n generous in their sympathies, they are\n touched to the quick by needless suffering,\n by cruel oppression, by pillage, outrage and\n murder, and with the contrast between their\n own happy conditions and the unfortunate\n plight of their near neighbors constantly be-\n fore them, it was not strange that the cry\n grew louder that a stop must be put to the\n warfare in Cuba and that the simple justice\n which the people of that island sought from\n their mother country must be speedily ac-\n corded to them or that to them must be given\n in some form the freedom for which in the\n past they had so frequently fought and died.\n A weak man in such a crisis would have been\n bewildered. Domestic matters of grave mo-\n ment pressed upon every hand. There were\n unsettled the questions of tariff and finance,\n and scores of other subjects of internal pol-\n icy required immediate attention, not only in\n justice to those whose suffrages had placed\n the administration in power, but for its own\n good name, that at the end of its term of\n office it might give a worthy account of its\n stewardship. A weak man would have ac-\n cepted peace at any price, or prompt war at\n the behest of a clamoring public. It is well\n not to forget the temper of the public\n mind at this time. The press teemed\n with bitter denunciation of the Spanish\n tyranny in Cuba; the demand for instant\n recognition of independence or for inter-\n vention was emphatic; the halls of Congress\n rang with appeals to prejudice and partisan\n feeling, and then, when all this was at its\n height, came the terrible calamity in the har-\n bor of Havana. A weak man would have\n taken the easy alternative and yielded with\n much show of reason to the cJmost universal\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0062/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0062/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0062/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0062/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0062/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0062.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 985325}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"62\">\n<p>\n 60\n</p>\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n cry for vengeance. No greater test has come\n to any public man in the history of this coun-\n try than to the President during those days.\n Through it all the man in the White Rouse\n kept his head. He comes of Scotch-Irish par-\n entage: good stock. The women of that\n stock are model housewives, thrifty, helpful\n in communities. The men are steady, self-\n reliant, Godfearing, peace loving; they think\n for themselves; when they are assailed they\n take a firmer grip on things. He had been\n educated in the common schools, and had\n been before the people for a generation in\n the various walks of public employment\n where men come to know and to be known by\n one another. His career had been constantly\n upw T ard. He had broadened in intellect and\n sympathies wfith each year of service. Affec-\n tionate and tender in the domestic relations\n of life as he was, some unconsciously had\n lost sight of the sturdy Scotch-Irish strain\n in his character. With the record of his ad-\n ministration as President before them, his\n friends now realize what these years were\n doing for him. They look back now upon his\n services as Representative in Congress and\n as Governor of his native state, and recall\n the traits which only needed wider fields for\n their development. They recall how, fre-\n quently when before the people for their suf-\n frages. he surprised his supporters and con-\n founded his enemies by the simplicity and di-\n rectness of his dealings with vexed questions.\n Time and again they had heard him insist\n that a course mapped out for him must be\n right rather than expedient. He saw four-\n teen years of service in that school of states-\n manship, the national House of Representa-\n tives, and never deserted the standard of the\n great doctrine of which he became the ex-\n ponent and defender. So it was that his\n friends of these years watched with eager\n and hopeful interest his discharge of the\n great duties of the Presidency.\n</p>\n<p>\n William McKinley is a typical American\n citizen. He stands for what is best in Amer-\n ican life and character. He is without osten-\n tation, simple in his tastes, deliberate in his\n speech, conservative in judgment, spotlessly\n pure in his private life, devoted to his home\n and his friends. There has been no stain\n upon his integrity during all the years that\n he has been under the searching light of pub-\n lic scrutiny. His devotion to his wife is\n one of the most beautiful and touching things\n in the lives of our public men. He wears\n well. There is nothing erratic about him. He\n does not pose. He believes in harmony. He\n is a fighter, but not a vindictive one. He\n fights with sense. If he has an object to ac-\n complish, he will accomplish it even though\n he may have to sacrifice the small distinction\n of winning a personal victory. He keeps faith.\n He fulfills his promises. He believes in party\n obligation. He wants a united party. He\n believes that such a party can best serve the\n great interests committed to its charge. He\n knows that we can ofttimes but approximate\n to our ideals and that it then becomes our\n duty to secure the best results obtainable.\n The Republican party under the leadership of\n William McKinley is more harmonious, more\n forceful, more dominant than at any time in\n .its history. In his state and nation he has a\n united party. Could this have been the work\n of a weak man, as some of his opponents\n would have us believe? Is this the record of\n uncertainty? There were times during the\n Spanish-American war when William McKin-\n ley was a force of strength and power that\n brushed aside jealousies and littlenesses,\n that hurried forward great movements, that\n blocked the way of schemers and swept all\n before him. He dominates his administra-\n tion, but, whether by force or gentle persua-\n siveness, he is the strong man at the helm.\n</p>\n<p>\n WILLIAM MC KINLEY.\n</p>\n<p>\n speaks, he is President. He is a many-\n sided man, not restricted in his equipment.\n In the varied fields of administrative duty\n he has been called upon, during his four\n years in the White House, to assume\n the direction of matters in many branches\n of the government. In these\u2019 he has shown\n a familiarity with the great affairs of gov-\n ernment which has astonished those who\n have known it. Many of the state papers\n emanating from the executive departments\n and that have become a part of the history\n of his administration were inspired by him\n or were the work of his own hand. His mas-\n</p>\n<p>\n time is written his masterful hand will be\n seen at every turn. He took nothing for\n granted but the patriotism and integrity of\n the American people. He is methodical in his\n habits, he is systematic. He accomplished\n much because of an orderly disposition of his\n time. When in the White House he arises at\n 8, breakfasts at 8:30; from 9 to 9:45 reads the\n papers, and at 10 o\u2019clock he is in his office\n ready for business. From 10 to 1:30 he re-\n ceives the various public officials. Senators,\n Representatives, members of the staffs of the\n various departments and the public. At 1:30\n he has lunch. From 2 to 2:S0 he spends with\n</p>\n<p>\n tery of diplomacy has been the wonder of\n diplomats, but the secret of it has been his\n Americanism, his plainness of speech, com-\n bined with a certain Yankee shrewdness in\n the presentation of a subject or in the dis-\n covery of the weak points in an adversary\u2019s\n contentions. In the conduct of the operations\n of our Army and Navy he has been the real\n commander-in-chief. When the history of his\n</p>\n<p>\n His methods are direct.

Du-\n ring the eventful days of the Spanish war the\n President remained in his office many hours\n of the night and was not infrequently work-\n ing there with his secretary long past mid-\n night.\n</p>\n<p>\n He is a plain liver. He smokes moderate-\n ly, does not use intoxicating liquors. He is\n clean of speech as he is of character. He\n has been a model husband, a devoted son\n and brother, and in all the walks of life has\n so carried himself as to leave the impress\n of a noble character. He is strong mental-\n ly and physically. He has no physical weak-\n ness. He walks with a decided and ener-\n getic step. While his face has a certain\n pallor under excitement, it has habitually\n the fine glow of a man in rugged health. The\n President is frequently seen upon the streets\n of Washington. He is not hedged about\n by the usual pride and circumstance of\n rulers. He is the most reasonable of men,\n the most accommodating. No citizen is too\n lowly, no cause too poor to enlist his sym-\n pathy, but with all this he is a business\n man. He knows the value of time. He\n cannot accomplish the work for which\n he has been chosen if he fails to hus-\n band his resources, and so it is that he\n gets out of every man associated with him\n the best and most that is in him. He does\n nothing himself that others should do for\n him. His Cabinet officers were appointed\n for a purpose \u2014 to administer the affairs of\n their great departments. He requires of\n them a strict account of stewardship. He\n does not interfere with them in the dis-\n charge of their onerous duties. He calls\n them into consultation. He requires a show-\n ing of their books. He draws upon them < for\n</p>\n<p>\n a strengthening of administrative policies.\n He relies upon them for material and sup-\n port. His office is a model in the dispatch\n of public business. A keen judge of men,\n he has surrounded himself with efficient\n helpers. From an ordinary government es-\n tablishment, with very indifferent methods,\n the Executive Mansion has become one of\n the most practical and helpful of public of-\n fices. A position in the office of the Presi-\n dent of the United States is to-day a post\n of signal honor, highly prized among the\n thousands of such places in the Federal\n service.\n</p>\n<p>\n President McKinley believes in true civil\n service reform. During the first year of his\n administration, when his attention was re-\n peatedly called to the inequalities and injus-\n tices of the then existing civil service regu-\n lations, he ordered the collection of data\n which would acquaint him with what was\n needed to better those conditions. And when\n it was gathered together, and he had satis-\n fied himself of the wisdom of the changes,\n he promulgated the amendments to the civil\n service rules which have already demon-\n strated their value and proved one of the\n most potent influences in the strengthening\n of the merit system. His administration has\n not been one of bluster. There has been\n no blare of trumpets or resorts to the arts\n of the demagogue. A striking example of\n this is found in the settlement of the Pacific\n Railroad indebtedness, when a vast sum was\n realized and the debt canceled without a rip-\n ple in the financial world, with a saving to\n the government of many millions of dollars.\n For years this indebtedness had taxed the\n skill of our ablest financiers, and was one\n of the things handed down from administra-\n tion to administration. Hawaii had been an-\n nexed. From danger of embarrassment in\n Samoa we have emerged in undisputed pos-\n session of the best of that group of islands.\n A government has been provided for Alaska.\n A practical tariff law and an equally practi-\n cal financial law are on the statute books.\n Any one of these measures would be suffi-\n cient for the record of an administration.\n Great results for liberty and humanity have\n been achieved in Porto Rico, Cuba and the\n Philippines.\n</p>\n<p>\n Militarism and imperialism are terms glibly\n spoken these days by the unthinking, and\n high sounding as they are, may appeal for\n the time to partisan expediency. They are\n the symbol of fine theories, but neither the\n one nor the other exists in America. Nor can\n the unbiased citizen, after a thoughtful study\n and investigation, come to any other conclu-\n sion than that they are but words \u2014 campaign\n necessities \u2014 for those who must find a catch\n phrase for a platform. These are the days of\n</p>\n<p>\n fact against fancy; of things done against\n things promised; of practice against theory;\n of sense against sound; of men of action\n against men of straw; of flesh and blood\n against bugaboos. Where is the evidence of\n this thing called imperialism? Is the Presi-\n dent attended with pomp and ceremony as he\n goes from place to place? Has he surrounded\n himself with courtiers and retainers? Is there\n a word or a line in any of his state papers\n championing absolutism or a ruthless disre-\n gard of the rights of the people? He has\n served while others have scoffed. He has\n fulfilled the obligations of his oath while oth-\n ers have vilified, have encouraged treason\n and cast their lot with the murderers of our\n soldiers. Devotion to the constitution i3 not\n well expressed by giving succor to the ene-\n mies of the government.\n</p>\n<p>\n No man in the presidential office was ever\n more scrupulous in his conduct of the people\u2019s\n business; no man in that exalted office ever\n had a nicer sense of its proprieties. No man\n was ever nearer the hearts of the common\n people than William McKinley. American\n diplomacy in China has had in it no element\n of either militarism or imperialism, but it\n stands to-day as an example to the world of\n what plain speech and direct methods can ac-\n complish in the intercourse of nations. It\n is but a link in the chain of the administra-\n tion\u2019s achievements. It appeals to all classes\n as a substantial advance of the republic in\n the pathway of progress and civilization.\n From the hour of the declaration of war with\n Spain America has taken her proper place\n among the nations. To-day she stands at the\n front, with no entangling alliances.

His\n career has, in many ways, been a remarkable\n one. In point of political service, he has out-\n lived all of his early contemporaries, and,\n while the minor details of party management\n have now been shifted to younger shoulders,\n he still holds the reins over the leaders and\n directs, in the main, the route of travel of the\n party machine in this county.\n</p>\n<p>\n An analysis of the characteristics of the\n man himself is a somewhat difficult task, in\n spite of the fact that his career has been a\n public one. Mr. McLaughlin has always been\n a man of few words. His confidences have\n not been distributed broadcast. His life has\n been a simple one, and while his personal\n friends have been cdose and loyal the list has\n not been large. A directness and even\n brusqueness of manner and speech have pre-\n vented the closer and more genial companion-\n ships in general which, in the case of public\n men, have afforded the best insight into their\n qualities of mind and character.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s position in the political\n history of this country has been unique.\n Bosses have come and leaders have gone, but\n he has stood supreme. He has apparently\n been defeated many times and has been forced\n to yield to opponents, but at the end of an\n indefinite number of weeks, months or years\n he has been found to be again in control. He\n has met attacks from without and revolts\n within the party and has either beaten or out-\n lasted them. He has formally and informally\n withdrawn from the leadership and yet to-day\n he occupies his old place in the auction room\n and compels his lieutenants to take aggres-\n sive action in a political fight which most of\n them oppose or think unwise. Yet he has his\n way and no one says him nay.\n</p>\n<p>\n What is the secret of this man\u2019s power?\n The answers to this question will be as var-\n ied as those of whom it is asked. Is it force,\n strength of will and an unyielding personali-\n ty? No; for Mr. McLaughlin has conquered\n stronger and more forceful men than he;\n has beaten them, without defeating them,\n simply through the ability to wait patiently\n for his chance and then to seize it. Is it\n courage, then? No; for he has conquered\n more audacious men than he, leaders of\n whom it never could have been said that\n they were timid or hesitant in any degree.\n [Thera were times during the past fifty years\n</p>\n<p>\n when he has yielded, almost without fight\n and sometimes almost abjectly \u2014 yielded when\n his followers have believed that courage\n would have won the game at the outset. Is\n it mental shrewdness and alertness? No; for\n he has been outgeneraled and outmaneuvered\n scores of times and has been freely and eas-\n ily used by dozens of state and national lead-\n ers. Is it in breadth of mind? No; for he\n has been content with narrow things. He\n has refrained from taking any large part in\n state or national politics and has, by choice,\n limited his power to the local field rather\n than, when possible, to have seized the state\n leadership and to have taken his part in the\n national councils of his party. He has never\n been deeply interested in any but local ques-\n tions. He has been interested in national\n matters only as they have affected the vote\n for Brooklyn officers.\n</p>\n<p>\n It must not be supposed, how ' ever, that\n Hugh McLaughlin is without these qualities.\n He is strong and he has courage and shrewd-\n ness. It is their possession in the superla-\n tive degree that he has not. What qualities\n has he, then in which lie the secret of his\n unique power? Some of the qualities which\n others have in larger degree than he are\n possessed by him in considerable measure.\n The union of them in him makes his charac-\n ter a strong one \u2014 net.\n</p>\n<p>\n Those who know him best, who have oppos-\n ed as well as counseled with him, say that\n his success is due to conservatism, to pa-\n tience and to what they call \u2018\u2019squareness.\u201d\n These qualities, united with such force, cour-\n age and shrewdness as he possesses, have\n made him the typical \" boss \" of that nation\n in which this type has been most completely\n developed. His conservatism has stood him\n in good stead. Change for the sake of change\n has never been his desire. \u2018\u2018Let well enough\n alone\u201d has been one of his mottoes. New\n methods and new ideas must be tested in the\n fire of experience before he is willing to adopt\n them. This conservatism has given to people,\n politicians, bhsiness men and citizens, a feel-\n ing of confidence which has been of the ut-\n most value at critical times. Mr. McLaugh-\n lin\u2019s patience is almost proverbial. \u201cEvery-\n thing comes to him who waits, \" must have\n been written with a foresight prophetic of his\n career. He waited \u2014 and he became foreman\n of laborers in the Navy Yard. He waited \u2014\n and the local leadership dropped into his\n hands. He waited\u2014 and the Jefferson Hall\n movement melted away. He waited \u2014 and the\n McKane rebellion vanished. He waited \u2014 and\n Edward M. Shepard became an organization\n</p>\n<p>\n man. He waits \u2014 and what will happen to\n the Coffey-McGarry-Hayes rebellion?\n</p>\n<p>\n On Hugh McLaughlin\u2019s personal \u201csquare-\n ness\u201d as a politician no one has ever cast a\n shadow. The political definition of \u201csquare-\n ness\u201d is somewhat peculiar and differs from\n the colloquial. In politics \u201csquareness\u201d is\n not an exact synonym for either honesty or\n for truthfulness. It means fair treatment of\n associates and subordinates, and the keep-\n ing of personal promises. \u201cSquareness\u201d in\n the mind of a ward politician is what \u201chon-\n or\u201d is in the mind of a gentleman of the old\n school. In other words, a \u201csquare\u201d leader is\n almost an ideal one. Mr. McLaughlin has\n been charged with breaking public prom-\n ises, with refusal to keep pledges on matters\n of policy. He has never, however, been ac-\n cused of breaking a personal promise. If he\n has promised to a man an office or a nomina-\n tion that man has received it or its equiva-\n lent. And not a little of the criticism which\n the veteran leader has had to face was due\n to this scrupulousness.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. McLaughlin has been called revengeful\n and an implacable enemy. The former he may\n be. The latter he is not. He has crushed\n many who have opposed him or who have be-\n trayed him, and he has forgiven many who\n have done both. There are men now living,\n and more now dead, to whom for years he re-\n fused to speak, but who were left undisturbed\n in their offices and their contracts. They\n had done good work for the organization, or\n were doing it, and while the leader disliked\n or distrusted them, his sense of squareness\n would not permit him to punish them for his\n own personal feelings.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was doubtless intended by nature that\n Mr. McLaughlin should command in whatever\n pursuit he took up. Before he came to be\n recognized as a power jn politics he was a\n master workmen in the Navy Yard. A pow-\n erful physique, a certain inborn stubbornness,\n a complete knowledge of human nature, fore-\n sight and persistence have contributed to per-\n petuate in politics the position of master\n which he won in the workshop. He is a na-\n tive born American, though of Irish parent-\n age, and his youth was spent in humble cir-\n cumstances on what is now Furman street.\n From association with his fellow toilers at the\n Navy Yard in the days when many a stout\n keel was hewn out of massive oak and from\n being a power in volunteer fire company poli-\n tics he came to have a liking for the politics\n of a larger field.\n</p>\n<p>\n In those days when Mr. McLaughlin was In\n his teens or twenties the firemen were a po-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0065/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 345, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 493}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0065/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 691, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 987}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0065/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1383, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1975}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0065/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2767, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3950}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0065/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0065.jp2", "height": 3950, "width": 2767, "levels": 6, "size": 910514}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"65\">\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n litical force to be reckoned with.

Young McLaughlin was not\n a shirker at the pumping engine and could\n \u201crun with the machine\u201d with the best of\n them. It was an early indication of his energy\n and from swaying the minds of his compan-\n ion firemen he came to sway the political\n action of his associates in a larger way.\n Then came the time when he was appointed a\n \u201cboss\u201d in the Navy Yard.

His personality was vigorously\n asserted even in these early days. What he\n wanted he sought for and worked for with\n all his might. Those he was opposed to were\n told so in no indirect fashion.

Young McLaughlin\n r\u00bbtognized the opportunity and was quick to\n take advantage of it.\n</p>\n<p>\n He began by making himself master of\n machine politics and its many ramifications,\n and there soon came a time when the appli-\n cant for a job was advised to \" Go and see\n HCghey.\u201d The Democratic managers of that\n day were too busy to trouble to find places\n for their followers. They were as a rule men\n of wealth and family. But young McLaughlin\n was wise enough to realize that personal en-\n deavors in such matters were quite as apt to\n create friendships for the one who made them\n</p>\n<p>\n almost autocratic power. Few like to rouse\n his wrath, and the thunder once aroused\n usually presages lightning. Yet there is a\n softer side to his character. In his home,\n with his family and his intimate friends, no\n one could be more gentle. Above all, he is a i\n religious man and firm in his religious con-\n victions.\n</p>\n<p>\n The history of the Democratic party in\n Kings County is largely an index to the char-\n acter and career of Hugh McLaughlin. While\n it is not the purpose to review that history\n \u2022here, there are some incidents which have a j\n direct bearing on the personality of the man. j\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. McLaughlin was elected register in j\n 1861 and re-elected in 1864.\n</p>\n<p>\n 03\n</p>\n<p>\n renominated but was defeated. In 1870 he\n was more successful, however, and was re-\n turned to the office of register by a major-\n ity of 12,000. That was the last public office\n to which he aspired.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. McLaughlin won recognition originally\n through a fight against the regular organiza-\n tion of the time, and he was elected to the\n first public office he ever held on an inde-\n pendent citizens\u2019 ticket.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the early days Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s ability\n as a party manager was often put to severe\n tests. One of these occasions was in 1879,\n when there were symptoms of a revolt\n against Mr. McLaughlin in the general com-\n mittee. The late Alderman James McGarry\n had a wordy warfare with the boss because\n of alleged interference in the affairs of the\n Tenth Ward in the interest of Phil Casey,\n who was fighting McGarry there. McGarry\n had been appointed to a lucrative place in the\n Department of City Works through Alderman\n Simon Gunder, whom he had elected to the\n board, and Gunder had done other things\n which were not entirely to the liking of Wil-\n loughby street. As a consequence of the trou-\n ble in the committee McLaughlin and McGar-\n ry did not speak to each other for a number\n of years, but they finally came together again.\n McGarry was a stubborn, courageous fighter\n and under his leadership the Tenth Ward\n was always good for a rousing majority.\n</p>\n<p>\n What many regarded as the most formid-\n able rebellion against the regular machine\n domination was that of the men engaged in\n the Jefferson Hall movement in 18S1. This\n demonstration grew out of a feeling among a\n considerable body of Democrats that Gen-\n eral Hancock, the candidate for the presi-\n dency, had not been properly supported by\n the McLaughlin machine. In fact, the charge\n was made that Hancock had been sold out in\n this county. In the membership were a num-\n ber of well known Democrats who have since\n been elected to office through the instrumen-\n tality of the Willoughby street organization.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the fall of i8sl James Howell was re-\n nominated for a third term as mayor. The\n Jeffersor Hall committee, or Central Demo-\n cratic Association, which met at Willoughby\n and Adams streets, placed in nomination\n General Slocum and also placed in the field\n a full local ticket. Seth Low was nominated\n as a citizens\u2019 and Republican candidate, Gen-\n eral Tracy and Ripley Ropes having with-\n drawn in his favor. The election was of un-\n usual importance, as the incoming mayor was\n to inaugurate the system of one head com-\n missions and exercise for the first time the\n sole, power of appointment. There was so\n much strife and dissatisfaction among the\n Democrats that it was evident that with ex-\n isting divisions there was no chance of elect-\n ing a Democrat to the mayoralty. An asso-\n ciation of Democrats known as the Young\n Men\u2019s Democratic Club, of which David A.\n Boody was a member, was also in revolt.\n It was not a very formidable organization,\n but it helped Just so much to split the Demo-\n cratic vote. la view of the gravity of the\n situation, the leaders of the Willoughby\n st/eet and Jefferson Hall parties got together\n for the purpose of having, if possible, but one\n Democratic candidate in the field. After much\n dickering, during which the Jefferson Hall\n people opposed the further dictation of Mr.\n McLaughlin in party affairs, it was decided\n that General Slocum and iiie rest of the Jef-\n ferson Hall ticket should be withdrawn, with\n the understanding that Mr. McLaughlin\n should retire from his position as leader. In\n accordance with this agreement, Mr. Mc-\n Laughlin had prepared a letter declaring it\n as his intention to retire, and then the Jet-\n</p>\n<p>\n la 1867 he was 1 ferson Hall committee withdrew its ticket.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0066/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0066/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0066/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0066/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0066/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0066.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 851887}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"66\">\n<p>\n 64\n</p>\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n The letter of retirement was sent to Jef-\n ferson Hall on the night of Tuesday, Novem-\n ber 1, 1881. In many respects it was a re-\n markable output.\n</p>\n<p>\n Although Mr. McLaughlin resigned the\n leadership, nobody ever knew the difference\n In his relation to the local machine from\n that time on. He continued to be boss just\n the same. Thirteen years later, in 1895, the\n machine found itself antagonized by a sub-\n stantial body of Democrats, who nominated\n Edward M. Shepard. Edward M. Grout was\n nominated by the machine for mayor. Mr.\n Grout had been classed as among the most\n determined antagonists, and his nomination\n was regarded by many people as a concession\n to them and evidence of the desire of Wil-\n loughby street to nominate competent and un-\n objectionable men for office. In this contest\n the Republicans nominated a pronounced par-\n tisan, F. W. Wurster. Here a division of\n the Democratic vote elected the Republican\n candidate, and the result attested the fact\n that the Shepard party held the balance of\n power. But how far the machine has re-\n covered from the blow of 1893 was suggested\n by the narrow margin by which Mr. Grout\n was defeated, for Mr. Wurster\u2019s plurality was\n only some 2,000.\n</p>\n<p>\n The election of 1897, while it brought Dem-\n ocratic victory, was not entirely satisfactory\n to the party or to Mr. McLaughlin. It was\n not until the year following that the Shep-\n ardites supported the regular ticket.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the darkest chapter of the political his-\n tory of Kings \u2014 the sale of law and murder\n of government by John Y. McKane in the\n Town of Gravesend \u2014 McLaughlin\u2019s name\n should be recorded against McKane and his\n gang. The men in political power who gave\n their support in the attempt to overthrow\n government by the people were to be found\n at Washington and Albany.\n</p>\n<p>\n The part taken by the regular Democracy\n of this county in state politics forms a more\n or less prominent chapter in the history of\n the party. It is well known to the friends\n ot Mr. McLaughlin that he much preferred\n to confine his attention to local affairs. In\n former years he was inclined to have others\n look after the details of state politics, al-\n though he never for a moment lost interest.\n On several occasions he has made the influ-\n ence of the organization felt in the councils\n of the party in the state. He has sought to\n have it represented in the higher offices. He\n worked hard for the nomination of General\n Slocum for Governor in 1882. He was mainly\n instrumental in elevating Alfred C. Chapin\n to the controllership of the state. He would\n have said, no doubt, all this was the work\n of the organization. He was among the\n amst ardent supporters of Grover Cleveland\n for the presidency in 1884, and it was said\n that his efforts and those of the late William\n C. Kingsley had much to do with making Mr.\n Cleveland the candidate. Kings County fa-\n vored Cleveland again in 1888, but was un-\n successfully opposed to him in 1892.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the factional disputes in the party in the\n state Kings County has generally been with\n the countrymen. Until 1897 it had few if any\n alliances with Tammany Hall. Its delegations\n saw Tammany Hall walk out of the state con-\n vention in 1879 because the Democracy of the\n rest of the state insisted upon renominating\n Governor Lucius Robinson. It resisted the se-\n ductions of Tammany Hall in that convention\n whereby Tammany hoped to defeat Robinson\n by nominating the late John C. Jacobs, who\n was presiding at the time and who refused to\n put the question on a motion made by a Tam-\n many delegate that he be the candidate for\n Governor. In connection with this incident\n</p>\n<p>\n it is well known that when Mr. Jacobs was\n thus named Mr. McLaughlin who occupied a\n front seat, looked up at Jacobs and negatively\n nodded his head. It has always been the boast\n of the Kings County Democratic organization\n that it never has been other than regular and\n has never bolted a convention. It went to\n that convention to aid in the renomination of\n Robinson and could not be shaken from the\n position.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Coffey rebellion in 1899 is still fresh\n in the minds of big and little in the party.\n It is known that it was a cause of great\n anxiety to Mr. McLaughlin that Senator Cof-\n fey should strike at his leadership by opposing\n the candidacy of John Morrissey Gray for reg-\n ister in 1899. Mr. McLaughlin looked upon\n the attitude of the South Brooklyn leader as\n a rare specimen of political ingratitude, and\n the South Brooklyn leader was astonished\n at w ' hat he characterized as a choice example\n of political effrontery. At any rate, each had\n his advisers and supporters, and after the de-\n feat of Gray by ex-Congressman Howe the\n Senator loomed up as a very important factor\n in local politics. 1-Ie was put on trial for po-\n litical heresy by the machine, and eventually\n expelled from the General Committee. The\n courts ordered Coffey\u2019s restoration, and the\n case is now on appeal. The fight, which is\n still on, is avowedly against McLaughlin\u2019s\n boss rule, and the leader\u2019s \u201ctrusted lieuten-\n ants,\u201d who had advised the retention of Gray\n on the ticket.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. McLaughlin is known and very gen-\n erally addressed as Boss. The title was\n conferred upon him when he was put in\n charge of a gang of ship builders. He is\n even addressed as Boss by his lieutenants,\n but he stated once in a public letter that\n of all terms in the English language it was\n most repugnant to him. Neverthless, there\n is no other word that describes his relation\n to a political party. \u201cLeader\u201d indicates a\n certain amount of limited authority. So far\n as authority goes, Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s power\n was not usually limited, but in its exercise\n he sought to follow his best judgment. He\n has not been averse to seeking advice, and\n has often followed it. So, probably, did Louis\n XIV, coiner of the famous phrase, \u201cThe\n state, it is I.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Many reams of white paper have been\n wasted in denouncing Mr. McLaughlin for\n his absoluteness and for the conduct of local\n government, but it does not seem to have\n harmed him very much. Mr. McLaughlin be-\n longs to another age of politics than the\n present, and is not in sympathy with jour-\n nalistic enterprise as illustrated by the desire\n to inquire into the reasons for this or that\n appointment or for a particular course of\n action. In the forty years or more of polit-\n ical activity the number of interviews he\n has given could probably be counted upon\n the fingers of the hands. He has, however,\n maintained friendly and even confidential re-\n lations with some newspaper men. But he is\n chary of his confidence, and the man who\n obtains it must serve a long probation. Years\n and long service bring respect, and better\n acquaintance with the old man of Willough-\n by street has given generations of political\n reporters a genuine regard for his sturdiness\n of character and directness.\n</p>\n<p>\n A factor of no small moment in the shap-\n ing of Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s career and in insur-\n ing his long continued hold upon the reins\n of party management, has been the thorough-\n ly democratic manner of his life and living.\n In another man this might have led to undue\n familiarity between leader and followers. Not\n so with Hugh McLaughlin. His personality\n has been of a different kind. Always ap-\n</p>\n<p>\n proachable, he is not always communicative.\n What he has to say is said directly and to\n the point. Bluntly, if you please.\n</p>\n<p>\n For many years Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s head-\n quarters have been at Kerrigan\u2019s auction\n room, 9 Willoughby street. As a political in-\n stitution the auction room is peculiar to\n Brooklyn, or rather to McLaughlin. He\n created it, and when in town be is a regular\n attendant there.\n</p>\n<p>\n Like most men of advanced years, the vet-\n eran leader likes to see old friends. Most\n of those who visit the headquarters are poli-\n ticians, but the \u201cboss\u201d has some personal\n friends who never sought for political prefer-\n ment. There is usually no difficulty for any\n one who has business with Mr. McLaughlin\n or his lieutenants to get an audience. There\n are no folding doors or attendants. One must\n wait his turn, how r ever, and then he may walk\n right in. In these days Mr. McLaughlin does\n not give much attention to details. That is\n attended to by Mr. Shevlin, Senator McCarren\n or ex-Senator McCarty. The old leader prob-\n ably has more to say abdut lines of policy\n than anything else, but his trust in Mr. Shev-\n lin and in his other lieutenants is absolute.\n His influence is usually wielded by suggestion\n rather than by direction; none the less it is\n usually heeded.\n</p>\n<p>\n In former days Mr. McLaughlin was much\n interested in athletic sports and was a cham-\n pion amateur wrestler. He is also fond of\n fishing and can tell yarns about the finny\n tribe with the best of them. On subjects of\n that sort he is very communicative, but on\n politics he is exceedingly reserved\u2014 that is,\n in talking for publication.\n</p>\n<p>\n On most phases of politics he is very con-\n servative and does not take kindly to new\n theories. ' Willoughby street never openly\n bolts a Democratic nomination. In that re-\n spect, the local organization has a cleaner\n record than Tammany.\n</p>\n<p>\n Evidence of Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s political\n acumen may be found in the record which be\n has made in maintaining the balance of power\n in the state organization. This was accom-\n plished through his willingness to keep in\n touch with the up-state forces, which were\n arrayed against Tammany. Thus through\n him they were able to sway conventions year\n after year. His influence in national poli-\n tics has never been. large and he does not\n pretend to be more than a local politician.\n</p>\n<p>\n Since Brooklyn was consolidated with New\n York, however, the relations of the local or-\n ganization have of necessity become intimate\n with Tammany, but Kings County is likely\n for years to have much to say about state\n nominations.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. .McLaughlin\u2019s practical philosophy has\n entertained men like Henry Ward Beecher\n and General Benjamin F. Tracy, whose train-\n ing was in an entirely ' different field. Hav-\n ing outlived his generation, the veteran lead-\n er of the local Democracy is \u2019able to look with\n considerable serenity upon public affairs and\n public men. In an interview published in the\n Eagle recently, Mr. McLaughlin said what he\n wanted now more than anything else was\n peace, and that he believed he had outlived\n the asperities and strife of active politics.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. McLaughlin is a lover of his home.\n The McLaughlin house, on Remsen street, is\n one of a row of wide brown stones. In it\n all callers are received with courtesy. \u201cThe\n old man,\u201d however, does not like to confuse\n politics with his home life, and it is seldom\n that politicians can get a hearing there.\n</p>\n<p>\n Soon after Mr. McLaughlin\u2019s return from\n Florida some months ago he had an attack of\n illness which inclined him to heed still fur-\n ther the advice of his physician kb*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0067/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 345, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 493}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0067/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 691, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 987}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0067/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1383, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1975}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0067/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2767, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3950}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0067/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0067.jp2", "height": 3950, "width": 2767, "levels": 6, "size": 739608}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"67\">\n<p>\n STUDIES IX AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n 65\n</p>\n<p>\n wishes of his family that he should give less\n time to politics and more time to life in the\n open air.

It is there that he has\n ruled the party, received political and per-\n sonal friends, heard the applications of candi-\n dates for nomination and their friends, and,\n in fact, attended to all the matters connected\n with leadership. His visitors here included\n men of conspicuity in nearly all the walks of\n life \u2014 statesmen, judges, lawyers, members of\n Congress, journalists and clergymen. Henry\n Ward Beecher once called on Mr. McLaugh-\n lin there. When the party was successful the\n crowd of visitors was always the largest. In\n days of darkness and disaster Mr. McLaugh-\n lin has often sat there attended only by a\n faithful few, whose loyalty to the man was\n not in the least impaired by disaster. At the\n auction room many a man has been started on\n a successful career in politics, and a death\n blow has been given to the aspirations of\n hosts of others who have sought fame and\n fortune at the hands of the party.\n</p>\n<p>\n During all the years of McLaughlin\u2019s lead-\n ership he has been associated with many of\n the best men of the party hereabouts. Not a\n</p>\n<p>\n few of them are dead, and the list of the dead\n includes some of the cleverest and most ' faith-\n ful of his friends. Others have departed\n whose advice could have been well ignored\n and whose identification with the party did\n not contribute much to its up-building.

They made an impression on\n the character of the party and in nothing\n more than in their individual independence\n in thought and action, with a result that to-\n day, organized as well as it is, the party is\n most difficult to guide and control.\n</p>\n<p>\n A Republican, a member of his party from\n its foundation, who for a quarter of a cen-\n tury wielded a large influence, is quoted. If\n his statement is true, and the history of the\n party since 1856 would show it is, then he who\n has risen to and has retained for years al-\n most supreme control, swaying, shaping and\n guiding its course within this state, is one\n \u25a0who possesses such qualities of mind and\n character as to make him a man of superior\n importance and an interesting study. The\n man is Thomas Collier Platt.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is now nearly two decades since Mr.\n Platt emerged from the front ranks, a single\n figure in the lead. During that time there has\n hardly been a year that he has not been\n challenged to personal combat by some one\n</p>\n<p>\n aspiring to occupy . the place. So, to the diffi-\n culties of maintenance of place gained, ' all\n \u201cbosses\u201d must contend against and, to the\n peculiar difficulty of maintaining leadership\n in a party of such heterogeneous elements,\n was added those of the outcome of organized\n opposition within his party directed solely at\n him and his leadership. During the nine-\n teen years elapsing since he took upon him-\n self the labors of management his opposition\n has been practically a running fight against\n him, sometimes formidable, sometimes seem-\n ingly overwhelming, always strenuous, and\n yet, through it all he has maintained his\n place, while leading his party from a minority\n to a majority position \u2014 into supreme control\n in state matters.\n</p>\n<p>\n .Mr. Platt came to superior leadership under\n conditions peculiar and by no means favora-\n ble. For a number of years he had been\n active and prominent in the affairs of his\n party, especially in the Southern tier, had\n represented his district in Congress for two\n terms, but subordinate to the vigorous and\n brilliant leadership of the stately and im-\n perious Roscoe Conkling. With Chester A.\n Arthur, Alonzo B. Cornell, Benjamin F.\n Tracy, Richard F. Crowley, Silas B. Dutcher,\n he made up that band of able lieutenants\n with which the masterful chief surrounded\n himself. During that exciting and turbulent\n period when, subsequent to the retiring from\n</p>\n<p>\n the presidency of General Grant, the Repub-\n lican party was divided into hostile factions\n known as Stalwarts and Half Breeds Mr.\n Platt was efficient in aiding in maintaining\n in this state the supremacy of Conkling. Cor-\n nell had become Governor of the state; Ar-\n thur, Collector of the Port of New York, and\n Mr. Platt was chosen United States Senator,\n junior to Conkling. This was his growth in\n politics when the factional division had\n reached its height. Of the Half Breeds\n Blaine was the head; of the Stalwarts really\n Conkling. Between the two heads existed an\n enmity, venomous and implacable. The two\n factions hared each other more bitterly than\n they did the common enemy, the Democrats.\n Both leaders cherished presidential aspira-\n tions, but Conkling had been defeated for the\n nomination, though supported by the existing\n administration, through the active work of\n Blaine and Hayes was the result. Blaine\n had been deprived of the nomination he be-\n lieved was surely his, through the machina-\n tions of Conkling in presenting Grant for a\n hird term and the result was Garfield \u2014 a par-\n tial triumph for Blaine, for the Ohioan was\n of his faction. Wider division and more in-\n tense bitterness followed the triumph of\n Garfield at the polls and his assumption of\n office. The course of the administration, if\n not dictated, was swayed by Blaine, who\n was made the Secretary of State.

The\n strike of giants culminated in a tragic event.\n President Garfield was assassinated by a man\n whose disordered intellect had been wrought\n upon disastrously by the excited political con-\n dition. Done in the name of Stalwarts that\n faction was injured by it. Conkling and\n Platt were defeated. The dominance of the\n Half Breed faction thus gained was main-\n tained through the unwillingness of the new\n President, Arthur, to have his high office\n made a means and instrument of the ven-\n geance of the irate and combative Conkling.\n The chief and his whilom lieutenant quar-\n reled, Conkling retired from politics to the\n practice of law; Platt to mending political\n fences. Confusion reigned in the ranks of\n the Republican party in this state and\n nowhere more wildly than in the front ranks\n and among the lieutenants left without a\n captain.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the meantime, under the wise and able\n leadership of Samuel J. Tilden, which, if\n advantaged by the divisions in the Repub-\n lican party, was complicated by the rebel-\n lious attitude of John Kelly, the head of\n Tammany Hall, the Democracy was growing\n in strength and power and came to the con-\n trol of affairs within the state. The Repub-\n lican machine was wrecked in the success-\n ful effort of President Arthur to force Secre-\n tary of the Treasury Folger on the State\n Convention as the gubernatorial candidate,\n thus depriving Governor Cornell of the re-\n nomination his party desired him to have.\n The rank and file revolted and Folger was\n beaten at the polls by a plurality of nearly\n two hundred thousand. It was believed that\n the Republican party was dead in the State\n of New York. The lever of the broken po-\n litical machine lay upon the ground. Mr.\n Platt picked it up, put it in its place, set\n about repairing the machine in an unosten-\n tatious manner, and while the other lieuten-\n ants who might have done the same thing\n were looking on, surprised the party, and\n perhaps himself, in electing a Secretary of\n State in the very next campaign. It was\n some time before the rank and file of the\n party realized that a new hand was at the\n lever. When they did the new man was in\n sufficient power to defend himself. As a\n leader he was born in a storm. The ele-\n ments thundered and crashed at hi$ birth\n and his career has been a stormy one until\n this time. From the beginning his right to\n lead has been challenged continuously, first\n by one and then by another, but he has\n gone forward, fighting his way and winning.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Democrats w r ere in power when he\n came to leadership and for thirteen years he\n saw the state administered by them. During\n that time the Democracy gave to the United\n States a President, the first in a quarter of\n a century; two United States Senators, the\n first in half a century; a majority of the\n Congressional delegation, and it wrested\n from Republican control the Legislature of\n the state, a miracle in view of the existing\n apportionment.

To-day in Republican\n affairs in this state he is as complete and pow-\n erful a boss as is Richard Croker in Demo-\n cratic affairs within the County of New York\n and in the control of as perfect a political\n machine.\n</p>\n<p>\n There was a time, and it was during those\n barren thirteen years, when it was the fash-\n ion to deny Mr. Platt the possession of brains\n</p>\n<p>\n the man who has accomplished so much the\n possession of intellectual powers. The man-\n agement of a great political party which em-\n braces within its ranks men of the first\n ability, active, restless, aspiring men, long\n continued, argues in itself a first rate ability.\n It is true that during the past six years,\n which cover the period of his visible and\n greatest success, he has had the opportunity\n given him by Democratic management. The\n first was in that senseless nomination of\n Maynard, but it must be credited that Mr.\n Platt saw the opportunity and embraced it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Against this he was compelled as a party\n boss, to contend. The most potent and effi-\n cient means of success to a boss \u2014 patronage \u2014\n he had not. Outside of his party he had to\n meet in Governor Hill, intrenched in power,\n the wiliest, most astute and resourceful polit-\n ical manager of his time. Yet, notwithstand-\n ing these handicaps, at the end of the six\n years following those barren thirteen, the sit-\n uation is reversed in all respects. The state\n is administered in all its offices by Repub-\n licans; the majority of Congressional dele-\n gation is Republican; the Legislature is too\n abundantly Republican; the two Senators are\n</p>\n<p>\n and to write him down as a man of ordinary\n intelligence, whose only attributes were cun-\n ning and industry. This judgment, in these\n days when such abundant triumph has been\n his, is not heard so often. It never was a\n just judgment. Mr. Platt is not an orator,\n nor a phrase maker, nor a wit whose say-\n ings are passed from mouth to mouth. Spec-\n tacular as his career has been he is not spec-\n tacular himself. He is never seen before the\n public and is known to it only by his deeds.\n Perhaps no man wielding so much and the\n sort of power he does discusses public ques-\n tions so little.

Great problems of political\n economy have little attraction for him, but\n it will not do to say, that he is a Republican\n simply because accident threw him into the\n lines of that party in the beginning. He is\n a Republican because he couid not be a Dem-\n ocrat. He does not believe in Jeffersonian\n principles, and in early life became a con-\n vert to the Hamiltonian theory of politics.\n He is, therefore, a Republican by conviction.\n The sentimental contentions which, in the\n early history of the party, did so much to-\n ward setting it firmly on its feet, it is appre-\n hended appealed but little to him. He ac-\n cepted them as part of the creed he had\n \u2022embraced, but it was the theory of the cen-\n tralization of power and its removal from the\n source of it that enlisted his interests in the\n party that espoused it. The influence of this\n early conception can be traced through his\n public career. His mind is neither original\n nor conceptive, and it is not much of a risk\n to venture that during his senatorial career\n his name will not be associated with a meas-\n ure that has for its purpose a great reform\n or alteration of existing conditions. He will\n be found marching abreast with the progress\n of the day, but his inclination is to look upon\n existing conditions as proper and stable un-\n til they are so bad that remedy is immedi-\n ately necessary when he will engage in the\n work of such remedy with vigor and energy.\n His mind is not restless in its activity, seek-\n ing to alter things because it involves a\n change, but it must not, therefore, be argued\n that it is inert, rather it is of a conservative\n habit, slow to admit the necessity of change,\n iio is a man of strong convictions and an\n</p>\n<p>\n idea of action once determined upon is given\n a. vigor and force by him somewhat surpris-\n ing in contrast with his habitual self-re-\n straint. An illustration is made of this\n when his attitude and course as to the in-\n sertion of the word \u201cgold\u201d in the Republican\n platform of 1896 is pointed out.\n</p>\n<p>\n The strong side is shown in the courage\n of bis convictions. He may debate to the\n point of adoption of a conclusion, but that\n pcinr. passed, decisiveness follows. He is a man\n quick of apprehension and comprehension;\n his grasp of a question is ready and strong\n and his conclusions as to the right and the\n wrong of it rapid. An excellent judge of hu-\n man nature, he rarely makes a mistake\n as to men. As a rule his instruments and the\n men chosen by him to lead are well chosen\n and if there is criticism of this at times, it\n is well to look elsewhere than in his mind or\n judgment for the cause of his act \u2014 into cir-\n cumstances that have been over-powering.\n The quality of patience is his in a large de-\n gree. He can wait and pursue his end wheth-\n er it is vengeance or the accomplishment of\n a fixed purpose. Devotion to purpose is anoth-\n er characteristic strongly developed. It may\n have appeared in toe course of his career that\n he has abandoned a purpose, but it will be\n found in the end it was only a suspension.\n Persistency in following his purpose, it is\n well known to those who have been in close\n relations with the Senator, is a part of him.\n Mr. Platt is not an oak that will break before\n it will bend in the wind. But if he bends be-\n fore inevitable conditions, it is not because he\n has either abandoned his ideas or his inten-\n tions. He is convinced of the folly of butting\n one ' s head against a stone wall as a means\n of getting on the other side of it, but he is\n not thereby prevented from finding a way\n around it even if that way be tortuous. He\n has a very decided aptitude for intrigue and\n a faculty for concealing his movements and\n intentions. It is in these qualities that he\n has earned his reputation for cunning. He\n burrows deeply at times, and so deeply that\n he goes completely out of sight, but he often\n plays the game openly and above board as a\n chess player does, and with scientific skill.\n There was a notable instance of this in the\n way in which he forced Governor Roosevelt\n on the national ticket in spite of the Gov-\n ernor\u2019s desire and of the wishes of President\n McKinley. Iu fact, the inner Mr. Platt, in\n his relation to Roosevelt from the beginning\n is shown very clearly. He did not want Mr.\n Roosevelt for Governor. He knew that he\n would not be a handable man. Could he have\n seen a way to have set him aside without\n prejudicing the Republican cause he would\n have done so. The exploits of the aspirant\n on the hill of San Juan had appealed to the\n sentiments of the rank and file. Had the\n same situation been presented to Croker. he\n would have put the candidate on a seat in a\n manner indicative of his intention of having\n him remain there and controlled the conven-\n tion with a result possibly similar to that\n which followed his turning down of Hill in\n Chicago. Not so Platt. He saw the conse-\n quences of antagonizing the sentiment and de-\n mand of his party and bowed before it, but\n his determination was then made to be rid of\n the Colonel at the first opportunity. Ductili-\n ty \u2014 that is part of him. He has a long mem-\n ory, and he can wait, as those who have of-\n fended and opposed him have found out in the\n long run.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Platt is not unlike other successful\n \u201cbosses\u201d in lifting his party organization\n above principles. The success of that organi-\n zation, and of his hold upon it is of greater\n importance than the principles of his party\n</p>\n<p>\n and it is impossible to avoid the conviction,\n when his course of twenty years is closely\n examined, that he has squared principles to\n his rule of the party rather than squared his\n rule to principles. He looks upon principles\n as something to help the party to obtain and\n retain power rather than upon party as some-\n thing organized to advance and enforce prin-\n ciples.\n</p>\n<p>\n In manner he is bland, suave, tactful and\n mild. But under that pleasant surface is\n strong determination, an iron purpose and a\n powerful will. He lias the faculty of com-\n pletely concealing the operations of his mind\n and is so diplomatic in his methods that\n while he has been apparently frank and open\n in his conversation, one goes away rather\n pleased with the interview until he tries to\n recollect what there was significant enough in\n the talk of the Senator to remember. It is\n charged that the Senator is a man of few\n friendships and that few can count on bis af-\n fections. But if this is asserted it is also\n claimed that he is a man strong in grati ' ude\n and this his memory of services rendered is\n as long as that of injuries done him. On the\n other side, it is ' claimed that, he breaks from\n alliances that are no ionger of use to him po-\n litically with iittle regard for past relations or\n favors. and in substantiation of this his course\n in the campaign of 1884 is pointed out The\n friendship, helpful and ccr.atart, that R scoe\n Oonkling had given him in the previous years\n did not, prevent him from espousing the cause\n before the convention of that year of Oopk-\n iing ' s bitterest enemy, Blaine, whose action\n and influence had driven not only Get kling\n but himself from the Senate Chamber. If\n that is all that the charge is based on it will\n hardly stand. Mr. Plat ' , so long, as he was in\n alliance with Mr. Oonkling and acknowledged\n Mr. Oonkling as a leader, was true to him\n and remained true in times when nearly all\n of the ' other lieutenants proved failures.\n Three years had elapsed since Mr. 0 tikling\n had been active in political affairs. He had\n withdrawn from the political field entirely.\n The divisions in which ho played ah influen-\n tial part had nearly rent the party in twain\n and its continued supremacy was threareued.\n I ' here was a movement toward a healing of\n those differences and Mr. Piatt, who had\n undertaken the work of reorganization of\n the party in this stale, bowed to the trend of\n events and wisely took a long step toward the\n reconciliation of differences in going to the\n support of Mr. Blaine. On the contrary, the\n indications are that Mr. Platt has been dis-\n tinctly true to his word and alliances.\n</p>\n<p>\n He has been a forceful leader and a mas-\n terful one. Had he not been he would not\n now be a leader. There has not been a day\n since he took the reins of management that\n he has not had an element within the party\n in bitter opposition to him and more particu-\n larly upon the point of \u201cone-inau power,.\u201d\n He has accepted the attacks without reply\n and pursued his course to the end he sought\n with success, his strength growing with the\n years and the accumulation of attack. Dur-\n ing all this time there have been no accusa-\n tions worthy the name as to his want of\n personal honesty or of the use of the polit-\n ical power in his hands to advance his own\n material interests. None has been proved\n against him. He has not been a seeker of\n public place. Two terms in Congress, a few\n years in the rather insignificant office of\n quarantine commissioner and two elections\n to the United States Senate constitute all his\n office holding in forty years of political ser-\n vice.\n</p>\n<p>\n For a week or two there have been rumors\n current in the inner circle of his jt > rty that\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0070/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0070/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0070/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0070/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0070/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0070.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 825548}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"70\">\n<p>\n 68\n</p>\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n he has retired, or is preparing to retire, from\n active leadership.

The passing of the man from\n public life, which is actually the mean-\n ing of the recent refusal of the United\n States Senate to recognize his appoint-\n ment by Governor Stone as Senator from\n the State of Pennsylvania, has brought\n into review many of the events of his long\n career in politics and has recalled to public\n mind something of the character and methods\n of the man himself. That such a man should\n have dominated the politics of such a state\n as his for so many years may form food for\n serious reflection in the minds of those who\n dip below the surface in their study of our\n existing form of government.\n</p>\n<p>\n Quay is now a man of 67 and for forty-five\n years he had held public office, for a large\n portion of that time dominating the political\n affairs of Pennsylvania. A variety of charac-\n teristics in the man made such domination\n possibl-j. Critically, it may be said that his\n long continued success has been due to four\n factors: His wonderful ability to feel the\n popular pulse and to determine the exact\n status of public opinion, his iron will and in-\n vincible determination to succeed at all haz-\n ards regardless of cost, conscience or conse-\n quence; his extensive mastery of every art of\n the practical politician and his almost hyp-\n notic ability to control men of weaker minds,\n to force their absolute obedience and to make\n them the subservient followers of his for-\n tunes. He never had use for strong men,\n and for his allies and lieutenants always\n selected those weaklings whose opinions he\n could readily mold and alter at will and on\n whom he could rely implicitly to humbly do\n his bidding without question or protest.\n</p>\n<p>\n To those familiar with the man his phe-\n nomenal success for almost half a century is\n ^ne of the most inexplicable riddles of modern\n political life. Possessed of none of the mag-\n netism usually considered inseparable from\n .Under ship; ordinary, and even uncouth in ap-\n pearance, careless in speech and attire, pos-\n sessing no oratorical talents; opinionated, ar-\n rogant, self-centered, displaying an inordinaS:\n vanity and self confidence; intolerant of op-\n position, brusque and dictatorial, it is al-\n most incredible to conceive that for twenty\n</p>\n<p>\n years this man could have controlled 5,000,000\n people, in spite of their protests and oppo-\n sition.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nothing about the man was calculated to\n appeal to the popular intelligence, and he\n craftily refrained from appearing any oftener\n in public than was absolutely necessary, and\n rarely appeared at mass meetings and other\n gatherings. His cold, impassive, calculating\n face produced revulsion rather than enthu-\n siasm. No one would recognize him from his\n portraits, for he has always seen to it that\n they flattered him and modified natural de-\n fects.\n</p>\n<p>\n His eyes are large, and have a sleepy, pro-\n truding appearance, which reminds one un-\n pleasantly of a fish. Coarse of speech, lack-\n ing almost in common courtesy, he only tri-\n umphed through his iron will and supreme\n daring and boundless confidence in himself.\n</p>\n<p>\n Quay\u2019s policy of utilizing only such men in\n public office as he could absolutely control\n illustrates one of the striking traits of his\n character\u2014 an utter lack of even ordinary\n caution, a total disregard of public opinion\n and a determination to consult his own\n preferences alone. Indeed, he never hesi-\n tated to sneeringly flout the religious and\n moral element of the community with a daring\n little short of incredible. Most politicians\n and public men, regardless of what their pri-\n vate opinions may be, are usually careful to\n preserve and to sedulously avoid giving of-\n fense to the religious and Sabbatarian prin-\n ciples which form such an important element\n in the community.\n</p>\n<p>\n His contempt for newspapers, as purveyors\n of legitimate news to the public, is another\n detail in which Quay stands at radical vari-\n ance with other public men. Instead of cul-\n tivating the journalistic profession and as-\n sisting it whenever possible, with an\n amazing indifference as to what blight be\n said of him, Quay, on almost all occasions, is\n inaccesible to reporters and curtly refuses\n to be interviewed, even on matters of public\n importance in connection with which his\n constituents have a right to his posi-\n</p>\n<p>\n tion.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is significant that almost the entire Re-\n publican press of the state is steadfastly and\n absolutely opposed to him. Eight years ago\n in Philadelphia, for instance, he had several\n supporters, but his public life and private\n</p>\n<p>\n rudeness have gradually alienated them from\n him and out of the entire twelve daily Phil-\n adelphia papers only one remains loyal and\n espouses his interests.\n</p>\n<p>\n A glance at the career of this man, who\n achieved almost omnipotent power which\n only the United States Senate sufficed to\n break, will throw no little light upon his\n personality. He is of Scotch-Irish extraction\n and a native of Pennsylvania. He was a\n legitimate successor to the Cameron dynasty\n and first came into prominence in 1855, before\n many noted men of to-day had been born.\n His first appointment was as prothonotary of\n Beaver County. The succeeding year he was\n elected to the office, and in 1859 received the\n compliment of a re-election.\n</p>\n<p>\n After the war, in which he won his title of\n colonel, he was elected to the State Legis-\n lature from the district comprising Wash-\n ington and Beaver counties. It then began\n to dawn on the fertile mind of the astute\n Quay that politics was a congenial field for\n the exercise of his diversified talents. He\n had no regular means of support; he was a\n lawyer, but he never practiced, and, per-\n ceiving the remunerative possibilities of poli-\n tics, he finally resolved to make it his pro-\n fession, his life business, and to devote him-\n self exclusively to it as a means of liveli-\n hood.\n</p>\n<p>\n Few men enter public life with motives sc\n openly and apparently mercenary. Differing\n impulses usually animate men in taking up\n politics, some have the honest pride of states-\n manship and hope to be of value to the com-\n monwealth, others love the excitement ami\n others still yearn for the honors and the ap-\n plause of their fellow men. With Quay, how-\n ever, it was different and his subsequenl\n career has proven that he had no mistaken\n dreams of statesmanship or sentimental\n ideals. It w ' as business, pure and simple, thi\n cold, hard problem of dollars and cents that\n animated him in his struggle for politica 1\n supremacy, and a due deference to facts com-\n pels the admission that he made his vocatior\n pay. In his entire career, his name has no\n been identified with any measure calculated tc\n advance the public weal and even his mos\n sanguine admirers have never claimed foi\n him those lofty qualities and noble principles\n which should inhere in men selected foi\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0071/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 345, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 493}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0071/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 691, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 987}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0071/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1383, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1975}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0071/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2767, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3950}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0071/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0071.jp2", "height": 3950, "width": 2767, "levels": 6, "size": 924554}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"71\">\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n 69\n</p>\n<p>\n the discharge of public functions of trust\n and responsibility.\n</p>\n<p>\n With no visible means of support except\n his modest Senatorial salary he has amassed\n an immense fortune, owns a beautiful estate\n at Beaver and is accredited to have holdings\n aggregating many millions.

Speaker Reed, who has ju3t\n withdrawn from the public gaze, and though\n for years so situated that he could have made\n millions by betraying his trust, retires from\n Congress a poor man. The rugged honesty\n of Reed and his failure to embrace his op-\n portunities must furnish an interesting\n psychological problem to Mr. Quay.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1869, for a brief time. Quay edited the\n Beaver Radical, and when Governor Har-\n</p>\n<p>\n tranft was inaugurated he made Quay Secre-\n tary of State. He held that office until made\n Recorder of the City of Philadelphia and in\n 1885 was faceted State Treasurer by a ma-\n jority of 24,000.\n</p>\n<p>\n From then dates his greatest successes and\n he becomes a national figure. Elected United\n States Senator in 1887, to succeed John I.\n Mitchell, he was shortly afterward selected\n as chairman of the Republican National Com-\n mittee. His conduct of the first memorable\n Harrison-Cleveland campaign, was marked by\n a series of scandals which have not been\n surpassed since the Hayes-Tilden contest. It\n was openly charged that immense sums of\n money were expended in bribes in New York\n and Indiana and his adherents openly boasted\n of the cleverness with which Quay had man-\n</p>\n<p>\n aged to employ his enormous election fund\n in New York City.\n</p>\n<p>\n Although discredited by this performance\n with independent voters it nevertheless made\n him a hero with the heelers and smaller\n politicians and on his return home, he tight-\n ened his grip on Pennsylvania and inaugurat-\n ed that reign of absolute despotism which\n has only now been broken.\n</p>\n<p>\n His hold on the \u201cworkers,\u201d that disreputa-\n ble element, which has no business other than\n politics and which depends for its subsistence\n on the pickings of the public treasury, was\n simply phenomenal and the machine which\n he gradually organized and built up was prob-\n ably the most compact, powerful and ingeni-\n ous ever devised. Personal responsibility was\n the keynote and patronage the incentive. The\n machine was organized with all the complete-\n</p>\n<p>\n ness of an army and had its ramifications in\n every section of the state. In each county\n Quay placed one of his trusted lieutenants\n in charge and under him and strictly account-\n able were city bosses, ward leaders and divis-\n ion heelers.\n</p>\n<p>\n All these were held to strictest account by\n the boss, and if by chance the division, ward,\n city or county pulled away from its machine\n moorings and returned a majority against\n Quayism the various leaders received stern\n reproof and were frequently supplanted im-\n mediately without an opportunity for ex-\n planation. Appointments could come only\n through machine influence, and it was essen-\n tial to have the indorsement of the ward\n leader In order to stand the slightest chance\n of consideration, even for subordinate posi-\n</p>\n<p>\n tions. Through these methods the workers\n were kept in line, by judicious manipulation\n opposition was stifled and for fifteen years\n Quay was able to maintain his supremacy as\n absolute head of the dominant party in his\n state.\n</p>\n<p>\n In all this time he had been out of sym-\n pathy with the party and arbitrarily opposed\n its wishes. At the last three national con-\n ventions he manipulated the Pennsylvania\n delegation against the candidate who was the\n choice of the state and thereby nullified all\n the influence of tho banner Republican state\n in selecting a candidate.\n</p>\n<p>\n After McKinley ' s nomination he sulked for\n some time, and it was only through fear of\n losing prestige In the certain event of Mc-\n Kinley\u2019s election that he was at last placated\n and supported the regular candidate. These\n points are merely instanced to show how dar-\n ingly the man has opposed popular will even\n in his own party and relied on his all power-\n ful machine to pull him safely through. His\n constant defeats in national conventions, al-\n though he had the backing of at least sixty\n votes, shows how little real influence he had\n in national affairs.\n</p>\n<p>\n Always identified with corporation interests\n and being a considerable operator in stocks\n and speculative interests, the associate and\n sponsor for men of doubtful reputation or\n frequently actual convicted law breakers, it\n was inevitable that Quay himself should have\n been concerned in dubious transactions and\n have been brought to the bar of justice as an\n indicted offender.\n</p>\n<p>\n This occurred in October, 1898, and the sen-\n sational trial and its sinister developments\n are still fresh in the public memory. On Oc-\n tober 5, Senator Quay, his son, Richard R.\n Quay, and C. H. McKee, law partner of Lieu-\n tenant Governor Lynn, were held in $5,000 bail\n each to answer a charge of conspiracy to use\n commonwealth funds for their own uses, and\n with conspiring with. John S. Hopkins, the\n late cashier of the People ' s Bank, to unlaw-\n fully loan public moneys and with unlawful-\n ly using and employing the moneys of the\n People\u2019s Bank. Benjamin J. Haywood, for-\n mer state treasurer, was charged with the\n same offense, and a few days later entered\n $5,000 bail for his appearance to answer the\n charge.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the trial which followed letters and tel-\n egrams were adduced which proved conclu-\n sively that Quay had had extensive private\n dealings with the dead cashier and that he\n was a large speculator in stocks and made\n extensive use of his position and political\n connections to gain private information cal-\n culated to aid him in his financial ventures.\n In spite of his fervently protested claims of\n innocence Senator Quay did not stand boldly\n forth and demand vindication and insist that\n every scintilla of evidence against him be\n brought forth and disapproved.

The next came when he selected\n as candidate for high judicial honors, a dis-\n credited Philadelphian, whose career could\n not bear the light of investigation. In re-\n sponse to a popular demand and a protest\n which threatened to jeopardize the election\n of the whole ticket, Quay was compelled to\n withdraw him and appoint a man of unques-\n tioned reputation.\n</p>\n<p>\n The third of the train of disasters was\n even more crushing. Quay had always main-\n tained a vindictive enmity to the upright\n magistrate who had refused to be awed in\n the criminal case and held the mighty chief\n for trial to answer his accusers. When the\n time came for selecting candidates, Quay\n refused to permit the name of the magistrate\n in question to go upon the Republican ticket,\n although he is eoncededly the best equipped\n member of Philadelphia\u2019s minor judiciary\n and has a large following. Nothing daunted,\n however, the magistrate in question, Jermon,\n rested hia case with the people, and won in\n spite of all the efforts of Quay and his co-\n horts to down him. in view of his personal\n animus this defeat was peculiarly galling to\n Quay. His fourth and final defeat came at\n the hands of the United States Senate.\n</p>\n<p>\n .During his entire political career Quay ' s\n chief hold on the lower element of politicians\n has been the wonderful skill with which\n he managed to extricate himself from diffi-\n culties and avoid the damaging loss of pres-\n tige by open defeat. When danger threat-\n ened. he always managed to squirm safely\n out, and the result of his many escapes was\n a general confidence among his followers that\n the \u201cold man\u201d bore a charmed life and could\n not be downed.\n</p>\n<p>\n The summary dismissal of his claims by\n the Senate has proved the fallacy of this\n belief, and, following as it does sharply\n on the heels of the three other crushing\n defeats whi-h he has recently sustained in\n state fights, ba3 completely dispelled the old-\n time faith in his invincibility. Far-sighted\n politicians are already carefully looking over\n their fences in order to be ready for the\n radical changes which must inevitably ensue,\n and throughout the state it is recognized that\n the power of Quayism is at last broken and\n a new era is at hand.\n</p>\n<p>\n The passing of Quay from the seat of par-\n ty power is not merely local in interest, but\n</p>\n<p>\n is an event of national importance, and has\n philosophic value in demonstrating that no\n man, no matter how strong nor resourceful,\n can continue to ruthlessly defy public senti-\n ment without eventually meeting his Water-\n loo and falling a victim to popular resent-\n ment.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the state of Pennsylvania Quay\u2019s word\n was absolute, and for almost two decades he\n successfully resisted all attempts to oust him\n from power, Through his recognized and\n almost undisputed right to dictate all party\n nominations he made and unmade law ' s at\n will, and practically selected the officers,\n legislative, executive and even judicial.\n</p>\n<p>\n This self delegated power he exercised with\n au autocratic and peremptory hand. Only\n his tried, abject and servile henchmen, re-\n gardless of their lack of qualifications or fit-\n ness, were selected for oflice, and the fearless\n and ambitious citizen, too honest and too\n proud to bend the knee to the master, stood\n a very small chance of political preferment in\n the Keystone State.\n</p>\n<p>\n Through his mastery of every trick and de-\n vice known to political jugglery he gradu-\n ally built up the most ingeniously devised\n machine recorded in the nation\u2019s history. All\n the healthy activity of the minority, essential,\n according t.o al! authorities, to good gov-\n ernment, was crushed out with an iron hand.\n He vitiated the Democratic party in the state\n and made it practically useless as far as any\n public good was concerned. By clever prac-\n tices and the enactment of favoring ballot\n laws he increased in ten years the normal\n Republican majority from 25,000 to over 300,-\n 000, and finally by a supreme stroke of\n genius actually extended his domain over\n the remnant of the Democracy and made it\n an appendage to his own machine, a pliant\n and facile tool, always at his behest, and an\n invaluable assistant in tho achievement of\n his various schemes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Again and again independent movements\n were organized to defeat his candidates \u2014\n movements which would have succeeded had\n not the cunning Senator, ostensibly Repub-\n lican and a religious believer in the sanctity\n of party rule, tipped the word to his Demo-\n cratic allies and smothered the promising\n agitation in the bud.\n</p>\n<p>\n When Quay wanted Democratic help he had\n no trouble in ' getting it. In the memorable\n fight between Crow ' and present Mayor Ash-\n bridge for sheriff, at Quay\u2019s behest the Demo-\n crats indorsed the former and duly accred-\n</p>\n<p>\n ited Quay ' s candidate and the result was his\n election.\n</p>\n<p>\n These instanees are typical of his methods\n and of his utter lack of even the semblance\n of regard for consistency. When it suited his\n purpose to he regular and accept the party\n candidates he did so, but. vice versa, when\n he could profit more by repudiating the party\n nominees he was just as ready.\n</p>\n<p>\n Whenever the reputable element of the par-\n ty revolted at his selections of candidates\n manifestly unfit he and his adherents always\n maintained a clamor about regularity and\n termed their opponents party traitors, w r here-\n as his support of Crow, whose name appeared\n on the Democratic ticket, and his mysterious\n vote on the sugar schedule of the Wilson bill,\n which insured his success and was in oppo-\n sition to the position of every other Repub-\n lican in the Senate and at home, proved that\n party claims were to him only binding when\n it best served his advantage.\n</p>\n<p>\n What increases the mystery of his success\n is the fact that the Quay regime brought\n neither the people of Pennsylvania nor the\n party any benefits nor national recognition.\n Pennsylvania, under the ban of Quayism, has\n for yearn gotten practically nothing.\n</p>\n<p>\n During his senatorial incumbency Senator\n Quay never permitted his obligations to the\n State of Pennsylvania to interfere with either\n his business cr his pleasure. Whenever his\n private interests or his diversions necessitated\n his absence from the Senate, he left without\n the slightest compunction and on many occa-\n sions when matters of vital import were\n being discussed, the great State of Pennsyl-\n vania was entirely unrepresented. Indeed,\n this striking indifference to tho rights of his\n constituents was one of Quay ' s most marked\n characteristics, and ho wan always ready to\n absent himself for extended fishing trips ot-\n to come to Pennsylvania to look aEter his\n political fences.\n</p>\n<p>\n The downfall of Quay should inaugurate a\n new era for Pennsylvania, for it deprives\n machine polities of it ' s greatest master or, at \"\n least, almost totally nullifies his power for\n evil. It removes from public life a keen, re-\n sourceful manipulator of men and events,\n who made and unmade candidates at will\n and reigned over a sovereign state with the\n despotism of a Czar. It should give new\n life to honest opposition and encourage an\n aggressive Democratic, minority to maintain\n I hi ' fight for improved conditions in the Key-\n stone State.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0073/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 345, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 493}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0073/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 691, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 987}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0073/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1383, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1975}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0073/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2767, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3950}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0073/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0073.jp2", "height": 3950, "width": 2767, "levels": 6, "size": 665326}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"73\">\n<p>\n Thomas Brackett Reed.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBIG BRAINED, BIG BODIED AND BIG HEARTED,\n THE BIGGEST MAN IN THIS COUNTRY\u201d : : : : :\n</p>\n<p>\n T O be recognized as possible presidential\n timber early in his career is the\n worst thing that can befall the public\n man who has dreams of the distinction of oc-\n cupying the White House.\n</p>\n<p>\n Such was the state of Thomas Brackett\n Reed of Maine. He had not served the first\n session of his first term in Congress before\n he was recognized as presidential timber.\n Perhaps his predecessor in the speaker\u2019s\n chair from the same state, had recognized\n his qualities before his arrival in the national\n capital, but it did not take long for his com-\n peers of Congress to realize that a giant,\n mentally and morally, as well as physically,\n had come among them. All the mediocres\n scented danger; - individual ambition raised\n the red flag of warning, and individual ambi-\n tions rallied under it to repel the advance of\n an intruder in the domain they vainly im-\n agined their own. The war. covert, under-\n handed and concealed, began and the largest\n and best equipped man of the party of hi3\n political faith was denied his laudable\n ambition. A hornet may not be a President\n of the United States, but it can sting and\n when a sufficient number combine, they can\n sting to death.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Reed was not without honor, gained in\n his own state before ho went to Washington.\n In early manhood he was an assistant pay-\n master in the United States Navy, leaving\n the Navy, however, in 1864, returning to the\n city of his birth (Portland, Me.), where short-\n ly after he began practice of the law. He\n entered public life four years later in be-\n coming a member of the lower branch of the\n Maine Legislature. After two years\u2019 service\n in that house he was elected to the State\n Senate. In seven years of practice of the\n law he had gained such widespread recogni-\n tion of his legal ability that he was chosen\n Attorney General of the state. From 1874 to\n 1877 he was solicitor for the City of Portland\n and in 1876 was elected to Congress, taking\n his seat in that of 1877, since which time, or\n until March 3, 1899, a period of twenty-two\n years, he was without intermission a member\n of the House of Representatives, and, as\n Speaker, presided over eight sessions.\n</p>\n<p>\n Early taking high rank in the house as\n a keen, subtle and able debater, Mr. Reed\n was regarded as a formidable foe and a pow-\n erful and resourceful ally in all the discus-\n sions taking possession of the House, yet he\n was not considered an orator. Such he was\n not then and such he is not to-day; nature\n has denied him some necessary physical\n qualities and some of the attributes of the\n oratorical temperament. Literary quality he\n</p>\n<p>\n has, but not the fervid and glowing imagina-\n tion that lifts to eloquent height, and his\n voice, drawling in its accents and nasal in\n its tones, is decidedly against a reputation\n for oratory. But, in marvelous clearness of\n statement, keen searching analysis, in power\n of argument, in that peculiar activity of mind\n which enables him to keep abreast with the\n shifting currents of debate, in readiness in\n meeting unexpected attack, in a marvelous\n memory that enables him to summon for ' in-\n stant use all he has read, or heard, or has\n seen of the subject under debate, in wonder-\n ful facility of retort, and in extraordinary\n ingenuity in turning the trend to the ad-\n vantage of his own contention, during the\n long term of his service he was without su-\n perior \u2014 indeed without equal.\n</p>\n<p>\n Pre-eminently he is a debater, and when\n on the floor, ever ready for the fray into\n which he seemed to rush with joyousness, he\n was an antagonist to be feared with whom\n only the most valiant of the opposition\n crossed lances, and then, only, when armed\n and equipped and fairly sure of their ground.\n He was the leader of his party and dominated\n it. In tue Speaker ' s chair, when elevated\n to it, he was a force and a power beyond that\n which had before been known. The office of\n Speaker in any hands is a powerful office.\n In the hands of a man of force and power\n who can wield the majority and discipline it\n into the subjection that this Speaker did it\n is omnipotent.\n</p>\n<p>\n Physically. Mr. Reed is a large man, big\n in frame, tall of stature, and heavy in avoir-\n dupois. His head is large and round\n with a towering forehead, rising to a con-\n spicuous dome where the phrenologist locates\n the moral organs. His face is in utter con-\n tradiction to the rest of his make up and\n a contradiction in itself. His nose is in-\n significant, denying from the physiognomist\u2019s\n standpoint that purpose which is unquestion-\n ably a leading characteristic of the man. But\n the eyes above it in their blue lights flash\n with power and control. The first impres-\n sion is that the face is infantile, but it quick-\n ly passes with study when under the folds\n of flesh the square jaw is observed/ Alto-\n gether his is an impressive personality and\n with continued observation faith in the man\n grows and, as well, the sense that he is far\n from, being a dangerous man in public life,\n however forceful he may be. In his carriage\n there is dignity without arrogance and an\n affability which, however, does not invite\n undue familiarity.\n</p>\n<p>\n The cast of Mr. Reed\u2019s mind is philosophic.\n The bigness and breadth of his body are re-\n produced in his brain and the repose and de-\n</p>\n<p>\n liberate movements of his body find their\n correlative in the meditative and ruminative\n habit of his mind. Mr. Reed is a profound\n thinker, searching and exploring a subject\n under consideration to its last end and corner.\n But this is not to convey the idea that he\n is slow and deliberate in his processes. Upon\n the contrary, they are astonishingly rapid.\n</p>\n<p>\n Naturally quick as his mind and perceptions\n am, this instantaneous grasp of a new sub-\n ject, or of a phase remote or perhaps recon-\n dite, which so often astonished his colleagues,\n is to be explained rather in that he is a\n profound student and an omnivorous reader\n than in the abnormal comprehension with\n which he is credited. Abstruse and profound,\n indeed, must that subject be that Mr. Reed\n has not explored and knowledge of which he\n has not stored away. A member of the\n House, himself a man of literature, relates\n that occasion arising where he was to pro-\n nounce an oration abroad, in his preparation\n he had stumbled on a term and an incident,\n he could not pass by, but of which he had no\n knowledge. After having searched the books\n of reference of the Congressional Library\n and applied to all the scholars of the House,\n without enlightenment, he finally, in despair,\n applied to the Speaker to be instantly in-\n formed it was an incident of the legendary\n period of Roman history with so full an ex-\n position as to make further search unnec-\n essary.\n</p>\n<p>\n Yet the fact of that learning is not so\n commonly known. Indeed, Mr. Reed rarely\n makes a display of it, rather he seems to\n avoid its exhibition, nor is it often that it\n is manifested in his speeches. Yet occa-\n sionally, when absorbed in a subject under\n discussion that has taken possession of him,\n it will gush forth in a pure stream filtered\n through his thought and meditation. His vo-\n cabulary is ample, and, as his mental impres-\n sions are vivid, there is a precision and con-\n ciseness in his utterances that give a sense\n of great vigor notwithstanding a slowness of\n speech and the suggestion of a whine, the\n consequence of a nasal habit.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Reed is sometimes regarded as a hu-\n morist. He is far from being such, though\n his sense of humor is not small. It is diffi-\n cult to understand where this idea gained\n ground. It is not seen in his speeches or\n public utterances. The record will be\n searched in vain for a specimen of sustained\n humor, such as S. S. Cox or Proctor Knott\n would give expression to. Even humorous\n shafts are infrequent. Such humor as\n makes its appearance in his conversation is\n in the shape of trivial persiflage.\n</p>\n<p>\n That the ex-Speaker might be called a wU\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0074/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0074/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0074/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0074/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0074/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0074.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 881161}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"74\">\n<p>\n STUDIES IX AMERICAN CHARACTER\n</p>\n<p>\n could be understood, but such a designation\n would not be accurate either.

He has method; is rapid and accu-\n rate in his judgment, and is an almost in-\n tuitive reader of human nature.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Reed entered Congress nearly a quarter\n \u2022f a century ago, a poor man. After twenty-\n two years of service, during which oppor-\n tunities presented themselves because of his\n potential position, no doubt, which, em-\n braced by him, would have made him rich\n beyond the dreams of avarice, he left Con-\n gress quite as poor in money as he entered\n it. During his long service, conspicuous as it\n was, in the constant battle engendering angry\n passions and desires for revenge, not a breath\n of scandal, not a suspicion, has touched his\n garments. \u201cEssentially honest\u201d, is the tes-\n timony of a political opponent who sat with\n him twelve years in the House. There is no\n hypocrisy in the man, nor has he been\n charged with shiftings, double dealings,\n tergivasation or bad faith, frequent charges\n in the political world. The charges and com-\n plaints made have been of practices the very\n reverse \u2014 of high-handed exercise of power,\n a straightforward seeking of the end in view,\n regardless of the rights of the minority; of\n a brutal frankness of motive and intention,\n ruthlessly executed. He said, and thereby\n brought condemnation on his head, that the\n House of Representatives was no longer a\n deliberative body. It was the truth, as every\n student of large legislative assemblies knows.\n</p>\n<p>\n He who knows Tom Reed knows that his\n invariable honesty would prevent him from\n increasing his income by an illegitimate use\n of his office and that the sturdy independence\n of his character would prevent him from sub-\n mitting to the dominion of debt. Hence he\n squared his duties to the circumstances and\n evaded as much as possible the social side\n of the national life. Yet for that life he was\n well equipped and with an undoubted in-\n clination toward it. Normally, Mr. Reed is\n a most agreeable man, genial, kindly, pre-\n ferring to grant rather than deny favors, af-\n fable and approachable.\n</p>\n<p>\n A man of many acquaintances, he Is one of\n few intimacies and fewer friendships; as to\n the latter, he follows the advice of Polonius,\n and \u201cgrapples them to his soul with hooks of\n steel\u201d ; but, so grappled, does not. give such\n friends license to expect undue favors. It\n will be further observed that the society he\n</p>\n<p>\n affects and the friendships he cherishes are\n of those who can bring contributions to the\n intellectual feast. There is nothing austere\n about the man, nothing of the ascetic, for he\n is appreciative of the good things of the\n earth, but neither is he self-indulgent.\n</p>\n<p>\n He is endeared to the thinking element of\n his party rather than to the political. The\n latter knows that in the White House he\n would be dominant, masterful, sw T aying, not\n swayed, and a most unhandible quantity,\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2014 that of lawyer. Less, of course, is known\n of him on that side, but those who claim to\n have knowledge insist that he is as strong in\n it as he has shown himself to be in public\n life.

Hostility to him,\n hov/ever, has never meant lack of respect\n for his abilities or his honesty. In fact, a\n transparent honesty, which is admitted, even\n by his enemies, in thought and action is one\n of the distinguishing characteristics of the\n man.\n</p>\n<p>\n Although Roosevelt has so distinct a per-\n sonality, he cannot easily be set down in\n black and white, pen-pictured for the instruc-\n tion and satisfaction of posterity and for the\n curiosity of his contemporaries. He must\n be known. Even those who know him best\n and love him most have their diffculties;\n for they have scarce time to understand his\n action of to-day before being astonished at\n his attitude on the morrow. At once lovable\n and forbidable, vindictive and tender, forgiv-\n ing and relentless, he is apparently a tangle\n of inconsistencies, a paragon of perfection, a\n disappointment and a hero.\n</p>\n<p>\n Those who have studied Governor Roose-\n velt\u2019s character declare that he owes his suc-\n cess to a combination of qualities which usu-\n ally impel a man to the front rank. They say\n that the most prominent and valuable of\n these qualities are ambition, enthusiasm, en-\n ergy, industry, sincerity, determination, a\n practical common sense and an almost boyish\n egotism. The secret of his prominence, they\n hold, is his ambition to become a great con-\n structive statesman and his ability to back\n this laudable desire with his other mental\n and moral resources.\n</p>\n<p>\n His admirers \u2014 and he has many \u2014 look upon\n him as a national tonic and draw many les-\n sons, all in the superlative, from his career.\n</p>\n<p>\n The young American, they say, has been\n taught that prominence in affairs of state can\n only be achieved by the use of methods unfit\n for gentlemen. The best and the ablest\n young men have either sought fame outside\n politics or have felt that custom and usage\n permitted them to play the game of politics\n unscrupulously. Roosevelt has shown them\n that it is as possible to adopt the gentleman\u2019s\n motto \u2014 \u201cFair play and the rigor of the game\u201d\n \u2014 to politics as to anything else. His suc-\n cess, therefore, these enthusiasts claim, is\n an inspiration to young men and will make\n itself felt in the next generation of. public\n men.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of these ardent disciples summed this\n matter up the other day in the following\n rather didactic way:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHere,\u201d said he, \u201cis a man who is the\n ideal of the young man of America more than\n any other living man. These young fellows,\n BUT coming politicians and statesmen, thrill\n</p>\n<p>\n with a fine, manly affection for him. They\n call him Teddy and talk about his fighting\n ability, and love him for it. His success is\n a more healthy inspiration for them than the\n tinkling rhymes of a hundred poets or the\n dreams of a thousand philosophers. The pol-\n iticians tell them that trickery is necessary\n in politics \u2014 and they see a man who, without\n tricks, has beaten the politicians to their\n knees. Their friends excuse lying and decep-\n tion in politics \u2014 and they see a man who has\n courage enough not to lie. They are told\n that the bosses control the parties \u2014 and they\n see a man who has compelled his boss to do\n his bidding. They are told by the idealists\n that politics are smirching \u2014 and they see a\n man whose honesty and good faith have\n never been questioned. The reformer tells\n them that the man who is a part of a political\n machine is a slave \u2014 and they see a man who\n recognizes the machine and its leaders and\n who forces it and them to do his will. The\n machine politician tells them that the re-\n former is a areamer and a crank \u2014 and they\n see a practical reformer, a man who\n combines \u2018God\u2019s own common sense\u2019 with\n a high ideal. They are told that the\n man who succeeds must veer and twist\n with the wind of popular caprice \u2014 and they\n see a man with enough determination and\n courage to bring people to his own way of\n thinking. In short, in the view of young\n men, Theodore Roosevelt is to politics what\n Rudyard Kipling is to literature \u2014 a revela-\n tion and a revolution; personified honesty,\n sincerity and strength, which have been pow-\n erful antidotes to corruption and degenera-\n tion.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This is the view of an enthusiast; yet it\n shows why Roosevelt is the idol of young\n men: and it is this popularity and their be-\n lief in him. in his intentions and in his star,\n which have enabled him to attain his present\n position. If retained, he would be a rash\n prophet who ventured to predict when Roose-\n velt\u2019s career will cease to mount upward.\n</p>\n<p>\n Not many years ago this Colonel of the\n Rough Riders, this Governor of the Empire\n State, was a lad whose delicate frame and\n lack of health seemed to indicate that he\n would never be more than a semi-invalid.\n Yet, from a weakling, he has become\n a man whose energy is rival to his\n power of will, and whose will is strong\n enough to withstand the prompting of\n unlimited ambition when right has seemed\n less advantageous than wrong. And this\n fight against a discouraging constitution and\n the victory which a wild life upon the plains\n gave to him was the making, the building\n up of a courage that often seems more than\n courage. It is the audacity of a man who\n</p>\n<p>\n knows no failure and sees in every setback\n the encouragement, the very necessity for\n renewed effort.\n</p>\n<p>\n No one can be with Roosevelt and not feel\n the energy, the motive power that lies with-\n in him. At rest, or rather during the period\n v/hich nearest approaches the state of rest\n in his nervous organization, he seems to\n pulsate with the desire to move. He is like\n some engine that has stopped for a time\n and whose puffs of steam tell of the pant-\n ing power stored up in it. Those who follow-\n ed Roosevelt the candidate through the\n Bowery, and saw him, an animated statue\n on a carriage, crushed round with humanity,\n felt the man\u2019s resistless energy. It was not\n altogether the things he said. It was the\n way he said them. What energy, strength,\n dominating will and courage of conviction\n he brought to his work. No one cared what\n he was saying. They knew that he meant\n whatever he said. Even his grin was grit per-\n sonified. What a grasp of the hand he gave,\n and how well the glance of the eye went with\n it. That was \u201cTeddy\u201d triumphant, \u201cTeddy\u201d\n the soldier.\n</p>\n<p>\n But he is Governor now. Men as gov-\n ernors are not always like men as soldiers,\n rough riders or campaign orators. At Wikoff\n he wore a slouch hat and round his neck\n was a rough handkerchief. Governors wear\n high silk hats and dress conventionally as\n dignified officers of the state. Somehow,\n Roosevelt in a high silk hat does not seem to\n the average man at all like \u201cTeddy.\u201d In the\n executive chamber, however, he shows as lit-\n tle regard for the conventionalities of dress\n as his mind shows for the distinctions of\n class or differences In social and political\n positions. To Theodore Roosevelt, the man,\n woman or child to whom most deference is\n due is the man, woman or child to whom\n the moment is devoted.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is something so democratic about\n Roosevelt that it is hard at times to remem-\n ber that he is a governor. No one doubts the\n ability or the power that lies in him. That is\n conveyed in a sort of atmosphere of vigor, of\n intellectual and physical strength. There\n is never anything of the snob about him;\n never even that indifferent air of superiority\n that very naturally surrounds a man of high\n office. He can always find something^to in-\n terest him even in the smallest page who\n brings him a message or in the most awe-in-\n spired of the street urchins who tip their hats\n to him as he goes by. He rarely rides to and\n from the Executive Mansion. Instead of tak-\n ing the elevators in the Capitol, he walks up\n the tremendous flight of marble steps that\n runs from the park to the second story.

When Mrs.\n Roosevelt is not there, Miss Roosevelt pre-\n sides. Her mother is as charming in the un-\n conscious interest she takes in all a? Mrs.\n Cleveland was in the White House. There\n is, indeed, an unmistakable charm about this\n whole household, over which the Governor\n presides when not at the Capitol. The guest\n at the table may have wine, even stronger, if\n he wishes \u2014 and cigars; yet the host takes\n neither one nor the other. Indeed, the vis-\n itor is not a guest, whether his station in\n life be low or high. He is a member of the\n family. And that family is interested in\n everything he says. There is no half hearted\n welcome there, no forced hospitality about it.\n There is more than affability in it all. When\n one is introduced for the first time to Mrs.\n Roosevelt, or to the Governor, he cannot help\n feeling that he is an object of no little inter-\n est to them. He has, perhaps, met the same\n cordiality from other public officials and their\n wives. But there is a difference. He goes\n away satisfied that this time the greeting was\n net one of mere formality. If he has had a\n story to tell to the Governor he knows that it\n has been heard and absorbed. Perhaps that\u2019s\n why they say that Roosevelt is magnetic. The\n writer has seen a page boy leave the side of\n the Governor with the fervent remark: \u201cSay,\n ain\u2019t Teddy a peach?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This is not familiarity. That same boy\n would run seven miles for the Governor and\n be willing to punch the boy rvho said any-\n thing disrespectful. But he has left the Gov-\n ernor with the impression that he has known\n him for a long time and the Governor is glad\n of it. \u201cTeddy,\u201d therefore, is a natural conse-\n quence in the boy\u2019s nomenclature.\n</p>\n<p>\n That same interest in men is taken in ani-\n mals and things. The writer was walking\n once with the Governor from the executive\n mansion and was descending the hill on\n Eagle street. Governor Roosevelt was deep\n in a discussion of the war in the Transvaal\n and the possible effect it might have upon\n the campaign the coming fall. Two sturdy\n but tired horses were striving to haul a\n heavy load up the ice covered street. One\n slipped. Immediately the Governor stopped\n and with that absorbed expression on his\n face that he shows when deeply interested\n watched the horse regain his feet. The\n horses stumbled again on the Ice.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cStop a moment,\u201d the Governor said to the\n driver. \u201cDrive sideways.\u201d The driver did\n not Beem to recognize the executive. He\n was about to say something unpleasant -when\n the Governor caught his eye. Then the man\n zigzagged his horses up the hill past the ice\n with never a word. The grim look in Roose-\n velt\u2019s face disappeared just as quickly as it\n came and the next moment he had tipped his \u00bb\n hat to a tiny tot who saluted in regular mili-\n tary fashion.\n</p>\n<p>\n Roosevelt Is by nature a fighter. He has\n all the stubborn tenacity that was inherited\n with his Dutch blood, coupled with an al-\n most Celtic willingness to combat anyone or\n anything, anyhow or anywhere he deems\n proper and necessary. There is no doubt that\n much of the credit he obtained for rushing\n up San Juan hill does not belong to him and\n surprised no one more than himself. He\n knew there was someone to fight on the top\n of that hill and the sooner he could get there\n the better pleased he was. It was character-\n istic of the man and entirely consistent with\n his career when he lamented that \u201cthere was\n not war enough to go round.\u201d Nevertheless,\n there is always purpose in his action. Nor\n</p>\n<p>\n can it be said that selfishness has had a\n prominent part in his impulses. When he\n fought against two parties to push through\n the bills giving Controller Coler the right to\n pass upon prices paid by departments for\n goods purchased and supervision in the con-\n fession of judgments the leaders of his party\n came to him and said:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Governor, you are building up a powerful\n rival to you for next fall.\u2019 ' '\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMaybe so,\u201d he said, \u201cbut he is right and\n he\u2019s going to have those bills if I can get\n them through for him.\u201d And he got them\n through. Again, two of his best friends in\n</p>\n<p>\n the Legislature, Speaker Nixon and Leader\n Allds, came to him and begged him not to\n force through the canal appropriation bill.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt is suicide to do it,\u201d they pleaded, \u201cfor\n it will lose votes for you among the farmers\n and in the districts that elected you. It is\n ungrateful and extremely bad politics.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Governor appreciated their argument,\n and did not say they were wrong In resent-\n ing it. He simply shook his head and said:\n \u201cYou are right, but this is a case where the\n fe.v must give way for the benefit of the\n many. I realize that /-it seems unjust to the\n farmers to be taxed for improvements that\n will bring produce from the West to com-\n pete with them, but the whole state must be\n</p>\n<p>\n considered, and this is in the line of com-\n mercial progress. It must go through.\u201d And\n it went through.\n</p>\n<p>\n Roosevelt cannot be called a clever poli-\n tician. Not too infrequently he attempted\n to do too much, and, as Artemus Ward\n would say, he did it. With all his confidence\n in himself, he is almost boyishly trustful of\n the men he deems worthy of his confidence.\n Indeed, with his frankness and almost youth-\n ful faith in men whom he has not known to\n be dishonest, he has committed grievous er-\n rors. There is something absolutely beyond\n understanding in that part of the Governor\u2019s\n</p>\n<p>\n nature. His political critics describe it as\n craft and the \u201cwillingness to pay political\n debts at the cost of public welfare.\u201d His\n friends believe it to be a phase of his char-\n acter \u2014 and regret its sometimes unfortunate\n consequences. Whatever may be the cause\n or meaning of the trait, it certainly detracts\n from his reputation for political sagacity, and\n leaves him far behind his predecessors as a\n judicial governor. It led to the retirement of\n Dr. Truman J. Backus, to political enmities,\n and to the signing of bills that did not add\n to his record as a reformer. This trait un-\n doubtedly detracts something from his force\n as a moving cower in American politics. He\n can forget an injury but not a debt.

Roooe-\n velt is not a reformer in that sense, whatever\n he may have been years ago. He is a firm\n believer in organization and has only con-\n tempt for the men who carp and croak at the\n corruptions of politics while they sit com-\n fortably before their fires at home and let\n the men they criticise run the primaries. \u201cI\n have more respect for the unholy heeler and\n his work than I have for the parlor politician\n and hie lament,\u201d he says. \u201cReporters, office\n holders, bosses, leaders, lobbyists, all are do-\n ing their part, good or bad, but they are doing\n it. They have their sleeves rolled up and are\n at work building the foundations for the\n structure of the future. Give me the man\n who acts, who works, and I\u2019ll guarantee to\n see hie work is well done.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Yet Roosevelt admires and earnestly be-\n lieves in personal independence, not only in\n the office holder, but in the man who bae\n but his vote to control. No man appreci-\n ates more than he the rapacity, the self-in-\n terest and corruptness that prompt too\n many moves of the political bosses. He be-\n lieves in organization because he has the in-\n stinct of a soldier and can see no result\n of permanent value achieved without active\n numbers working in unison to effect it. But\n he is not a martinet, and has no faith in men\n who have not minds of their own. It was to\n Assemblymen Morgan and Price of Brooklyn,\n two young legislators to whom he took a\n great fancy, that he said at the beginning of\n the last session: \u201cIf you choose to he cattle\n I must consult your driver. Be men and I\n want your advice.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n He consults Senator Platt because he knows\n him -to be the leader of the state organiza-\n tion, in whose hands the majority of the ac-\n tive Republ ' cans see fit to leave the machin-\n ery of politics. There is no doubt that he\n has taken the Senator\u2019s advice in many mat-\n ters. There is equal truth in the statement\n that he has refused to take his advice in\n many more matters and has thoroughly en-\n joyed the resultant struggle. With a chuckle\n that is as essentially a part of his make-up\n as his mysterious and famous grin, he once\n sail to a group of friends: \u201cI\u2019vo enjoyed be-\n ing Governor. Indeed, I believe I\u2019ve had a\n ruu for my money. I\u2019ve had a hot time and\n I liked it.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The stubborn determination of the man\n was shown as strongly as anywhere in the\n Payn controversy. Roosevelt believed L ou\n Payn to bo the wrong man to hold the pow-\n erful office of insurance superintendent. He\n \u201cspoke softly\u201d to Chairman Odell and Sena-\n tor Platt of his intentions, while the \u201cbig\n stick\u201d of the South African forest which he\n carried was carefully concealed. He asked\n them to name a good, honest, representative\n</p>\n<p>\n and capable man who would he agreeable to\n him and to the organization, as Mr. Payn\u2019s\n successor. Mr. Platt simply said in his cold,\n calm, commanding way that Payn was to re-\n main. Roosevelt showed his teeth and left\n for Albany. Later on Mr. Platt suggested a\n man who would have been the counterpart of\n Payn. Roosevelt\u2019s \" no\u201d caused rumors of a\n split in the Republican party, of threats of\n refusal to renominate and other dire things,\n while Payn uttered a defiance and declared he\n could not be removed. Roosevelt savagely\n grinned and sent for some of the Democratic\n senators. That was the beginning of the end.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Governor has been asked why he has\n helped to add to the power of \u201cthe presiding\n genius,\u201d by consulting him at all. He replied:\n \u201cSuppose I were to build an engine, perfect\n in every detail, except that I left no room for\n the motive power. What good would that\n engine be? Suppose I appoint a man who is\n absolutely distasteful to the organization,\n hated by the leaders and not liked by the\n rank and. tile of the party. Can I expect to\n have him confirmed? Suppose I appoint\n charter revision commissioners who are sat-\n isfactory neither to the Democratic nor Re-\n publican party organizations. Is there much\n chance of their work being accepted by the\n Legislature? There is a happy medium in all\n things.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n His desire to strengthen the organization\n has undoubtedly led him to sign bills which\n were purely political in character. He be-\n lieved that when they did not rob the state\n they were fair in political warfare. In this\n he has disappointed not a few independents.\n</p>\n<p>\n Fighter though he is, Roosevelt does not\n fight unfairly. There have been Governors\n who have forced votes in the Legislature by\n threats to hold up the bills of recalcitrant\n Senators or Assemblymen. There were those\n even among the recognized reform element\n who argued that this was fair in war, and al-\n most begged him to drive some of the Sen-\n ators into line on the Payn matter. But\n Roosevelt stendiiy refused. \u201cT/iese bills\n belong to their constituents and to the pub-\n lic,\u201d he said, \u201cand J have no right to delay,\n much less to defeat them. As I cannot do this\n it would be unfair to threaten them. I must\n win on the merits of the case itself, or not at\n all. But I will win.\u201d Subsequently he had\n occasion to call sternly to account an over\n zealous employe of the state, who tried to\n help him in just that way.\n</p>\n<p>\n If there Is any characteristic of Roosevelt\n more marked than another. It is hie relish for\n work. During the legislative session he was\n in the executive chamber from early morning\n until 6 in the evening. Each morning the\n barber came in and while he lathered the\n Governor\u2019s face or plied the razor the latter\n dictated part of his tremendous correspond-\n ence. Even Sundays were devoted, save for\n the morning attendance at church, to con-\n ferences over affairs of state at the Executive\n Mansion. Yet, somehow, and no one under-\n stood how, Roosevelt managed to gain time\n to write his \u201cLife of Cromwell\u2019\u2019 and a number\n of essays on various topics.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many men say that Roosevelt would havd\n been a better executive if he had put forth\n</p>\n<p>\n ail his energy on the one work at hand.\n They declare that it is all very well for a\n man to write essays on good government,\n tell how to ruu police forces, compile his-\n tories and study out lives of Cromwell while\n he edits a magazine and runs the greatest\n state in the greatest republic in the world\n at the same time, but that he would run the\n state better if he did not try to do other\n things at the same time. They do not know\n the man. Some men of business enterprise,\n men of office or of literature relax the brain\n by playing whist, golf or polo; by angling\n for bass, casting for trout, shooting deer, by\n bicycling or riding. Roosevelt rests the\n executive bumps in his head by writing or\n speechmaking and by playing politics. He\n loves outdoor sports, too.\n</p>\n<p>\n Roosevelt is an ambitious man and natur-\n ally could not be content with the vice pres-\n idency. because it is not a creative position.\n Such a thing as the governorship of the Phil-\n ippines would be acceptable to him because\n of its wider possibilities. He likes to meet\n and combat new conditions and to solve\n new riddles. The harder the task, the great-\n er the joy to him. He i3 as devoid of intrigue\n an a new born child. Government under a\n blanket has no charm for him, and he can\n see no virtue in it. He believes in publicity,\n and fears no criticism. What would be incon-\n sistency in any other man, seems perfectly\n natural in him. \u201cGentlemen,\u201d he said to the\n diners at a legislative banquet, \u201cbrutality,\n dishonesty and corruption have caused the re-\n peal of the Horton boxing law, and I favor\n that repeal, but I would like to see one good\n fight before it goes into effect.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n So much did he favor publicity in govern-\n ment that he v, as the first of the governors\n to really recognize the newspaper correspond-\n ents as a part of the machinery of govern-\n ment at Albany. He not only told them all\n he knew of every matter that had reached\n a stage where it might he made public, but\n he never failed to ask the newspaper men for\n information of certain bills in the Legisla-\n ture. Many a bill met its fate at the hands\n of that council of sharp, trained newspaper\n men, who often knew more than the Gov-\n ernor about the purposes and forces behind\n legislation. He trusted each man implicitly,\n but a betrayal of trust was never forgiven by\n him.\n</p>\n<p>\n Secretary Youngs declares that the happi-\n est moments of the Governor ' s administration\n were the fifteen minute talks with the re-\n porters, morning and afternoon.\n</p>\n<p>\n Possibly those heart to heart talks will\n never occur again, even if Roosevelt should\n be Governor next year. There was no one in\n that group of forty or fifty correspondents\n who attended the conference who broke the\n confidence imposed. However they looked\n upon him politically, each one of those men\n admired him as a man. But by repetition\n outside, or by mere inadvertence, the remarks\n of the Governor, misconstrued by repetition,\n were printed now and then in garbled form\n and hurt him In the opinion Of some of hia\n intimate friends it is well that they are to\n stop. Yet they were characteristic of the\n frank, blunt, almost boyish way of the man.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0078/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0078/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0078/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0078/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0078/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0078.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 735683}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"78\">\n<p>\n Andrew Carnegie.\n</p>\n<p>\n A MAN WHO HAS WON DISTINCTION\n IN MANY FIELDS OF ACTIVITY. : : :\n</p>\n<p>\n [ T seems to be characteristic of the men\n of distinction of this country, as a rule,\n that they have more than one side to\n vhlch their eminence may be ascribed. In-\n leed, there are some who have so many\n sides and of such equal value that it is\n iifflcult to determine accurately what side\n ,t is that has been potent in winning the\n fame enjoyed. A notable instance of a many-\n sided man is Chauncey M. Depew. To which\n af the many is his peculiar distinction due?\n To the oratorical, embracing the airy humor\n of the dinner table and the stately rhetoric\n )f great occasion, the administrative that has\n helped to make him a power in the transpor-\n tation world, or to the deliberative that in the\n political council chamber has made him one\n of the great leaders of his party? William\n C. Whitney was a celebrity in public affairs\n before he discovered his other side in finan-\n cial operation. But he proves the statement.\n Theodore Roosevelt is another who keeps us\n guessing whether he should be admired most\n in the realm of politics or of that- of litera-\n ture; whether he is to be best remembered as\n the author of \u201cThe Winning of the West\u201d or\n as the reluctant wielder of the gavel of the\n Senate. Even Croker appeals to fame as a\n runner of horses, as well as the ruler of New\n i ' ork, while his pet enemy. Dr. Parkhurst, is\n more widely known to fame as a reformer\n :han he is in his chosen profession as a\n pulpiteer. And critics insist that if Joseph\n Jefferson had not been so prosperous as an\n actor that he was not compelled to sell his\n pictures he would have won equal fame as a\n pictorial artist.\n</p>\n<p>\n This many sidedness so characteristic of\n the American man of affairs is conspicuously\n shown in Andrew Carnegie. It has not re-\n quired the formation of the gigantic steel\n combination to introduce Mr. Carnegie to the\n American public. His biographer doubtless\n would classify him as a manufacturer, but it\n is a large question whether the greater part\n of the American people did not come to know\n him first as an author \u2014 as the writer of\n \u201cTriumphant Democracy.\u201d As well, too, his\n biographer might put him down as a philan-\n thropist. Certainly, after the revelations of\n the past few weeks, he can be written down\n a capitalist and one of the largest in the\n world.\n</p>\n<p>\n But whether he be classified as a manufac-\n turer, a philanthropist, a capitalist or an au-\n thor, Andrew Carnegie is a very interesting\n personage. He is distinctively an American,\n though born in Scotland, for his beginning\n</p>\n<p>\n and development were wholly American. He\n was hardly out of swaddling clothes w r hen his\n parents put the hills of Scotland behind them\n and embarked for this country, settling ou\n arrival in Pittsburg, Pa. Since he was born\n late in the year of 1835, and his father and\n mother arrived early in the year of 1845, he\n was but little over 9 years old when Pitts-\n burg became his place of residence. He had\n left \u201cauld Scotia\u201d at too early an age to be\n much impressed by his environments there\n and settled in the new residence at the very\n beginning of the most impressionable period\n of life. Hence the influence that environment,\n climate and national spirit could exert on a\n bright lad, at an impressionable age, -was\n wholly American, and the result was develop-\n ment on American lines into a purely Ameri-\n can product.\n</p>\n<p>\n His career after all is not so different from\n a large number of other prominent , Ameri-\n cans as to be singular. It differs rather: in\n degree than in anything else. It is a -record\n of self-making from small and adverse be-\n ginnings, of moving from one employment to\n another until the net of success is hit upon\n and then followed to results with industry\n and enthusiasm. \u00ab . ,\n</p>\n<p>\n At 11, with most insufficient schooling, he\n became a wage earner, as . an attendant upon\n a small stationary engine. Dissatisfied with\n his employment, he sought and obtained the\n position of a messenger for the Atlantic and\n Ohio Telegraph Company, developing in time\n into an operator, being one of the first to\n read by sound. The degree of skill he at-\n tained gave him employment as clerk to the\n manager of the telegraph lines of the Penn-\n sylvania Railroad Company located at Pitts-\n burrg. Three years of service carried him\n past the point of manhood. His growth had\n not been phenomenally rapid but steady and\n secure. Nor were there in those years start-\n ling indications of those qualities which in\n subsequent years, when exigencies and op-\n portunity demanded, tvere displayed to his\n great success. But even then he seems to\n have had his eyes open to the main chance\n and to possibilities in things w ' hich tvere not\n conventional or laid on old and tried lines.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was while he was acting as clerk to this\n telegraph manager that he fell in with Wood-\n ruff, the sleeping car man, and joined with\n him in the effort to have his invention\n adopted by the Pennsylvania Company. Out\n of the successful effort he made some money,\n which was, in fact, his financial beginning.\n Two things occurred about this time, when\n he was about 30: He was made superintendent\n of the division of the Pennsylvania Railroad,\n</p>\n<p>\n which included Pittsburg within its length\n and he was induced to embark his savings\n in a company ' or a syndicate to purchase a\n farm on Oil Creek, on which it was suppose*\n oil would be found if bored for. Oil was\n found in the most abundant quantities. It\n made all who were concerned rich \u2014 yielding,\n as it did, in a single year $1, 000,000 in divi-\n dends. Some of those who had ventured in\n this profitable enterprise were satisfied with\n its results, finding their financial aspirations\n sated, but not so with Mr. Carnegie. The for-\n tunate outcome seems to have whetted his\n appetite for other triumphs. The field in\n iron working attracted him, though he had no\n more association with it than as he had been\n brought in contact with it through employ-\n ment by the Railroad Company. He now threw\n up his position as superintendent and, asso-\n ciating himself with others, established a\n rolling mill ' in ' Pittsburg. In this rolling\n mill, modest as it must now look to him, was\n the germ life of that marvelous combination\n that has just startled the world. - Into the\n work of successfully establishing ' this mill\n ' Mr. Carnegie flung himself- with ardor; in-\n deed, his old associates say with impetuosity,\n instantly becoming the motive power of the\n enterprise, the leading spirit. And in this\n enterprise w r ere first recognized those qual-\n ities which have been the potent factors in\n his uprise\u2014 vast energy, tireless industry, an\n almost unyielding -will, - imagination peering\n into the future, a wide mental grasp, a pro-\n found conviction that knew no other result\n when decision was reached, such rapidity of\n mental processes that decision seemed\n reached by intuition rather than by reason,\n and that kind of courage which enabled him\n to stand by his convictions and stand alone.\n</p>\n<p>\n Doubtless these qualities had helped him\n to reach the position he was now piaced in,\n but the opportunity for their conspicuous dis-\n play had not before been his. He became at\n once the leader he has ever since been and\n with their display was also a manifestation\n of an intolerance of opposition that almost\n amounted to arrogance of opinion. This,\n after all, when it is controlled by superior\n intellectual qualities, is an attribute of lead-\n ership. But a few years passed before he\n was the dominant force in the association,\n and the name of Carnegie meant all that was\n bound up in the association. The rolling\n mill w r as a successful enterprise, growing in\n strength, in scope of operation and in wealth.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the scholastic sense, Mr. Carnegie was\n not an educated man. He had received no\n schooling.

Yet when he was recognized as a\n power in the manufacturing world he was\n also recognized as a man of education. This\n was self-attained. He has somewhere put on\n record that a benevolent gentleman of Pitts-\n burg, fancying the youth, or perceiving his\n dominant qualities and the yeast that was in\n him, threw open his library to him and di-\n rected his reading. The rest the ardent, as-\n piring and laborious youth did himself. When\n the library was exhausted he had become\n educated, and with disciplinary results to his\n mind that many another with university ad-\n vantages does not attain. That it was not\n academic of course will be patent to those who\n make a rigid analysis, but the fact remains\n</p>\n<p>\n but the capacity to labor, the power of per-\n sistent application, the faculty of absolute\n concentration on the matter in hand. To an\n enormous degree Mr. Carnegie possesses these\n qualities. They are not acquirements in the\n degree possessed by this man. They are gifts.\n They may be cultivated and developed to a\n degree by any one, but not to their highest\n expression, unless they are birthrights. With\n the mental inclination must go something\n which is not mental but physical \u2014 the ner-\n vous constitution that permits, or rather re-\n sists, the effect of labor to tire and to re-\n cuperate easily from strain. They were the\n fairy gifts at his cradle. Mr. Carnegie,\n physically, is not cast in the heroic mold.\n He is not a large man, but he is essen-\n tially what would be called a wiry man,\n compact, well set, well balanced. Even now,\n</p>\n<p>\n w r as in his early thirties, grew up the most\n extensive and complete system of iron and\n steel industries ever under the control of a\n single individual. And it has stood as such\n for years, or until the combining genius of\n J. Pierpont Morgan brought a still greater\n system, of which the Carnegie works are a\n part, into existence under the guidance of a\n man who was discovered and developed by\n Mr. Carnegie. And this brings us to another\n point in Mr. Carnegie ' s makeup, which has\n been a factor largely in his rise. No one\n faculty is more potent toward success than\n that of being well served. Those giants of\n civilization who have accomplished the most\n and secured the greatest success in their aims\n have been those who have been able to choose\n with unerring accuracy of judgment efficient\n aids.

This period of his life and\n the influence upon him In shaping and direct-\n ing his life that the kindly possessor of the\n library extended seems to have made the\n most enduring impression upon him. To that\n act of permitting him access to the library\n he apparently attributes much of the suc-\n cess of his life, and to it may doubtless be\n attributed that disposition and practice of\n his to sprinkle libraries over the country.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this recital is there further insight into\n the man? Above, his tireless industry was\n mentioned. It is something more. It is\n not only the disposition to be industrious.\n</p>\n<p>\n after a life of labor, of weighty enterprises\n and great achievements, he moves with ease\n and labors without friction. That he is a\n man of rare intellectual endowments goes\n with the saying. His mind is capacious, his\n grasp wide and sure, his processes rapid,\n working on naturally logical lines, his mem-\n ory, and especially for details, tenacious,\n penetrative, with a wonderful faculty for\n cleaving through the non-essential to the es-\n sentials, and while having the power of gen-\n eralization is yet subtly analytical.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carnegie is more voluble than men\n of his kind and degree usually are.

Mr. Carnegie\n has always had from the beginning, not only\n the power to choose well, but the courage to\n advance to positions of power, men of the\n largest ability he could find. No fear that\n he would be cast into the shade thereby, or\n that his power would be lessened or divided,\n has deterred him. Perhaps the consciousness\n of power to control even the strongest may\n have been strong within him, and that ever\n rejoicing in his own vigor he has enjoyed the\n strain on his hand.

When he stepped aside and let his\n great works go into the billion dollar com-\n bination, he stood fast and stern until he\n saw one who had served him and his inter-\n ests well the executive head of the new com-\n bination with a salary which each year is a\n large fortune in itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n He has in this sketch so far been con-\n sidered almost wholly in his aspect as the\n creator and director of a vast industry and\n in this work the greater part of the energies\n of his life have been expended. But there are\n other sides of him which are in measure\n inconsistent. Mr. Carnegie has never sought\n political honor nor, so far as is apparent, po-\n litical control. He has been a member of the\n party which, since his manhood, has been\n almost wholly in control of the national gov-\n ernment, and yet he has rarely been in full\n accord with it on all questions. In the heat\n of political controversy it has been charged\n that he and his interests have interfered\n with the powers it would control to influence\n legislation so that it would inure to the\n benefit of their industries. But no more has\n been proved against it than against the other\n industries of the country, whose interests\n were to he affected hy any change of legisla-\n tion. Mr. Carnegie is a radical\u2014 a fierce\n Democrat, though his affiliations have been\n with the Republican party. There seems to\n be something inconsistent in the attitude of\n the man who has devoted the best energies\n of his life and the best powers of his mind\n to the accumulation of one of the colossal\n fortunes of the world that he should be in\n theory, as he is, an emphatic advocate of the\n \u201crights of man;\u201d that while practicing con-\n solidation and concentration of interests he\n should contend for the widest individual\n liberty. It seems strange to read of his part\n to the erection of the most stupendous com-\n bination of industrial interests the world has\n ever known in the knowledge he controls, or\n</p>\n<p>\n has controlled, until a very recent period,\n eighteen newspapers in England devoted to\n (he spread of the ideas of radicalism. Men\n who discover this discrepancy between prac-\n tice and theory sometimes account for it on\n the ground that the conditions are not as\n they would have them, but such as master\n them, and that their individual arm raised\n against them would but result in their indi- j\n vidual ruin without beneficial results to those\n who would be better off if the conditions\n were other than they arc \u2014 that for their in-\n dividual profit they may seize the advantages\n the present conditions present, deploring at\n the time that such conditions do exist. It\n may be that Mr. Carnegie will reconcile in-\n consistencies in this way and in the great\n combination w ' hich could not have been ac-\n complished except with his consent, sees only\n the operation of the inevitable laws of\n evolution. At all events while aiding in ex-\n tending empire over labor he condemns na-\n tional expansion as tending toward imper-\n ialism.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carnegie has literary aspirations which\n have found expression in at least three books,\n \u201cA.f American Four-in-Hand in Britain,\u201d a\n record of the long coach journey of a party\n conducted by him, which was also recorded\n by William Black, the English author and\n further made memorable by the sketches of\n Edwdn Abbey, the artist; \u201cRound the World,\u201d\n an account of the incidents and of the im-\n pressions of his journey; and \u201cTriumphant\n Democracy,\u201d which has received greater at-\n tention than any other effort of his pen, to-\n gether with frequent contributions to peri-\n odicals. In these works much of the man\u2019s\n intellectual quality may be read, and it ' will I\n not be denied that it is vigorous, vivacious\n and not infrequently philosophic and some-\n times original if not profound in thought.\n</p>\n<p>\n Just now a day hardly passes that there is\n not mention in the public press of the en-\n dowment of some library by Mr. Carnegie.\n He seems to have settled into a system of\n these benefactions. His contributions and\n gifts have be-sn principally in the educational\n</p>\n<p>\n direction, but as w ' ell he gives to other and\n charitable benevolence largely. His latest\n gift is $5,000,000, of which $1,000,000 is sup-\n plementary to previous gifts of libraries for\n the workmen of the Carnegie plants, and\n $4,000,000, a contribution of the establishment\n of a pension and relief fund ior the workmen\n and laborers in the distinctively Carnegie\n i works. It is probably the largest single gift of\n its kind that history records and in it is the\n promise of further munificence. He has said\n in public print that the man who dies rich\n dies disgraced It is therefore to he supposed\n that now ' having retired from money get-\n ting, in which he has beeD most industrious,\n he will devote the remaining years of his\n life to benevolence. To give away the enor-\n mous fortune he possesses wisely and well,\n he must be almost as industrious ae he was\n in amassing it. That his fortune is immense\n is unquestioned. About the amount of the\n wealth of most very rich men there is much\n speculation and actually little known. Mr.\n Carnegie stands alone in this particular, too,\n for recent events having become public, the\n amount of wealth accruing to him becomes\n fairly well known. From ascertained basis\n it is figured that his annual income is to\n he not less than $15,000,000 a year and he is\n reported to have said that he would now be\n able to give away $1,000,000 a month.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the ordinary intercourse of life, Mr.\n Carnegie is frank, affable and approachable.\n Socially he is hospitable, agreeable and en-\n tertaining, liberal in his view ' s, and in the\n social circle as tolerant of the opinions of\n others as he is in business affairs intolerant\n I of opposition when his course is decided. In\n the social circle, a dry humor not unmixed\n with causticity, a gift, of hie Scottish ances-\n try, is discovered. He is devoted to music,\n is fond of art in its various branches and a\n lo.ver of hooks. At 66 years of age the springs\n of life are yet vigorous and he gets quite as\n much out of life and crowds quite as much\n into one day as many a man two decades\n younger.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0081/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 345, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 493}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0081/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 691, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 987}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0081/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1383, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1975}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0081/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2767, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3950}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0081/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0081.jp2", "height": 3950, "width": 2767, "levels": 6, "size": 665338}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"81\">\n<p>\n Peter\n</p>\n<p>\n SECRETIVE BUT ALWAYS AND EVER PERSISTENT.\n GREAT RESULTS FROM CONCENTRATED EFFORT.\n</p>\n<p>\n S EVERAL months ago Peter A. B. Wide-\n ner, street railway magnate, multi-mill-\n ionaire, art connoisseur and philan-\n thropist, presented to the City of Philadel-\n phia a magnificent library, a valuable prop-\n erty situated in one of the finest residence\n sections of the city and including a famous\n gallery of noted paintings.\n</p>\n<p>\n In connection with his elaborate \u201cwrite\n up\u201d of the presentation ceremonies, the edi-\n tor of a well known Philadelphia paper wished\n to include a sketch of the life of the donor\n in his article. For just such contingencies\n the paper maintains a careful system of\n biographical files, clipped from various\n sources and including histories of almost\n every man of prominence in the United\n States.\n</p>\n<p>\n A careful search was made through these\n files for a life of Widener, but for some\n strange reason no sketch of the world fa-\n mous magnate was to be found. After sound-\n ly berating his unfortunate custodian of the\n archives for this inexplicable omission, the\n editor dispatched a subordinate to the pub-\n lic libraries to get the desired information\n there.\n</p>\n<p>\n After a three hours\u2019 search he returned\n and reported that although he had carefully\n delved into every biography, gazetteer,\n \u201cGreat Men of Philadelphia,\u201d \" Prominent\n Pennsylvanians,\u201d \u201cOur Eminent Citizens,\u201d\n \u201cPhiladelphia\u2019s Philanthropists,\u201d etc., he had\n been unable to find a single word of refer-\n ence to the man who for three decades had\n played such an important part in the city\u2019s\n life.\n</p>\n<p>\n The editor was ihcredulous. Was it pos-\n sible that the wonderful railway operator\n who counted his millions by the score and\n whose manipulations had frequently shaken\n the stock markets of two worlds, the phil-\n anthropist whose generous gifts to the city\n are among its chief glories, the scholar and\n savant whose art collection ranks among\n the finest in America, and who had at vari-\n ous times entertained at his palatial home\n some of the world\u2019s greatest celebrities,\n writers, actors, singers and artists, could\n have been so utterly ignored in the public\n annals? He could not believe it and so pro-\n ceeded to forego the dignity that is popular-\n ly supposed to hedge about an editor, and\n sallied forth himself in quest of what he\n termed the \u201creadily obtainable\u201d information.\n He hadn\u2019t the slightest doubt that he could\n</p>\n<p>\n find it and was resolved to completely an-\n nihilate the stupid subordinate on his return.\n</p>\n<p>\n For once, however, the judgment and ve-\n racity of an underling were vindicated- after\n an interval the crestfallen editor returned\n and admitted that he had been unable to\n get any data on Widener. He had searched\n through tome after tome; had found sketches\n of men great and small; men whom he had\n never heard of and men whom he knew to\n be nonentities, but the name of P. A. B.\n Widener was conspicuous by its absence. As\n it was impossible to reach and interview the\n magnate personally, owing to his known\n aversion to the process, the editor was com-\n pelled to let his article go to press without\n the sketch of the life of the benefactor.\n</p>\n<p>\n This incident has been related at some\n length because it throws an invaluable side-\n light on one of the most marked character-\n istics of the subject of this article.\n</p>\n<p>\n Probably no prominent man in public life\n has been so little exploited in the public\n prints. Much has been published concerning\n his operations and business moves, but in\n so far as possible the crafty Widener has\n kept his personality in the background as\n much as possible and has made secretiveness\n and privacy cardinal rules of his phenome-\n nally successful life. He never lets the pub-\n lic into his secrets; his left hand is never\n permitted to know what the right is doing.\n He comes as little into the public eye as\n possible and in this way many New York-\n ers, even among the best informed, are un-\n aware of the potent influence which he wields\n in street railway affairs in the metropolis.\n It is only when he puts the finishing touch,\n the climax, on some particularly brilliant\n operation which he has been scheming and\n quietly, insistently and relentlessly pushing,\n perhaps for years, that attention is directed\n to him and the name \u201cWidener\u201d is called to\n the public tongue. As soon as the excite-\n ment subsides, he again withdraws into his\n privacy, not to emerge again until it is time\n to execute some new and crushing stroke.\n</p>\n<p>\n Work in the dark, is his rule; do not\n publish your plans until they have thor-\n oughly matured, and when you strike, strike\n hard and finish the job at a stroke. This is\n the Widener system and in many respects\n it is analogous to the methods employed in\n Russian diplomacy. The ceaseless grinding,\n the eternal sticking to a plan in the face\n of apparently insurmountable obstacles and\n</p>\n<p>\n despite the lapse of even centuries, the work\n descending from one generation of states-\n men to another, have made Russia pre-emi-\n nent in statecraft, and had the wily Widener\n been born in the land of the white czar he\n would probably have taken first rank as a\n diplomat.\n</p>\n<p>\n No one understands better than he the in-\n estimable advantages of concealing one\u2019s real\n purpose until the time for action arrives, of\n avoiding notoriety and the exciting of un-\n pleasant suspicions, of sticking everlastingly\n day and night at a project until it progresses\n to a triumphant conclusion, of working si-\n lently, ceaselessly, invincibly until opposi-\n tion is crushed and complete mastery of the\n field achieved. To facilitate this he reduces\n the avoidance of publicity to a science and\n sternly denies himself the popular adulation\n and flattery which form the very breath of\n life to so many prominent men.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cGet the power and the pleasure, leave the\n fame to others,\u201d is the way this idea might\n be tersely expressed.\n</p>\n<p>\n Next to his Tule of diplomatic unobtrusive-\n ness, the next factor of importance in his\n mental equipment is his ability to break down\n and circumvent opposition. At this he is a\n master and every resource of force or cunning\n is always at his disposal. He holds that time\n and money are omnipotent, that joined to-\n gether they form a combination which no hu-\n man agency can resist, and which must be\n served in the end.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cFinally and surely, Widener always gets\n what he wants. You may stop him, you may\n block him, he may appear to surrender, but\n in the end, by hook or crook, in some manner\n he always manages to come out ahead. He is\n the most remarkable combination of craft,\n keenness and superhuman determination in\n public life to-day, and I firmly believe that\n the day will come when he and his associates,\n Messrs. Elkins, Whitney, etc., will control\n every mile of street railway track in the en-\n tire United States, from the Atlantic to the\n Pacific, and from Mexico to Canada.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This is the opinion expressed by a well\n known New York man of affairs, and there\n are many competent judges who readily in-\n dorse it. Whether or not the future will set\n the seal of truth on this tremendous prophecy\n is an open question, but on his achievement\n of the present there is no man living whose\n influence in street railway affairs is more\n potent.\n</p>\n<p>\n All over the country stretches the network\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0082/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0082/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0082/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0082/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0082/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0082.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 961578}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"82\">\n<p>\n so\n</p>\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n of lines operated by the syndicate composed\n or Widener and his associates. New York,\n Philadelphia, Chicago and Baltimore are\n prominent in the list, and a host of smaller\n cities is included.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of all this gigantic system it is Widener\n who is the actual controlling head. Whitney\n and Elkins represent cash and political influ-\n ence, but they have other extensive interests\n and the actual management devolves on Wide-\n ner. It is he who plans out the various\n schemes of absorption by which the syndicate\n has extended its ramifications; it is he who\n controls and regulates its enormous expendi-\n tures. His power is absolute, his word law,\n and under the control of his edict are tens of\n thousands of employes. Yet, incredible as it\n may seem, little more than three decades ago\n this mighty magnate, this omnipotent wielder\n of men and millions, this scholar, social lead-\n er and phenomenally astute politician, was an\n humble veal dealer, who stood daily behind\n a stall, cut up and weighed meat and gladly\n sued for the patronage of the humblest of his\n neighbors. From butcher to Croesus in thirty\n years Is a marvelous transition and demon-\n strates better than could any words the man\u2019s\n audacity, boundless enterprise and over-\n whelming force. Less credit attaches to the\n poor boy who becomes favorite than to the\n matured man who, later in life, after his\n habits and career have been formed, realizes\n that he has made a mistake in bis life occu-\n pation and resolves to strive for higher and\n better things. To a young ambitious boy\n anything Is possible, but the man who starts\n late in life to carve a career carries a severe\n handicap. He was over 30 years old when he\n commenced his uphill fight and had none of\n the advantages which are usually stepping\n stones to success. His parents, Germans\n of accredited honesty and respectability, were\n nevertheless of humble origin, and did not\n bequeath him the valuable prerogatives of\n station or strong social connections. His edu-\n cation was rather limited, and he did not\n even complete the common school course.\n</p>\n<p>\n Moreover, his chosen calling, the useful but\n prosaic one of a veal butcher, suggested but\n few possibilities of future greatness. The\n lawyer, the financier, the artist, the politi-\n cian, the writer, no matter how poor they\n may be, all have the satisfaction of knowing\n that they are engaged in pursuits in which\n at any time they may be brought to the fore\n by the everchanging currents of events and\n public preference; but the merchant, espe-\n cially the handler of such a modest staple as\n meat, though he may live comfortably, would\n certainly seem to have as small a chance of\n achieving greatness and a dominant position\n in the world\u2019s affairs as could well be\n imagined.\n</p>\n<p>\n So the humble sign, \u201cP. A. B. Widener,\n Veal Butcher,\u201d gave but little presage of the\n future status of its owner. None of his as-\n sociates who vied with him for trade thought\n of him as being out of the ordinary. Like\n them, he attended strictly to business, buiit\n up a good trade and was very clever at driv-\n ing a bargain. That was the most they said\n of him, and as a butcher they expected him\n to live and die. But the jolly, ruddy-faced\n butcher had in him undreamed of possibilities.\n He began to make discoveries concerning him-\n self. He found out that he had an exceptional\n mathematical faculty and that he could figure\n mentally with more rapidity and connected-\n ness than his associates could on paper. He\n vindicated the soundness of his judgment and\n proved his superior business ability by the\n certainty with which he got the best of all his\n bargains. Gradually it began to dawn on him\n that his abilities applied in a larger scale\n should bring correspondingly larger results.\n</p>\n<p>\n This impression was strengthened by the dis-\n covery of his innate power over men and his\n ability to control and dominate those with\n whom he came in contract. As a consequence\n of this line of thought came the turning point\n in his career\u2014 his entrance into politics.\n</p>\n<p>\n Standing behind his chopping block in\n butcher\u2019s apron, cleaver in hand, with al-\n most incredible audacity, he marked out his\n course of future action. He planned out\n how, when he had first gained the necessary\n capital, he would embark into the street rail-\n way business; how as his profits increased\n</p>\n<p>\n he would gradually buy up the stock until\n he gained a controlling interest and became\n master of the road.\n</p>\n<p>\n T.hen he would introduce new ideas calcu-\n lated to produce increased returns, then as his\n capital and influence multiplied, he would\n still further extend his sphere of influence\n until he became the dominating factor of\n traffic in Philadelphia. Nor did his ambitious\n projects stop there. He looked further into\n the future and saw himself gaining a foot-\n hold in other cities and reaping rich harvests\n as rewards of industry and enterprise.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nor must it be understood that these\n schemes were visionary\u2014 merely the air cas-\n</p>\n<p>\n tles of an ambitious and hopeful man. Wid-\n ener ' s practical disposition forbade day\n dreaming. He tvas coolly and deliberately\n mapping out plans which he firmly intended\n to put into execution. The incongruity of the\n position never appealed to him. He did not\n appreciate the apparent wildness and absurd-\n ity of the intention of the humble butcher to\n become a capitalist of national power. He\n recognized only his own inherent force and\n capacity and consequently saw nothing im-\n possible in his ambitions. Even Richard\n Wagner, alone, friendless and poor, an ex-\n</p>\n<p>\n patriated exile, writing the tremendous mu-\n sic dramas which were to revolutionize op-\n eratic art, create a new school of music and\n whose production must necessarily involve\n the outlay of hundreds of thousands of dol-\n lars, does not present a more remarkable in-\n stance of splendid daring, self confidence and\n courage.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the plans thus formulated during this\n humble period of his since brilliant career,\n Widener relentlessly adhered. Discourage-\n ments and reverses came and there were mo-\n ments when failure seemed certain, but the\n hutcher-capitalist-politician toiled doggedly\n on, breaking down or winning over those who\n</p>\n<p>\n PETER A.

The far-seeing Widener, looking in-\n to the future, saw the fortunes at the behest\n of the man who could wipe out rival concerns,\n prevent competition and exercise exclusive\n control over the traffic of the great cities. To\n effect this one looks for his motto, the word\n \u201cConcentration.\u201d In letters of fire it burned\n on his fertile brain and all his actions were\n directed toward its consummation. Iu all his\n plgus concentration was his guiding motive.\n He made friends calculated to be serviceable\n in this direction, he cast the power of his\n growing wealth and influence with the polit-\n ical powers best able to aid him. Years ahead\n he schemed out the absorption of the rival\n companies that mitigated against his dream\n \u2022f complete control.\n</p>\n<p>\n When he assumed the dictatorship of the\n Philadelphia . Traction Company, there were\n four or five local lines which far exceeded it\n in wealth and importance and whose direc-\n tors wo.uld have laughed at the suggestion\n that Widener and his little ' road would some\n day control them all. Little by little liis\n plans matured\u2014 slowly,, but as surely as the\n mills of , God are supppsed to grind. He never\n missed a point and he never stopped working.\n Every time -he could .advance he- did so and\n every inch so gained was tenaciously . held.\n He .nevei went, back and. he never relented.\n He had his plan, he, dpggedly pushed it with-\n out, cessation. He took advantage of every\n opening, every weakness .of an, opponent was\n instantly perceived and quickly operated on,\n until one By, one. rival companies began to\n</p>\n<p>\n weaken and sue fonpeace.; The terms dictat-\n ed by the merciless victor were absolute sur-\n render, ' utter . negation and loss .of identity\n and complete merging ' into the Traction Com-\n pany. Finally, after a twenty years\u2019 strug-\n gle, the indomitable Widener\u2019s triumph was\n complete. Consolidation had been effected,\n the last company had been purchased, all ri-\n vals had been bought up and the erstwhile\n butcher had realized his dream of being un-\n disputed master of Philadelphia\u2019s railway\n system.\n</p>\n<p>\n This \u2018.victory complete, he began to sigh\n for new worlds to conquer and he turned his\n eyes longingly on New Y r ork. His sound busi-\n ness judgment dictating that Whitney was\n too strong a man to fight, Widener formed a\n combination with him, and the resulting syn-\n dicate, soon gained a strong foothold. Then\n in turn Chicago, Baltimore. Washington, etc.,\n fell under the sway of the resourceful capi-\n talist and the same tactics which had already\n succeeded so signally in the City of Broth-\n erly Love proved equally efficacious wher-\n ever tried.\n</p>\n<p>\n Even these victories have not satiated the\n aggressive Widener with the strife of munici-\n pal warfare and the same relentless, unceas-\n ing grind of advance is still in progress with\n apparently quite as much ardor as in the\n days of-yore. It - is not impossible that the\n weighty brain that once had for its chief in-\n tersst the price of cattle has conceived the\n gigantic, almost incredible, project of con-\n trolling every street car in the United States.\n Such a combination if formed would exceed\n in wealth any corporation ever organized,\n hut the brilliant career of its inceptor and\n hia wonderful success in the past prevent\n evtrn such a Utopian plan from seeming vis-\n ionary and utterly impracticable.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of Widener\u2019s working methods in addition\n to his secretiveness, probably the most po-\n tent in the securing of results is masterly\n \u25a0if ii i in combining legitimate business with\n</p>\n<p>\n politics. He has never followed the methods\n of the ordinary politician and made politics\n his sole occupation, his only source of rev-\n enue, instead he merely used it to assist him\n in whatever regular business venture he\n chanced to be engaged in and to further the\n profits. In politics a Republican, of late years\n he has seldom taken active partisan part in\n any campaign, but has preferred to be one of\n the controlling powers behind the scenes \u2014 a\n manipulator of the puppet candidates \u2014 one of\n the astute few who reap the profits of cur-\n rent events, no matter which way the polit-\n ical wind blows \u2014 a man who would rather\n control office holders than be one.\n</p>\n<p>\n Always a heavy contributor to Republican\n campaign funds, he has carefully prevented\n any undue publicity concerning his dona-\n tions. He avoids the rostrum, seldom figures\n in the reports of the party councils and de-\n spite his wealth, eminence and general avail-\n ability, is but seldom mentioned 41 s a can-\n didate for any office. Yet, it is a known fact,\n that be is one of the most potent and in-\n fluential members within the state The rea-\n son for this seeming ' reticence and modesty\n has its foundation in the sound judgment\n that distinguishes the every move of this\n gifted financier. As a naan of affairs he\n knows full \" well . the remunerative possibili-\n ties \" of furthering business enterprise with\n the judicious use of politics. He knows full\n well that the ' man without political influence\n is often \" likely to find chambers ' of councils,\n boards of aldermen ~ and other \u25a0 municipal\n bodies which \u2019have* at their, disposal . valuable\n franchises, recalcitrant and 7 difficult to ma-\n nipulate; oh the contrary he has also in the\n course of his,- researches: found that the city\n fathers can be handled -with facility and ease\n if the applicant- for,, favors ' has . ' the- proper\n indorsement ' from the political powers that\n be. . j; \u25a0 > < *- < ' \u2022\u2014 , \u2022 :\n</p>\n<p>\n He knows that executive .officials and even\n grave judges prove more docile when in the\n presence of a party master, and consequently\n as a business man he has cultivated this\n branch of his profession and learned every\n point in the game of securing concessions\n with a minimum of outlay. Yet it has not\n escaped his keen powers of discernment that\n a certain prejudice exists against the man\n of large corporation interests who dabbles\n in politics. He is sufficiently astute to have\n seen that the popular mind is prone to har-\n bor suspicions against the motives of such\n men, so he keeps carefully in the back-\n ground. content to let others reap Ihe glory.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another reason which necessitates this re-\n tirement is his position as head of a corpora-\n tion numbering thousands of employes. If\n the chief was openly active in politics, the\n frequently averred charge that this army of\n employes constitutes a personal machine,\n which the traction magnates wield to fur-\n ther the ends of the corporation, would re-\n ceive a certain substantiation. In the heat\n of political contests this accusation has been\n frequently made, but in spite of investiga-\n tions, has never received verification. The\n suspicion, however, affords excellent reason\n why the head of the traction hosts should\n content himself with a minimum of political\n notoriety.\n</p>\n<p>\n As an example of his ability to reap benefit\n from politics in conjunction with regular\n business, may be mentioned an incident\n which occurred way back in the butcher days.\n By skillful manipulation of influence he suc-\n ceeded in securing the contract to supply the\n Philadelphia Club House with veal. From\n the accruing profits, which were consider-\n able, for the contract figures ran into the\n thousands, Widener aggregated a little capi-\n tal, which proved the nucleus of his enorm-\n ous fortune, and so throughout his career he\n</p>\n<p>\n has always known how to make politics the\n handmaiden of business and without appear-\n ing too prominently on the scene himself. He\n has only once presented himself as a can-\n didate for the suffrages of the people and\n that was before he turned his attention to\n street railways. Iu 1874 he was elected City\n Treasurer, having already served one year\n by appointment to fill out an unexpired term.\n Many times since by merely signifying his\n willingness he could have secured nomina-\n tions as mayor, governor or congressman,\n but he has steadfastly refused all overtures.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is said, however, that he cherishes one\n political ambition \u2014 that he craves to be\n United States Senator. This may or may not\n be true, for Widener\u2019s reticence is proverbial,\n and he never expresses a desire for any-\n thing until he has it absolutely within his\n grasp. If it is true, however, that the bee of\n senatorial aspirations has really stung this\n man of steel, who has proved callous to so\n many honors, all other candidates might as\n well stand aside, for what he wants he gets,\n runs the phrase in the City of Brotherly\n Love.\n</p>\n<p>\n A striking peculiarity of Widener is his\n indifference, even his contempt, for details.\n Many prominent men pride themselves on\n their ability to grasp the large features and\n the small details of an enterprise.\n</p>\n<p>\n Widener, however, is not of this stripe.\n He never concerns himself with the vexa-\n tious trifles, preferring to keep his mind\n free to cope with large and weighty prob-\n lems. He never bothers about cutting down\n operating expenses and practising economy\n here and there. All that is left to subordi-\n nates and the weighty chieftain seldom in-\n terferes. He is a thorough believer in the\n doctrine of doing the planning and hiring the\n execution.\n</p>\n<p>\n In spite of all his craft and diplomacy,\n Widener has never feared to turn sharply on\n public opinion when necessary. Under ordin-\n ary conditions he prefers to float quietly\n with the popular current, hut if actual neces-\n sity arises, does not hesitate to bluntly op-\n pose the public mind and to have his way\n regardless of all obstacles. At such times,\n while his policy is not exactly that of the\n famous American who was accused of having\n</p>\n<p>\n said, \u201cThe public be ,\u201d nevertheless It\n</p>\n<p>\n is somewhat analogous and might he rer-\n mulated as \u201cHave your way first, placate the\n public afterward.\u201d Acting on this principle he\n makes it a practice to first annihilate oppo-\n sition and to execute his ideas, regardless\n of public clamor, hut having thus succeeded,\n he is always ready to do all he can to win\n back popular favor. This is the way the\n Traction Company has fought all its battles\n in Philadelphia and though for years it en-\n countered fierce opposition it now numbers\n many of its best friends among former an-\n tagonists.\n</p>\n<p>\n The installation of the trolley system on\n Philadelphia streets some years since illus-\n trates this phase of Widener\u2019s character\n strikingly. The great mass of the people\n were strongly opposed, to the placing of an\n overhead system of electric wires. They con-\n tended that it was dangerous, would lead to\n accidents and conflagrations and would be a\n standing menace to public safety. Mass meet-\n ings were held and resolutions passed strong-\n ly condemning the ordinance. Councils were\n petitioned to kill the project and the Mayor\n was besought to veto it in case of its passage.\n During all this outcry, Widener remained si-\n lent and indiffeent. He was determined on\n an overhead trolley system apd intended to\n have his way. Nothing coulcf move him to\n compromise or change of base. Finally the\n bills passed and the new system was install-\n ed.

Having carried his\n point and triumphed he was willing to do all\n possible to allay popular resentment. Ac-\n cordingly the company more than discharged\n all the obligations entailed in the ordinance\n legalizing a trolley system. The streets on\n which its lines were operated were paved\n without a penny of cost to the public, with\n the most approved modern asphalt.

It ie much more difficult to account\n for Widener the art expert. From whom did\n this son of humble parentage inherit his\n fine tastes, his love for the beautiful, his un-\n erring judgment in all art matters?\n</p>\n<p>\n His collection of paintings is renowned as\n among the best in the country, he has many\n first editions, rare old copies and valuable\n prints. Nor le this art devotion a mere fad\n \u2014the p\u00ae\u00bbe of a wealthy man, searching a po-\n</p>\n<p>\n lite and refined way of spending his -wealth.\n Widener has no cheap ambition to impress his\n fellow men with a sense of his erudition. He\n buys old books and rare copies because he is\n a genuine bibliophile. He is not only familiar\n with the beautiful covers but he has a thor-\n ough knowledge of the contents of his books.\n He did not establish his superb gallery mere-\n ly to win the plaudits of his wealthy friends,\n but because he loves paintings, is familiar\n with the best products of ancient and modern\n schools, has the entire literature of painting\n at his finger tips and can tell a good painting\n from a bad one with a certainty which would\n do credit to a professional critic. So in con-\n nection with music. He is always a familiar\n figure at the opera and symphony concerts\n and can discourse learnedly on Wagner,\n Beethoven, Brahms, Gluck, Bach, Schumann,\n Schubert, etc. He is a generous contribu-\n tor to all musical projects, not because it is\n the proper thing to do, but because he is in\n hearty sympathy with every branch of art.\n As proof of his influence in this direction it\n should be cited that within the last dec-\n ade almost every musician, painter\n or literary man of prominence has been en-\n tertained at the home of the hospitable\n Widener. Nor have they found in him sim-\n ply a rich but ignorant patron of the arts.\n The extent of his accomplishments and art\n knowledge has surprised all, and the opinion\n has frequently been expressed that if he had\n never ventured into financial operations he\n could have made a success as an art critic.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cUpon what meat does this our Caesar\n feed, that he is grown so great?\u2019\u2019 said Cas-\n sius of old, referring to Caesar, and the in-\n quiry might well be paraphrased in endeav-\n oring to solve Widener\u2019s appreciation of art\n and the high esteem in which his judgment\n is held by eminent artists.\n</p>\n<p>\n What opportunities had the industrious\n butcher for cultivation engrossed in the cares\n</p>\n<p>\n s\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n of business? What time did the turmoil of\n the magnate\u2019s life leave him for contempla-\n tion and study? What was there in the ca-\n reer of the politician conducive to an appre-\n ciation of the beauties and glories of art?\n</p>\n<p>\n All are questions which practically defy\n solution, and the only explanation which can\n be proffered is that Widener\u2019s appreciation\n of the value of time enabled him to so\n economize that in spite of his many in-\n terests he has found leisure to read and\n study and to develop the accomplishments\n which prove his versatility. His life has been\n reduced to a schedule \u2014 so much for business,\n so much for pleasure, so much for cultiva-\n tion.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this schedule attendance on social func-\n tions played but a small part. Pleasure lov-\n ing and fond of company, the genial mag-\n nate always entertained freely, but he long\n ago learned the folly of becoming a victim\n of the society habit \u2014 with its ceaseless round\n of functions, attendance on which is com-\n pulsory \u2014 and when he accepts an invitation\n it is because he wants to go and feels as-\n sured of a good time, not simply because he\n feels it his duty.

In his abilty to achieve wonders, to\n wrest results from the operation of the occult\n forces of nature, he is popularly regarded\n as little less than superhuman. In an earlier\n age Mr. Edison would have been deemed to\n be what he is now called in the way of super-\n lative description, a wizard. His concrete\n results would have been attributed, not to\n patient Investigation and abnormally persist-\n ent experimentation, but to alliance with the\n abhorred denizens of the supernatural re-\n gions. Instead of being showered with wealth,\n honored by the diplomas of the learned so-\n cieties and distinguished with the medals of\n crowned potentates, at the fagot and stake,\n by fire, he would have been resolved Into the\n very elements with which he has dealt so\n largely and curiously in this age. Mr. Edison\n was most fortunate in being born in the nine-\n teenth, rather than in the fourteenth, cen-\n tury.\n</p>\n<p>\n To inquire into the life and the achieve-\n ments of Mr. Edison and to carefully weigh\n the one and measure the others is to discover\n that the man of the popular imagination does\n not exist, that the public estimate of him is\n somewhat erroneous. In such inquiry, how-\n ever, a most interesting, instructive, pictur-\n esque and intensely human personality will\n be found\u2014 a man who is unique and must be\n considered by himself, who is not to be\n classed, who stimulates curiosity and who\n challenges admiration as he invites disap-\n pointment.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Edisons are of Dutch origin. The first\n of the name, of whom Thomas Alva is in\n descent, was John, who emigrated to these\n shores as early as 1737 and became a banker\n in New York, but being a Tory in the later\n development of colonies, and, siding with\n the British interests, found it convenient, if\n not necessary, to emigrate to Nova Scotia.\n There, Samuel, father of Thomas Alva, was\n born. Arriving at the age of manhood and\n receiving a grant of land from the govern-\n ment, Samuel removed to the part of Canada\n on the shores of Lake Erie to settle upon the\n grant. But in 1838, becoming involved in the\n Papinean rebellion, his lands were forfeited\n and he fled for safety to Milan, in Ohio, where,\n settling, he married a girl of Scotch descent.\n Of this union Thomas Alva, born February\n 11 , 1847, was the issue. Thus the Teutonic\n</p>\n<p>\n and the Celt are blended in the inventor, and\n thus, too, some of the contradictions to be\n found in the nature and character of the man\n can be accounted for. While Thomas was yet\n a small lad, the elder Edison removed to\n Michigan. Thomas Alva was early thrown\n on his own resources, indeed early made, iu\n the stress of circumstances, a contribution\n to the family support. Schooling he had lit-\n tle of; the foundations of his education were\n laid by his mother, who had been a school\n teacher before her marriage. It is of record,\n however, that from the earliest period the\n young lad was a hard reader from inclina-\n tion, often undertaking works beyond his un-\n derstanding, for instance attacking, before he\n was 14, Newton ' s \u201cPrincipia.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Edison\u2019s first employment was as a news-\n boy on the Grand Trunk Railway, an employ-\n ment that in a considerable degree shaped\n and directed his life, since he came into close\n contact with and interest in the telegraph.\n The story has been repeatedly told how,\n without instruction and on knowledge ob-\n tained only by observation, he began experi-\n ments in telegraphy, conducting them in a\n car of the train until an accident, which set\n fire to the car, resulted in his ignominious ex-\n pulsion from the service of the road. There\n are stories, too, of that time, showing the\n thriftiness of his Dutch and the canniness of\n his Scotch side, in the way in which he ' stim-\n ulated excitement at the stations in advance\n of the coming of his train, whereby he was\n enabled to sell his papers containing an ac-\n count of the battle of Pittsburg Landing, at\n the advanced prices of 10 and 25 cents \u2014 that\n thrift and cunning which have been so curi-\n ously shown in his after life in such con-\n tradiction to the recklessness and improvi-\n dence of the years when he was a telegraph\n operator. There are tales told, too, repeated\n in every life and sketch of Edison published,\n which show how decided was the bent of the\n boy toward investigation, experiment and in-\n vention.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the fortunate incident of saving the\n life of a child of the master and telegraph\n operator of a station on the Grand Trunk\n was due the offer of instruction in the art of\n telegraphy\u2014 an offer eagerly accepted. At\n che age of 17 he was a supremely skillful\n operator and then began his nomadic life,\n during which he wandered over the United\n States, a Bohemian in his neglect of the pro-\n prieties of life and disregard of its obliga-\n tions, in such contradiction to the thrift he\n</p>\n<p>\n had shown previously and which is notable\n in his after career. But he experimented\n constantly, often neglecting his practical du-\n ties for his experiments, to the loss of his\n employment. It was during this period that\n he invented his automatic repeater by which\n a message could be transferred from one wire\n to another without the aid of an operator. At\n 22 years of age he reached Boston, where, in\n recognition of his skill, he was given the\n \u201ccrack\u201d wire from New York. It was while\n living there that he conceived the idea of a\n duplex telegraph by which two messages\n could be sent over the same wire at the same\n time. The year 1871 saw him in New York a 3\n superintendent of the Gold and Stock Com-\n pany, and in a year followed the perfecting\n of his duplex system, which he subsequently\n developed into a quadruplex system of trans-\n mission, which, making a single wire do the\n work of four, saved the telegraph companies,\n as it was estimated, $15,000,000.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here in New York came the turning point\n of his career. Up to this time he had re-\n ceived little from his devices above his sal-\n ary, but now he brought to perfection the\n printing telegraph for gold and stock quo-\n tations. For this right of use he received\n a lump sum of $40,000. With that sum in his\n possession he abandoned the field of teleg-\n raphy as an operator. With his capital so\n suddenly, and to him, unexpectedly acquired,\n he established a manufactory in Newark,\n N. J., for the making of his quotations\n printer ostensibly, but his time in it was\n given chiefly, if not wholly, to experimenta-\n tion. His mind was yet running on teleg-\n raphy and a sextuplex transmission of mes-\n sages soon appeared. Indeed, devices and\n improvements and new inventions relative\n to telegraphy flowed from his fingers and\n brains almost without number and the dom-\n inating telegraph company was kept busy\n in buying control of them lest they should\n get into rival hands and cheapen the process\n to a ruinous point. It is asserted, and prob-\n ably will not be contradicted, that there are\n devices locked up in the safes of this com-\n pany which have never been and probably\n never will be put into operation, which rep-\n resent the expenditures of hundreds of thou-\n sands of dollars, so expended in self defense.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was at this period that the commis-\n sioner of the Patent Office of the day said\n that \" there is a young man in New Jersey\n who has made the path to the Patent Offlc*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0086/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0086/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0086/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0086/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0086/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0086.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 946950}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"86\">\n<p>\n 84\n</p>\n<p>\n STUDIES IX AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n hot.\u201d In 1876 Mr. Edison removed to Menlo\n Park, in New Jersey, and built the first of\n those buildings intended purely for experi-\n mental purposes, and now he devoted himself\n wholly to experimentation and invention.\n About this time the effort to reproduce\n sounds at a distance by the aid of electricity\n attracted general attention. The dream w r as\n cot new. For many years enterprising minds\n had been working at the problem and with\n only the promise of success. Finally great\n advances were made by Gray and Bell, par-\n ticularly the latter.

Mr. Edison, abandoning the field\n of telegraphy, entered that of telephony, not\n as a pioneer or original investigator. Sub-\n stantial progress to a practical plane had\n been made before he began his labor. Yet\n his contributions were immediately of the\n highest value. One of his earliest produc-\n tions, if not his earliest, was his carbon tele-\n phone transmitter, by which the inflections\n and changes in the intensity of the vocal\n sounds were more faithfully rendered.

Bell\n was compelled to adopt it to perfect his own\n device; yet Mr. Edison could not put his\n discovery into use without the devices and\n system Mr. Bell had brought to such per-\n fection. A contest sprang up. Mr. Edison\n sought to complete an entire system of his\n own invention, but which, as a fact, re-\n sulted only in infringements on the Bell\n patents. Mr. Bell sought to accomplish the\n results of the carbon transmitter of Edison\n through the use of the same materials in\n another way, with a result only of infringe-\n ment of the Edison patent. The result was\n litigation, ending in compromise by which\n Edison greatly profited, since he received\n & share in the benefits of all that had pre-\n ceded his discovery in exchange for it. The\n steadiness with which he had kept his eye\n on the main chance throughout all of this\n contest, forcing, in a measure. Bell to share\n with him the benefits of his system, rather\n astounded those of his associates who had\n been lulled into the idea that the inventor\n had little consideration for the material as-\n pect of things, and largely increased their\n respect for his thrift.\n</p>\n<p>\n Once entered upon this field of reproducing\n sounds Mr. Edison did not stop with his car-\n bon transmitter. A host of discoveries fol-\n lowed, many of them of little practical value,\n except, perhaps, as steps toward grand final\n results. Out of this period came the micro-\n phone, which multiplied sound; the mega-\n phone that draws nearer and magnifies sound\n so that a whisper a thousand yards away, a\n bee rustling in the grass, can be heard; the\n aerophone, to amplify sound without impair-\n ing the distinctness of articulation and, most\n notorious and conspicuous of all, the phono-\n graph.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of all these the phonograph has done more\n for the fame and widespread popularity of\n the inventor, has served to a greater degree\n than any other medium to carry his name to\n the ears of the world. The others dealing\n with sound have shown little practical value\n outside of the uses of a restricted scientific\n circle. Serving all the ends sought in their\n perfecting, it is difficult to see that they have\n been adopted into the practical affairs of the\n world. The microphone, for instance, of\n which much was hoped as serving to lessen\n the dangers of fog at see, in conjunction with\n the aerophone, has not been put to such use\n as yet to justify the hopes entertained of it.\n And the phonograph, which has done so\n</p>\n<p>\n THOMAS ALVA EDISON.\n</p>\n<p>\n vaudeville halls \u2014 curious and wonderful,\n more calculated to appeal to the man who\n said he would rather write the songs of a\n nation than make its laws than to him who\n measures all things by their influence or aid\n in thq material advance of people. But who\n shall say these things have not had a useful\n and beneficial influence?\n</p>\n<p>\n Out of this ( period came also various other\n kind of telephones that seem to have had\n</p>\n<p>\n [ copyist, from a vote recorder to a mimeo-\n I graph, al! things practical and impracticable,\n ! things that entertain the leisure hour and\n ! lessen the labors of those who toil.\n</p>\n<p>\n The great achievements of Mr. Edison\n have been made in the field of electric light-\n ing.

To the rewards, the honors and\n</p>\n<p>\n much to excite admiration for the man wlio\n brought it to perfection, is after all yet mere-\n ly a delightful scientific toy, contributing un-\n doubtedly to the pleasures of mankind, but\n not winning its place in the practical affairs\n of the world.

And in the end when the record\n of his life and labors is carefully investi-\n gated and the judgment final is given it will\n be upon this that his enduring fame will\n stand. The especial achievement in this ac-\n complishment was the solution of the prob-\n lem of the commercial subdivision of the\n light in a general distribution from a cen-\n tral point, like gas. This, by scientific ex-\n perts, had been officially declared impossible.\n Even when it was announced as attained,\n scientific electricians refused to believe and\n the fact was not accepted until after Mr.\n Edison gave, at Menlo Park, in 1879, a pub-\n lic exhibition of the complete system in\n operation. There were many lesser problems\n incidental to perfection of this system, such\n as the carbon filament inclosed in the glass\n chamber from which the air had been al-\n most wholly exhausted, and the glass cham-\n ber itself, which called for solution and all\n successfully accomplished, making the sys-\n tem now in such general use. And it may\n be said that in these experimentations or\n out of them came the perfected dynamo.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Edison also devoted much time and\n energy to another dream of the scientific\n world and that an electric motor for rail-\n road draught. It is declared that he suc-\n ceeded, too, in this and the public exhibitions\n of his completed effort seemed to confirm the\n assertion. Yet the motor is in infrequent\n use and it is asserted by scientists that\n in this achievement Mr. Edison developed\n conditions that practically destroyed the\n value of his own completed work \u2014 that he\n made plain the fact that the real solution\n of railroad traction was a motor in each\n car, which car could be enlarged to the\n limit of weight as a factor of safety. Mr.\n Sprague, who was an assistant of Mr. Edison\n at Menlo Park, put this determination into\n successful operation in an application of it\n to the trolley cars of street railroads and\n reaped fame and fortune by it. But what\n Mr. Edison did do, and for this all credit is\n due him, no matter what may be the final\n manifestations of the conditions developed,\n is that he demonstrated the feasibility and\n practicability of electricity as a motor power\n for heavy traction.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this rather discursive way the main\n achievements of Mr. Edison ' s career have\n been set forth, and certainly they are re-\n markable, fully Justifying the interest the\n world has manifested in him and his works.\n And no less interesting is the man himself.\n At 53 years of age he is yet a man in the\n enjoyment of full powers of mind and body.\n This is all the more remarkable, for in his\n labor he has violated the laws of nature, has\n submitted himself to tests of endurance that\n would have sapped the life and strength of\n others attempting to rival him in these\n tests. He is a physical wonder in this re-\n spect and in his habits he has been no more\n conservative than in his methods of labor.\n Laboring without regard to hours, without\n sleep, taking no note of the coming of the\n night or the passing of the day, when the\n fit was upon him, eating to repletion when\n fancy took him or abstaining for hours with-\n out food when absorption in a problem or\n the pursuit of an elusive end beckoned him\n on with promises of immediate seizure made\n him oblivious to the demands of hunger,\n chewing almost constantly a black cigar,\n finding a renewal in a great draught of stim-\n ulant upon which he might not look\n for weeks again, indifferent to the functions\n of body and the simplest sanitary demands.\n</p>\n<p>\n he has for years defied the laws of nature\n and apparently without serious results to\n his health and strength.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is in the possession of his wonderful\n powers of concentration, of self violation, of\n complete abstraction, of Indomitable will, of\n untiring energy and unfailing endurance\n that he has been enabled to accomplish the\n results ' he has. Theodore Tilton said of\n Henry Ward Beecher, that he would have\n been an intensely indolent man had it not\n been for his positively sensual love of labor.\n This being quoted to an intimate friend of\n Mr. Edison, familiar with the man in all his\n sides, the reply was that the criticism would\n apply with equal force to the inventor. And\n this friendly critic went on to say that in an\n accurate estimate of the man must be recog-\n nized a large animalism, a great sensual de-\n velopment that gave force, motive power and\n momentum to bis mental equipment as a\n powerful boiler does to a steam engine.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Edison is regarded by the public mind\n as a rare genius, the manifestations of which\n are almost ' superhuman. Those closely as-\n sociated with him and who have been in a\n position to observe him in all his aspects,\n do not so regard him. He has neither the\n originality nor the imagination which are the\n attributes of genius. Mr. Edison has erigin-\n ated nothing nor conceived a great principle.\n This is a statement \" which may be offensive\n to the general belief and even may be re-\n garded as a petty attempt at iconoclasm.\n But when made. It is not to say that Mr.\n Edison is not a great man, or that the facul-\n ties he is blessed with and of which he has\n made such abundant and astonishing use\n have not the quality and degree of greatness.\n .Mr. Edison has not given to the world a\n single principle it did not have before he\n was born, such, for instance, as Newton\u2019s\n laws of gravitation. His mind is not philo-\n sophic, but in its highest manifestation is\n investigative toward the practical end of\n utilization. Lying under that apple tree, his\n nose endangered by the falling apple, Mr.\n Edison would not as Newton did, turn over\n and think out why that apple had taken\n the centriputal rather than the centrifugal\n impulse, but would have risen immediately\n in an effort to discover some automatic de-\n vice whereby that tendency of the apple to\n fall downward could be utilized to force the\n apples to arrange themselves in barrels\n properly packed, and that result, if reached\n at all, would have been through experimen-\n tation and not through ratiocination.\n</p>\n<p>\n That is the destination. His mind is pecu-\n liarly observant of natural effects and pecu-\n liarly curious as to them. Intensely prac-\n tical in all its operation the utilization of\n these effects and forces is the impulse that\n sends it to labor. Penetrative to a high de-\n gree, he follows their development, noting\n minutely each step much as the woodsman\n blazes his way through the trackless forest\n and often with results, to himself it must be,\n as astonishing as to other people. It was\n so with the evolution of that astounding pro-\n duct, the phonograph. All these qualities,\n when developed to the degree they are in\n Mr. Edison\u2019s mental equipment, are qualities\n of greatness. They do not appeal to the gen-\n eral imagination as dramatically as the more\n popular conception of him, that he is pos-\n sessed of powers rarely held by human be-\n ings and that by their exercise, much as the\n magician is supposed to summon spirits from\n the vast deep by the wave of his wand, Mr.\n Edison wrests from nature her secrets, but\n they are made more conformable to common\n sense. Mixed with this disposition to get at\n the utility of things is his regard for the\n main chance ever held steadily in view.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is an insight into hie character in the\n well authenticated anecdote told of him. A\n gentleman who had a great admiration for\n Mr. Edison, though he had never met him, en-\n tered a public place with an intimate of the\n great inventor to find the latter there. The\n friend presented the admirer who, in the\n course of the conversation that followed, ex-\n pressed the opinion that the phonograph was\n the most wonderful of all inventions.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cYes,\u201d slowly replied Mr. Edison, \u201cbut the\n d thing don\u2019t bring in the money.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Thrift has marked his career of invention,\n and it has served him well, for Mr. Edison Is\n a very wealthy man who counts his fortune\n by millions. There is no reason why it should\n not be so, nor is it cause for condemnation\n and criticism. Indeed there is much that is\n gratifying in the fact that in his case he has\n reversed the rule that inventions enrich any-\n body rather than the inventor, but it take3\n something from the fanciful conception of\n him.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is another authenticated anecdote of\n him that also throws a sidelight on his char-\n acter and is indicative of that persistency and\n absorption in a pursuit of an end when once\n seriously entered upon. An admirer, calling\n on the inventor with his young son, bade his\n child look upon Mr. Edison and recollect that\n he had met one of the great men of the earth,\n and turning to Mr. Edison asked that he\n would say something to the lad that he could\n carry away with him to influence his life.\n And Edison, looking down on the lad, said:\n \u201cNever watch the clock.\u201d-\n</p>\n<p>\n Apart from his laboratory, his investigation#\n and his experiments he has led no life espe-\n cially in recent years. He has a home adorned\n with all the elegancies that taste, refine-\n ment and wealth can give, but his happiness\n and contentment are found where the ma-\n chinery whirrs. Social side he has not, nor\n does he care for it, nor can he be induced\n except by diplomacy, even trickery, to partic-\n ipate in it. Yet with those of a common or\n mutual interest he is companionable, and is\n not without the relieving grace of humor.\n But the conventionalities of life to him are a\n bore, from which he escapes when he rec-\n ognizes them, if he can, yet often fails to\n observe them. It is in this side that he pre-\n sents his most picturesque aspect. It is\n one of the duties of the life of his helpmeet\n to see that he is appropriately clad, a duty\n most onerous in his incorrigibility. A friend\n relates that he went to see Mr. Edison at\n his laboratory on business to find him at\n home. A message was sent to Mr. Edison,\n and in course of time he arrived driven\n thereto by a coachman in livery, in a coach\n satin lined and wearing a most costly fur\n overcoat. Entering the laboratory he threw\n off the expensive fur coat and disclosed un-\n der a suit of canvas clothes stained with\n chemicals and oils. The friend remarking on\n the singular contrast between the outer and\n the nether garments Mr. Edison replied that\n when he started out it w r as the only garment\n he could find and he thought probably it be-\n longed to one of tbe boys. This is not a\n pose and the inventor seems to be uncon-\n scious of his incongruities. Indeed this in-\n difference to personal appearance has been\n characteristic of him from his beginning.\n</p>\n<p>\n Certain phases of Mr. Edison\u2019s character\n being under discussion with a ftiend of the\n inventor the remark was made that they\n smacked of charlatanism. \u201cNo greater has\n existed since the days of Balsamo,\u201d was the\n prompt reply. \u201cAnd yet he is a man in the\n fullest sense of the word. He is one who\n has his enemies, as what strong man has\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0088/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 337, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0088/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 675, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 990}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0088/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1351, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1980}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0088/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2702, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3961}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0088/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0088.jp2", "height": 3961, "width": 2702, "levels": 6, "size": 807734}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"88\">\n<p>\n 8(5\n</p>\n<p>\n STUDIES IN AMERICAN CHARACTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n not, and he has most devoted adherents and\n friends as all strong men have.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Edison has a well stored mind; he has\n been a profound student and an omnivorous\n reader, acquiring a wonderful stock of in-\n formation.

McCall.\n</p>\n<p>\n : : : \u201cHIS IS AN ARDENT TEMPERAMENT\n CONTROLLED BY STRONG COMMON SENSE.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n D URING the year past there have ap-\n peared in these columns some thirty\n studies of American characters as\n shown in the lives and careers of that num-\n ber of prominent Americans. The subjects\n of these sketches were selected with no\n thought of their beginnings, but, rather in\n consideration of the degree of distinction\n at which they arrived. Yet, in look-\n ing over this list a notable fact is\n apparent: Fully two-thirds are men who\n have climbed through their own efforts,\n without adventitious aids, all from pov-\n erty, many of them compelled to edu-\n cate themselves as best they could, while\n supporting themselves, not a few overcoming\n obstacles seemingly insurmountable. Of\n course, it is our boast that under the condi-\n tions obtaining under our system of govern-\n ment and in our peculiar civilization these\n results are possibilities and not infrequent\n occurrences.\n</p>\n<p>\n Included in this two-thirds is John A. Mc-\n Call, prominent in the insurance world.\n Power and distinction have come to him in\n the direction, perhaps it might be said in\n the rehabilitation, of one of the three or four\n life insurance companies which, by reason of\n the magnitude of their operations and the\n opulent figures of their surplus stand in the\n very front ranks.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. McCall is an excellent example of the\n American who has reached the highest plane,\n from beginnings which, if not adverse, at\n least were modest and humble. A native\n of Albany, N. Y., his parentage was respec-\n table, yet humble. Wealth was not theirs,\n nor, indeed, the poverty which is sordid\n and enervating. He attended the common\n schools of the city of his birth, being fairly\n well grounded in the elements, but his years\n</p>\n<p>\n of attendance were few. His feet were\n placed at an early age on the path which he\n has followed without deviation to success\n and distinction. His first employment was\n as a messenger boy in the insurance depart-\n ment of the state government. Advancing\n through the various grades of that depart-\n ment, he steadily rose from clerkship to\n clerkship, from responsibility to greater re-\n sponsibility, until the whole was devolved\n upon him in his appointment as deputy su-\n perintendent. By the time he had reached\n this position Mr. McCall was recognized by\n experts as one learned in insurance who\n had studied not alone its technical and finan-\n cial side, but its philosophy. This position\n he held for a number of years and though a\n man of strong political conviction, whether\n the party of his adherence or its opponent\n was in the political control of the state,\n whether the appointed head was Democratic\n or Republican, under all the changes, and\n they were frequent at this time, Mr. Mc-\n Call held it, and wholly because of his pre-\n eminent fitness for the discharge of its\n duties. Indeed, it is not too much to say\n that Mr. McCall practically became the de-\n partment.\n</p>\n<p>\n The period of his occupancy of this place\n may be called the constructive insurance\n period. Perhaps to a greater degree than\n before or since there was much insurance\n legislation affecting, even revolutionary, the\n insurance interests of the state. On the one\n side the insurance companies were contend-\n ing against the restrictions sought to be im-\n posed and for privileges which were in dan-\n ger of being destroyed, while on the other, a\n severe and rigid scheme of regulation was\n being urged. To complicate this situation,\n antagonistic and sometimes venal elements\n entered in seeking personal ends that were\n</p>\n<p>\n dangerous and confusing. The Insurance De-\n partment had been erected as a supervisory\n safeguard of the interests of the policy hold-\n ers and the public. Almost necessarily the\n influence of this department was interposed\n between th^e opposing forces which made\n the Legislature of the state their battle-\n ground. That influence > was naturally shap-\n ing and controlling, and much of the legis-\n lation of that day originated with it; in fact,\n the system of laws as it stands to-day, though\n the work of the Legislature is indeed the\n outcome of the wisdom and conservatism of\n that department. It is not of public record,\n but those familiar with the work of those\n years know that the influence of Mr. McCall\n was so .vide and efficient that if a just due\n were given he w r ould be called the architect\n of the present system. What did not origi-\n nate with him received little consideration\n if it had not his approval, and that which\n fell under his condemnation failed to reach\n the statute books.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was during this period also that the\n rigid system of examination now obtaining\n with the consequent publicity of reports was\n instituted. This perhaps was a matter of\n natural growth, but its. form was the sug-\n gestion born of the experience for so many\n years of Mr. McCall in the department.

This power and influence were\n attained by a scrupulous observance of the,\n narrow lines of his duties not seeking the\n aids of politics from without.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1883, when Grover Cleveland assumed the\n office of Governor, one of the early duties\n falling to his hands was the appointment of\n the superintendent of the department. At\n this time Mr. McCall was in receipt of an\n offer of a high position in one of the large\n insurance companies of New York City\n at a salary easily twice that attached to the\n</p>\n<p>\n office of the superintendent. It was, how-\n ever, his ambition to reach the head of the\n department which he had entered in the low-\n est station. So, casting aside the allurements\n of the New York company he offered himself\n as a candidate for appointment. There is\n now no doubt that he met with an opposition\n from two quarters, neither of which perhaps\n he had anticipated. The one was from a po-\n litical element which bad learned by his\n</p>\n<p>\n course as deputy that with him at the head\n political control of the department would\n be slight and fragile; and from an element\n of the insurance world which perhaps might\n be called the political element of that world,\n which recognized, were he the head, there\n would be a stern and masterful executant of\n existing laws, evasion of which would not\n be permitted and who, in the exercise of such\n discretion as was vested in the superintendent\n could not be reached through ordinary ave-\n nues of political influence nor swerved from\n his conception of duty. On the other hand.\n</p>\n<p>\n the best elements of the insurance interests\n and those most interested in what was be-\n lieved to be a great organized work of benefi-\n cence supported his claims to the appoint-\n ment. Speaking of his candidacy a promi-\n nent insurance man of the day, now dead,\n said: \u201cIf McCall is appointed, there will be\n a man at the head of the department who\n knows neither friends nor enemies in the\n discharge of his duties. He will be stern and\n</p>\n<p>\n severe, but, if so, it will be an expert and\n intelligent man who will wield the powers\n of the position and, we can better afford to\n be treated with severity than to be gov-\n erned by one ignorant of the intricacies and\n difficulties of our business.\u201d This sentiment\n made known in the executive chamber, doubt-\n less had its due influence upon the appointive\n power. In course of time, Mr. McCall was\n appointed to the head of the department in\n which a dozen years previous he had entered\n as a boy.\n</p>\n<p>\n He served but one term. Between the be-\n ginning and the end of it Mr. Cleveland was\n translated to Washington and Mr. Hill in-\n stalled as Governor, with a Legislature po-\n litically adverse to him. Having decided to\n accept a lucrative appointment from a prom-\n inent insurance company of New York City,\n the term of which was to begin at the ex-\n piration of his term of public office, Mr. Mc-\n Call resigned a few months in advance of the\n expiration in order that the Governor might\n appoint his successor without a conflict with\n the Senate, which had the confirming power.\n Within a few weeks thereafter he assumed\n the duties of controller of the Equitable Life\n Insurance Company. This important position\n he occupied for some three years when the\n then president of the New York Life Insur-\n ance Company having resigned, Mr. McCall\n was made the unanimous choice of the di-\n rectors of the company as his successor, a\n position which he has since held, with a\n salary which was considered one of the phe-\n nomenal ones until the gigantic one given\n to the head of the ' hew steel combination\n made all others appear small.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this hasty review it will be seen that\n there is nothing particularly startling or pic-\n turesque in his growth. It has been one of\n steady advancement, but there are to be\n found two or three rather significant things.\n In the first place, from the very first of his\n beginning there has been preparation and\n constant education for the position which he\n now holds; the best energies of his mind have\n been devoted wholly to the insurance prob-\n lem. The singular thing, however, is that\n he has come to his present distinction\n through public service. This is a reversal\n of the ordinary rule. Where the occupancy\n of public office had benefited him by dis-\n tinction won in private effort, little be-\n yond publicity is gained by its occupant\n who has begun in such public service.\n Few so beginning have won such regard in\n the administration of public duty that they\n have been called to the discharge of mo-\n mentous private affairs. As a matter of fact,\n there is a disposition to regard lightly the\n abilities of one who has spent his time in\n public service, which amounts actually to a\n piejudice. A gentleman at the head of a\n financial institution in this borough, who has\n occupied a number of important public posi-\n tions,_j?oth state and national, on an occasion\n said that he could not see that the occupancy\n of public office had benefited him in any re-\n spect; that while the departments under his\n control had been of the first magnitude in\n their affairs, and while he had the satisfac-\n tion of knowing that under his .hand they\n had been satisfactorily conducted, he felt at\n the end that a doubt existed as to his ability\n to conduct large affairs because of his very\n connection with the public service. If this\n be an exact statement of the estimation in\n which public officials are held, then Mr. Mc-\n Call\u2019s experience is certainly singular and\n unique, for it was in public office and in the\n discharge of its duties alone, that the quali-\n ties which have lifted him to distinction\n were discovered. To-day he is no better\n known as an expert insurance man than h)\n</p>\n<p>\n JOHN A.

It may be\n further pointed out as significant in his ca-\n reer that Mr. McCall\u2019s success is an illustra-\n tion of the legitimate results of thorough\n training and education in the line of his pur-\n suit.\n</p>\n<p>\n While all this is true, his success, however,\n is not to be accounted for wholly on that\n ground. As a matter of fact, an unpreju-\n diced examination will show that he possessed\n the qualities which would have lifted him to\n a high place in any branch of human en-\n deavor that he might have undertaken. He is\n yet in the prime of life, in tvhose appearance\n there are the visible signs of an astonishing\n vitality. A man of medium height, stockily\n built, he gives the observer the suggestion\n of great physical strength. The biologist, ap-\n plying his gauge to him, would say that in\n his broad shoulders, deep chest, massive\n trunk, short neck, towering head above his\n ears, and great wudth between the eyes, he\n was destined to longevity. He who is\n not a biologist, nor even a believer in the\n rules formulated by that science, would be at\n no loss to determine that energy is the dis-\n tinguishing characteristic of Mr. McCall.\n Both physical and mental energy are writ-\n ten on his face and figure and plainly read\n in his speech and motions. That he has un-\n limited capac\u2019ty for labor is suggested in a\n glance, and as well that he has an actual sen-\n sual delight in work for work ' s sake. He is\n of the blonde type; frank, open, fearless in\n demeanor. Affable and approachable, there\n</p>\n<p>\n is a readiness of greeting in him which may\n have been the result of his long training iD\n public office, but is probably the outcome of\n a naturally democratic disposition. That he\n is a man of conviction with the courage of\n them is plainly apparent. He is too direct to\n be called diplomatic, too apt to say without\n loss of time or words what he conceives to\n be the necessary thing to be said at the time.\n That is not to say that he is without policy\n or that he is brusque or abrupt in manner.\n</p>\n<p>\n He is a man of large executive ability, of\n quick decision, rapidly shifting from one\n branch of labor to another, nor is he fretted\n with the pushing claims of several subjects\n at one and the same time. An ardent tem-\n perament is controlled by strong common\n sense. With his abundant and overflowing\n vitality his extraordinary mental and phys-\n ical capacity for labor and his unusual love\n for work considered with this ardent tem-\n perament and rapid mental processes, his\n quality is very much that of a steam en-\n gine at full pow r er. The executive and ad-\n ministrative side is the most characteristic\n of the man, and the one which first impresses\n itself upon those with whom he comes in con-\n tact. But it is not the wholly dominant side.\n Back of it, controlling and directing, is a\n strong and vigorous intellectuality. His\n mind is capacious, firm in its grasp and\n tenacious in its grip; wide-visioned; rapid in\n its processes, working with force, direct-\n ness and great precision. What he sees he\n sees clearly and w-hen the period of delibera-\n tion is passed and conclusion is reached he\n</p>\n<p>\n does not yield easily nor let go short of\n compulsion. That particular quality is clear-\n ly read in his face. His judgment of men and\n things is rarely at fault. There is imagina-\n tion in his makeup, but it is not of the spec-\n ulative kind. He is intensely practical, the\n reverse of everything visionary. One can-\n not imagine Mr. McCall giving the slight-\n est heed to the consideration of occultism,\n for instance. His qualities are those of a\n financier and his skill in the science he has\n made abundantly manifest in the direction\n of the company of which he is the head.\n</p>\n<p>\n The high measure of success he has at-\n tained came to him early in life and as yet\n he is one who cannot be said to have passed\n the dividing line of middle age. In strong\n health, abundant vitality, the prospect of long\n life before him, the years of his activity and\n usefulness are likely to be many. His record\n is probably made to-day. The future will\n contain for him only degrees of achievement\n in the field in which he is working. His am-\n bition is probably satisfied with his present\n attainment and its further urgings will only\n be in the direction of conserving, strength-\n ening and developing the great interests al-\n ready under his direction.\n</p>\n<p>\n Apart from his public side Mr. McCall is\n a genial, kindly, companion; warm in his\n friendships, domestic in his tastes and in-\n clinations and too well acquainted with\n public life by actual contact to care for its\n honors, which beckon so powerfully so many\n men who have attained a similar distinction\n in private enterprise.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0091/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 345, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 493}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0091/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 691, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 987}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0091/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1383, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1975}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0091/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2767, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3950}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:ud:ie:si:na:me:ri:ca:00:un:se:studiesinamerica00unse:studiesinamerica00unse_0091/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/ud/ie/si/na/me/ri/ca/00/un/se/studiesinamerica00unse/studiesinamerica00unse_0091.jp2", "height": 3950, "width": 2767, "levels": 6, "size": 324644}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"91\">\n<p>\n MECHANICS ' BANK\n</p>\n<p>\n Court Street, corner Montague Street,\n</p>\n<p>\n OPPOSITE CITY HALL\n</p>\n<p>\n SCHERMERHORN BANK BRANCH,\n</p>\n<p>\n 335r355 Schermerhom Street*\n</p>\n<p>\n (Parlors for Ladies.)\n</p>\n<p>\n Capital and Surplus, $1,000,000.00\n</p>\n<p>\n GEORGE W.
