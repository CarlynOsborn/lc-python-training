Thou wilt, my\n dear cousin, have frequent necessity to take this\n retrospect, and to supplicate for a continuance of\n sustaining help; for theendearingness of her whom\n thou hast been deprived of will often break in upon\n thy solitary mind; thou wilt miss her as Lady\n Rachel Russell said of her husband, \u201c sleeping,\n waking* walking, at meals,\u201d and in divers other\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:jo:ur:na:lo:fl:if:eg:os:00:co:nr:_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1_0129/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 218, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 371}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:jo:ur:na:lo:fl:if:eg:os:00:co:nr:_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1_0129/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 437, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 743}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:jo:ur:na:lo:fl:if:eg:os:00:co:nr:_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1_0129/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 874, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1486}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:jo:ur:na:lo:fl:if:eg:os:00:co:nr:_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1_0129/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1748, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2973}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:jo:ur:na:lo:fl:if:eg:os:00:co:nr:_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1_0129/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/jo/ur/na/lo/fl/if/eg/os/00/co/nr/_1/journaloflifegos00conr_1/journaloflifegos00conr_1_0129.jp2", "height": 2973, "width": 1748, "levels": 6, "size": 267374}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"129\">\n<p>\n JOHN CONRAN.\n</p>\n<p>\n 115\n</p>\n<p>\n ways : so that all will seem insipid without her.

CONTINUATION OF THE JOURNAL OF IUS\n RELIGIOUS EXPERIENCE AND SERVICES.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ninth Month 10 th .\u2014I have not felt inclined of\n late to record any of the occurrences which at\u00ac\n tended me in my spiritual progress which were\n various\u2014some painful trials and probations, and\n many temptations, over which I w r as favoured to\n get w r ith thanksgiving and praise where only it was\n due. I attended, as usual, all the meetings at home,\n and sometimes the neighbouring ones, some by ap\u00ac\n pointment and others on - my own concern, which\n were in general to my satisfaction. These services\n were at times attended with baptisms that brought\n to my recollection the state the apostle had to pass\n through when he said he was cast down, but not\n forsaken; in which times the promise of the Saviour\n was [fulfilled], \u201cI will not leave } r ou comfortless\n His poor depending children, who have none in\n heaven but Him, nor in all the^arth in comparison\n of Him, give Him the praise of His own blessed work,\n for they experience Him to be the Resurrection and\n the Life; it is by and through Him alone they live,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:jo:ur:na:lo:fl:if:eg:os:00:co:nr:_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1_0164/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 218, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 371}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:jo:ur:na:lo:fl:if:eg:os:00:co:nr:_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1_0164/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 437, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 743}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:jo:ur:na:lo:fl:if:eg:os:00:co:nr:_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1_0164/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 874, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1486}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:jo:ur:na:lo:fl:if:eg:os:00:co:nr:_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1_0164/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1748, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2973}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:jo:ur:na:lo:fl:if:eg:os:00:co:nr:_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1_0164/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/jo/ur/na/lo/fl/if/eg/os/00/co/nr/_1/journaloflifegos00conr_1/journaloflifegos00conr_1_0164.jp2", "height": 2973, "width": 1748, "levels": 6, "size": 309593}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"164\">\n<p>\n 150\n</p>\n<p>\n THE LIFE OF\n</p>\n<p>\n and because He liveth they live.

VARIOUS EXERCISES AND OPENINGS IN SCRIP\u00ac\n TURE DOCTRINE\u2014CONCLUSION OF HIS JOURNAL\u2014\n TESTIMONY OF THE MONTHLY MEETING OF LIS\u00ac\n BURN CONCERNING HIM.\n</p>\n<p>\n Second Month, 1824.\u2014I returned from B. after\n a week\u2019s absence; in one of the meetings there I\n had to address some wdiose lamp was gone out,\n and they were sensible of it, that they were not\n prepared to answer the awful summons if it should\n come whilst they were in this situation; I said I\n believed this impression was made on their minds\n by Him who willeth not the death of any, for His\n gracious will is that all who have erred and strayed\n from His heavenly sheep-fold should return, repent,\n and live; and therefore I recommended it as the\n loving mercy .of God in Christ Jesus, to awaken\n them from that sleep of forgetfulness, which if con\u00ac\n tinued in much longer might terminate in death.\n A solemn stillness covered the meeting, and I be\u00ac\n lieved the state was reached. I was invited to\n spend an evening at their house, but did not go\u2014\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:jo:ur:na:lo:fl:if:eg:os:00:co:nr:_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1_0238/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 218, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 371}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:jo:ur:na:lo:fl:if:eg:os:00:co:nr:_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1_0238/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 437, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 743}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:jo:ur:na:lo:fl:if:eg:os:00:co:nr:_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1_0238/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 874, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1486}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:jo:ur:na:lo:fl:if:eg:os:00:co:nr:_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1_0238/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1748, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2973}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:jo:ur:na:lo:fl:if:eg:os:00:co:nr:_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1:journaloflifegos00conr_1_0238/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/jo/ur/na/lo/fl/if/eg/os/00/co/nr/_1/journaloflifegos00conr_1/journaloflifegos00conr_1_0238.jp2", "height": 2973, "width": 1748, "levels": 6, "size": 299727}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"238\">\n<p>\n 224\n</p>\n<p>\n THE LIFE OF\n</p>\n<p>\n if any good is performed, let it be the Lord\u2019s work,\n and not man\u2019s.\n</p>\n<p>\n [Daring this latter period of his life, he appears\n in his early waking hours, or other seasons of re\u00ac\n tirement, when prostrated in awful silence before\n God, to have often been favoured with a flow of\n Scripture doctrine, which was spiritually explained\n to his understanding in a remarkable manner, so as\n to fill him with humble admiration and grateful\n praise; he frequently committed these passages,\n with the heads of their explanations to writing,\n whilst fresh in his memory, and on one of these\n occasions remarks how suddenly these Divine open\u00ac\n ings were closed, as if a person had been reading to\n him in a book, which was afterwards shut, and the\n communications which had been in the Divine light\n ceased, adding] not one sentence I think could I\n remember a few minutes after, I could not read any\n more in that hook , neither did I attempt it, but\n abode in the quiet submission.
