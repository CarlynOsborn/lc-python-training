I answer, it is to believe all that God says in the\n gospel concerning him, so as to look to him alone for salva\u00ac\n tion. Faith is explained by conning to Christ ; it is the ap\u00ac\n plication of the mind to him for relief.

It is such a change, as if a\n black man should become white; or a lion become a\n lamb. In a word, God takes away the heart of stone,\n and gives a heart of flesh.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is an inward change. It will indeed produce an\n outward change, if the life was before immoral; but\n there may be strict morality without this inward change.\n Reformation is not Regeneration, though too often mis\u00ac\n taken for it.

Now, without the new\n birth, no person whatever can see the kingdom of God.\n It is not said, he may not , or he shall not , but he can\u00ac\n not ; it is impossible in the nature of things.\n</p>\n<p>\n He cannot perform any of the duties.

He sees that he has, all his life, lived with\u00ac\n out God in the world, and paid no regard to his will and\n glory; that he has loved himself, the world, and the\n creature, far more than God; and that he has been doing\n all this contrary to light and knowledge; notwithstand\u00ac\n ing the checks of his conscience, and many resolutions to\n the contrary, and notwithstanding the mercies and the\n judgments which God had sent to reclaim him.

So Peter, when\n duly affected with the sin of denying his master, \u201c went\n out and wept bitterly;\u201d and Mary Magdalene, sensible\n of former iniquities, washed her Saviour\u2019s feet with her\n tears.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is indeed a false sorrow , which many mistake\n for the true.

But, too often, such a one is only sorry that God\n is so holy, that the law is so strict, and that he is in\n danger of being damned for his sins. He is not grieved\n that he has offended God, his best friend and benefactor,\n who has followed him with goodness and mercy all his\n life. But the rottenness of this repentance often appears\n when the sick person recovers; when the fright is over, he\n returns to the same carnal course as before. The sorrow is\n no better than that of some criminals at the gallows:\n very sorry they are that they have forfeited their lives;\n but they are not affected with the criminality of their ac\u00ac\n tions. Felix trembled, but did not repent; and Judas\n was sorry for what he had done, but not in a godly manner.\n And this shows how very uncertain, for the most part, is\n the repentance of a dying bed. God forbid we should\n delay our repentance to that season !\n</p>\n<p>\n But the sorrow of a true penitent is for sin , as com\u00ac\n mitted against a holy and good God.

Doubtless he was a sinner; and by some\n means or other he became a convinced sinner, a penitent\n sinner, and a praying sinner. Perhaps this was the first\n time that ever he prayed in his life; for sinning gener\u00ac\n ally keeps men from praying. It is plain that the Spirit\n of God had humbled his heart; and he was one of those\n blessed men, who are \u201c poor in spirit,\u201d and he was one\n of those blessed mourners, who u shall be comforted.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Observe his posture\u2014 he stood afar off -\u2014at a great dis\u00ac\n tance from the holy place, where the priest officiated; he\n knew this became him, for he had lived at a great dis\u00ac\n tance from God as a sinner; and he knew he de\u00ac\n served that God should for ever behold him afar off.\n</p>\n<p>\n Observe also his dejected looks: he could not look up;\n he thought it would be presumptuous in him to lift up\n his eyes to heaven, the habitation of God\u2019s glory.

Let us re\u00ac\n solve, without a moment\u2019s delay, to humble ourselves at\n his feet; and let us be encouraged to do so, by the affect\u00ac\n ing account we have heard of God\u2019s kindness. \u201c He\n sees afar off the returning sinners; he pities, he meets,\n he pardons, he embraces them.

But these persons\n have oftentimes such an awful view of the glorious and\n dreadful majesty of God, as an infinitely holy and just\n being, and of the distance that sin has occasioned, that\n they know not how to approach him.

Show what sort of a way Christ is.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. It is a living way. This way to heaven was by\n Christ\u2019s dying; yet it is called a living way, because all\n our life springs from his death. Christ is the life of all\n who live spiritually or eternally. This way is trodden\n only by such. All who are in this way are alive to God,\n and, what is more, they shall never die. The eternal\n life of all who are in Christ, and walk in him, is secure;\n for because he lives, they shall live also. No man ever\n died upon this road. \u201c I am,\u201d saith Christ, \u201c the resur\u00ac\n rection and the life ; he that believeth in me, though he\n were dead, yet shall he live; and whosoever liveth and\n believeth in me shall never die.\u201d The body indeed must\n die, because of sin, though that is more properly called\n sleep, in the New Testament, and the body shall be raised\n in glory; \u201c but the spirit is life, because of righteous\u00ac\n ness,\u201d and shall never perish, but have everlasting life.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. It is a plain way. Some ways are hard to find;\n have many turnings and windings and cross-paths; but\n this way is easy to find, and to keep. The prophet\n Isaiah, speaking of it, says, \u201c The wayfaring men, though\n fools, shall not err therein.\u201d Isa. xxxv. 8. It is an in\u00ac\n finite mercy, that the things which belong to our peace\n are not difficult.

It\n is a way prepared on purpose for the use of sinners, who\n are returning to God; and no objections are made to\n such persons.

It is a firm solid road,\n there is no danger of sinking in it, for Christ is the rock\n of ages. It suffers no alterations by rains and floods, as\n other ways do; it is passable at all times; there is\n nothing at any time to hinder our access to God, and pro\u00ac\n gress to heaven.

But this cannot be true; for if any way\n of man\u2019s invention might suffice, what occasion was there\n for Christ to come from heaven, obey the law, and endure\n the curse, that he might become our way ? For, \u201c if\n righteousness come by the law,\u201d or men can be their own\n Saviours, or partake of the mercy of God without an\n atonement, all the vast expense of Christ\u2019s sufferings and\n death might have been spared; yea, in that case \u201c the\n grace of God is set aside, and Christ is dead in vain.\u201d\n Gal. ii. 21.

It is admitted there are\n some hypocrites; and woe be to them! There was a\n hypocrite, a Judas, even among the apostles ; but religion\n did not cease because of him. If there was not a reality\n and an excellency in religion, there would be no hypo\u00ac\n crites ; if guineas and bank-notes were not valuable, there\n would be no counterfeits; and, I presume, you do not re\u00ac\n fuse to take any money, because there is base coin; nor\n would you excuse yourself from paying your rent to your\n landlord, because you are afraid of taking bad money.\n If there are hypocrites, as you say, and we allow, then\n there is the greater need to look to yourself, that you\n are sincere; but I greatly doubt the sincerity of those\n who make this excuse; and their hearts tell them it will\n not be admitted at the bar of God. Besides, it is censori\u00ac\n ous and wicked to judge another man, and to call him a\n hypocrite, unless his life is bad; but, because you can\n find no blemish in the life of a truly religious person, you\n presume to search his heart, and call him a hypocrite.\n The truth is, you would be glad to prove him such, as an\n excuse for your own want of religion. x\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.

Is it an attach\u00ac\n ment to certain ministers and buildings ? This is not\n religion. Religion is the devotedness of the heart to\n God; and without this the most pompous forms are of\n no avail. Nicodemus was an old man when he came to\n Christ, who said to him as we say to you, \u201c Except a man\n be born again he cannot see the kingdom of God.\u201d In\n a word, if your religion has not changed you, it is high\n time to change your religion.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. Methinks I hear another say,\u2014 I intend to he better\n at some future time. So did F elix, who trembled when Paul\n preached, and said to him, \u201c When I have a convenient\n season, I will call for thee;\u201d but that season never came.\n The way to hell is paved with good intentions. Should you\n die in your sins, which God forbid! out of your own\n mouth will you be condemned; for you are forced to\n admit that all is not right; and yet you venture to go on\n in sin, though you know not what a day may bring forth.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0117/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 237, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 404}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0117/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 474, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 808}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0117/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 948, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1617}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0117/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1897, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3234}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0117/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sa/il/or/sc/om/pa/ni/on/00/pr/es/sailorscompanion00pres/sailorscompanion00pres_0117.jp2", "height": 3234, "width": 1897, "levels": 6, "size": 378550}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"117\">\n<p>\n OF SINNERS EXPOSED.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ill\n</p>\n<p>\n Go to tlie sick and dying bed of a neighbour, and hear\n him groan and complain of an aching head and sick\n stomach ; observe his shaking hand and disordered pulse;\n the rattling throat, the convulsed limbs, and the cold\n sweat; and say, is this a time for repentance?

Every man has a soul of the greatest value.\n</p>\n<p>\n The nature of the human soul is, at present, but im\u00ac\n perfectly known. God has not told us so much about it,\n as to gratify our curiosity; but enough, to assist our\n faith. From the scriptures alone we learn anything sat\u00ac\n isfactory concerning our souls; and there we find that\n the soul is a something distinct from the body; a think\u00ac\n ing immortal substance ; and capable of living separately\n from the body in another world. This appears from\n Matt. x. 28, where our Lord says to his disciples\u2014\u201c Fear\n not them which kill the body; but are not able to kill\n the soul; but rather fear him, which is able to destroy\n both soul and body in hell. \" In like manner, we learn\n from the parable of Dives and Lazarus, that the soul of\n the former was tormented in hell, while his body lay\n buried in earth. Jesus Christ assured the penitent thief\n on the cross, that he should be with him that very day in\n paradise, while, as we know, the body of Jesus was laid\n in the tomb. It is said of Judas, that he went to his own\n place , which certainly was hell; but his wretched carcass\n was on earth. Paul declared, that death would be gain\n to him, because, when absent from the body , he should\n be present with the Lord ; useful as he was in the church,\n and happy in that usefulness, he rather desired to die, to\n depart, to be with Christ , which was far better.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now this immortal soul is of immense value: and its\n excellency may be argued from the following considera\u00ac\n tions :\n</p>\n<p>\n 10*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0120/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 241, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 403}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0120/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 483, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 806}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0120/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 967, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1612}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0120/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1935, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3224}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0120/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sa/il/or/sc/om/pa/ni/on/00/pr/es/sailorscompanion00pres/sailorscompanion00pres_0120.jp2", "height": 3224, "width": 1935, "levels": 6, "size": 408331}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"120\">\n<p>\n 114 THE VALUE OF THE SOUL.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1.

See\n a list of them in 1 Cor. vL 9, and mark, whether any of\n you are there described. \u201c Know ye not that the un\u00ac\n righteous shall not inherit the kingdom of God ? be not\n deceived; neither fornicators\u2014nor adulterers\u2014nor effemi\u00ac\n nate/ 7 that is, persons of lascivious tempers and prac\u00ac\n tices, however private and alone \u2014\u201c nor sodomites\u2014nor\n thieves\u2014nor covetous\u2014nor drunkards\u2014nor revilers\u2014-nor\n extortioners, shall inherit the kingdom of God. 77 Look\n over this black catalogue again, and if you find your name\n there, own it.

If we consult the world, in which \u201c sin abounds,\u201d\n we shall find that u fools make a mock at it;\u201d they treat\n it as a trifle, which need not give them any uneasiness :\n there are some who are properly \u201c workers of iniquity ;\u201d\n it is their trade, yea, their food, their element, their de\u00ac\n light ; they \u201c cannot cease from sin :\u201d and some go further\n still; they plead for it, they promote it in others, and\n \u201c glory in their shame.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n But, whatever mistaken men, who are deceived and en\u00ac\n slaved by the destroyer, may think of sin, we are sure\n that our holy God, who cannot be deceived, and will not\n deceive us, accounts it an abominable thing, and hates it\n with a perfect hatred. And how can it be otherwise ?\n for it is exactly the reverse of all that he is, all that he\n approves, and all that he requires. He gave us our being;\n he gave us all the powers of body and mind which we\n possess. He gave us this earth on which we dwell; and\n he has filled it with his goodness. \u201c He gives us rain\n from heaven and fruitful seasons, and fills our hearts with\n food and gladness.\u201d And all that he requires, and most\n reasonably requires, by way of return, is that we love him\n supremely, and that we love our neighbour as we wish he\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0157/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 237, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 404}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0157/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 474, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 808}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0157/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 948, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1617}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0157/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1897, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3234}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0157/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sa/il/or/sc/om/pa/ni/on/00/pr/es/sailorscompanion00pres/sailorscompanion00pres_0157.jp2", "height": 3234, "width": 1897, "levels": 6, "size": 376080}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"157\">\n<p>\n SIN ODIOUS TO GOD.\n</p>\n<p>\n 151\n</p>\n<p>\n should love us.

Psalm xxxiv. 19.\n</p>\n<p>\n For our light affliction which is but for a moment,\n worketh for us a far more exceeding and eternal weight\n of glory. 2 Cor. iv. 17.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mark the perfect man and behold the upright: for the\n end of that man is peace. Psalm xxxvii. 37.\n</p>\n<p>\n Precious in the sight of the Lord is the death of his\n saints. Psalm cxvi. 15.\n</p>\n<p>\n For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain. Phil.\n</p>\n<p>\n i. 21.\n</p>\n<p>\n And I heard a voice from heaven saying unto me,\n Write, Blessed are the dead which die in the Lord from\n henceforth; Yea, saith the Spirit, that they may rest from\n their labours, and their works do follow them. Bev. xiv.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13.\n</p>\n<p>\n O death, where is thy sting ? O grave, where is thy\n victory ? The sting of death is sin, and the strength of\n sin is the law; but thanks be to God which giveth us the\n victory through our Lord Jesus Christ. 1 Cor. xv. 56, 57.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0222/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 241, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 403}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0222/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 483, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 806}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0222/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 967, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1612}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0222/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1935, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3224}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sa:il:or:sc:om:pa:ni:on:00:pr:es:sailorscompanion00pres:sailorscompanion00pres_0222/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sa/il/or/sc/om/pa/ni/on/00/pr/es/sailorscompanion00pres/sailorscompanion00pres_0222.jp2", "height": 3224, "width": 1935, "levels": 6, "size": 378389}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"222\">\n<p>\n 216 WHAT IS RELIGION?\n</p>\n<p>\n The religion of the Bible secures our resurrection from the\n *i grave and our happiness in heaven.\n</p>\n<p>\n OR, we know that if our earthly house of this taber-\n</p>\n<p>\n JL 1 nacle were dissolved, we have a building of God, a\n house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens. 2\n Cor. v. 1.\n</p>\n<p>\n For if we believe that Jesus died and rose again, even\n so them also which sleep in Jesus will God bring with\n him. 1 Thess. iv. 14.\n</p>\n<p>\n For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and this\n mortal must put on immortality.
