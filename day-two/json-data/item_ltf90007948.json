It represents \u00ab\n hopper into which the angelic power of our beautiful Spiritual religion has\n thrown all its opposing churches, with their creeds, mummery, hypocrisy and\n priests, together with the crimes of civilized society, to be absorbed by tin*\n Universal Globe of Spiritual Truth. It shows, at a glance, the rapid strides\n the truly scientific and divine Spiritual phenomena have made, and are now\n making throughout the world, since their first ^-development by the good\n angels, through the Fox family, of Hydesville, Wayne county, New York,\n March, 1848\u2014only nineteen years ago.\n</p>\n<p>\n Already has our beautiful Spiritual religion absorbed into its Unitary Fold,\n 50,000,000 of souls, from all the various sects, creeds and ranks of society\u2014not\n excepting even the Emperors and Queens of Europe and Asia, and some of the\n most intellectual Atheists of the world \u2014 thereby giving us a \u201cNew Heaven\n and a New Earth,\u201d or practically bringing the people into that harmonious\n state spoken of by that wise philosopher and beautiful medium, Jesus of\n Nazareth, in his prayer\u2014\u201cThy Kingdom come; thy will be done, in our\n earth-bodies, and on earth,\u201d and not in some far-off orthodox pasture.

The self existence of matter being positively self-\n evident, so also is its self-action, as the two are twins: the first position can\n not be accepted without accepting the second. Dense forms are only tempo\u00ac\n rarily so, as modern science demonstrates that 3,000 degrees of heat changes\n the most dense substances back to their ethereal home; and that matter, in its\n original ethereal state, is chemically a unit, or one kind of substance. The\n reason why the various forms or bodies of the universe differ in their chemistry,\n color, shape, sex, habits or modes of life, is owing to the density or rarity\n of the substance composing them. This is the reason why the planet, horse,\n bee, bird, angel, man, woman, Ac. \u2014 all made of the same kind of God-\n substance \u2014 differ from each other, but the limitation of the human mind can\n never measure exactly those differences. We should ever bear in mind that\n the substance making up any of the different forms of the universe, from the\n largest to the smallest planets, animals, insects, vegetables, including men and\n .women, is never new nor old because it can never be added to nor taken from\n the universe, but is an ever present, changing, self-existing, self-acting sub\u00ac\n stance, now and forever, worlds without beginning or end\u2014for there is noth\u00ac\n ing new nor old, as substance, under the sun. (Bible corrected.) As substance\n only exists, and is never new nor old, consequently it never retrogrades nor\n progresses\u2014in the sense that it never deteriorates nor improves\u2014lienee the\n progression of any substance, or human-substance-forms, is, to the intelligent\n mind, an impossibility. Centuries ago, the difference between good and bad,\n or harmony and inharmony, could be measured with the same degree of cer\u00ac\n tainty as in the present century, yet the proportionate amount of evil of the\n nineteenth century is as great, if not greater, than in any past century. Jesus\n was a well-born substance-form, eighteen centuries ago\u2014yet the world, since\n that time, has failed to show us one individual who has been elevated up to or\n beyond his good qualities as a whole. Now, I ask-\u2014What lias become of, and\n what constitutes progression ? Progression, as generally understood and used,\n lias been misapplied, to represent an improvement in the quality instead of the\n harmonious action of substance or any of its forms, and that innate harmony,\n equity and order, is as permanent as substance itself, without which, harmony,\n equity and order can not be. Progression may also be applied to the motion\n of bodies, but not in the sense that substance can be improved in its quality.\n The last born angel strata of any planet, is chemically the same as the first bom\n angel strata, bom many millions years before. As the time never was when\n substance did not exist, hence it never had a cause beginning, consequently\n t ' an never have an effect ending .

(Bible corrected.) There can be nothing outside nor\n inside the universe of substance as a supposed to exist principle or power to\n make it alive or act, because, what would be otherwise a vacuum is already\n infilled with God-natural-spiritual substance, consequently, substance itself is\n perpetually, innately, integrally alive, or self-existing and self-acting; therefore\n incontestibly must be, the life, the soul, the spirit, the mind, the instinct, the\n intuition, the impression, the form, the order, the motion, the sound, the prin\u00ac\n ciple, the power, the magnetism, the sensation, the everything. In an absolute\n sense, life, soul, spirit, mind, instinct, intuition, impression, form, order, mo\u00ac\n tion, sound, principle, power, magnetism, sensation and substance are all one\n and the same, or synonymous terms. There can be no life, motion, sound,\n song, or language, without the primary existence of substance-forms. The\n substance-body of a bird must first exist, before we can hear its song. Tho\n reason why all substance, not perverted , assumes equitable and orderly forms, is\n because it is itself inherently, innately, and integrally, equity and order ; and\n as like always produces its like, hence, out from the universe of equitable,\n orderly, living, God-substance, must be born all equitable, orderly forms. The\n equitable, orderly God-substance that forms the eye, eyelid, eyelash, eyebrow,\n eye muscles, optic nerves, and brain, is the condition, existence, necessity,\n adaptation and use, of such dense substance-forms, to adapt them for self\u00ac\n protection, and to use the ethereal light for sight and seeing, and are just as\n divine, or natural-spiritual, in a horse, hog, bird, cat, hyena, reptile and fish, as\n in a man or angel, and no one can draw a line of divine or natural-spiritual\n difference between them. In an absolute sense, any substance, when reduced\n to its ultimate ethereal, homogeneous state, is unparticleized, therefore there\n can be no such thing as fine or coarse substance, high or low states; they are\n merely relative terms to define temporary conditions of substance.\n</p>\n<p>\n Without the ethereal light, air and magnetism, there would be no necessity\n for organized eyes, ears and lungs; there would be no demand for those ethe\u00ac\n real conditions of substance called light, air and magnetism.

Spiritualism, as taught by the Angels, through the man Jesus, was\n known to the Hindoos, and to Confucius, of China, many centuries prior to\n the Christian era. Spiritualism of to-day is simply a re-development of the\n same phenomena, with elevated intellects, and wisdom, to explain and practi-\n calize it. It is rapidly becoming popular and fashionable among the rich sec\u00ac\n tarians, whose aristocratic notions have heretofore led them to hypocritically\n worship Creeds, Mummery, Priests, and unknown personal Gods, Devils and\n material Hells. The creed churches are rapidly, yet slyly, using our spiritual\n thunder: it elevates their souls; it gives them hope; it is a lever in the hands\n of Angels (see Design), that is rapidly lifting the people of the Globe out of\n Ignorance, Superstition, Crime, Priestcraft and Political Gambling, up into\n Wisdom, Knowledge, Truth, Justice, Love, Charity and Unity. \u201cNow, con\u00ac\n cerning spiritual gifts, brethren, I would not have you ignorant.\u201d\u2014Cor., 12 c.,\n 1 v. \u201c But the manifestation of the Spirit is given to every man, woman and\n child, to profit withal.\u201d\u2014Bible corrected, Cor., 12 c., 7 v. \u201c For by one Spirit\n are we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether\n we be bond or free; and have been all made to drink into one Spirit.\u201d\u2014Cor.,\n 12 c., 13 v.\n</p>\n<p>\n NO SECT IN HEAVEN.\n</p>\n<p>\n A DREAM.\n</p>\n<p>\n Talkin ' * of sects until late one eve,\n</p>\n<p>\n Of the various doctrines the saints believe,\n That night I stood, in a troubled dream,\n</p>\n<p>\n By the side of a darkly flowing stream.\n</p>\n<p>\n And a \u201cChurchman\u201d down to the river came,\n When I heard a strango voice call his name:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cGood father, stop!
