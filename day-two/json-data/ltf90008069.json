But if\n nothing could excuse him, how much soever entitled to our pity\n and assistance, who, afflicted with a contagion, would wilfully ex\u00ac\n pose his fellow mortals to the same calamity, how much more de\u00ac\n serving of our reproof is he, w ho exerts his utmost endeavours to\n spread abroad his errors, and corrupt the minds of others !

For what is language, but an infinite\n series of combinations of signs to represent an infinite series of\n ideas, incessantly succeeding each other in the human mind ? Yet\n you pretend that a limited number of combinations, ready made,\n and learned by heart, (2) will constitute the knowledge of a lan\u00ac\n guage !\n</p>\n<p>\n (1) A French Ear, as Mr. Dufief calls it, means nothing, .or it signi\u00ac\n fies at least, that he will in 36 lessons, make better scholars than other teach\u00ac\n ers. \u201c His scholars,\u201d he says, \u201c will be superior to any one, who, having for\n one year, studied the French in Paris, should, besides, have had, between his\n lessons, the advantage of practising with the natives.\u201d Nay, Mr. D.\u2019s pu\u00ac\n pils, after their 36 lessons, are to know so much of the language, to understand it\n so well, to master it so readily, that they want no such thing as boarding, for\n some time, in a French family, in order to practise and become more familiar\n with the language. This boarding in French families, he intimates , is a trick of\n unsuccessful teachers, who thus get rid of their scholars, and afterwards take\n to themselves credit for the progress which their pupils may have made in\n their intercourse with French natives.\n</p>\n<p>\n (\u00a3) The expression to \u201c learn by heart,\u201d as it is generally understood, as\n Mr. Dufief understands it, and finally, as I understand it, signifies to repeat,\n over and over, in rotation from the book, and with as much attention as pos\u00ac\n sible, a series of words or phrases, or whatever is to be committed to\n memory, till by dint of repetition, such series of words or sentences are so\n well associated in the mind, that, at any future period, without the assistance of\n the book, that series of words or phrases will recur to the mind, in the very\n same order in ivhich they have been learned. Now, I say, that this is not na\u00ac\n ture\u2019s mode of teaching. I maintain and I shall prove, that he who teaches a\n language in this manner, understands nothing about the relations which exist\n between language and the human mind, is a perfect stranger to the nature\n of memory, and that, far from obtaining any success, he must produce all the\n evils which are the necessary consequences of an infringement of nature\u2019s laws. %\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0009/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 142, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 269}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0009/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 285, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 539}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0009/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 570, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1079}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0009/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1140, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2159}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0009/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4318}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0009/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ex/am/in/at/io/no/fm/rd/00/ma/ne/examinationofmrd00mane/examinationofmrd00mane_0009.jp2", "height": 4318, "width": 2280, "levels": 6, "size": 666834}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"9\">\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n You speak of nature\u2019s method; you flatter yourself that you\n have discovered her mysterious process ; how has it not come into\n your mind, that even a whole life might be too short for the learn\u00ac\n ing of a language after that cautious teacher\u2019s system ?

But, this is not all: anterior to the above difficulty,\n there is another which you do not appear to have even suspected ;\n yet one need not be a great philosopher to see that, before a child\n thinks of learning sentences, he must be aware that they are made\n for signs. What induced you to imagine that the child knows that\n sentences, which, to his ears are nothing but a succession of strange\n unmeaning sounds, are intended for signs, w hich he must attend to ?\n Reveal to us how he is made sensible of that preliminary and in\u00ac\n dispensable truth ?\u2014Yet no: it would be cruel to press you so\n hard : let us, for argument\u2019s sake, admit what is above your pow\u00ac\n er to explain, namely, that nature\u2019s pupil is informed, in some\n way or other which you cannot tell, that a spoken sentence is in\u00ac\n tended for the sign of a judgment, which is in the mind of the speak\u00ac\n er ; still returning to the first started difficulty, we summon you to\n demonstrate to us, by what means nature\u2019s pupil is led to hit upon\n</p>\n<p>\n The pure French, as far as I am informed, is the only tongue in Europe that\n has no accent. Proven^aux, Gascons, Languedocians, Basques, Bas-Bretons,\n and many others of our own country people, may pronounce our language with\n respect to sounds and articulations , as purely as the other French people; still\n they will accent osir words, as they are used from infancy to accent those of\n their home dialect, by which they are immediately detected by their other coun\u00ac\n trymen. Among those divers sectional accents, some are not unpleasant, others\n are more or less disagreeble to a French ear, but all want loftiness and dignity.\n Cato delivering his soliloquy with the Gascon accent, or Antony his funeral\n and incendiary speech in the Provencal way, would most surely produce upon\n French people effects which would set at defiance the best skill of Mather.\n That very English accent, made still more intolerable by a bad pronunciation\n of vowels and consonants , is the stumbling block of an American ; yet what\n may appear surprising is, that if properly guided, he will, sooner than the Pro\u00ac\n vencal and Gascon, succeed in speaking the French free from his own national\n accent. The reason, however, is obvious; the American scholar may be well\n advised before he speaks the French , that is, before he has contracted bad habits ;\n whereas, the Provencal, and the Gascon, speak the French at home in their way ,\n before they think of, or even care for correcting themselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n Suppose a French book of phrases, to be learned by heart, is put in the hands\n of a scholar twenty years old, that is, a person who, for at least twelve years,\n has been used to give to letters and syllables, precisely the same as ours , a cer\u00ac\n tain value which is contrary to that which we give to them ; he goes home and\n commits the sentences t\u00a9 memory, that is, he reads and repeats them by him\u00ac\n self, over and over, till he thinks he knows them ; now, the luckiest thing which\n may happen to him is, that he will immediately forget the whole, for there is, at\n least , twelve years against a few moments of hasty and superficial advice offered\n to his mind, engaged with many other things, that he will speak the little he\n inay remember in the most unintelligible and ridiculous manner.

Suppose a dog snatch a piece\n of bread from the child\u2019s hand, and run away. The mother says,\n \u201c The dog has taken George\u2019s bread.\u201d What reason can the\n child have to think that the whole of that sentence does not mean\n the dog , or simply, the bread, or the act of running, perhaps of\n eating ? Why should he not as well believe that the sentence sig\u00ac\n nifies the feeling of hunger , the ideas of theft , of violence, or in\u00ac\n injustice, & ic. ? Neither do I see why, \u201c The dog has taken\n George ' s bread,\u201d should not be construed by him into \u201c Dog! give\n back to George his bread,\u201d or, in short, any other analogy. If\n you, sir, with the unspeakable advantage of a powerful mind,\n have been so far mistaken, as to imagine that there vyas no think\u00ac\n ing without speaking , no memory without external ears , how can\n you expect a child, who takes its first lesson, to perceive that which\n baffles the efforts of reason to explain ! You will, perhaps, tell us,\n that the child does not guess at the first trial, but that, after repeat\u00ac\n ed experiments, it at last succeeds; but we do not wish to know '\n when it guesses, we intreat you to tell us in what manner it is made\n to guess. Besides, we should have no sort of objection to grant\n you the experiments, if the dog were always at hand to snatch\n George\u2019s bread, the very same piece of bread, from the same hand,\n in the same time, place, manner, circumstances, fyc. fyc. all things\n necessary to constitute identity in the judgment; else, how could\n the child imagine, that the same series of sounds represent a se\u00ac\n cond judgment, different in so many respects ? But not to cavil w ith\n you, sir, and, putting aside all those philosophical niceties; I say,\n that many days, perhaps several weeks, nay, a w hole year may\n pass, before the dog will snatch George\u2019s bread ; therefore, there\n will be no more occasion for the sentence, which, of course, must\n become obsolete. Mind, sir, that any other phrase 1 might have\n chosen, would equally answer my purpose, for, I would in the same\n manner prove to you, that it would run the same chance of being\n seldom or never repeated to the child; consequently, we can easily\n conceive a new trial at every sentence spoken, but as it is never or\n hardly ever the same, we perceive no experiments. Yet it is only\n by dint of experiments that there is any learning of language ;\n without frequent recurrences there can be no impressions made, no\n associations, no memory, no practice, no exercise, no habits of pro\u00ac\n nunciation : this is precisely your mode of teaching, but it is not\n nature\u2019s.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another query. Thanks to the arts of writing and printing, the\n sentences in your system are bounded right and left by officious\n margins, which protect them from each other\u2019s contact, so that,\n like so many jewels in their case, they are perfectly distinguished\n by the eye, and your pupils, consequently, will never take two for\n one.

A\n child could not be made sensible of the snatching of a piece of\n bread by a dog, if the dog, the act, and the bread,, did not each se\u00ac\n parately strike his perceptive powers; in a like manner, the vo\u00ac\n cal proposition which is intended for the compound sign of such a\n scene, will never be comprehended by him, unless he has before\n been made acquainjLed With the intent of each of its separate parts.\n Nature, consequently, teaches not language by whole sentences.\n</p>\n<p>\n What would a child do with a whole sentence, even if, at the\n first hearing, he could have suspected its import, its meaning, and\n pronounced, learned, and remember it ? Use it!

A word , there\u00ac\n fore, that expresses no thought or action , has no force by itself, and\n only serves as a link in the chain that makes up a phrase, or com\u00ac\n plete sense.

Thus, even if possessed of a\n long list of unmeaning sounds, or mere names of things , without\n any idea of their relative uses and qualities, the infantine palace\n of memory might truly be said to be furnished with useless lumber.\n What would it avail with respect to the acquisition of language, to\n know the names of all animals of the creation, the necessary articles\n of life, & c. without a connexion ?

I answer, NO: for such a thing\n is useless, it is impossible, it is absurd. No vocal sign can be no\u00ac\n ticed, attended to, and learned by the child, before he feels an urgent\n want, which renders necessary the immediate and frequent use of\n that sign. The child ostensibly begins the practical study of his\n mother tongue, as soon as he is made sensible that his native lan\u00ac\n guage of pantomimic signs begins to be inadequate to the expression\n of his increasing wants. It is only then , that his anxiety to com\u00ac\n municate what he feels, disposes him to turn his attention to vo\u00ac\n cal sounds, which, before that moment, he did not mind any more\n than other common sounds. The first time a new want, expressed\n by the child in his native language, happens to be misunderstood,\n he is forcibly made to experience the necessity of some more suc\u00ac\n cessful mode of conveying his new idea; (3) it is about that time,\n that after many disappointments, the first vocal sign is at last\n guessed at, tried, ascertained, stammered over, and adopted for in\u00ac\n cessant use ; for at that period of life, the same wants frequently\n recur, and so also, the terms which express them must be often re\u00ac\n sorted to. A child\u2019s wants are few, their increase is slow ; there\u00ac\n fore, plain common sense, (philosophy is nothing else,) tells us that\n the demand for new signs to express them, must bear an exact pro\u00ac\n portion with their moderate increase. This plain, lucid, and cau\u00ac\n tious onset of nature, displays at once before us the beautiful\n simplicity of her system of imparting knowledge to her pupil.\n</p>\n<p>\n (3) If we attentively observe children at that epoch, we shall see that their\n bad humour, fretting, and cries, are the spiteful expressions, and utmost elForts\n of their disappointed pantomimic eloquence ; it is the critical time when, made\n more and more sensible of the inadequacy of their native signs, they are\n prompted by necessity to turn their attention to vocal signs.\n</p>\n<p>\n A child whose wants should be anticipated, would, I believe, make slow\n progress in the learning of his mother tongue. We ought not to consider as\n genuine progress, certain words and phrases, which parents and nurses teach\n to children, and make the latter repeat before friends and strangers, in order to\n render them more interesting ; for the young ones most certainly do not under\u00ac\n stand the meaning of those words or sentences which may be said to have been\n learned by heart. There are few persons who are sufficiently aware how in\u00ac\n finitely simple must be the things presented to the perception of little children ;\n the practice of teaching words or phrases to them is extremely mischievous,\n because it occupies their minds to no useful purpose, and turns their attention\n fVom the real lessons of nature, with which they are incessantly engaged. Ano\u00ac\n ther thing that I would recommend to parents and nurses, is to speak sparingly\n to their children* and articulate and pronounce slowly, distinctly, and the\n best they can when addressing them : the infantine mode of speaking to little\n children with half articulated words, is pernicious, as it gives them a false idea\n of the vocal signs.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0026/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 145, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 264}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0026/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 290, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 529}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0026/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 581, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1058}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0026/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1163, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2117}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0026/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2327, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4234}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0026/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ex/am/in/at/io/no/fm/rd/00/ma/ne/examinationofmrd00mane/examinationofmrd00mane_0026.jp2", "height": 4234, "width": 2327, "levels": 6, "size": 724920}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"26\">\n<p>\n Is it necessary to ' be a great philosopher, to observe that a child\n twelve or fifteen months old, having but his immediate and limited\n wants to attend to, for the expression of which he is provided with\n his native signs , cannot be supposed to have the least occasion for\n the names of the things which surround him , still less of all the\n animals of the creation and necessaries of life , fyc. ?

Besides, it is < k incontrovertible\u201d that his\n grandfather will at any time recall his grandmother, and the latter being in like\n manner associated to, is still alive , will most surely occasion the recollection of it.\n Then, as his grandmother is in close intimacy with his great-grandfather , she\n will start him up. who, in his turn, will stir up his grandson, who will elbow his\n brother , who will wake his sister , and so on, from the beginning of my book to\n its end ; for, like nature\u2019s, all my system is linked together\u2014 with italics.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0030/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 145, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 264}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0030/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 290, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 529}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0030/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 581, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1058}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0030/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1163, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2117}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0030/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2327, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4234}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0030/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ex/am/in/at/io/no/fm/rd/00/ma/ne/examinationofmrd00mane/examinationofmrd00mane_0030.jp2", "height": 4234, "width": 2327, "levels": 6, "size": 760473}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"30\">\n<p>\n \u201830\n</p>\n<p>\n chance that one of those ideas actually in the mind, will reproduce one of\n the other past ideas; the less, therefore, is his memory.\n</p>\n<p>\n A person who should have never learned the numbers in any other way\n than from one to two, two to three, & c. which we may call the simplest\n associations , would not be able, without the greatest effort, to recite the\n numbers in the inverted order; if he had learned and equally practised\n numbers in both orders, he would, with equal facility, repeat them in both\n directions. It might be said that such a person knew numbers by two as\u00ac\n sociations, and his memory, with respect to numbers, would be exactly dou\u00ac\n ble that of him who should know them by one association only. But, if q.\n person, besides learning numbers by these two associations, had been used\n to associate in his mind, one with three, three with five, five with seven, and\n so on, it is equally evident, that this memory, with regard to numbers,\n would be extended by a treble association, and, consequently, be more ex\u00ac\n tensive than that of him who could only repeat them in the direct and in\u00ac\n verted order.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus, by increasing the number of associations, we might suppose a\n man who, at the actual idea of any given number, would, without effort,\n without any interference of his will , immediately think of any number\n whatever. Such a man would possess the maximum of memory with re\u00ac\n spect to numbers. Now, such is the memory requisite to master a language\n with the velocity of thought; and that memory , which evidently is the ef\u00ac\n fect of a multiplication of associations, is an acquired faculty.\n</p>\n<p>\n When a man actually remembers a past idea, it is because the idea which\n immediately preceded it, that is, its antecedent , has brought it into his\n mind.\n</p>\n<p>\n When a man cannot recollect a past idea, it is because the actual idea\n in his mind is not associated, or not sufficiently associated, with the wished-\n for past idea. A being whose each individual idea should be equally asso\u00ac\n ciated with every one of his other ideas, would at the same time remember\n all his ideas at once. Such a being would possess the maximum of univer\u00ac\n sal memory. He would have at the same moment in his mind, all his past\n and present ideas. God is the only intelligence whom we can suppose to\n possess such an infinite memory. A being whose individual idea should\n be associated with none of his past ideas, would have no memory at all.\n The human intellect lies, and is graduated, between those two extremes, and\n it approaches the one or the other in proportion to the thinking faculties\n as they are more or less exerted. Teachers of youth, reflect upon this !\n</p>\n<p>\n Thinking is an act of the mind which multiplies associations. He who\n thinks more, acquires more memory upon the subject of his thoughts; he\n who thinks less, has less memory. That memory which consists in recol\u00ac\n lecting series, dates, ideas, words or sentences in rotation ; in short, that\n memory which is the result of the simplest associations, is the memory of\n the unthinking; it may be useful for some professions, but, in my humble\n opinion, it is the bane of sound teaching and genuine learning.\n</p>\n<p>\n We know things, we master and use them, in the same manner that we\n have learned them. There are things which we need not know otherwise\n than by the simplest associations, that is, from the beginning to the end ;\n a song, for instance, is sufficiently known, when learned from its first to its\n last word ; there is no necessity to learn it from its end to its beginning.\n But is language a song ?

Nothing shows more evidently the ignorance of\n the nature of memory, than the idea, that the practical knowledge of a lan\u00ac\n guage can be acquired upon the benches of a school, or in the pages of a\n book. Upon the teacher, and th e first outset , depends, indeed, the success\n or total failure of the pupil. An intelligent teacher may devise the best\n means to facilitate the multiplication of associations, and make the task of\n a scholar comparatively easy ; but, farther than that, the extent of memory\n necessary to master a language, depends wholly upon industry, practice,\n and time.\n</p>\n<p>\n If, in the course of these letters, I have been so fortunate as to express\n my ideas with sufficient clearness, it must appear evident to you, sir, and to\n my other readers :\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 st, That whole sentences ready made, constitute not the elements of lan\u00ac\n guage.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2 dly, That nature does not tench language to man by whole sentences\n ready made, as you do.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0032/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 145, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 264}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0032/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 290, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 529}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0032/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 581, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1058}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0032/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1163, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2117}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0032/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2327, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4234}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ex:am:in:at:io:no:fm:rd:00:ma:ne:examinationofmrd00mane:examinationofmrd00mane_0032/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ex/am/in/at/io/no/fm/rd/00/ma/ne/examinationofmrd00mane/examinationofmrd00mane_0032.jp2", "height": 4234, "width": 2327, "levels": 6, "size": 605372}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"32\">\n<p>\n 52\n</p>\n<p>\n 0 021 817 324\n</p>\n<p>\n 3 dly, That teaching by heart in rotation, that is, by the simplest asso\u00ac\n ciation , which does very well for a song, is infinitely insufficient for\n language from which truth it follows, that your mode of teaching phra\u00ac\n ses by heart in rotation, is infinitely insufficient.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4thly, That the teaching of language is not such a bagatelle, and the\n acquiring of it so light a business, as you think them to be ; which fourth\n and last proposition should be strongly impressed upon the mind of youth\n and the public, in order that they who wish to acquire, in a proper manner ,\n the knowledge of the French, Spanish, or any other living language, may\n be enabled to estimate the deserts of a teacher, and form a correct idea of\n the attention , industry , and perseverance, necessary to carry their contem\u00ac\n plated undertaking to a happy termination.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here, sir, before I close this letter, I will only add, that in all which I\n have said against your mode of teaching, as it is expounded in your Na\u00ac\n ture Displayed , I have taken for granted, that your plan was followed by\n an intelligent teacher, like yourself, for instance, with one single scholar ;\n for I could not, for a single moment, entertain so mean an opinion of the\n common sense of mankind, as to believe that they would not readily per\u00ac\n ceive the effects of your circular process, when applied to a numerous\n class; and l trust, that the public will now understand (he true import\n of your favourite phrase, u the m > re the better \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n I am your obedient servant,\n</p>\n<p>\n J.
