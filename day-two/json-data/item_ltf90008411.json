We are gathered to celebrate the centen\u00ac\n nial anniversary of the beginning of modern missions. Just one hun\u00ac\n dred years ago to-day was organized in Kettering, England, the first\n society of modern times for giving the gospel to the heathen. Presently\n the people from all the world will be assembling in Chicago for the pur\u00ac\n pose of commemorating the adding of a new continent to the map of the\n world, and that is well. But what is the discovery of a continent com\u00ac\n pared to the beginning of modern missions? Columbus discovered\n America, but Carey discovered the world. In behalf of the Baptists of\n Kentucky, in behalf of the denomination and the community in Louis\u00ac\n ville, and in behalf of this grand old church with whom you meet, I bid\n you welcome. It is well that you have come; well for you in the blessing\n you will receive in your labors of love among us; well for us in the in.\n struction and inspiration we will derive from your coming and from the\n glad messages you bring, and well for the cause of Him who loved us and\n gave himself for us, and whose right it is to reign.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0004/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 155, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 262}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0004/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 311, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 525}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0004/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 623, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1051}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0004/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1247, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2103}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0004/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2495, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4206}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0004/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ce/nt/en/ni/al/ce/le/br/00/so/ut/_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0_0004.jp2", "height": 4206, "width": 2495, "levels": 6, "size": 731558}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"4\">\n<p>\n 4\n</p>\n<p>\n CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION\n</p>\n<p>\n Prof. H. Harris, LL.D., spoke on\n</p>\n<p>\n Results of a Century of Missions.\n</p>\n<p>\n The last hundred years have seen greater and more varied progress\n than any other like period in the history of mankind. A map of the\n world as now printed on great power presses is not only immensely\n superior in finish and accuracy, but it also presents a different world\n from that of its prototype, laboriously drawn with goose-quill pen on\n pieces of paper pasted together, and hung upon the walls of the cobbler\u2019s\n shop at Moulton in 1792. Since that time our own country has more\n than doubled its domain and increased its population about fifteen fold.\n England has vastly extended her sway and changed her home govern\u00ac\n ment from a personal to a constitutional sovereignty. Germany and\n Italy have effected unification with great advances in individual free\u00ac\n dom. France, Mexico, Central and South America have turned from\n monarchial to democratic forms of government. Insurrections, rebel\u00ac\n lions, and revolutions\u2014called one or other according to the number\n and success of parties engaged\u2014have torn down the Bastiles of ancient\n custom and used their stones to pave the pathway of popular progress.\n Great wars have introduced such improvements in the art of wholesale\n destruction as to make personal bravery of no avail and armed conflict a\n terror.\n</p>\n<p>\n More notable still has been the advance in the arts of peace. New\n processes of mining and of metalurgy have unlocked rich stores laid up\n in the heart of the earth. Machines without number have been devised\n for cultivating the soil, for manufacturing and transporting its products,\n and for utilizing in man\u2019s service the strength of inferior animals and\n the forces that lurk in coal, in water, even in the lightings. The whole\n system of steamboats, railways and electrical appliances belong to the\n nineteenth century. Carey had a prosperous voyage from London to\n Calcutta. It occupied five months lacking one day. News of his arrival\n did not reach home for about a year. To-day one can make the trip in\n two weeks and cable the news instantly.\n</p>\n<p>\n Greatest of all has been the progress in commercial and social life.\n A hundred years ago more than half the human family were entirely\n \u2022cut off from the more enlightened parts of earth, or connected only\n through a few trading posts controlled by avaricious corporations. The\n opium wars with China, the Sepoy troubles in India, like conflicts else\u00ac\n where, explorations in Central Africa, and commercial treaties more or\n less extorted, have now united the whole world into one body politic,\n with overland wires and submarine cables for its nerves, and a system\n of banks and post offices for the arteries and veins of its vital circulation.\n The few books and fewer periodicals of 1792 has developed into the\n mighty flood of literature that has fertilized, sometimes disastrously\n \u2022overflowed, the richest of our intellectual lands. All the arts and\n sciences have moved with rapid stride.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0005/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 262}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0005/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 323, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 524}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0005/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 647, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1049}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0005/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1294, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2098}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0005/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2589, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4196}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0005/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ce/nt/en/ni/al/ce/le/br/00/so/ut/_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0_0005.jp2", "height": 4196, "width": 2589, "levels": 6, "size": 688664}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"5\">\n<p>\n OF MODERN MISSIONS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5\n</p>\n<p>\n We do not forget that change is not always improvement, that move\u00ac\n ment may be backward, and yet it remains indisputably true that the\n closing century, far beyond any of its predecessors, has been progressive.\n Has Christian activity kept pace with the march of humanity? Has the\n faith delivered once for all more than eighteen hundred years ago,\n proved suitable to its new environment? Amid the triumphs of science,\n has grace also reigned? In the general growth of knowledge, has\n the knowledge of Jesus increased? In an intensely practical age, has the\n law of love been more clearly exemplified? Have Christian people dur\u00ac\n ing the century been merely borne along on a tidal wave of natural\n evolution, or have their faith and their zeal been potent agencies in\n starting and swelling the tide of progress? These questions will find\n answer in considering the results of the modern missionary movement.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the complex organization of human society, results are either direct\n or indirect\u2014the former, such as flow primarily and chiefly from the\n assigned cause, being only modified and helped by co-operating influ\u00ac\n ences: the latter, such as flow mainly from other forces, but these evoked,\n stimulated or materially assisted by the given cause. The indirect\n results of a great moral influence are naturally more in number than the\n direct, but hard to trace out and establish clearly. They must in the\n present discussion be passed over with very brief notice.\n</p>\n<p>\n One other prefatory remark. The term missions suggests a very wide\n theme, which for convenience has been divided into City, State, Home\n and Foreign Missions, with diversities of gifts, but the same Spirit,\n diversities of ministrations, but the same Lord, diversities of workings,\n hut the same God. Time would fail to discuss them all. I have chosen\n that one with which I am more particularly connected and which in\n some sort embraces the rest. The world is more than our country, our\n State, our community. A wave started in some deep bay moves out to\n the ocean, and its height is less and less as the shores recede. But a\n tidal wave raised by sun and moon on the broad bosom of the world-\n embracing sea runs up into the bay and rises higher and higher to its\n head. If the constraining love of Christ shall raise within us an interest\n in the salvation of mankind in general, we cannot fail to be more and\n more interested in those people who are nearer to us.\n</p>\n<p>\n INDIRECT RESULTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. Among the indirect results of modern missions one of the earliest\n and most obvious is the science of Comparative Philology. Dr. Carey\n was pre-eminent as a linguist and for thirty years was Professor of Sans\u00ac\n crit and Bengali. Ability to master foreign tongues has always been\n counted one of the qualifications for mission work. It is not too much\n to assert that the influence thus set in motion has completely revolution\u00ac\n ized all philological study and extended to all other lines of investiga\u00ac\n tion the benefits of the Comparative method. It has given a stimulus to\n all forms of intellectual activity, and is felt in every school from the\n</p>\n<p>\n /\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0006/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 155, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 262}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0006/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 311, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 525}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0006/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 623, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1051}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0006/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1247, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2103}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0006/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2495, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4206}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0006/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ce/nt/en/ni/al/ce/le/br/00/so/ut/_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0_0006.jp2", "height": 4206, "width": 2495, "levels": 6, "size": 745270}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"6\">\n<p>\n 6\n</p>\n<p>\n CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION\n</p>\n<p>\n primary grades to the great universities. The literary world would be\n poor indeed if stripped of all it owes indirectly to missionaries.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Along with this has gone the contribution to our stores of knowl\u00ac\n edge in geography and natural history, for missionaries have necessarily\n been explorers, botanists, naturalists, anthropologists. To take one in\u00ac\n stance out of many not a few of us can remember when maps of equatorial\n Africa were a blank, and the ancient question about the sources of the\n Nile was still a mystery. Livingstone changed all that.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. A third result of missions, indirect and incidental, may be seen in\n the extension of arts and habits of civilized society. Traders seek\n money, missionaries are fishers of men. Eighty years ago the Fiji\n Islanders were naked cannibals, they are now clothed and in their right\n mind, a Christian community. The progress of Japan, one of the mar\u00ac\n vels of the century, is unquestionably due more to the Christian religion\n than to any other one cause. These are but samples of a work silently\n and surely going on in every mission-field.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. A fourth result to which missionaries have largely contributed, is\n seen in the gradual abatement of mutual jealousy and the steady growth\n of more kindly feeling between men of different races and nations, which\n has made it possible for diplomacy to negotiate mutually advantageous\n treaties instead of cruel conquest and fierce oppression of the weaker by\n the stronger. A notable -illustration may be seen in our own western\n country in comparing those Indians who have been held in check only\n by rifles, with those others who have been sought out by faithful preach\u00ac\n ers of the gospel.\n</p>\n<p>\n Much more might be said of the indirect results of modern missions,\n but we must hasten to consider some of the\n</p>\n<p>\n DIRECT RESULTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n These may be grouped under four leading statements.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. The reflex influence of Missions.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is seen in the enlargement of heart and mind among Christians\n at home. Our fathers of a hundred years ago had to meet not only the\n sneering ridicule of unbelievers, and violent opposition from the worldly-\n wise, but, far harder to bear, indifference on the part of really pious\n people and outspoken skepticism about the possibility of barbarians ac\u00ac\n cepting Christ. So it was also in apostolic days. The church at Jeru\u00ac\n salem, though baptized in the Holy Spirit, verily thought the new faith\n must be kept within the old bounds of national seclusion, and actually\n contended with Peter because he had gone with the Word of Life to men\n uncircumcised. They had heard the phrases \u201call the world,\u201d and \u201call\n nations,\u201d and \u201cunto the uttermost parts of the earth,\u201d but they had not\n reached the idea of a universal religion suited to the real wants of all\n men everywhere.\n</p>\n<p>\n The \u201cSociety for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts,\u201d\n formed in 1701 was designed in the words of its charter \u201cfor the relig-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0007/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 262}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0007/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 323, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 524}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0007/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 647, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1049}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0007/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1294, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2098}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0007/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2589, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4196}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0007/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ce/nt/en/ni/al/ce/le/br/00/so/ut/_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0_0007.jp2", "height": 4196, "width": 2589, "levels": 6, "size": 726777}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"7\">\n<p>\n OF MODERN MISSIONS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7\n</p>\n<p>\n ious instruction of the queen\u2019s subjects beyond the seas; for the mainten\u00ac\n ance of clergymen in the plantations, colonies and factories of Great\n Britain; and for the propagation of the gospel in those parts.\u201d Similarly\n limited in scope were the Danish missions of the 18th century, and in\n fact all others of that time. How else could it be with men who believed\n in a Union of church and State?\n</p>\n<p>\n We are at length beginning to grasp a higher and truer conception of\n the Christ, and to realize somewhat thaj; the gospel is for man, not as an\n Israelite, not as an Anglo-Saxon, not as a civilized and enlightened\n being, but simply and solely as a sinner; that in this there is no differ\u00ac\n ence, the same Lord of all being rich unto all that call upon him; and\n so we can in some sort appreciate that the field is the world, and the\n whole world, and can sing with the understanding the Coronation hymn.\n This great idea expands the mind, thrills the heart into sympathy with\n the mind that was in Christ Jesus. A growing tree sends out its rdbts\n and gathers material from the soil, but before this can become a part of\n the organism, it must be drawn up through trunk and branch and twig,\n and in the laboratory of the waving leaf be fitted by air and sunlight to\n descend again by the inner bark and add every year another ring of woody\n fibre. So churches planted in Christian lands are constantly gathering\n in material through many feeders, but before it is fit to be incorporated\n into the body, it needs to be drawn up into an atmosphere of world em\u00ac\n bracing love and wrought upon by the beams of the Sun of righteousness.\n Mission work is to the churches at home what leaves are to the trees.\n In France and Italy the mulberries are often stripped of their foliage to 1\n feed silk-worms\u2014as a result the trees are dwarfed and gnarled and short\n lived. So will it be with a church that does not develop and cultivate a\n missionary spirit. The maples and hickories of our forests are now put\u00ac\n ting on their autumn colors, for their life is waning into the sleep of\n winter, but the church is more fitly represented by an olive tree, ever\u00ac\n green.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Converts from Heathenism.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another obvious result of missions is seen in the conversion of at least\n a million souls out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation. The\n latest tabulated reports put the communicants of evangelical churches\n in heathen lands at about 800,000. Nearly if not quite 200,000 more have\n either paid the debt of nature or yielded up their lives in martyrdom for\n the truth. Add the uncounted thousands who, like Joseph of Arimathea,\n are secret disciples.

The rock\n remained substantially unchanged, the currents ran on treacherous as\n ever, all the apparent result was a few car-loads of pulverized granite,\n hoisted little by little from a shaft.

Missionaries in\n India, in China, in Africa, in Persia, in Italy , have been pushing along\n \u2022 the narrow lines of personal influence, gathering a few converts, but\n planting seeds which have in them a possibility of infinite expansion,\n and so preparing for God\u2019s set time when the spark of his quickening\n Spirit shall \u201ccause righteousness and praise to spring forth before all\n nations.\u201d The greatest of all moral forces works in and through the\n Word of the Lord.

In like manner all other evangelical mission\u00ac\n aries have labored to give the people the Word of God in their own ver\u00ac\n nacular. In not a few instances they have been obliged first to reduce\n the spoken tongues to a written form and introduce the art of reading.\n</p>\n<p>\n The British and Foreign Bible Society, organized in 1804, was one of\n the first fruits of missions.

It\n is dangerous I know for one man to manipulate facts and figures com\u00ac\n piled by another, but an examination of his results, with much care,\n seems to show that there were a hundred years ago including the orig\u00ac\n inal tongues thirty-three versions of the Bible. But half a dozen of\n these, Arminian, Syriac, Slavonic, Gothic, Latin and Greek, were read\n only by a few scholars, or intoned in liturgies by priests who rarely\n comprehended what they repeated. As many more were carefully kept\n out of reach of the common people. There were really less than twenty\n versions of the Bible in actual use. Up to 1890, besides numerous revis\u00ac\n ions, there had been added in a hundred years 59 distinct translations of\n the whole Bible into as many different tongues. Of the New Testament\n alone or conjoined with parts of the Old, e.g., the Pentateuch or the\n Psalms, there were in 1792 a few versions made by Ziegenbalg, Elliott\n and other eighteenth century missionaries, at present more than eighty\n versions are printed and circulated. Of additional translations, yet\n incomplete, there had been printed in 1890 portions ranging from a sin\u00ac\n gle gospel up to three-fourths of the New Testament with half the Old,\n no less than 157. The aggregate of all these, Bibles, Testaments and\n Portions, is 330 as against less than 50 a hundred years ago. And what\n is more to the purpose over 300 of them are in actual circulation, being,\n like the decree of Ahasuerus, sent to every province and \u201cto every peo\u00ac\n ple after their language.\u201d Thibet, the high table land of Central Asia,\n is one of the few countries that still closes its gates against all foreigners\n and is specially jealous of religious innovation. But a company of\n Moravians have been sitting for years at the barred gates, have learned\n the language and translated into it the New Testament, the Pentateuch,\n the Psalms and Isaiah. When the army of Victor Emmanuel entered\n Rome, September 20, 1870, close upon the heels of the marching soldiers\n came a colporter with his pushcart laden with Italian Bibles. A treaty\n made this year with England opens Thibet to commerce. It will not be\n long before the United Brethren can follow the tramp of an army carry\u00ac\n ing a Thibetan Bible issued from the presses of the B. and F. B. Society.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4.

Associ\u00ac\n ations, and in fact all organizations for Christian work, do something,\n directly or indirectly, to illumine the nations that \u201csit in darkness and\n in the shadow of death.\u201d The regular foreign mission Societies raise\n and expend every year increasing amounts. The latest figures foot up\n about eleven million dollars, used to support, in round numbers, 8,000\n missionaries and 35,000 native helpers.\n</p>\n<p>\n Different plans of work have been tried. The ardent love and buoy\u00ac\n ant zeal of enthusiastic young workers impels them to strike out, time\n and again, new methods, new lines of policy, or more frequently to try\n over again what in other hands have failed. Questions about methods\n have to be discussed again and again. Experience gradually proves all\n things and holds fast to that which is good. The Holy Spirit sent forth\n Barnabas and Saul, but seems to have left them in many matters to the\n guidance of sanctified common sense and accumulated experience. It\n would be folly to imagine that we have yet reached or indeed ever shall\n reach, perfection in our theories, much less in our practice, but it is a\n compliment to the Careys and Judsons to say that by the help of their\n experience and all that has been since added, we are to-day in better\n position than ever before to solve the problems of missionary life.\n</p>\n<p>\n The labors of a hundred years have wrought almost as great a change\n in public sentiment abroad as at home. It was perfectly natural for\n people ignorant of Christianity and of the unselfish love which it in\u00ac\n spires, to regard the early missionaries as either political spies or mer\u00ac\n cenary prospectors. What else that heathenism knew, could induce\n them to endure such hardships? But long years of unswerving truth\n and kindliness, and particularly in times of pestilence, or floods, or\n famine, have slowly established their real character and instead of being\n hated or feared, they are beginning to be respected, and loved, even by\n those who will not heed their message.

The past century has been largely\n a time of planting and watering and tilling in preparation for future\n harvests. Some foretastes have been given of what we may expect in\n fuller measure. The first Karen convert was won in 1828, the baptized\n believers among that people now number 27,000. The Telugu mission\n ^yielded little visible fruit for more than thirty years, but then came the\n Pentecostal season.\n</p>\n<p>\n This preparatory work in several of the phases mentioned, is strikingly\n illustrated by the crowning glory of this century of missions, Woman\u2019s\n Work for Woman, begun in England about sixty, in this country about\n thirty years ago. In a most important sense there is no distinction of\n sex in religion, \u201cthere can be neither Jew nor Greek, neither bond nor\n free, no male and female; for all are one in Christ Jesus.\u201d But in the\n church as established on earth there is a difference, for it still remains\n true as Paul wrote to the Corinthians, that \u201cit is shameful for a woman\n to speak in church.\u201d Still more difference is there in the society, the\n manners and customs of the world. In heathen and Mohammedan coun\u00ac\n tries a daughter, instead of bring the light and joy of the house, is valued\n solely for what she will fetch in the market, and a wife, instead of being\n the trusted counsellor at her husband\u2019s side, is a slave to be trampled\n beneath his feet. In Catholic lands, both Greek and Roman, the condi\u00ac\n tion of the weaker vessel is better, yet still far below her proper station\n as prescribed in the Word of God and practiced among evangelical\n Christians. Woman therefore owes for this life far more than man to\n the gospel, and being more benefitted she naturally loves more. Then\n again she only can enter the zenana, the harem, the heathen home, and\n carry there the word of life and liberty the sweet story of the Man of\n Sorrows. So it is that as missionaries who have access to the women\n and children, our devoted sisters are doing the best and truest founda\u00ac\n tion work, while the circles and bands at home are stirring up the slug-\n ish churches, and by their constant gathering of many little rills of\n prayer and praise and liberality are pouring a perennial stream into the\n Lord\u2019s treasury. Unfortunately there have sometimes been misconcep\u00ac\n tions and misstatements of their plans and purposes, leading to jars and\n friction and separate work. It is matter of hearty congratulation that\n the Woman\u2019s Missionary Union, with headquarters in Baltimore, pro\u00ac\n claims itself \u201cauxiliary to the S. B.

Jno. iii:14-17.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the foundations of the Strasburg Cathedral were rising the\n architect was suddenly cut off. It was a sore calamity. Who could\n translate into that proposed structure the conception of the master\n builder?\n</p>\n<p>\n It was suggested that this responsibility might be referred to his\n daughter who had been associated with her father from the first, and\n that was done.\n</p>\n<p>\n As one stands before that venerable pile to-day he is impressed with\n architectural misconceptions that doubtless mar the completeness of the\n original designs of that Cathedral.\n</p>\n<p>\n Jesus had scarcely finished the foundations of His Kingdom when he\n was put to death on the cross. The completion of his work was referred\n to the Holy Spirit as the interpreter of his plans and purposes to His\n church. As we look at the churches to-day, as in sects and sections they\n are toiling upon His Kingdom, we must account for the defective work\n done, by concluding that the designs of the divine architect are but im\u00ac\n perfectly understood by these builders.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE MISSIONARY IDEA.\n</p>\n<p>\n Which is our Lord\u2019s conception is not only not understood but often\n misunderstood. Is it Christ\u2019s plan to convert the world, by means of the\n church, or has he sent forth His church to gather out from among the\n nations a people for himself ? Whichever of these views we take will\n largely determine, for us, our methods and aims in our work for and in\n missions.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our methods, if approved of God, must be adjusted to the divine pur\u00ac\n pose in missions.\n</p>\n<p>\n The impulse to missionary endeavor must be begotten in us by the\n love of God, not our love for Him, but His love in us. This love which\n John makes the assurance of eternal life, and is as Paul tells us the con\u00ac\n straining power of the new life.

We are not servants , but\n children who serve in love. Under this divine impulse we become co\u00ac\n workers with God, co-partakers with Christ, and co-witnesses with the\n Holy Spirit, i.e., we are co-laborers with the triune God.

The moral basis of missions is to be sought for in the active minis\u00ac\n try of the Lord Jesus Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n His work and his Father\u2019s were one and the same work. He came \u201cto\n seek and to save that which was lost,\u201d and in doing this to \u201cglorify His\n Father.\u201d The church of Christ must never lose sight in her missionary\n work that out of Christ, men are lost. She must fully recognize, as did\n Christ, that men are lost. As we lose sight of this, as we substitute\n other means, or other names, than that of Christ, as satisfactory condi\u00ac\n tions and terms of salvation, we depart from the line marked out for us\n by him who hath brought life and immortality to light through the\n gospel.\n</p>\n<p>\n Because man is lost \u2014hopelessly lost\u2014unless God interferes on his be\u00ac\n half, the incarnation was a necessity. This plain fact of the gospel\u2014the\n peril of man out of Christ must not be lessened, awful as it is\u2014for the\n incarnation and death of Jesus Christ give to this dreadful truth an\n emphasis that must not be trifled with.\n</p>\n<p>\n While Christ is the only name under heaven, given among men\n whereby we must be saved, the hope of salvation in any other name or\n by any other means is a delusion. \u201cHe came that we might have life.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Love descends and seeks to lift up. Jesus was in heaven before he\n came to earth. He came down to us that he might bring us\u2014lift us up\n to God. Jesus the message of the infinite love of God to the world, com\u00ac\n ing down to us, and becoming obedient unto death, even the death of the\n cross. What an appeal to a church possessed with this same love! to a\n church that loves men, because God loves men and because she loves\n God.\n</p>\n<p>\n What a basis we have in all this for Christian service, and for the joy\n that glorifies that service that seeks the lost that they may be brought\n back to their home and to their Father! It was this awful thought that\n men, out of Christ, are lost, and hence must be brought to Christ, if\n saved, that roused the great Judson from his skepticism\u2014when a youth\u2014\n and no doubt gave its force to the reasons that made him the missionary\n he became. It was this peril of the lost, for whose rescue the only be\u00ac\n gotten Son of God came to earth, that roused Carey and led Paul to con\u00ac\n secrate themselves to the missionary work of the church. God\u2019s love for\n a lost world, illustrated and enforced as it is in the earthly ministry of\n our Lord, is the Christian motive for missions!

This passion for souls for the glory of God, is what\n the church needs most of all to-day. This passion will deepen and\n intensify our consecration and possess us with the proper realization of\n our personal stewardship as nothing else can. This passion must have\n its roots in spiritual life, and our spiritual life must measure our spirit\u00ac\n ual power.

The moral basis for missions is to be sought for in our Lord\u2019s\n commission to his disciples.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAll power (authority) is given unto me in heaven and in earth, go ye\n \u25a0therefore , and teach all nations, * * * lo, I am with you alway, even\n unto the end of the world.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n These were the words of him who had only forty days before come\n forth from the grave, whence he had been borne from a cross of suffer\u00ac\n ing and shame. His death and resurrection had given him them astery\n of heaven and of earth, and upon this supreme authority he rested his\n commission to his redeemed church.\n</p>\n<p>\n And who were this church? Unknown men, called from the fishing\n boats of Galilee, and the custom house of Capernaum. Some of whom\n had denied him. All of whom had forsaken him at his death, and\n doubted the truth of his resurrection. To men such as these he commit\u00ac\n ted the work of a world\u2019s evangelization! To them he embodied his\n marching orders in his last commission. In that commission the revel\u00ac\n ation and person of himself was made the foundation and center of Chris\u00ac\n tian teaching\u2014the spirit of obedience is made the spirit of his disciples.\n Christ\u2019s church is made the witness and minister of his gospel; that com\u00ac\n mission recognizes the omnipotence of Christ as the reason why his fol\u00ac\n lowers should evangelize and baptize, and it also makes Christ ' s omni\u00ac\n presence (Lo, I am with you, etc.) the hope of his people in the work to\n which He sends them. So that Christ\u2019s commission spheres not only\n the logic but also the motive of missions. If, therefore, the divine pur\u00ac\n pose of the church be missionary, then the church must be such in fact\n or it must be out of harmony with the divine purpose. Every word of\n the commission, as we have seen, pulsates with the energy of a divine\n sovereignty; in it he opened up the divine purpose and issues of our\n Lord\u2019s death. Upon the omnipotence of Christ (\u201cAll authority is given\n unto me,\u201d) he places the \u201c therefore \u201d of his commission, and the duty of\n his church (\u201cgo ye therefore and make disciples\u201d).\n</p>\n<p>\n Hence, because missions are the purpose of Christ, missions are the\n business of the church. Shall we set over against this magnificent aim\n of the Christ, the inadequacy of the church\u2019s means, which after all is\n the confessed exponent of the incompleteness of her consecration? Do\n we not know that what the church gives of her means and of her mem\u00ac\n bers for missions is no measure of her ability to give, but rather the\n confession of her unwillingness to give?

The church of Christ must be a self-propagating, as\n well as a self-supporting church. Christlieb was right when he said\n that missions demand of the church a three-fold conversion. (1.) The\n conversion of the heart in order to right affections. (2.) The conversion\n of the head in order to right conceptions. (3.) The conversion of the\n purse in order to make ample provisions.

R. H. Harris, D.D., of Columbus, Ga., on\n</p>\n<p>\n Are the Heathen \u201cLost Without the Gospel?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Text: \u201cHe that hath the Son, hath life; hut he that hath not the Son of\n God , hath not life \u2014I. Jno. 5:12.\n</p>\n<p>\n If words have any meaning, the question would seem to be answered,\n as soon as asked. Indeed, it is strange that, with the open Bible before\n us, there should be any such question. But, that there is such a ques\u00ac\n tion, in the minds of many excellent people, cannot be denied. Perhaps\n not a very great many entertain a decided conviction , in the negative: but\n a comparatively large number of persons are honestly in doubt \u2014and, with\n most of them, so far as effects their practical conduct , doubt is tantamount\n to conviction.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of people whose views are not affirmative, there are two general\n classes: 1st. Those who in the goodness of their hearts, would fain hope\n that, in some mysterious way, unrevealed to us, the benighted multitudes\n of earth may be saved, notwithstanding their ignorance of the Bible plan\n of salvation: 2d. Those who, in their meanness and stinginess of heart,\n are glad to favor any doctrine that will excuse them from the conscious\n duty of contributing money to the Lord\u2019s work. Kind-heartedness, on\n the one hand, and covetousness on the other, are the totally dissimilar\n influences which produce precisely the same result upon moral char\u00ac\n acters, otherwise entirely unlike.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some who are prejudiced in the negative, and others whose minds are\n merely doubtful, are unwilJing to hear this question discussed, apparently\n lest their convictions may be disturbed or their doubts removed; while\n others, still, already know more upon this, or almost any other sub\u00ac\n ject, than any one under heaven can tell them.\u2014Prov. xxvi:I2,I6. So,\n among them, they either absent themselves, altogether, on occasions\n when this topic is to be discoursed upon, or else they attend with self-\n blinded eyes and stopped-up ears, determined not to be moved.\n</p>\n<p>\n But the spectre \u2018\u2018will not down at bidding\u201d and a real issue confronts us\n that must be met, in a spirit of honest inquiry after the truth. This done,\n we may confidently leave the result to God, regardless of indifference or\n opposition, in any quarter.\n</p>\n<p>\n If the negative be true, and the heathen are not lost without the gos\u00ac\n pel, then, the greatest calamity that we could inflict upon them would\n be to send them the news of salvation in Christ. We are so unfortunate\n as to have heard of Jesus! and, while some of us will be saved in Him,\n most of us are destined to be lost, because we have heard. Now, in loving\n pity toward our benighted fellow-men, let us conceal this fatal news from\n them. And, to be consistent, let us do more. We love our children, and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0021/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 262}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0021/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 316, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 525}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0021/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 633, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1051}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0021/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1266, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2103}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0021/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2533, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4206}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0021/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ce/nt/en/ni/al/ce/le/br/00/so/ut/_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0_0021.jp2", "height": 4206, "width": 2533, "levels": 6, "size": 671340}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"21\">\n<p>\n Of modern missions.\n</p>\n<p>\n 21\n</p>\n<p>\n we are deeply concerned about the generations yet unborn.

Because\n His work was for the benefit of the world\u2014\u201cGod so loved the world,\u201d\n Jno. iii:16, and movement, outward, from the initial centre, was neces\u00ac\n sary, to \u201cteach\u201d \u201cthe world\u201d of mankind \u201cthe way\u201d of life that had been\n opened up for those who should walk in it. \u201cGo, ye,\u201d all ye, who have my\n spirit and my pledged power, for ye are qualified, \u201cand teach all na\u00ac\n tions\u201d\u2014not merely those which are contiguous to Judea, but \u201cinto all\n the world,\u201d as is more explicitly stated by Mark. \u201cYe shall be witnesses\n unto me, both in Jerusalem and in all Judea and in Samaria and unto\n the uttermost part of the earth,\u201d Acts i:8.

All men. \u201cDeath passed upon all men, for that all have\n sinned,\u201d Rom. v:12; \u201cthe wages of sin is death,\u201d Rom. vi:23; \u201cwe (Chris\u00ac\n tians), were by nature the children of wrath, even as others,\u201d (the unre\u00ac\n generate, Or heathens,) Eph. ii:3.

There are only three classes of animated\n creatures known to us: 1, Angels; 2, Men; 3, Beasts. Under the term,\n beasts, I include, for this occasion, all cretures, from the highest brute,\n to the lowest form of animal life. Are the heathen angels? None will\n assert it. Are they beasts? Blood analysis will settle the questian. The\n red corpuscles in human blood, every scientific physician knows, are dif\u00ac\n ferent from those in the blood of any other animal. The blood disks in\n all animals of the canine family are similar, and so, with the felines, or\n members of the cat family, and so, also, with all other genera, of the\n lower orders; but none of these resemble corresponding disks in human\n blood\u2014and the corpuscles are found to be precisely alike, in all the races\n of mankind. God \u201chath made of one blood, all nations of men, for to\n dwell on all the face of the earth,\u201d Acts xvii:26. Not that all are white\n men\u2014or all black men\u2014or all brown or red men\u2014but that all are men \u2014\n homo, human. \u201cAll flesh is not the same flesh; but there is one kind of\n flesh of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes and another of\n birds,\u201d 1 Cor. xv:39. Cannibalism was proved upon certain dead mem\u00ac\n bers of the Greeley expedition, by the presence, in their stomachs, of\n the striped tissue, which is peculiar to human muscle. The flesh and\n blood of the heathens are found to be of identically the same kind, as ours.\n The heathen, therefore, are men.\n</p>\n<p>\n If men, the heathen are lost, in common with other men, \u201cfor there is no\n respect of persons, with God,\u201d Rom. ii:ll, and, therefore, Christ \u201ccame\n to seek and to save them ,\u201d since \u201cthere is no difference,\u201d Rom. iii:22.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0023/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 262}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0023/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 316, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 525}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0023/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 633, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1051}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0023/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1266, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2103}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0023/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2533, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4206}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0023/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ce/nt/en/ni/al/ce/le/br/00/so/ut/_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0_0023.jp2", "height": 4206, "width": 2533, "levels": 6, "size": 711002}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"23\">\n<p>\n OF MODERN MISSIONS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 23\n</p>\n<p>\n The question now occurs, will any men be saved?

The Scriptures , themselves,\n are emphatic, in the negative: \u201cNeither is there salvation in any other,\n for there is none other name under heaven given among men, whereby\n we must be saved,\u201d Acts iv:12\u2014the language is most positive, \u201cmust\u201d;\n and \u201che that believeth not shall be damned,\u201d Mark xvi:16.\n</p>\n<p>\n If there were any other means, the sacrifice of Jesus Christ was unnec\u00ac\n essary: \u201cFor if righteousness come by the law (works), then Christ is\n dead in vain,\u201d Gal. ii:21. \u201cFor by grace are ye saved, through faith, and\n that not of yourselves; it is the gift of God, not of works, lest any\n man should boast,\u201d Eph. ii:8,9. Salvation is of God, through the gift of\n grace, by faith in Christ, also His gift, and all this, men may \u201cdespise,\u201d\n to their own damnation. Rom. ii. 4-6. On the other hand, if any,\n heathens or others, can be saved by \u201chonestly doing the best they\n know,\u201d they will \u201chave whereof to boast,\u201d and will have a right to march\n up to heaven\u2019s gates, flying the banner of \u201cgood works\u201d and demand\n admittance!\n</p>\n<p>\n Then, consider what a reflection such a doctrine casts upon God\u2019s\n business capacity!

The Omniscient God\n has actually been out-traded , by some of His ignorant, finite creatures\n and has spent His All, for what might have been, by Him, and by ' others\n is, bought at an infinitely lower price!

If, as in the suppositional case, parenthetically introduced by\n the apostle, \u201cthe Gentiles\u2014or heathen\u2014who have not the law, (should)\n do, by nature, the things contained in the law, they (would be) a law\n unto themselves, showing the work of the law written.in their hearts\u2019\n and being \u201caccused or excused by one another,\u201d accordingly. Or, as\n more accurately interpreted: \u201cWhenever the heathen do * * * they\n are a law unto themselves, * * * inasmuch as they show, etc.\u201d The\n idea being, according to one of our foremost scholars, that \u201cthe heathen,\n in every discrimination between right and wrong, show consciousness of\n moral law and are, therefore, justly condemned for not keeping the law\n they have.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n But the hypothetical case alluded to is impossible, in view of this\n emphatic language, by the same inspired apostle who wrote the other\n words: \u201cBecause the carnal mind is enmity against God; for it is not\n subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be,\u201d Rom. viii:7. Where,\n in all history, is the record of a single man, who, \u201cby nature did the\n things contained in the law? \u201d I defy the world to ' produce one example. The\n purest heathen I ever heard of\u2014Socrates\u2014died a suicide\u2014a deliberate\n self-murderer!\n</p>\n<p>\n I think the passages quoted in this connection do teach the doctrine of\n \u2018\u2018degrees of punishment,\u201d but there can be no question that they also\n emphasize the doctrine that all who cannot pass the test of judgment by\n the gospel of Christ will be certainly and impartially punished.\n</p>\n<p>\n The former doctrine just alluded to, is not a doctrine of grades. I\n think the Scriptures indicate degrees of happiness in heaven, as well as\n degrees of misery, in hell, the difference in experience of the one or the\n other depending rather on capacity than position. A homely figure may\n illustrate this point. A row of vessels, of different sizes, are placed\n upon a shelf\u2014one holding ten gallons, one five, one two and so on, down,\n through quarts, pints and gills, to one that can hold only a thimbleful.\n When filled, they are all full, the thimble vessel as full as the ten gallon\n vessel\u2014every one as full as it can be and all standing on the same level\u2014\n or grade\u2014and yet the largest vessel contains many times more than the\n smallest. The difference is one of capacity, altogether.

Miracles\n were deemed necessary to attest the Divinity of Christ, Jno. iv:48, and\n miracles appear also to have been deemed necessary, for a time after the\n Savior\u2019s death, to prove to gainsayers that His Divine power was not\n extinguished in the sepulchre, Acts ii:43; vi:8. That is all. The Lord\n thus rebukes those who demand supernatural manifestations, where God\n does not see proper to give them, of His own accord: \u201cAn evil and adul\u00ac\n terous generation seeketh after a sign and there shall no sign be given,\u201d\n Matt. xii:39.

While God has\n \u2018included all under sin,\u2019 He has also provided a remedy for all. Yet its\n application is made dependent upon human agency. The Bible clearly\n teaches that the salvation of all men depends on their \u2018hearing\u2019 and \u2018be\u00ac\n lieving\u2019 the gospel.

It is high time to cease palavering. We have\n heard quite enough about \u201cour good brethren who do not agree with us\n upon the subject of missions.\u201d God\u2019s people may ignorantly fall short of\n duty, in many particulars, but \u201cthe true Israel of God\u201d will not persist in\n willful disobedience.\n</p>\n<p>\n In opposition to foreign missions, it has been falsely said that it costs\n ten dollars to convey ten cents to the heathen, and a great complaint has\n been made against \u201cso much machinery,\u201d in our missionary enterprises.\n Our boards correspond to directorates in railroads, banks and other\n legitimate enterprises, our secretaries correspond to their secretaries,\n cashiers, etc., and no large business, of any kind, can be successfully\n conducted, without such officials.

The expense of the \u201cmachinery\u201d is comparatively small and the\n difference (in our favor) in value between domestic currency and foreign\n exchange is sometimes sufficient to pay all expenses and still leave a premium\n to be added to the original contribution. I noticed this difference in money\n values, particularly, on two different visits to Mexico, six or seven years\n apart. On one of those visits, I found that a United States dollar was\n worth one dollar twelve a half cents in Mexican money, of purer silver.\n At that time, you might have rolled your missionary dollar toward\n Mexico and after paying all commissions, it would have entered the coun\u00ac\n try of the Montezumas, worth seven or eight or, possibly, nine cents\n more than it was when it left your hand l And to-day, as I am reliably in\u00ac\n formed, the premium is from thirty-five to thirty-nine per cent.!

The year\n 1900 will find the soil of America sustaining not less than eighty-five\n millions souls.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our increase of wealth has been even more marvelous than our in\u00ac\n crease of population. In 1880, the wealth of the United States had be\u00ac\n come equal to that of Great Britain, about $44,000,000,000, measuring the\n value of the property owned by each of these two countries. The census\n of 1890 shows that during the last decade the increase of the wealth of\n the United States has been $20,000,000,000, more than forty per cent,\n upon the amount which had been accumulated from the settlement of the\n country to the year 1880.\n</p>\n<p>\n A nation with such illimitable resources, and such augmentation of its\n powers, both in numbers and its industrial resources, becomes the most\n striking figure among the peoples of the globe. Its influence upon the\n destiny of the world is simply incalculable.\n</p>\n<p>\n If the present ratio of the increase of the population shall continue, in\n thirty years, from 1890, there will be found within our territory one hun\u00ac\n dred and twenty-five millions of people. These people are to be cared\n f or \u2014their religious wants must be supplied.

The amount of surplus thousands\n created, over and above the wants of our people, must produce the\n grandest commerce the world ever saw. Discarding all that we now\n send abroad, if the consumption per capita of our people should remain\n the same, we will then have a surplus arising from the industries of the\n land equal to twice our present production. If the consumption per capita\n should be increased fifty per cent., there will then remain an amount\n which must be sent abroad, or perish on our hands, equal to the whole of\n the present products of the industries of our country.\n</p>\n<p>\n Imagine, if we can, how many and how great must be the leviathans\n of the type needed to transfer across the ocean to other lands so vast an\n amount. Compared with them, all the fleets that ever swept the seas\n from the day that Tyre from her island home sent her ships through\n Gibraltar into the wide Atlantic, down to the present hour, will be in\u00ac\n significant.\n</p>\n<p>\n The question will arise in thoughtful minds, where will such a vast\n commerce find a market? Not in Western Europe, for their civilization\n and their products are alike our own. As two merchants, or two far\u00ac\n mers, or two blacksmiths trade little with each other, so two nations of\n similar civilization create little commerce. It is among the nations\n whose products are unlike our own that this market must be found.\n Some of these products will go to supply the wants of the two hundred\n millions of Africa, some of them will go to the islands of the sea, some\n to Mexico, some to South America. But after all, the great bulk of our\n exports must find a market among the five hundred millions of people\n who trade down to the Pacific on the other side. Such will be the need\n of increasing in their land the consumption of the products of our own\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0039/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 262}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0039/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 316, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 525}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0039/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 633, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1051}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0039/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1266, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2103}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0039/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2533, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4206}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0039/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ce/nt/en/ni/al/ce/le/br/00/so/ut/_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0_0039.jp2", "height": 4206, "width": 2533, "levels": 6, "size": 682824}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"39\">\n<p>\n OF MODERN MISSIONS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3d\n</p>\n<p>\n that their rivers must be opened, and their highways must be lengthened\n until access can be had to the habitation of the man who lives furthest\n from us on the face of this great globe.

I shall, therefore,\n confine myself to such corners as could not be reached by his powerful\n traction engine.\n</p>\n<p>\n America as a Factor in Mission Work! What are we to understand\n by America? Do we mean the Western half of the globe? If so, we\n may stand appalled by the immensity of the field. A vast bi-continent\n territory; a multitudinous population of diversity of tongues and uncon\u00ac\n genial social institutions. So we mean the North American Continent?\n Then we may well cry: Who is sufficient for these things? We look to\n the Canadas, and behold! A mixed population with every shade of be\u00ac\n lief and unbelief. Do we turn our eyes to the Republic of Mexico?\n There we see crystalized ignorance and traditional-religious corruption.\n Shall we journey to our own Alaska to encounter avarice, savagery, and\n brutish humanity? What a field these outlying wastes for sacrificing\n missionary enterprise. But are we to limit our observations to the\n States and Territories of this great North American Republic? This\n seem quite a limitation, yet how limitless the field! What opportuni\u00ac\n ties; what obstacles! What prosperity; what hindrances! What fear\u00ac\n ful obligations, what indifference!\n</p>\n<p>\n But shall we of these United States call ourselves America? Are\n we Americans more than the Canadians ? Have not the de\u00ac\n scendants of the Aztecs and the surviving posterity of the Aborigi\u00ac\n nal Indian better title to the designation American than have we,\n the offspring of staid Puritans and chivalric cavalier? The United\n States\u2014a social, political, and religious phenomenon. Our growth a\n surprise, our institutions a marvel, and our prowess the dread of older\n civilizations.\n</p>\n<p>\n Contemporaneous with America\u2019s celebration of the four hundredth\n year of Columbus\u2019 discovery, is the honoring of the Centennial of Or\u00ac\n ganized Modern Christian Missions. Are not these incidents and coin\u00ac\n cidents in the history of progress suggestive of the orderings of Divine\n Providence in things pertaining to the Kingdom of Christ? Can we in\u00ac\n telligently contemplate the Gospel apart from the history of progress?\n The sublime pathos of the Gospel is its proposition to uplift humanity\n from its self-imposed degradation through human instrumentality.

The imperfect\n civilizations of the Old World had become so far corrupted and so far\n removed from the simplicity of the Gospel that a new people, new in\u00ac\n stitutions, fresh inspirations\u2014a \u201cNew World\u201d was needed for the pur\u00ac\n pose of holding the truth, and giving it in its purity to the benighted\n regions of the \u201cOld World.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It is a truth of man\u2019s nature that superiority must dominate inferior\u00ac\n ity. In the relations of human life the weak are dependent upon the\n strong. It is furthermore true that, for the superior races of man, po\u00ac\n litical freedom is necessary to the largest civil progress and highest\n Christian attainment. There can be no true development of a race\n innately progressive where there is not freedom of thought and con\u00ac\n science\u2014the mind must not be held insubordinate subjection to civil or\n ecclesiastical autocracy or monarchy. Religious liberty, guaranteed by\n civil institutions, is necessary to that freedom of conscience upon which\n depends Christian development. Religious freedom \u2014 a benediction\n from Baptists to America\u2014makes it the world\u2019s greatest Christian land.\n American institutions educate the American heart to the largest hu\u00ac\n manity. Out of this, under the ministrations of the Holy Spirit, comes\n the largest spirit of Missions.\n</p>\n<p>\n The blessings which Providence has so munificently bestowed upon\n America in making of it the land and home of the free; in lavishing\n upon her people phenomenal wealth, as the product of seemingly inex\u00ac\n haustible natural resources, and in defending her against foreign foes,\n give unto her wonderful opportunities and power for blessing mankind.\n</p>\n<p>\n These blessings to a people come not without corresponding obliga\u00ac\n tions and responsibilities. The measure of our obligation is the degree\n of our blessings from the hands of the God to whom we are responsible.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0042/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 155, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 262}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0042/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 311, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 525}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0042/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 623, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1051}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0042/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1247, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2103}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0042/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2495, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4206}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0042/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ce/nt/en/ni/al/ce/le/br/00/so/ut/_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0_0042.jp2", "height": 4206, "width": 2495, "levels": 6, "size": 746116}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"42\">\n<p>\n 42\n</p>\n<p>\n CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION\n</p>\n<p>\n May we not begin to estimate the magnitude of America as a factor\n in Mission work. Here we are\u2014forty-four free Republics held in Union\n by common consent of a free and enlightened citizenship. It is con\u00ac\n ceded by staticians of other civilizations that we are the most prosper\u00ac\n ous and the wealthiest people on earth. Here are unnumbered churches,\n Christian colleges, tens of thousands of ministers of the Gospel, and\n millions of Christian communicants. What does all this mean? Why\n this wonderful growth into greatness in so short a while? What are we\n here for? Let me ask you, fellow-Christians, is our mission no more\n than personal aggrandizement and national boasting? Why our fertile\n soils, our diversified product, our abounding mines of precious metals.\n Are these things ours, or are they God\u2019s? Are we fee simple owners, or\n tenants and stewards?\n</p>\n<p>\n Does not the condition and history of American people bring us into\n peculiar relation to other peoples? Have we not God-committed mes\u00ac\n sages for those less favored than we? That Frenchman\u2019s gift standing\n in New York harbor, symbolizing our own America as Liberty enlight\u00ac\n ening the world, is politically significant. But, may we not learn an\u00ac\n other lesson from that radiant statue, Beams there not a light upon far-\n off peoples from the thousands of movements decking our fair land in\n honor of and subservient to the Light of the World? Ah! friends and\n brethren, believe it! Believe it!

Is the reli\u00ac\n gion of Jesus Christ merely a plan\u2014a scheme for individual salvation\n for the individual\u2019s sake? If the Gospel purpose be limited, as we have\n heard here, and that limited purpose backed by Infinite energy, then\n we may be assured, do as we may, that purpose shall be accomplished.\n Is your missionary conviction and zeal only an evidence of your conver\u00ac\n sion? Well, I have nothing to do with divine decrees. I have not been\n admitted to the secret councils of the Trinity. One thing I believe\u2014\n man is self-ruined. Yet another-thing I believe\u2014Christ Jesus came into\n the world to seek and to save the lost. I know He said, in touching\n words of prayer to the Father, \u201cAs Thou didst send me into the world,\n even so have I also sent them into the world.\u201d Here is the mission of\n the church to seek and to save the lost. Holding forth the word life\n is the high calling and solemn trust of the people of God. Ye are the\n light of the world, the salt of the earth.

We ought not\u2014we cannot\n live to ourselves. If life is shut in to individualism then it is a blunder,\n and living is a stupendous humbug. To free man from the narrowness\n of selfness, Christ died. He died that they which live should not hence\u00ac\n forth live unto themselves, but unto Him who died for them and rose\n again. Is the Church an institution in cold separateness from the\n world, or is it not rather an inspiration in sympathizing touch with lost\n humanity? The Church ought to uplift itself from institutionalism into\n the inspiring atmosphere of that love that outstretches bleeding hands\n to embrace a world. The time has come for the Church to understand\n and appreciate its place in the redemptive economy of the Gospel, and\n zealously conserve its spritual forces. If the Church be not the incarna\u00ac\n tion of the Spirit of Christ, then it is no more than a human organiza\u00ac\n tion. If it be the body of Christ then its mission is identical with His\n mission. It cannot afford to fritter away its strength in vain philoso\u00ac\n phies, or uncertain speculation, or hollow ceremonies. It must not de\u00ac\n bilitate itself by a mechanical use of forms\u2014responsive and concert\n readings prescribed by and furnished at \u201cheadquarters.\u201d Such intru\u00ac\n sions upon the simplicity of spiritual worship are ominous. Let us be\n careful to watch tendencies. They are more influential in Church as\n well as in State than open and violent revolutions. We need not so\n much dread \u201cHigher Criticism\u201d or \u201cAdvanced (?) Thought,\u201d or \u201cScien-\n rific Methods,\u201d as the tendency to formalism and the craze for multitu\u00ac\n dinous organizations outside of the Church. What we need is a simple,\n robust faith that courts conflict with the powers of darkness and propo\u00ac\n ses assault upon the frowning ramparts of sin and Satan.\n</p>\n<p>\n Brethren, the Word is the sword of the Spirit. Let us preach the\n Word\u2014it is spirit and life. If our churches would be missionary in the\n truest and best sense they must hold fast the form of sacred words and\n earnestly contend for the faith delivered once for all to the Saints. The\n business of the Church is the conversion of the world. It has no busi\u00ac\n ness with any other business. But this mission implies and compre\u00ac\n hends more than striving for numbers. \u2022 \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n The truth of the matter is, the law of our life is found in social envi\u00ac\n ronment, and there is no way to fulfill the law but to lovingly serve our\n fellow mortals, and this is exactly what the Church is for. If any one\n of you were cast off alone upon a lonely island of the seas, you could\n worship God; you could adore Him; you could commune with him; but\n you could not serve Him. There would be no field. The relation we\n sustain to others is the ground and explanation of moral obligation. We\n cannot negatively answer the question: \u201cAm I my brother\u2019s keeper?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n We must go a step further and learn the relation of the material to\n the spiritual\u2014the temporal to the eternal.

The\n world of matter is as much a part of God\u2019s domain as the world of spirit;\n and he has not divorced the one from the other.

Christianity was wise\n to lay holy hands on this almost marvelous invention. There is not\n so potent an engine in its factors of progress as the press. We live in\n the printing-reading age. Christian progress would be next to impossi\u00ac\n ble without this wonderful auxiliary. Mission work would be a com\u00ac\n parative failure were it not for printing. The time was when oratory\n educated thought and directed the movements of men. Now it is the\n press. This engine has come to stay. If it were well to banish it, it\n could not be done. If the Church fail to make most of the press it fails\n to do its utmost for the spread of divine truth. It is true that the press\n is to an extent used against Christianity, but this is only another reason\n why the Church of Christ should use all diligence in commanding this\n miracle of science and art in the interests of truth.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is true, and must ever be true, that the preached Word is the prime\n instrumentality for enlisting the hearts of men in the service of Christ.\n But, for the enlargement of Christian intelligence, and the invigoration\n of the spirit of progress, the press is indispensable.\n</p>\n<p>\n Second\u2014Cultivate the waste land of your own field.

It remains for American\n Christians to answer the question.

Yet, the Indian has mind\u2014he has a soul;\n and the best Indian is not the dead Indian. I shall not endeavor to\n paint a picture of the white man\u2019s cruelty to the red man. The colors\n would be so dark that there could be no light upon the shadings. This\n much we all know, that as Christians we are debtors to all men, and the\n Indian is man, and in him can be developed many qualities of moral\n good. Who so indebted to the Indian as the white man? Shall we\n continue to drive the Indian from the earth? No! No! Rather let us\n help him to inherit the earth, and all the blessings of the eternal life.\n Let us, with the Word of Life wipe the Indian\u2019s blood from our skirts\n and offer unto him newness of life. He is God\u2019s mind-creature.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have among us seven million Negroes. What of this fact? It is\n a dark fact; can we throw light upon it? Here they are invested with\n civil rights\u2014a political anomaly. Unfortunately they are here to stay\n with a race superior in numbers and natural gifts. The superior race\n must always dominate the inferior. This can\u2019t be helped! If there are\n any \u201cfixed laws\u201d this is one of them. We all know it, whether we admit\n it or not. Yet there is no \u201crace problem\u201d for statesmen or religionists\n to solve. The negro is a citizen. It is his duty to be a good citizen. It\n is the duty of the white man to help him become just as good a citizen\n as it is possible for him to be. The negro is instinctively religious\u2014his\n religion is impulsive and physically demonstrative. He needs the\n Christian religion to enlighten him as to the significance of life and its\n relations and duties. To help him to be a good citizen and an informed*\n Christian it is the duty of the white man\u2014this and nothing more, cer\u00ac\n tainly nothing less. We owe him nothing that we do not owe others\n He is not the \u201cnation\u2019s ward,\u201d he is by law a part of the nation\u2014if we\n have any nation.

The methods of the China\n Inland Mission, who believe in preaching the Gospel as a witness to the\n nations, must be different from those of a mission that aims at the\n founding and indoctrinating of churches.\n</p>\n<p>\n Well, what ought to be the aim? I take it that Christ\u2019s Commission\n gives it clearly. It is broad enough in its scope and plain enough in its\n substance.\n</p>\n<p>\n The mission of the twelve is set aside, on the ground that the later\n and more comprehensive excludes the early and more limited commis\u00ac\n sion. Going without support is expressly abrogated by Christ. His\n disciples were to take money and means of defense. But even in the\n earlier commission it is said that the laborer is worthy of his hire.\n Paul maintains the doctrine of his right to a support from the churches,\n while for the sake of expediency he did not demand it. Men are now\n converting a matter of policy into a matter of principle.\n</p>\n<p>\n What is the aim of missions? It is both itinerant and permanent.\n The Commission has in it nothing short of permanent, self-supporting,\n self-propagating churches. The missionary journeys of Paul show his\n solicitude to maintain and strengthen the churches which had been\n brought together through his labors.\n</p>\n<p>\n What is the best method for attaining the grand aim before us? Our\n methods certainly ought to be pliable. There ought to be as much dif\u00ac\n ference in methods abroad as at home, as much as between the methods\n of Walnut-street church and those of a country church in the mountains.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0051/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 262}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0051/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 316, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 525}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0051/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 633, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1051}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0051/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1266, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2103}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0051/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2533, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4206}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0051/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ce/nt/en/ni/al/ce/le/br/00/so/ut/_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0_0051.jp2", "height": 4206, "width": 2533, "levels": 6, "size": 604143}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"51\">\n<p>\n OF MODERN MISSIONS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 51\n</p>\n<p>\n We are to evangelize the World.

He asked no one to give him an education. He\n determined that, with God\u2019s help, he would educate himself. He entered\n no college. He made a college of his cobbler\u2019s bench.

They certainly had \u201ca local habitation and a\n name\u201d as far back as a century ago.

Modestly, meekly, but\n with a determination \u201cfixed as fate,\u201d he unfurled his missionary banner,\n and in a voice whose ring betokened a heavenly inspiration, called upon\n all true lovers of Jesus to rally for the great conflict.\n</p>\n<p>\n Soon after the adjournment of the Association he wrote that famous\n \u201cInquiry into the obligations of Christians to use means for the conver\u00ac\n sion of the heathen. \u201d That paper was like a new revelation from the\n skies. Every line was luminous, and from first to last it seemed to be\n stamped with the signet of Heaven\u2019s approval. Its effect upon some of\n his brethren was as signal as their first conversion. It was another\n spiritual quickening and resurrection. They saw the truth as they had\n never seen it before.

In every word of it there\n was the accent of a conviction born of God. It was the opening of an\u00ac\n other trumpet stop on the grand, organ of spiritual passion.

Of all the monopolies that have\n wronged and robbed men, and made merchandise of human bodies and\n human souls, that East India Company was the most infamous, and the\n most deserving of the reprobation of God and man.\n</p>\n<p>\n Seeing no prospect for the protection or perpetuity of his work in Cal\u00ac\n cutta, Carey left it and went ten miles away to Serampore, a Danish set\u00ac\n tlement, and began a work under the protection of a more humble and\n liberal people.

Beneath that sa\u00ac\n cred ensign of redemption not less than five hundred thousand native\n converts stand to-day, bravely and patiently continuing the struggle so\n wisely begun by the man whose only ambition and purpose was to lead\n lost men out of the darkness of error and sin into the light and liberty\n of the sons of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n We celebrate to-day the beginning of modern missions. By modern mis\u00ac\n sions we mean missions among the heathen. I have confined my remarks\n mainly to the work of William Carey, because the verdict of Christendom\n and the verdict of history will ever be, that to him, under God, belongs the\n glory of laying the foundations of the great and sacred enterprise of\n modern missions.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many useful lessons may be learned from the history which I have but\n briefly outlined:\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. Here we see something of the sublime possibilities of a single hu\u00ac\n man life absolutely consecrated to God. \u201cThe lives of such men all re\u00ac\n mind us, we may make our lives sublime.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Here we see how seemingly insuperable difficulties may be conquered\n by facing them with a martyr\u2019s faith and courage.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Here we see God\u2019s fidelity in fulfilling his promises to men who un\u00ac\n reservedly put themselves in His hands, and dare to obey Him in the\n presence of any danger.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Here we can see how God can and does use the weak and despised\n things of this world to confound and vanquish the mighty.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Here we can see how God\u2019s work, begun in simple faith and un\u00ac\n feigned love, will rise from feebleness and seeming insignificance into\n magnificent strength and beauty.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. But the thought with which I am specially impressed has reference\n to the condition of the country.\n</p>\n<p>\n Just before his untimely and tragic death, Abraham Lincoln uttered\n these words, which have passed into history: \u201cAs the result of the war,\n corporations have been enthroned. An era of corruption in high places\n will follow.

Their ships sailed through the Medi\u00ac\n terranean by the Pillars of Hercules, into the Atlantic Ocean, turning\n northward to England for tin and copper, and on into the Baltic for fur\n and amber; venturing also southward along the western coast of Africa.\n The Carthaginians inherited the trade of Tyre and Sidon, and, in addi\u00ac\n tion, opened highways to Egypt and into the interior of Africa, barter\u00ac\n ing their wares in Egypt for corn and grain, and in Africa for ivory,\n gems and slaves. They planted colonies in Africa and Sicily, and for a\n time were successful rivals of Greece and Rome. The rule of the ocean\n transferred from Asia to Africa remained there for a short time, for the\n day of Europe came with the rise of Greece and Rome.

Thrice he suffered ship\u00ac\n wreck, a night and a day he had been in the deep.

Sir Isaac Newton and Kepler conceived all objects\n and all worlds to be held by universal gravitation. And in our century,\n von Baer and Humboldt held that the world, in all its forces and ma\u00ac\n terials, is an integrated cosmos. Anyone who is the least familiar with\n the progress of philosophy will recall that since the dawn of written\n history the thoughts of men were tending to this unification. Shortly\n after this first effort at comprehensive unity Mayer, Rumford and Joule\n invented the methods of demonstrating the oneness of physical forces,\n the conservation of energy. Wollaston, Kirchoff and Bunsen devised\n the delicate apparatus to prove the chemical identity of all worlds.\n Lamarck, Geoffroy St. Hilaire and Darwin taught the consanguinity of\n all living beings. Helmholtz and Meyer co-ordinated nervous excita\u00ac\n tion with mental activity. Comte and Spencer asserted the unity of all\n sensible phenomena. Newton, Leibnitz and Hamilton projected their\n minds beyond phenomena and invented mathematics of four or more di\u00ac\n mensions, conceiving of worlds and systems that under the present order\n of nature can have no objective reality. Over all this, into many souls\n have come notions of infinite space and time and causation and person\u00ac\n ality. The idea of limitation to thought or achievement no longer enters\n the imagination. The depth of the sea, the distances of the stars, the\n concealment of the earth\u2019s treasures, the minuteness of the springs of\n life and sense, the multiplicity and complicity of phenomena are only so\n many incitements to a wider, deeper, loftier comprehension of that Holy\n Spirit who was in all ages to accompany the church, and who was to be\n the perpetual reservoir of power in all lands and ages.\n</p>\n<p>\n GREAT IDEAS SLOWLY ADOPTED BY THE PEOPLE.\n</p>\n<p>\n After the exalted minds had come little by little to comprehend these\n meanings of the word \u201call,\u201d how slow the people were in coming up\n with them. First the universities, then the colleges, then the schools,\n then people of common intelligence; but behind them, always, was a\n vast herd that comprehended nothing.\n</p>\n<p>\n It almost broke the Savior\u2019s heart when he was on earth that his\n Apostles were so slow of heart to believe.\n</p>\n<p>\n The same is true now of those of Christ\u2019s disciples who read his in\u00ac\n junction to evangelize the whole world. The Catholic missions in the\n sixteenth, seventeenth, and eighteenth centuries were characterized\n with praiseworthy zeal, but their motive was propagandism. One hun\u00ac\n dred years ago Carey caught a glimpse of their import, and then they\n seized a few other noble Protestant minds. Seventy-five years ago they\n were felt in our owq country by a little band of enlightened souls.

The success of commerce\n is owing to the fact that so many are eagerly engaged in it, from the\n merchant prince down to the street fakir. Matthew Arnold says,\n \u201cHuman progress consists in the contiuued increase in the number of\n those who, ceasing to live the animal life alone and to feel the pleasures\n of sense only, come to participate in the intellectual life also and to find\n enjoyment in the things of mind.\n</p>\n<p>\n The awakening of commerce was the awakening of great masses of\n peoples to participate in its activities. The thing to pray for in the\n church is a like great moving of all Christ\u2019s followers and an uplifting\n of the masses to participate in the spiritual life and find enjoyment in\n the things of the soul.\n</p>\n<p>\n DRIFTING ABOUT IN THE EDDIES.\n</p>\n<p>\n As an illustration of the conservative conduct of the church as a\n whole, the following incident will suffice:\n</p>\n<p>\n On the 22d of June the steamer Trave ran into the schooner Taylor\n five hundred miles east of New York City and broke her in two. The\n stern drifted northward and the bow southward, the former landing on\n August 3d near Portland, Maine; the latter, when last seen, was just off\n Cape Henlopen, Delaware. Neither portion has at any time gotten into\n the Gulf Stream, but both have been driven by the wind and tossed, the\n stern probably following the cold southerly current between our coast\n and Gulf Stream, making its way toward the point where Columbus\n landed. I mention this incident in order to throw the following account\n into bolder relief.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE GREAT OCEANIC STREAM.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the year 1890, the hydrographer of the United States Navy caused\n to be thrown into the Atlantic Ocean over one hundred bottles in which\n letters were enclosed, asking the finder to write the date and place of\n finding on the same sheet and enclose the paper to the Navy Department\n in Washington. A great many of these bottles were cast overboard op\u00ac\n posite the coast of Spain and of West Africa, and every one of them\n landed in the little Antilles, and some of them on Watlings Island or\n Guanahani or San Salvador. They were carried to the place of Colum\u00ac\n bus\u2019 landing by a stream flowing in the ocean since the Tertiary Age.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was the same stream that insensibly wafted the little fleet of Colum\u00ac\n bus to the New World.

The exploitation of these resources\n is the primary industry of men. The amount of coal and metallic pro\u00ac\n duct each year is counted by billions of tons. The secret places of the\n earth yield their treasure, the lands their harvests of food, fibres, and\n woods, the seas their products by thousands of millions of tons.\n</p>\n<p>\n The muscular power of man and of beasts, the motive power of water\n and wind and steam and electricity used up in the manufacture of this\n product are gauged by billions of horse-power. The value added by\n these mechanical transformations exceed many times the cost of the raw\n material, and all the time that this ransacking of the earth is going on\n and these factory wheels are spinning round, the stream of traffic is\n bearing it all along on the world\u2019s highways.

It does not send to any people the things\n they do not need and even caters to their idiosyncrasies, becoming all\n things to all men. I am told by eminent explorers of the Congo that so\n fastidious are the negroes in regard to their tastes that even a slight\n difference in the shade of beads has consigned the venturer to a total\n loss of his goods. The great success of missions, likewise, in some places\n and among some peoples, and the great failure in others surely cannot\n be the fault of the divine Comforter, nor yet of the missionary as regards\n his zeal or motives. The cause lies in the fact that we have not gone to\n school to the children of this world, that we have not studied ethnology\n in all its branches and have sought to clothe every message everywhere\n in the same garb.\n</p>\n<p>\n COMMERCE AN ORGANIZED ACTIVITY.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another feature of commercial success, demanding our closest study,\n is its wise system of centres of force and activity. The organization of\n the commercial forces of the world about definite centres is not a matter\n of chance, but an example of the universal law of the mutual alliance of\n spiritual and natural forces. If on a terrestrial globe you were to put\n one point of a pair of dividers upon the city of London and with the\n other point were to mark off a hemisphere, you would include therein\n nearly all the land surface of the earth of any value, save Australia. In\n other words, London is the centre of the land surface of the earth, of the\n commercial, manufacturing, monetary world.

And this is done. A ny student of science\n is in possession of the means of speaking to his brother on the other side\n of the earth without a penny of cost. There are many who do not know\n of this blessed agency, many who do not avail themselves of it. But\n that is because they are not in that wondrous stream whose currents\n move around the world.

Connections - have never been established in some\n places, in others they have been broken down.

The millennium has not yet\n dawned on the commerce of nations and much of it does not make for\n righteousness, but it is getting nearer and nearer to the golden rule.\n Piracy has been swept from the seas. Christian nations are breaking up\n the slave trade in Africa. Highway robbery and wanton destruction of\n wealth are remanded to the frontier and society is outraged by their per\u00ac\n petration. There are great evils remaining still, but good honest people\n and religious people countenance them and are supported by them im\u00ac\n mediately or remotely, and so long as that exists their day of judgment\n is far off.

But while men slept, his\n enemy came and sowed tares among the wheat and went his way. . But\n when the blade was sprung up and brought forth fruit, then appeared the\n tares also. So the servants of the householder came and said unto him:\n Sir, didst thou not sow good seed in thy field? from whence then hath it\n tares? He said unto them. An enemy hath done this. The servants said\n unto him. Wilt thou then that we go and gather them up? But he said,\n Nay; lest while ye gather up the tares, ye root up also the wheat with\n them.

These consecrated merchants,\n bankers, manufacturers, shippers will know where the main currents of\n the world\u2019s activities are flowing. They will tell you where to send your\n missionaries to catch, to intercept the great world-caravans of influential\n people. They themselves sailing on the currents of world-encompassing\n activities will lend their daily sanctification to enforce the teachings of\n the men whom they send to preach Christ\u2019s gospel to every creature.\n</p>\n<p>\n Upon the tomb of the Hon. Robert Y. Hayne, of South Carolina, is this\n inscription: \u201cNext to the Christian religion I know of nothing to be\n compared with the influence of a free, social and commercial intercourse,\n in softening asperities, removing prejudices, extending knowledge and\n promoting human happiness.\u201d The truth of this declaration is confined\n in every treaty, in every international conference and exposition, in the\n public opinion of all nations. The doors opened by commerce for the\n spread of religion are innumerable and religious obligations incalculable.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE BETTERING OF COMMERCE BETTERS THE OPPOR\u00ac\n TUNITIES OF SPREADING RELIGION.\n</p>\n<p>\n All these opportunites are available, even in the carrying on of a com\u00ac\n merce not wholly sanctified in its appliances, its methods and the prod\u00ac\n ucts of its activities. But how much better for the sender and the con\u00ac\n signee if the creative and sanctifying Spirit of God had breathed upon\n its operations in the woods, the fields, the mines, the waters; in the mills\n and shops; in the wagons and cars and ships; in the banking houses and\n markets and expositions; in the minds and correspondence of its agents.\n The railroad tracks and the ocean highways would be the way of life; the\n charts and time tables and bills of lading would be the truth, and the\n Holy Spirit would be its animating principle. The world would be re\u00ac\n deemed.\n</p>\n<p>\n The reaction of the church already upon commerce along che mission\u00ac\n ary line is shown in the fact that the translation of the Bible and cate\u00ac\n chisms and religious books into many hundreds of languages have first\n made the world acquainted with those languages. You were well in\u00ac\n structed on this topic by Professor Harris. The presence of the Catholic\n missionaries long ago among the American aborigines taught them the\n value of their goods and saved them from destruction. The same is true\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0074/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 155, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 262}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0074/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 311, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 525}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0074/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 623, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1051}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0074/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1247, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2103}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0074/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2495, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4206}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0074/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ce/nt/en/ni/al/ce/le/br/00/so/ut/_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0_0074.jp2", "height": 4206, "width": 2495, "levels": 6, "size": 742259}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"74\">\n<p>\n 74\n</p>\n<p>\n CENTENNIAL CELEBRATION\n</p>\n<p>\n of later missions.

The raising of\n the average moral tone of commerce in relation to the Savior\u2019s teaching\n will increase the sanctifying and propagandist power of commerce. As\n early man became more civilized, his dog and his horse became more\n gentle; as they became more gentle, men became less brutal. These\n great beasts of burden, called ships and railroad trains, may be civilized\n and Christianized and these will Christianize and civilize in their turn,\n just as they have been demoralized and have demoralized in turn.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE CHURCH AND ITS RESOURCES.\n</p>\n<p>\n The progress of the church in availing itself of the avenues and con\u00ac\n veniences of trade has not been uniform. The first messengers were not\n backward in this regard. During the thousand years of darkness, from\n the fourth until the thirteenth century, both trade and church were\n sluggish. The revival of commerce at the centres of Venice and Genoa\n was stimulated first by the crusades and these kindled the zeal for traffic,\n and this created the renaissance of Europe. But the Moorish successes\n held back this glory for a while until Prince Henry the Navigator and\n Ferdinand and Isabella had restored the cross to its supremacy in the\n west. In the next fifty years Columbus discovered the New World, John\n Cabot the continent of North America, and Vasco deGama sailed around\n the Cape of Good Hope to India, to set aflowing the old stream westward\n from that land. The lust for gold and zeal for souls went hand in hand\n in all these enterprises down to the end of the eighteenth century. Com\u00ac\n merce moved on by its slow processes and religion was only propagan-\n dism. Both were in the streams but knew them not. The resources of\n spiritual grace were almost as hidden as the mines of coal, and the dis\u00ac\n covery of the steam engine and the commencement of Protestant mis\u00ac\n sions were both in the future. Carey was the contemporary of the men\n who conceived the locomotive and the steamboat, and I have been won\u00ac\n dering whether the new spirit of missions would fill men\u2019s hearts with\n love as this new age of steam is filling their minds with plans for gain.\n At any rate, the world is now explored. The world is a network of\n commercial activities. Following its teachings and using its resources,\n there should henceforth be no foreign missions and domestic missions,\n but world-missions, world-embracing missions, all-the-world-and-every-\n creature missions, as thou saidst Blessed Lord, at first.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0075/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 262}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0075/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 316, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 525}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0075/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 633, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1051}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0075/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1266, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2103}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0075/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2533, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4206}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0075/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ce/nt/en/ni/al/ce/le/br/00/so/ut/_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0_0075.jp2", "height": 4206, "width": 2533, "levels": 6, "size": 614843}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"75\">\n<p>\n OF MODERN MISSIONS.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE CLIMAX.\n</p>\n<p>\n Like Ezekiel, when the Spirit, of whom we have been speaking, lifted\n him above the earth as it goes spinning around in space, we even now\n hear the noise of the wings ,pf the living creatures that touch one an\u00ac\n other, so crowded are they in the great docks, and the noise of the\n wheels over against them and a noise of a mighty rushing.\n</p>\n<p>\n Fly swifter, ye white wings of commerce, and carry these messages of\n love over every sea.

When Sam Patch jumps to his death\n all sensible men say: There goes a fool! But when a brave swimmer\n leaps into a roaring flood to rescue a drowning child, as all dripping he\n lays his precious burden on the shore, Heaven and earth shout: Bravo!\n</p>\n<p>\n When duty calls and love girds for action, then character rises to the\n height of the heroes.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Bravery of encounter is another element that is absolutely essential\n to the real hero.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is beauty in duty, however smoothly the course of duty runs,\n but the quality of which we have been speaking means toil and tears,\n strife and struggle, battle and blood. It braves fire or flood, wild beasts\n or the wilder fury of a mob. It dares to stand for God and truth against\n a world in arms.\n</p>\n<p>\n It means Arnold Winkelried gathering up a sheaf of spear-points into\n his own bosom, and so making way for liberty. It means Curtius leap\u00ac\n ing, with his armor on, into the yawning gulf and closing the gulf by the\n sacrifice of Rome\u2019s most precious thing\u2014a loyal heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n It means Horatius at the bridge, Leonidas at the pass, and Martin\n Luther at the Diet of Worms.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. But the crowning glory of the real hero is calm, invincible persist\u00ac\n ency of purpose. Almost anybody can make a dash. A whirlwind\n sweep of cavalry is not the thing that tries most sorely the metal of a\n soldier, but the tramp, tramp, tramp, for days and nights, beneath weep\u00ac\n ing skies, over miry roads, hungry and cold and footsore and homesick,\n the wearisome work in the trenches, the waiting under fire for the long\n delayed order to charge upon the enemy.\n</p>\n<p>\n The dauntless courage that holds right on though sinews crack, and\n nerves quiver, and wounds bleed, and darkness deepens, and victory seems\n far away: that cuts down the bridge behind, and burns the ships, and\n faces the foe, determined to do, and dare, and, if need be, die, but never\n fall back. This is heroism of sublimest sort.\n</p>\n<p>\n This shines resplendent in God\u2019s Holy Word, which is nothing other\n than a bundle of biographies, where truth is set before us, not so much\n in philanthropic sentiments, and pious precepts as in saintly lives, radiant\n with divinest beauty, and going forth to highest duty. Truth incarnate\n \u2014this is what the world wants and the Bible gives. And while it found\n splendid expression in many Old Testament saints, who, through faith,\n subdued kingdoms, wrought righteousness, obtained promises,\n stopped the mouths of liars, quenched the violence of fire,\n escaped the edge of the sword, out of weakness were made\n strong, waxed \u201cvaliant in fight and put to flight the armies of the\n aliens,\u201d yet none of these, nor all of them together are, for a moment to\n be compared to Him in whom humanity finds its culmination and its\n crown- the Son of Man\u2014the Son of God\u2014the one ideal, and yet most\n real hero\u2014Jesus of Nazareth\u2014the \u201cCaptain of Salvation.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n ' q j\n</p>\n<p>\n - ' ' \u25a0 > \u25a0/) *\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0079/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 262}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0079/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 316, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 525}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0079/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 633, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1051}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0079/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1266, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2103}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0079/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2533, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4206}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ce:nt:en:ni:al:ce:le:br:00:so:ut:_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0:centennialcelebr00sout_0_0079/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ce/nt/en/ni/al/ce/le/br/00/so/ut/_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0/centennialcelebr00sout_0_0079.jp2", "height": 4206, "width": 2533, "levels": 6, "size": 656942}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"79\">\n<p>\n OF MODERN MISSIONS. 79\n</p>\n<p>\n All others are worthless paste\u2014He is the priceless Kooh-i-nor.

There are such heroes even now, as\n there were in the olden time. Many a time we recognize them only\n when laid out for burial, and discover too late that we had been enter\u00ac\n taining angels unawares. Many of them will he uncovered when the\n secrets of all hearts shall be revealed, and we shall find that some, not\n much accounted of in their day and generation, were really making the\n bravest of fights, and displaying a splendid heroism which shall be glo\u00ac\n riously \u201crewarded in the resurrection of the just.\u201d But after all one\n cannot fail to feel that the grandest of heroes and heroines are those who\n hearing the hour of the Great Commission, and hearing the wail of a\n perishing world, tear themselves loose from all the tender ties that bind\n them to their homes and friends, and animated by a quenchless love, and\n armed with an invincible purpose, say, \u201cLo, I come! I delight to do thy\n will, O God!\u201d \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n Let me not be understood, as disparaging, for a moment, any other\n form of service. Any act of duty is a thing of beauty, but it is not all\n duty that rises to the height of the heroes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Such heroism is sometimes demanded in our daily duties here, for\n often the battle rolls to our gates, and rages in our streets, and we have\n urgent need to gird ourselves, and quit ourselves like men. But when\n one leaves every long loved scene of life, and plunges into deepest dark\u00ac\n ness, resolved to do, to dare, to die, if need be, that those who are per\u00ac\n ishing for lack of knowledge may hear the glorious gospel\u2019s sound\u2014this\n is something that quickens the heart throb in every generous bosom and\n wakens the applause of earth and heaven.\n</p>\n<p>\n And when, as in the expression of Carey and Marshman and Ward,\n and J ' udson and multitudes more this self-sacrificing service is protracted\n for weary, toilsome years, and every word of truth and deed of love\n seems as water spilt upon the ground that cannot be gathered up again\u2014\n when sickness wastes the frame, and trials oppress the heart\u2014when the\n heathen mock and turn away, and friends lose heart and withdraw sup\u00ac\n port\u2014when nothing seems to come of love\u2019s labor but disappointment\n and disaster\u2014to hold on in spite of all that, and feel at such a time, as\n Judson felt, at such a time, that \u201cThe prospect is as bright as the prom\u00ac\n ises of God\u201d\u2014this is heroism, the sublimest that mortal ever displayed\n in the sight of heaven.\n</p>\n<p>\n Oh, brethren, we have fallen upon easy going, pleasure loving times,\n even for the Church of Christ, when we seek to make religion winsome\n by eliminating from it all the severer elements that used to make it\n grandly heroic.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our favorite strain is the one which declares that religion never was\n designed to make our pleasures less, while we hear less than aforetimes\n of tears and blood. If the church has lost something of its fibre; if Chris\u00ac\n tianity has lost something of its attractiveness for manly souls the rea\u00ac\n son, possibly, is not far to seek.
