Is the soul really to live for\n ever, and is its condition to be fixed without any\n possibility of change after leaving this world?\n Then I am in great fear; my Shasters never told\n me any such thing. Is the soul hereafter to have\n no transmigration? Must it be unchangeably\n fixed either in heaven or in hell? I am not fit\n to go to heaven ; if I should die now, I must go\n to hell.
