Early after the Flood, the country which we now call\n Palestine became the habitation of a portion of the tribes de-\n scended from Canaan, the youngest son of Ham. Hence the\n country acquired its earliest name, the Land of Canaan ; and\n the inhabitants were, collectively, called Canaanites. At the\n time of Abraham the country was but thinly peopled, and the\n inhabitants were separated into the various nations, enumerated\n in the first section of the Introduction. These several nations\n were not united under a common head ; but each was kept to-\n gether by a common name and parentage, and by local connec-\n tion. In all these nations, every town with its vicinage appears\n to have formed a separate commonwealth under its own Melek\n or \u201c king.\u201d These kings appear to have been no other than the\n chief magistrates of the place, who were also leaders in war,\n and sometimes priests. Their authority was small, and they\n seem to have been unable to transact any important matter with-\n out the direct consent of their citizens. As there was abundant\n room, the vacant pasturages were abandoned to the pastoral\n chiefs of other tribes or nations, with whom the Canaanites ex-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0010/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 423}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0010/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 846}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0010/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1692}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0010/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3385}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0010/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0010.jp2", "height": 3385, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 595104}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"10\">\n<p>\n 2\n</p>\n<p>\n THE DELUGE.\n</p>\n<p>\n [b. c. 2348.\n</p>\n<p>\n changed their goods and the produce of their fields, for the pro-\n duce of the flocks and herds. Their language, with probably\n some difference of dialect, was the same with that which Abra-\n ham brought from Mesopotamia. Their moral practices had be-\n w come very offensive, and their notions of God and his govern-\n ment were wild and uncertain ; but there is no evidence that\n .yx^-they we;re idolaters in the time of the Patriarchs.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our only knowledge of the social condition of the Canaan-\n ites is to be gathered from the few intimations contained in the\n Book of Genesis. They lived in walled towns, at the gates of\n which public business was transacted ; they cultivated the\n ground, and raised corn and wine. Silver by weight was their\n medium of exchange, and it. would seem that every adult male\n was acquainted with the use of arms. Such were the people\n of Canaan, when their country was visited by the illustrious\n stranger whose descendants were to become its most celebrated\n inhabitants. The circumstances of that visit must now be ex-\n plained.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. One thousand six hundred and fifty-six years after the Crea-\n tion, th^race of Man had become so guilty before God, that he\n swept them from the earth by a flood of waters. Only one fami-\n ly, of which Noah was the father, was saved. Noah had three\n sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth, through whom the vacant world\n was again .replenished with inhabitants. In nearly 400 years\n after the flood, the new races of mankind had also forgotten God,\n and had onlv some vague remembrance of that ancient promise\n of a Deliverer, who should crush the head of the Serpent, by\n whose seducernents sin and sorrow were brought into the world\n (Gen. iii). The world then seemed fast ripening for a new de-\n solation ; but God had sworn not again to destroy the earth for\n man\u2019s iniquities (Gen. viii. 21. 22). He chose rather to take one\n of the numerous tribes of men, and commit to its keeping the\n great truths which it was needful to keep alive in the world,\n until the time should come in which He purposed to make his\n will more fully known. These truths were, the knowledge of\n Himself as the Creator and Ruler of the Universe, and of his\n promise to provide a Redeemer for the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The founder of this favoured tribe was Abraham (at first\n called Abram), a descendant of Shem, the son of Noah, in the\n line of Heber. He belonged to a wealthy pastoral family dwell-\n ing beyond the Euphrates, in that district in which the town of\n Ur (now Urfah) was situated. This family was not free from\n the general taint of idol worship ; for we are told tha\u00a3 Terah,\n the father of Abraham, and probably also his sons, served\n other gods\u201d beyond the Euphrates. Nevertheless, the God of\n Noah does not appear to have been altogether unknown ; and\n while the world at large lay in darkness, the last rays of de-\n parting truth still lingered upon the tents of Terah.

Haran, the eldest, died early, leaving one son called Lot,\n and two daughters, Milcah and Sarah (at first called Sarai).\n Milcah became the wife of Nahor, and Sarah of Abraham. Na-\n hor had children, hut Abraham had none.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5 . Before the flood, the life of man had been very long ; after\n the flood, it gradually shortened ; but in the times of which we\n write, it was not yet reduced to its present limit of three score\n and ten years. Abraham, therefore, although sixty years of\n age, was still in the prime of life when God made himself known\n to him in a vision, and required him to leave his own country\n for another which should be made known to him (Acts, vii. 2\n \u2014 4). He must have communicated this mandate to his family;\n for they all went with him from the land of their birth. But\n they proceeded no further than Charan, in another part of Me-\n sopotamia. The cause we know not; but in that neighbour-\n hood they remained sixteen years, when Terah died, at the age\n of 205 years. (Gen. xi. 27 \u2014 32 ).\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. When Terah was dead, a second and more special call was\n received by Abraham, requiring him not only to- quit his coun-\n try, but his kindred, for a strange land. But this more strict re-\n quirement was accompanied with encouraging promises of bles-\n sedness and renown; and with the obscure intimation of some\n great distant blessing which the families of men should receive\n through him. With that undoubting faith and prompt and un-\n questioning obedience which he always exhibited, and for which\n he is much commended in the sacred books, Abraham separated\n himself from his brother Nahor, and departed. He was accom-\n panied by his nephew Lot ; and as both had large possessions\n of flocks, and herds, and slaves, a large caravan was doubtless\n formed by their union. They crossed the great river Euphra-\n tes ; and, traversing the deserts to the west, at length entered\n the land of Canaan, and first pitched their tents in the beauti-\n ful valley of Moreh, which lies between the mountains of Ebal\n and Gerizim, in which the city of Shechem was afterwards\n built. ,\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. In this early age there were no temples. Men worshipped\n their gods at altars erected in the open air, sometimes amid the\n shade of umbrageous groves. Their more solemn acts of wor-\n ship consisted in the sacrifice of victims from their flocks or\n herds, or oblations of the fruits of the ground \u2014 corn, w r ine, and\n oil. So did the patriarchs worship God ; and many were the\n monuments of their piety, in the form of altars, which they\n erected in the land of their sojourning.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The year after Abraham\u2019s entrance into Canaan, a great\n scarcity arose in that land. This was no doubt occasioned by\n the absence of the customary rains. But Egypt, whose fertility\n depends upon the overflowing of the Nile,- was not affected by\n this drought, and continued to afford its usual abundance of*\n corn. To Egypt, therefore, the patriarch repaired.

So Abraham returned to Canaan very rich, not only in cat-\n tle, but in silver and gold. Proceeding northward, he came to\n \" his former station near Bethel, and encamped there. The in-\n creased substance of Abraham and Lot, made it difficult to find\n sqfficient pastures for the flocks of both in the same neighbour-\n hood, and this led to frequent contentions between their shep-\n herds. They therefore separated ; and Lot removed to the fer-\n tile and well-watered plain at the south end of the Dead Sea,\n part of which is now covered by the waters of that lake. Here\n were the cities of Sodom, Gomorrah, Admah, Zeboim, and Bela\n (afterwards Zoar). This enforced separation from the last of\n his kin, was doubtless*a great grief to Abraham. But he was\n comforted by the renewed promises of God, who again assured\n him of a numerous posterity, and directed him to go forth and\n survey more largely the fine country which was to become their\n heritage. He went first southward, and pitched his tent under\n the shade of a terebinth tree, in the pleasant valley of Mamre,\n near Hebron, where he remained a considerable time.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. The Assyrian empire, beyond the Euphrates, appears al-\n ready to have risen to some importance, by reducing many petty\n kings to the condition of tributaries. The strength of these in-\n ferior chiefs appears to have been then employed in distinct and\n foreign expeditions, for the further aggrandisement of the em-\n pire to which they were subject. About four years before Abra-\n ham entered the land of Canaan, of these princes, Chedor-\n laomer, whose own kingdom was Elam (probably Elymais, a\n district of south-western Persia), was intrusted with a command\n to extend the empire in the country west of the Euphrates. This\n he executed by rendering several nations tributary ; and he ap-\n pears to have remained on this side the great river to keep his\n conquests in obedience. After twelve years of subjection, and\n about eight years after the first arrival of Abraham in Canaan,\n some of the conquered nations revolted, and refused any longer\n to send their tribute. Among these were the petty \u201c kings,\u201d or\n chiefs, in the five cities of the plain to which Lot had with-\n drawn. This brought upon them the vengeance of Chedorlao-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0013/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 423}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0013/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 846}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0013/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1692}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0013/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3385}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0013/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0013.jp2", "height": 3385, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 445263}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"13\">\n<p>\n DEFEAT OF CHEDORLAOMER.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5\n</p>\n<p>\n B. c, 1931.]\n</p>\n<p>\n mer, who, with his former confederates, invaded and ravaged\n all the country east of the Jordan, defeated the five kings in a\n pitched battle, and retired with numerous captives and abund-\n ant spoil.

But although Abraham was\n to be the father of this promised son, Sarah had not at any time\n been named as its mother. She had always been reputed bar-\n ren ; and now that she was advanced in years, had given over\n all hope of children. She therefore recommended a course\n which was sanctioned by the ideas and usages of these times.\n She proposed that the patriarch should receive her own hand-\n maid, Hagar, as a secondary and inferior wife, and that any\n child which this bond- woman might have, should he counted as\n the child of the mistress. Abraham did not object to this\n course ; and it soon became plain that Hagar would have a\n child. This consideration appears to have made her behave\n unbecomingly towards Sarah; who, in return, treated her so\n harshly, that she fled, and wandered in the southern desert.\n But an angel met her and encouraged her to return to the tents\n of Abraham, where, in due season, she gave birth to a son, who\n was called Ishmael, and who became the founder of a large\n portion of the Arabian bribes.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2.

And as a ratification of this covenant on their\n part, the ceremony of circumcision was instituted, that every\n male in that race should bear upon him a token of this covenant\n with God. And further, when Abraham so spoke as to shew\n that his hope of a posterity was resting on Ishmael, he was as-\n sured that the heir of the covenant was not yet born, and that\n Sarah herself was his destined mother. Even the name (Isaac),\n by which he should be called, was given ; and it was on this\n occasion that the patriarch himself had his name changed from\n Abram to Abraham, and his wife\u2019s name was altered from Sarai\n to Sarah.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

It amounted to little more than that the contracting par-\n ties, and their heirs after them, should act with truth towards\n each other. In memory of this transaction, Abraham gave the\n name of Beersheba ( oath of the well ) to the well in question ;\n and, the situation being agreeable and convenient, he remained\n there many years, and planted a grove of trees round the altar\n at which he worshipped God.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. When Isaac had attained the age of twenty-five years, it\n pleased God to prove Abraham by one great trial of his faith and\n obedience. He was commanded to journey to a mountain in\n Canaan, and there to offer up his son Isaac in sacrifice to God.\n Firmly persuaded that since God had promised him a posterity\n through Isaac, we would even raise him again from the dead,\n rather than allow his promise to fail (Heb. xi. 17-19), the \u201cfa-\n ther of the faithful\u201d prepared to render full, however heart-\n rending, obedience to this extraordinary mandate. He travel-\n led to the appointed place ; he built an altar, and laid thereon the\n wood for the fire ; he bound his beloved son with cords ; and\n his hand was uplifted to give him the death-wound, when he\n was arrested by a voice from heaven with words of encourage-\n ment and praise, and by a more than ever solemn confirmation\n to him and to his race of all the blessings that had before been\n promised. A ram, which was found entangled by the horns in\n a thicket, was substituted for Isaac upon the altar, and the fa-\n ther returned rejoicing to Beersheba with his son.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Twelve years after this Sarah died, in the 127th year of\n her age. Abraham had before this removed his camp from\n Beersheba to his old station at Mamre, near Hebron, or to some\n other spot in that neighbourhood ; and as it now had become\n necessary that he should have a family sepulchre in which to\n lay his dead, he purchased for 400 shekels of silver the field\n and cave of Machpelah, near Hebron. Here Sarah was buried ;\n and thus a sepulchre became to the patriarchs the earnest of\n their reversionary heritage.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Three years after this, when Isaac had reached the age of\n forty years, Abraham besought himself of seeking a wife for\n his son. The state of religion and morals in Canaan, and the\n special nature of the promises made to his race, condhrred with\n the usual habits and notions of a pastoral chief, in leading his\n attention to his own family, which he had left in Mesopotamia,\n of whose welfare he had a few years before received intelli-\n gence.

They were fifteen years of age\n when their grandfather Abraham died. As they grew up, the\n brothers manifested very different dispositions ; Esau was a rude\n and boisterous man, devoted to the sports of the field ; while\n Jacob was of a sedate and quiet disposition, much employed in\n the cares and duties of pastoral life. Before their birth, it had\n been intimated to the mother, that the younger of the two was\n the destined heir of the promises ; and this, together with his\n gentle disposition, rendered Jacob very dear to Rebekah ; but\n the love of Isaac, although himself a quiet man, was more en-\n gaged by the first-born, Esau. Not knowing, or not rightly un-\n derstanding, or not having much confidence in, the intimation\n which had been given to his wife, Isaac was still disposed to\n consider Esau as the heir of the promises, knowing which, Re-\n bekah was always contriving to bring about by craft and man-\n agement the designs which the Lord would have accomplished\n without her aid. Jacob, in his early life, much resembled his\n mother in these respects ; but time, trouble, and experience,\n made him a much better man in his later years.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.

After this there was a famine in the land of Canaan, and\n Isaac would probably have withdrawn into Egypt, had he not\n been commanded by the Lord to remain in the land which was\n the destined inheritance of his race. On this occasion, the pro-\n mise of that heritage, and of all the other blessings of the cov-\n enant with Abraham, was repeated to Isaac, who then remov-\n ed into the territories of the Philistines, where another Abime-\n lech than he who had entered into covenant with Abraham,\n reigned. During his residence in Gerar, Isaac denied his wife,\n as his father Abraham had done in the same country, and for\n the same reason; for which he also incurred the just rebuke of\n the reigning king. While in this quarter, Isaac paid some at-\n tention to the culture of the soil, which repaid him a hundred\n fold; and in this and other ways, his wealth and power so ra-\n pidly increased, as to excite the alarm and jealousy of the Phi-\n listines, who filled up the wells which gave him a right to the\n soil, and whose king at length desired him to withdraw to a\n greater distance. The patriarch accordingly proceeded to the\n more open pastures, which his father had occupied, and there\n digged again, without opposition, the wells of Abraham. But\n his attempts to dig new wells were vehemently resisted by the\n Philistine shepherds, until hedid so at such a distance, that they\n no longer interfered. In this situation, his still growing pros-\n perity suggested to Abimelech the propriety of renewing with\n the powerful nomad chief the convention which his own prede-\n cessor made with Abraham. The king, therefore, went from Ge-\n rar to the camp of Isaac, whom he treated in all respects as an\n equal. He and his attendants were properly feasted by the pa-\n triarch, who, after a becoming remonstrance as to the treatment\n he had received, consented to renew the covenant of peace. \u2014\n At the age of forty, Esau married two women of Canaan, and\n thereby gave much pain to his parents, whose views in such\n matters were the same as those which Abraham had entertain-\n ed.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0020/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 423}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0020/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 846}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0020/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1692}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0020/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3385}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0020/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0020.jp2", "height": 3385, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 451770}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"20\">\n<p>\n 12\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER IV.

By that time Isaac\u2019s\n sight had failed him; and he expected that he had not long to\n live. He therefore determined to bestow that blessing which\n the patriarchal fathers were wont to give to their sons in their\n last days, and to which much importance was attached, because\n on such occasions an influence from above enabled them to in-\n terpret the designs of the Almighty towards those whom they\n addressed. The blessings of the Abrahamic covenant, which\n God intended for Jacob, the fond Isaac now proposed to bestow\n on Esau. This he made known to him ; but first sent him out\n into the fields to hunt, that with the game he might prepare one\n of those savoury messes with which he had been in the habit\n of gratifying the appetite of his aged father. All this was over-\n heard by Rebekah, who instantly determined to frustrate the de-\n sign by artifice. She dressed Jacob in his brother\u2019s clothes, and\n persuaded him to personate Esau, and thus obtain from his\n blind father the important blessing : \u201c Let people serve thee,\n and nations bow down to thee : be lord over thy brethren, and\n let thy mother\u2019s sons bow down to thee: cursed be every one\n that curseth thee, and blessed be every one that blesseth thee !\u201d\n Jacob had scarcely withdrawn, when the entrance of Esau re-\n vealed the deception which had been practised. Isaac was sei-\n zed with consternation when he discovered that his intention\n had been counteracted. But convinced that he had been rashly\n attempting to act in opposition to the Divine will, and that the\n whole matter had been overruled by a higher power, he made\n no attempt to recall the blessing he had bestowed on Jacob, but\n rather confirmed it by the emphatic declaration, \u201cYea, and he\n shall be blessed.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The grief and rage of Esau at being thus circumvented by\n his brother were very great.

All the parties in this trans-\n action were much to blame ; Rebekah and Jacob, especially,\n were guilty of the sins of doing evil that good might come, and\n of promoting by fraudulent means the intentions of G-od, in ef-\n fecting which their aid was not needful.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Esau cherished the most inexorable resentment against Ja-\n cob for what he had done. He vowed to be revenged by the\n death of his brother ; but out of regard for his father, purposed\n to wait till after his death. This came to the ears of Rebekah,\n who thereupon persuaded Jacob to withdraw for a time to her\n brother Laban in Mesopotamia. Not to trouble the mind of the\n aged Isaac, she forbore to tell him the principal reason for this\n course, but assigned another, which was also true, being her\n fear lest Jacob should follow the example of his brother in mar-\n rying one of the women of the country in which they lived.\n Isaac, therefore, called Jacob, and charged him not to do this,\n but to go and obtain for a wife one of the daughters of Laban,\n his mother\u2019s brother.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Dismissed with his father\u2019s blessing, the heir of the pro-\n mises set forth upon his journey. On his way, he was encour-\n aged by an important vision at Bethel, and in due time arrived\n at Charan ; and when he came to the well outside that city, he\n found a great number of persons of both sexes assembled there\n to water their flocks. Among them he discovered Rachel, the\n daughter of Laban, who had charge of the home flock. Hav-\n ing watered the flock for her, he told her who he was, and went\n with her to her father\u2019s house. He was well received by La-\n ban, to whom he made his circumstances known. In a short\n time that person discovered that Jacob had a very superior\n knowledge of pastoral affairs, and became anxious to retain his\n services in the management of his flocks. He offered him wa-\n ges ; but Jacob, who had much love for his cousin whom he\n had met at the well, but had no means of paying the price\n which custom required a man to give to the father of the wo-\n man he married, offered Laban seven years services for Rachel.\n Laban consented ; and when the time came, made a great feast\n to celebrate his daughter\u2019s marriage ; but instead of giving Ja-\n cob the youngest daughter according to agreement, he managed\n by some deception to substitute Leah, the eldest, for whom Ja-\n cob had no regard.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.

As might be expected, Rachel\n was much dearer to him than Leah, whom he treated with\n comparative neglect ; but the Lord, who hates injustice, restor-\n ed the balance in this matter, by giving Leah children, which\n were withheld from Rachel. Leah bore successively four sons,\n whom she named Reuben, Simeon, Levi, and Judah.

Jacob was much grieved, and his sons were fired with in-\n dignation, at the dishonour which the family had received ; and\n at first refused to listen to the liberal offers which Hamor made.\n At last, however, they acceded to the proposed marriage, on con-\n dition that all the Shechemites should receive the rite of circum-\n cision. To this the townspeople were induced by Hamor to\n consent ; and on the third day, when they were least able to de-\n fend themselves, Simeon and Levi, full brothers of Dinah, en-\n tered the town, with some of their father\u2019s men, and slew all\n the male inhabitants, to avenge the indignity offered to their\n sister, whom they took away to the camp. After this the other\n sons of Jacob came and plundered the place, bringing the\n women and children away as captives. Jacob was greatly dis-\n tressed and alarmed at this atrocious action of his sons ; and\n was glad to withdraw, in accordance with a divine intimation,\n from a neighbourhood stained by so great a crime, to Bethel.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. From Bethel Jacob proceeded southward, probably with\n the intention of rejoining his aged father, who was still alive,\n and who abode in the plain of Mamre, near Hebron. When\n they were near Ephrath (afterwards Bethlehem), Rachel was\n delivered of a second son, named Benjamin ; and she died in\n giving him birth. The bereaved husband honoured the grave\n of his beloved wife with a sepulchral pillar, which long after\n stood there ; but which is now replaced by a Mohammedan\n monument. Israel removed from Ephrath, to a pasture ground\n in which stood a tower, called The Tower of the Flock ; and,\n after some stay there, at length joined his old father in Mamre,\n and remained with him till his death. This did not occur till\n sixteen years after, when Isaac had reached the advanced age\n of 180 years. Esau was also present, and joined with Jacob in\n rendering the last offices of filial duty to their father, whose re-\n mains were deposited in the cave of Machpelah, with those of\n Sarah and Abraham. After this Esau withdrew, with the por-\n tion of the property which fell to him, to his former residence\n in the mountains of Seir, where his posterity became a consid-\n erable nation. At the time of Isaac\u2019s death, Jacob was 120\n years old. He continued still at Mamre, engaged, with his sons,\n in the usual pastoral employments.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The history now conducts us to Joseph, the eldest of Rach-\n el\u2019s two sons. His beauty, his engaging qualities, his early\n wisdom, and, more than all, his having been for many years\n (before Benjamin was born) the only son of Rachel, had given\n him the first place in his father\u2019s love.

Pharaoh im-\n mediately sent to the prison for him ; and when he stood be-\n fore the king, related to him his dreams. Modestly disclaim-\n ing the wisdom which the king supposed him to possess, and\n ascribing all the honour to the God whom he served, Joseph\n told the king that the two dreams were to be received as a\n warning from God, that seven years of extreme plenty in Egypt\n would be succeeded by seven years of unexampled scarcity.\n He then proceeded to give such sound advice, as to the mode in\n which the over produce of the seven years of plenty might be\n husbanded for use during the seven years of famine, that Pha-\n raoh at once determined to invest him with the power and sta-\n tion necessary for giving effect to the measures he had advised.\n By taking off his signet-ring, and placing it on Joseph\u2019s finger,\n he conveyed to him such high powers as made him next in\n authority to the king. He was then arrayed in the vestures of\n fine muslin and the chain of gold which belonged to his high\n place, and, standing in the royal chariot, he was conducted in\n grand procession through the metropolis, and proclaimed chief\n minister and governor of Egypt. Joseph was thirty years old\n when he attained this high advancement. Soon after, Pharaoh,\n in order to strengthen Joseph\u2019s position by connecting him with\n distinguished families, gave him in marriage a lady of high\n rank \u2014 Asenath, daughter of Potipherah, high-priest of On, by\n whom he ultimately had two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8; During the seven years of plenty, Joseph travelled through\n all the provinces, making surveys, building granaries, and fill-\n ing them with corn. The effects of the years of scarcity which\n followed, were felt not only in Egypt but in all the adjacent\n countries, the inhabitants of which soon flocked to Egypt to\n purchase corn from the well-filled granaries of Joseph. The\n private stores of the Egyptians themselves were soon spent, and\n they became dependent upon the public stock, out of which\n they bought corn until they had nothing but their persons and\n their lands left to them. Then, at their own desire, Joseph\n bought their lands for the crown at the cost of supplying therri\n with food during the scarcity; and for the convenience of dis-\n tribu tion, he assembled the people of every district into the\n towns in which the corn Avas stored ; and when the famine\n was nearly ended, he gave them seed, and restored them their\n lands to farm at the fixed crown-rent of one-fifth of the produce.\n We have explained this procedure, because it appears to have\n been of late much misunderstood.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0028/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 423}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0028/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 846}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0028/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1692}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0028/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3385}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0028/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0028.jp2", "height": 3385, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 485435}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"28\">\n<p>\n go\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER VI.

Among the foreigners who repaired to Egypt to buy corn,\n in the first year of the famine, were the brethren of Joseph. As\n they stood \u201c and bowed themselves before him, with their faces\n bowed to the earth,\u201d and thus accomplished what was predict-\n ed by the dreams which they had so criminally endeavoured to\n frustrate, they little thought of their brother ; but he knew them\n well. To try their present dispositions, he spoke roughly to\n them, and accused them of being spies, \u201c come to spy the nak-\n edness of the land.\u201d This was a most grave and dangerous\n charge, coming from such a quarter. This they felt ; and, in\n their anxiety to repel it, gave a particular account of their real\n condition, from which Joseph learned that his father still lived,\n and that his favourite son, their younger brother, had remained\n at home with him. Joseph seized hold of this, and made the\n appearance of that younger brother before him, the test of their\n sincerity, and decided that one of them should go for him, and\n the rest remain in custody till that one returned with Benjamin.\n Meanwhile they were all cast in prison ; but on the third day he\n spoke more gently to them, and directed that they should all go\n except Simeon, who was to be detained as a hostage for their\n return. Their troubled consciences interpreted the difficulties\n into which they had fallen, as a divine judgment upon them for\n the treatment of their brother; and, as they freely expressed\n this to one another, not supposing \u201c the governor of the coun-\n try\u201d could understand them, Joseph was much moved, and turn-\n ed from them and wept. He gave them provisions for the\n journey, and caused the money they had paid for corn to be pri-\n vily restored in their sacks.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2.

But, when the corn was all\n consumed, and Jacob desired his sons to go to Egypt for more,\n they absolutely refused again to appear before \u201c the governor*\n without Benjamin.

Benjamin, therefore, he would detain in bondage, but\n they might go home. Judah then interceded, and, in a most\n eloquent and touching address, evinced the most tender affection\n towards his brother and his aged father ; and, declaring the spe-\n cial trust he had incurred, entreated to be taken as a bondsman\n in the stead of Benjamin.

On the way he paused to worship at\n the old family altar at Beersheba, and was there favoured with\n the intimation from God that the purpose of His providence was,\n that his race should tarry in Egypt to grow into a great nation\n there ; and that, as such, they should then march forth to take\n possession of the land of Canaan, their promised inheritance.\n Jacob\u2019s family, consisting of his sons, with their wives and chil-\n dren, at the time it entered Egypt, consisted of seventy-five* per-\n sons.

On entering Egypt, Jacob sent Judah to\n give notice of his arrival to Joseph, who immediately rode forth\n in his chariot to meet his father, who, when he saw him, \u201c fell\n upon his -neck, and wept on his neck a good while;\u201d and, as\n soon as he could speak, he said, \u201c Now, let me die, since I have\n seen thy face ; because thou art yet alive.\u201d Joseph conducted\n them into the land of Goshen, which they were to occupy.\n Having left their flocks and herds there, they went to the me-\n tropolis, and were introduced by Joseph to the king, the father\n separately, and the sons together.

As they all stood around him, he gave utterance,\n in the most beautiful language, replete with poetical images,\n to a wonderful series of predictions respecting the future char-\n acter, ciifcumstances, and situation of the tribes which were to\n spring from his several sons. To Judah was allotted the pre-\n eminence, and a more especial interest in the promises of the\n covenant ; nor was it obscurely intimated that in that tribe was\n to arise the promised Deliverer, whose coming was the main\n object of the Hebrew covenant, and of the Jewish polity as es-\n tablished in after years.

C. 1571.\n</p>\n<p>\n but it may be observed Ephraim and Manasseh, the two sons\n of Joseph, instructed by their father to prefer the lot of God\u2019s\n chosen people, very early joined the Israelites in Goshen, and\n followed the same mode of life. All went on very well until\n the accession of a new dynasty to the throne of Lower Egypt\n \u2014 probably a foreign dynasty from Upper Egypt, which knew\n little and cared less lor the memory and services of Joseph.\n The new government contemplated with alarm the position\n occupied by an active, closely-united, and rapidly increasing\n body of foreigners in the land of Goshen. It was considered\n that, unless means were taken to reduce and keep down their\n numbers, their power would soon be too great for the Egyptians\n to control. While the troops were elsewhere employed, they\n might get possession of the country, or might at any time ruin\n Egypt, by going- over to its enemies in time of war.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Much of this alarm obviously arose from the fact of their\n living apart by themselves, in Goshen, so that their aggregate\n mass was so apparent as to inspire the Egyptians with appre-\n hension, and the Israelites with confidence. Had they been\n dispersed over Egypt, and intermixed with the native popula-\n tion, nothing of this could have been felt. Knowing how, under\n ordinary circumstances, a population may be kept in check by\n oppression and labour, the Fgyptian government determined to\n reduce the free-born Israelites to the condition of serfs, requir-\n ing them to \u201c serve with rigour \u201d in the public works \u2014 to dig\n in canals, to cultivate the ground, to build towns and granaries,\n and to make the sun-dried bricks, compacted with straw, of\n which they were constructed. Task-masters were set over\n them to exact the full amount of labour ; and those who failed\n were subjected to severe punishments. But, although the yoke\n of Israel was made very heavy, the population was not checked.\n The more they were oppressed, the more their numbers increas-\n ed. Perceiving this, the king determined to resort to more de-\n cisive measures, and enjoined the Hebrew midwives to destroy\n every male infant in the birth. Fearing God more than they\n feared the king, the midwives disregarded this barbarous order.\n But, determined not to be balked in his politic design, Pharaoh\n no longer stooped to indirect and secret measures, but openly\n commanded that every male child thenceforth born should be\n thrown into the river Nile.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. In those days, Jochebed, the wife of Amram, of the tribe\n of Levi, gave birth to a son. She had already two children, a\n son named Aaron, and a daughter called Miriam. For three\n months the mother managed to save her infant from its doom:\n and then finding that she could hide him no longer, she placed\n him among the Hags beside the river, in a basket which had\n been daubed with slime to keep ihe water ou-t. In the good\n providence of God, who intended this infant for great deeds, it\n happened that he had not remained there long before the king\u2019s\n daughter (Thermusus) came to the spot, .attended by her mai-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0033/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 423}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0033/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 846}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0033/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1692}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0033/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3385}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0033/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0033.jp2", "height": 3385, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 536253}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"33\">\n<p>\n MOSES QUITS EGYPT.\n</p>\n<p>\n 525\n</p>\n<p>\n b. c. 1531.]\n</p>\n<p>\n dens, to bathe.

He repaired to the land of Goshen, and\n became an eye-witness of the misery which they still sutFered.\n One day, seeing an Egyptian task-master beating an Israelite,\n he fell upon him, slew him, and hid his body in the sand. The\n next day, in endeavouring to pacify two quarrelling Israelites,\n he was treated with insult, and jeeringly reminded of w.hat he\n had done the day before.

This led to his intro-\n duction to the father of these damsels, Jethro, the prince and\n priest of Midian, who persuaded the stranger from Egypt to\n take charge of his flocks, and gave him in marriage Zipporah,\n one of his daughters. By her he had two sons, Gershom and\n Eliezer. Forty years Moses fed the flocks of Jethro his father-\n in-law, at proper seasons leading them for pasture to the well-\n watered valleys of Sinai mountains.

The\n brothers called together the elders of Israel, and Moses opened\n to them his commission, and confirmed it by the appointed mira-\n cles; and having satisfied them, they all repaired to the court of\n the reigning king, of whom Moses demanded, in the name of\n Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, that the descendants of Is-\n rael should be allowed to quit his dominions. The Egyptians\n had, however, by this time, found out the value of their forced\n services, and the king flatly refused to listen to so extraordina-\n ry a proposal. Indeed, affecting to consider such vain notions\n the effect of idleness, he directed their labours to be increased,\n and their bondage to be made more bitter.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Moses was then obliged to resort to \u201cthe plagues,\u201d which\n he was commissioned to inflict, in order to compel Pharaoh to\n consent to their departure, and at the same time to demonstrate\n the greatness and power of the God whom the Hebrews wor-\n shipped. The heart of Pharaoh was very hard, and it required\n a succession of the most terrible inflictions to extort his con-\n sent. The waters were changed into blood ; frogs, lice, and\n gnats, successively inundated the land ; a murrain destroyed the\n cattle ; the people were afflicted with painful and noisome ul-\n cers ; a tremendous hail-storm destroyed the fruits of the ground ;\n clouds of locusts consumed all that the hail had left ; and this\n was followed by a thick darkness which overspread all the\n land except that part which the Israelites occupied. By some\n cunning sleight, a few of these miracles were imitated by the\n Egyptian magicians, which much encouraged Pharaoh in his\n obstinacy. At times he wavered ; but as at the end of all these\n plagues he still remained inexorable, one last and terrible inflic-\n tion was threatened, and Moses was apprised that it would be\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0035/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 423}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0035/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 846}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0035/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1692}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0035/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3385}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0035/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0035.jp2", "height": 3385, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 528470}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"35\">\n<p>\n B.

Accordingly at midnight, the first-born,\n from the highest to the lowest, were smitten, and there was no\n house from which came not the wail for the dead. This ca-\n lamity, like the others, touched not the Israelites, whose door-\n posts were sprinkled with the blood of a lamb offered up in sa-\n crifice to God, according to his previous appointment. And that\n the memory of this signal distinction, when the Destroyer pass-\n ed over the blood-sprinkled doors of the Israelites, and smote\n the first-born of the Egyptians only, might be preserved to all\n generations, the Lord instituted the feast of the Pass-over;*\n and as a further memorial, he directed that the first-born should\n henceforth be set apart for his service (Exod. vii. to xiii).\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. Although the king of Egypt had held out so long, the peo-\n ple had been anxious before this that the Israelites should\n be dismissed ; and now they were no longer to be restrained.\n With their dead around them, and not knowing what might be-\n fall them next, they insisted on the instant departure of the Is-\n raelites. The king was not able to resist the popular impulse,\n and perhaps was not at the moment willing, for the first-born\n of the throne lay also dead. He gave his permission, and the\n people in every possible way urged and hastened their going\n forth. The Hebrews, however, took this opportunity of uni-\n versal consternation to demandf the wages of their long and la-\n borious services ; and the Egyptians in their eagerness to get\n them out of the country, were in no humour to contest the mat-\n ter, but hastened to load them with \u201cjewels of gold and jewels\n of silver,\u201d together with costly raiment. This, together with\n their numerous flocks and herds, caused the Israelites to go forth\n from Egypt a wealthy people. They had also become very nu-\n merous; for the men fit to bear arms amounted to six hundred\n thousand, which implies a total population of two and .a half\n millions;]: besides there was a large \u201c mixed multitude,\u201d which\n chose rather to take their part with the Israelites than to re-\n main in Egypt. Very probably a large proportion of these were\n foreigners who had, like the Israelites, been held in slavery by\n the Egyptians: the rest may have been Egyptians of the lower\n and more despised orders. At all events, this \u201c mixed\u201d body\n appears from the history to have formed the rabble of the im-\n mense multitude that quitted Egypt 215 years after Jacob and\n his family entered that country, and 430 years after the founder\n of the family went to the land of Canaan.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9.

Only a miracle could save them ; and that miracle\n was wrought. At the command of God, Moses uplifted his rod\n over the waters, when immediately a strong wind arose, by\n which a broad track was opened through the sea for the pas-\n sage of the chosen race, dryshod, to the other side, where by\n the break of morning, they all arrived in safety. With mar-\n vellous temerity, Pharaoh, with his chariots and horsemen, en-\n tered in pursuit ; when Moses, from the further shore, again\n stretched forth his rod, and the waters suddenly returned and\n overwhelmed them all. This great event, which was celebra-\n ted by the daughters of Israel in triumphant hymns, had a\n most salutary effect upon the neighbouring nations, impressing\n them with a great dread of the mighty God by whom the Isra-\n elites were protected.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The now secure multitude tarried a short time at this place,\n and then marched southward for three days through the wilder-\n ness of Shur, where they began to be in want of water. This\n caused them to murmur greatly, especially when, on coming\n to Marah, they found water which was too bitter to be of any\n use. To pacify them Moses was instructed to cast a branch of\n a certain tree into it, and it then became sweet and drinkable.\n Their next resting place was at Elim, where twelve wells, sha-\n ded by seventy palm-trees, gave abundant of water to the peo-\n ple and their flock.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.

[b. C. 1491.\n</p>\n<p>\n They forgot the miracles of God, and remembered only the\n \u201c flesh-pots\u201d of Egypt. God rebuked them ; but he promised\n that they should have meat in the evening, and in the morning\n bread to the full. This he made good by causing a vast flight\n of quails to rest that evening upon the camp : and of these\n large quantities were taken and dressed for food. And in the\n morning, when the dew was gone, the ground was found to be\n covered, as by hoar-frost, with small, round, white particles,\n like coriander seed for size and shape, and the taste of which\n was like fine bread sweetened with honey. The wondering in-\n quiry Man-hu ? ( what is this?) which the Israilites addressed to\n one another on beholding it, caused this food to be called Man-\n na. This proved to be the commencement of a supply of \u201c bread\n from heaven,\u201d which was furnished daily, except on the Sab-\n baths, for forty years. Still advancing southward towards the\n upper region of Sinai, the Israelites passed overall arid tract of\n country and encamped at Rephidim. As no water was found at\n this place, the people again broke forth into their usual mur-\n murs; and on this accasion, so wild and fierce did their pas-\n sions rise under the agonies of thirst, that Moses and Aaron\n were in danger of being stoned for having brought them to that\n wilderness, unless some immediate relief were given. Moses\n was instructed by God to take some of the elders as witnesses,\n and strike with his rod a rock in Horeb. He did so ; and from\n that rock an abundant stream immediately broke forth and\n flowed to the Hebrew camp. Moses signalized this transaction\n by calling the place Massa ( temptation ), and Meribah (strife).\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. By this time the movements of the Israelites attracted the\n attention of the inhabitants of Sinai ; and that warlike tribe, the\n Amalekites, whose quarters the Hebrew host now approached,\n determined to assault them, stimulated, perhaps, by the hope\n of acquiring the Egyptian wealth with which they were laden.\n On this Moses directed a valiant young man named Joshua,\n who always attended him, to draw out a body of choice troops,\n and give the Amalekites battle on the morrow. The next\n morning, when Joshua marched forth against the Amalekites,\n Moses, accompanied by his brother Aaron, and by Hur, ascen-\n ded to the top of a mountain and prayed to God in view of the\n warriors and the people. It was soon discovered that while the\n hands of Moses were uplifted in prayer, Israel prevailed over\n Amalek ; but that when his hands hung down in weariness,\n Amalek was the stronger; and therefore, Aaron and Hur plac-\n ed themselves beside the prophet and sustained his interceding\n hands until the evening, by which time the Amalekites were\n put to utter route. This signal success in their first military\n enterprise greatly encouraged the Israelites; and by Divine au-\n thority and command, the race of Amalek was, for this first and\n most unprovoked act of hostility against the chosen people, de-\n voted to utter extermination.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.

In the first place, they were to provide for him a palace-\n temple, containing all things meet for the state of a Divine king ;\n a throne, a table, an incense altar, a superb candelabrum, \u2014 all\n formed of, or overlaid with, the finest gold. The throne was\n the ark, the table that of shewbread. The dwelling itself, the\n Tabernacle, was necessarily so made as to be taken to pieces,\n and carried from place to place as occasion required. When\n standing it was an oblong structure fifty-five feet in length, by\n eighteen in breadth and in height, formed of acacia wood over-\n laid with plates of gold, and the whole overhung with rich palls\n and curtains. In the enclosure in front was erected a large but\n portable brazen altar, on which were to be offered daily and oc-\n casional sacrifices ; and here also was an immense basin or layer\n of the same metal, in which the ministers of the Divine king\n were to perform their ablutions. When the sacred edifice was\n completed and set up, the pillar of cloud, which has already\n been mentioned, moved from its previous station, and rested\n upon it ; and a wondrous resplendence, called the Shechinah,\n or \u201c glory of God,\u201d filled the place, and ultimately concentra-\n ted over the ark, where it became the appropriate and abiding\n symbol of the Divine presence.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0042/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 423}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0042/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 846}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0042/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1692}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0042/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3385}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0042/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0042.jp2", "height": 3385, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 633946}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"42\">\n<p>\n 34 AARON AND HIS SONS APPOINTED PRIESTS, [b. C. 149 1.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. For the state of the Great King, ministers and officers\n were necessary. According to patriarchal usage, there was no\n distinct order of priesthood, such sacerdotal offices as their sim-\n ple worship required being discharged by the first-born. In\n conformity with this, the first-born had, as we have seen, been\n set apart to the service of God on the departure from Egypt,\n with a farther reference to a commemoration thereby of their\n preservation, when all the first-born of the Egyptians were des-\n troyed. But now that the Israelites had evinced their need of\n a more ostensible system of worship, it was deemed proper, for\n the sake of better organization, that a whole tribe, instead of\n the first born of all tribes, should be set apart for this service.\n The tribe of Levi, to which Moses and Aaron belonged, was\n therefore chosen for the general service of the theocratical gov-\n ernment ; and the family of Aaron was selected for the higher\n and more special services of the priesthood, Aaron himself be-\n ing the high-priest. All these had peculiar dresses suitable to\n their service, which they were to use when they officiated : at\n other times they were dressed like the rest of the community.\n The dress of the high-priest was very splendid, especially by\n reason of a breastplate of gold, in which were set twelve pre-\n cious stones, on each of which was graven the name of a tribe\n in Israel. This was called the Urim and Thummim.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. To support the court and ministers of the Great King,\n which involved also a provision for public worship, it was di-\n rected that the Levitical tribe should have one-tenth (lithe) and\n the first fruits of the produce of the fields and of the flocks.\n The tithe was what kings were in the habit of exacting for the\n support of the government, and as a sort of quit-rent for the\n soil, of which they were regarded the sovereign proprietors ;\n and more than once does the Lord assert this right, as king, to\n the soil of Palestine. Besides, the tribe of Levi was to have\n no territorial inheritance; and as their exclusion left more for\n the other tribes, they had a claim of right to compensation from\n these tribes ; for the few towns which were given to them for\n residence were no adequate compensation for their foregoing an\n equal heritage in the soil of the Promised Land.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The people worked with ardour, and contributed with lib-\n erality and zeal, in giving effect to all those designs and opera-\n tions ; for a gorgeous regality and theocracy, with a splendid\n court and imposing ritual, were exactly suited to their condition\n of mind, and gave them a feeling of importance and concentra-\n tion, which they could not well have realized by any other\n means. Eight days after the solemn consecration of Aaron\n and his sons to the priesthood, their ministrations commenced\n by the first burnt-offering upon the altar. On that occasion the\n Lord was pleased to signify his complacency by the appearance\n of that \u201c glory\u201d or resplendence, of which we have so often\n spoken, and from which a fire now darted forth which consum-\n ed the bumt-offering that lay upon the altar.

At all events, their feeling was bad, and\n as the expression of it tended to undermine the authority of Mo-\n ses, the Lord testified his displeasure by smiting Miriam with\n leprosy, and as a leper she was excluded from the camp.

Korah, although himself a Levite, appears to have been\n the chief instigator of this revolt. His birth and station would\n have entitled him to a leading place in the tribe ; and it is more\n than probable that another family being appointed to the priest-\n hood, was the chief cause of his discontent. This, however,\n was not a ground on which he could expect much support from\n the chiefs of other tribes ; and it was therefore pretended, that\n the liberties of the people had been infringed by Moses and\n Aaron ; and that the heads of families had been unjustly de-\n</p>\n<p>\n f > rived of the sacerdotal and other powers, which naturally be-\n onged to them. The manner in which the high-priesthood had\n been made a high political office in a theocracy, exposed the\n priesthood to the ambition which it might have escaped had its\n duties been only sacerdotal.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Besides Korah, two chiefs of the tribe of Reuben, Dathan\n and Abiram, are named as the principal malcontents ; and it\n will be remembered, that this tribe, descended from the first-\n born of Jacob, had, as regards the civil and sacerdotal rights of\n primogeniture, suffered more than any other by the existing in-\n stitutions, \u2014 which gave the civil pre-eminence to Judah, and\n the sacerdotal to Levi. Two hundred and fifty other chiefs,\n probably from the different tribes, joined in this conspiracy, the\n very grave character of which may be estimated from the de-\n scription of these persons as \u201c princes of the assembly, famous\n in the congregation, men of renown.\u201d (Num. xvi. 2.)\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The people appear to have been well disposed to listen to\n those who told them that they had cause to be discontented ;\n that their liberties had been taken from them ; and that the\n yoke of a central government was too heavy to be borne. The\n leaders, therefore, being supported by a large body of the \u201c con-\n gregation,\u201d at length openly charged Moses and Aaron with the\n usurpation of civil and pontifical power, which they were re-\n quired to lay down, It was admitted that the appointments of\n the Divine King were absolute ; but it was denied that it was,\n or could be, his intention that such powers should be vested in\n their hands. This they could only dispute by indirectly doubt-\n ing the testimony of Moses, who brought this institution with\n him on his return from the Mount ; and it was clear that, if his\n legislative agency in this matter could be set aside, an opening\n was made for overturning the whole system which rested on\n the same foundation. This was, no doubt, secretly understood\n on all sides : hence Moses at once saw that a special manifes-\n tation that the Aaronic priesthood was a divine appointment,\n had become necessary, not only to establish that institution, but\n for the confirmation of the whole system, of which that was an\n integral part : and, in the confidence that God would vindicate\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0049/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 423}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0049/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 846}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0049/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1692}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0049/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3385}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0049/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0049.jp2", "height": 3385, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 544995}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"49\">\n<p>\n REBELLION OF KORAH.\n</p>\n<p>\n 41\n</p>\n<p>\n b. c. 1471.J\n</p>\n<p>\n his own appointments, Moses was content to refer the matter\n to him.

The destruction of those who unwarrantably pretended to\n sacerdotal functions, and the honour put upon Aaron by the\n plague being stayed at his intercession in his priestly character,\n were calculated to settle all real doubt regarding his appoint-\n ment. But to place this matter beyond controversy, the Divine\n King was pleased to grant a special and abiding miracle. Moses\n was directed to take a rod from each of the tribes, and to en-\n grave upon each rod the name of the tribe to which it belonged,\n but upon the rod of Levi to write Aaron\u2019s name. All these rods\n were laid up in the tabernacle, before the ark, God having sig-\n nified that he would cause to blossom the dry rod of the man\n chosen and appointed by him. The next day the rods were\n brought forth and delivered to those to whom they belonged,\n when it was found that the rod of Aaron had budded, blossom-\n ed, and borne ripe almonds.

The want of water was experienced at Kadesh\n with so much severity, that the people became clamorous and\n reproachful. By this Moses and Aaron were so much disturb-\n ed, that, when instructed to smite a certain rock, from which\n water should then flow, they exhibited such impatience and\n distrust as, if left unpunished, might have had an injurious ef-\n fect on the minds of the people.

Considering the strength of the southern frontier of Ca-\n naan, and the warlike character of the inhabitants, it seemed\n much less desirable that the Israelites should invade the coun-\n try on that side, and fight their way northward, than that they\n should at once enter a central and comparatively undefended\n part of the land. This could only be achieved by passing over\n into the country east of the Dead Sea; and, after marching\n northward, to cross the Jordan into the heart of Palestine.\n From Kadesh, the nearest way to the east country was through\n a great valley in the mountains of Seir, which, however, could\n not be traversed with safety, if any resistance were made by its\n inhabitants, the Edomites. An embassy was therefore sent to\n the king of Edom, to remind him of the fraternity of the two\n nations, and request permission to pass through his country.\n This request, although couched in the most civil and respectful\n language, met with a direct and churlish refusal. It was there-\n fore determined to return to the head of the eastern arm of the\n Red Sea, from which it was easy to pass to the other side of\n the Seir mountains. On the way they had to pass by Mount\n Hor, one of the loftiest of these mountains, at the base of which\n they encamped. Upon that mountain Aaron died, and was bu-\n ried ; and his tomb is still seen afar off by tl/ose who travel in\n that solitary region. He was succeeded in the pontificate by\n his eldest son Eleazer. (Num. xx.)\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. Before the Israelites quitted this place, they were unex-\n pectedly attacked by the Canaanitish king Arad, who took some\n of them prisoners.

The Israelites passed without molestation, along the eas-\n tern border of Mount Seir, and through the country of Moab,\n and encamped by the river Arnon. Of the country immediate-\n ly to the north of that river, the descendants of Lot had before\n this time been dispossessed, by a colony of the Amorites from\n the other side of the Jordan. As it was an early law of na-\n tions, of which we hare had a previous instance, that a body\n of armed men could not pass through a country without permis-\n sion from the sovereign, Moses sent ambassadors to Heshbon\n to ask that permission. This was not only refused by King Si-\n hon, but he went forth with an army to fight against the Isra-\n elites, and to drive them back. Hearing this, the Hebrews did\n not await his attack, but advanced to meet him half way ; and\n having routed him at Jahaz, they acquired possession of a very\n fine country, rich in pastures, and full of towns and cities. This\n acquisition brought them into the neighbourhood of Bashan,\n</p>\n<p>\n ^ whose King, Og, was descended from the old gigantic race by\n * whom the country was originally inhabited. To give an idea\n of his bulk of stature, the sacred historian informs us that his\n bed was of iron, and that its length was thirteen feet and a\n half, and its wiatn six. This monarch prepared to resent the\n defeat and slaughter of his friend and neighbour ; and the Is-\n raelites were somewhat dismayed when he appeared against\n them ; but being encouraged by Moses with assurances of suc-\n cess, they fought bravely, and slew the monarch and dispersed\n his host. Thus the Israelites became possessed of the coun-\n tries of Gilead and Bashan, east of the Jordan, although their\n views had in the first instance been confined to the country\n west of that river.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The Israelites now moved their encampment from the\n banks of the Arnon to the district of country near the nor-\n thern extremity of the Dead Sea, called the plains of Moab,\n as having once been in the territory of the Moabites. That na-\n tion was not at all pleased with these transactions. On enter-\n ing the land of Moab, the Israelites had been cautioned to re-\n spect their descent from Lot, and offer them no molestation ; and\n the Moabites, qp their part, although they regarded the new-\n comers with no good will, were afraid to oppose them.

He therefore sent an honourable embassy, with the\n promise of high distinctions and costly gifts, to tempt Balaam\n from his distant home.

On the way, however, he met with an unexpected check.\n In a narrow road, he was stopped by an angel with a drawn\n sword. The angel was at first visible to the ass, but not to the\n rider ; and the obstinate refusal of the animal to proceed, so\n provoked Balaam, that he beat him most severely. On this the\n ass was gifted for the moment with a human voice, in which he\n remonstrated against this treatment, and intimated that there\n was a cause for his obstinacy. This cause became instantly\n visible to the confounded prophet, who humbled himself before\n the angel, and offered to return home ; but he was allowed to\n proceed, with the strict caution that on his arrival he should\n speak and act only as directed. [Num. xxii.] He was receiv-\n ed with great honour by the king of Moab, who, intent upon\n his design, lost no time in taking Balaam, first, to the high pla-\n ces of Baal, then to the top of Pisgah, and the third time to the\n top of Mount Peor ; from which, severally, he could view, first\n the whole, and then different parts of the Hebrew camp. At\n all these places altars were set up by Balaam\u2019s direction, and\n sacrifices offered. On each occasion the king wished the pro-\n phet to lay his curse upon the people before him ; and Baalam\n was more than willing to gratify him ; but he was constrained\n not only to abstain from cursing the Israelites, but to bless them\n altogether, and to utter the regretful but vain wish that his\n own portion were with them in life and death. The king was\n displeased that he had brought a blessing upon those he intend-\n ed to curse; and to pacify him, as well as to evince that he had\n acted contrary to his own will, Balaam proceeded to point out\n the way to inflict a real injury upon the Israelites.

But this\n could not last. Idolatry was now a capital crime by the law,\n having been made an act of treason against the Divine head of\n the theocratical government.

Moses was also commissioned to punish the Midianites\n \u00bb# by warring against them. A thousand men from each tribe\n</p>\n<p>\n were entrusted with this service, which they discharged with\n exemplary severity ; for, being conquerors in battle, they made\n tremendous havoc among the Midianites, and took a large num-\n ber of female captives, with an immense spoil in cattle and rich\n goods and ornaments. The Moabites were less severely pun-\n v ished ; but for their conduct on this and other occasions, it was\n decreed that, for ten generations to come, they, notwithstanding\n their near relationship, should be counted as strangers to Israel.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. The tribes of Reuben and Gad, and half the tribe of Ma-\n nasseh, having large possessions in flocks and herds, and observ-\n ing that the conquered country on the east of the Jordan was\n rich in pasturage, applied to Moses that it should be given to\n them for their portion of the promised inheritance.

From this comparison it appears that the population which\n had increased so rapidly in Egypt, had rather decreased in the\n wilderness. This is clearly a result of the Divine determination\n to remove by death in forty years the whole of those who were\n past twenty on quitting Egypt, in consequence of which there\n could now be no old men in the congregation ; and as the total\n population was nearly the same as when the Israelites commen-\n ced their journey, there must have been a great increase of the\n young, seeing there were none above sixty years old except*\u00ae\n Moses himself, who was soon to die, and Joshua and Caleb,\n who alone of the past generation were to enter the land of pro-\n mise. The absence of aged and superannuated members exhi-\n bited a strange and singular social condition ; and while their re-\n moval by death was intended in the first instance as a judgment,\n it at the same time gave a character of remarkably unencum-\n bered physical efficiency to the generation on which the con-\n quest of Canaan devolved. But although the full number is\n nearly the same, it is surprising to notice the very great changes\n of proportion in the several tribes \u2014 such as the increase of\n 20,500 in Manasseh, 11,900 in Asher, and 10,200 in Benjamin;\n and the decrease of 37,100 in Simeon, and of 8000 in Ephraim\n and in Naphtali. On both occasions the number of Judah was\n the highest ; but on the first occasion the lowest (omitting Levi)\n was Manasseh, and on the second, Simeon.

At the second, Judah more\n than doubled Simeon, Ephriam, and Levi, and nearly doubled\n Reuben, Benjamin, and Naphtali.

The day appointed for the passage of the Jordan was the\n tenth day of the first month, only five days being wanting to\n complete forty years since the departure of the Hebrews from\n Egypt.

No* sooner had the\n feet of the priests touched the water, than the course of the\n river at that point was stayed. The waters above suspended\n their course, while those below hastened into the Dead Sea, '\n leaving the bed of the river dry for the hosts of Israel to pass\n over. The priests bearing the ark entered, and stood in the mid^pp\n channel, under the wall of paters, until all the ho\u00a7ts of Israel\n had gone over. Then the priests also left the river\u2019s bed ; ' and\n no sooner had they reached the bank, than the suspended wa-\n ters resumed their course. As a standing memorial of this stu-\n pendous miracle, twelve large stones from the bed of the river\n were set up in the plain ; and twelve stones from the shore were\n deposited in the bed of the river.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. At the place where the stones were set up, namely, a|j|fc\n Gilgal, in the plain of Jericho, the Israelites formed their firfQHP\n encampment in Canaan. Instead of proceeding to take advan-\n tage of the panic with which this event had inspired the inhabi-\n tants, as mere human policy would have dictated, by at once\n marching against them, the Israelites were directed to the ob-\n servance of the details of that covenant under which they\n claimed their inheritance. Therefore, in the first place, the rite\n</p>\n<p>\n of circumcision, which had been intermitted during the sojourn\n in the wilderness, was renewed, *and all the persons, forty years\n old and under, who had been born since the departure from\n Egypt, were taken into the Abrahamic covenant by being cir-\n cumcised at Gilgal. They were then in a condition to observe\n the passover, the time for which had come round ; and this was\n the third celebration of that remarkable ordinance, as it had\n been entirely neglected since the second celebration in Sinai.\n The day after the passover they began to eat the corn-, the fruits,\n and other products of the soil of Canaan ; and then the miracu-\n lous supply of manna, by which they had been so long fed, alto-\n gether ceased. It should be observed that the tabernacle was\n set up at Gilgal, and that it remained there during the seven\n years employed in the conquest of Canaan.- Gilgal may, there-\n fore, be regarded as the head-quarters of the Israelites through-\n out that period.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.

He announced himself as the \u201c Captain of\n the Lord\u2019s host,\u201d and commanded Joshua to take the sandals\n off his feet, because the ground was holy on which he stood.\n The prostration and worship rendered by the Hebrew chief on\n this occasion indicates that this was the same mysterious being\n who had spoken to Moses from the burning bush. His object\n was to encourage Joshua, by directing his attention to the fact,\n that the success of the great enterprise before him depended not\n upon his own skill and valour, nor upon the endurance and cour-\n age of his forces, but upon the assistance of the Almighty, who\n had covenanted to bestow the land upon them, and who would\n ensure the victory to his people in every contest which they un-\n dertook with a becoming confidence in their Divine leader. To\n evince this, in the first instance, means were to be taken in the\n siege of Jericho which would be wholly inoperative under ordi-\n nary circumstances, and which would, therefore, refer the vic-\n tory solely to that Almighty arm which was made bare to fight\n for the chosen people. Accordingly, the army was - directed to\n march round the city in solemn state on six successive days, pre-\n ceded by the ark, before which went seven priests with rams\u2019-\n horn trumpets in their hands. This seemingly idle parade pro-\n bably occasioned nothing but wonder to the people of Jericho,\n whom we may conceive crowding the walls to behold the spec-\n tacle. On the seventh day this circumambulation was repeated\n</p>\n<p>\n I even times, and at the completion of the seventh circuit, the\n iiests blew a long blast with their trumpets, and the people\n aised a tremendous shout. At that instant, the strong walls of\n Jericho fell level with the ground, and free ingress was offered\n on every side to the Israelites, who, the place having before\n been put under a ban of devotement to utter ruin, slew every\n living creature with the sword, excepting only the woman, Ra-\n hab, by whom the spies had been entertained. (Josh, vi.)\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. Not only every living creature in Jericho had been devoted\n to extinction, but all the effects were to be destroyed, save arti-\n cles of precious metal, which were to be consecrated to the\n Lord, and laid up for the service of the Tabernacle.

On hearing this, the lot was resorted to for the detection\n of the offender. Achan was taken, and having confessed the\n crime, was stoned to death, and a tumulus of stones was raised\n over his body. After this expurgation, Ai was in another\n attempt easily taken by a stratagem, in which one body, by a\n pretended flight, drew out the defenders in pursuit, on which,\n another body, which had lain in ambuscade, rushed into the\n town, and set it on fire. The pretended fugitives then turned\n upon their pursuers, who, being also attacked in the rear by the\n other body, and seeing their town in flames, were panic-struck,\n and easily cut in pieces.

As the Lord was employing the sword of the Israelites\n for the extermination of a very guilty people, whose iniquities\n had at this time reached the highest point of aggravation, he\n did not direct that the invaders of Palestine should introduce\n any milder usages of war than those which then ordinarily pi^*\n vailed.

The inhabitants of the land appear to have trusted very\n much to the obstacle which their fortified towns would offer to\n the progress of the Israelites ; but the capture of two such\n strong places as Jericho and Ai awoke them from this confi-\n dence, and evinced the necessity of some decided course of\n action. Among the \u201c kings\u201d of that part of Palestine in which\n the invaders lay, five are named, who, headed by Adonizedek,\n king of Jerusalem, confederated together to resist them. If the\n states in this quarter had been disposed to make overtures of\n peace, or even of tribute, they were doubtless prevented, by the\n knowledge that the Israelites were bent on dispossessing them\n altogether, and were under orders to enter into no treaties with\n them. The knowledge of this did not, however, prevent the\n inhabitants of Gibeon from attempting to obtain by stratagem\n what they knew would be refused to a direct application. Am-\n bassadors were sent to the Hebrew camp at Gilgal, cunningly\n dressed up and disguised to appear as travel-worn men, whom\n the renown of the Lord\u2019s marvellous acts in behalf of Israel had\n drawn from a far country, to enter into engagements of friend-\n ship and peace with so highly favoured a people. Deceived by\n their appearance and their professions, the Hebrews entered in-\n to the proposed engagements, without previously consulting\n their Divine King. For this neglect they were very soon pun-\n ished by discovering how they had been outwitted, when they\n sought counsel as to the binding nature of an obligation incurred\n under such circumstances. They were told that a covenant so\n solemnly contracted must be held binding ; but that its terms\n did not not prevent the Gibeonites being reduced to servitude.\n A tribute of labour, in hewing wood and drawing water, was\n therefore exacted from them, (Josh, ix.)\n</p>\n<p>\n 2.

A rapid march by night brought him un-\n expectedly upon the besiegers, who were routed with great\n slaughter ; those that fled were hotly pursued all the day. The\n fugitives were sorely distressed also by a shower of large stones,\n by which the Lord evinced that He fought for Israel ; and when,\n under the coyer of advancing night, many of them seemed like-\n ly to escape into the fortified towns, the light of day was pro-\n longed at the request of Joshua, who, urged by the strong im-\n pulse of his faith, which taught him that even such a mani-\n festation of the Divine power would not be refused, cried, \u201c Sun,\n stand still upon Gibeon; and thou, moon, in the valley of\n Ajalon.\u201d Being ignorant of the true system of astronomy,\n Joshua described what appeared to him and those who heard\n him to be the only means of producing the desired result.

As the worship of the Canaanites and other idolaters\n ultimately resolves itself into the worship of the heavenly bodies,\n of which the sun and moon are the chief, nothing could more\n strikingly evince the omnipotence of the God whom the He-\n brews worshipped, than this proof, that the most glorious objects\n of the material world, of which men made to themselves gods,\n were but the creatures ofhis power.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The five kings were found hid in a cave near Makkedah,\n from which, when the pursuit was over, they were brought out,\n and the principal Hebrew officers set their feet upon their necks,\n which was a well-known act and symbol of victory in the East.\n They were then slain and hung upon trees until the evening, as\n the king of Ai had been. At evening, as the law required\n (Deut. xx. 16, 17), they were taken down, and their bodies were\n returned to the cave which had been their refuge. With his\n usual ability, Joshua took advantage of the panic which his sig-\n nal success and the attendant miracles had on this occasion in-\n spired, and overran and reduced the greater part of the country\n from Gibeon southward to the desert frontier, including the cities\n of Makkedah, Libnah, Lachish, Eglon, Debir, and Hebron.\n The attack on Debir was commanded by Caleb, who, according\n to a romantic oriental usage, announced* that he would give his\n daughter Achsah in marriage to the man who should first en-\n ter the town, or most distinguish himself in the assault. The\n prize of gallantry was won by Othniel, Caleb\u2019s own nephew,\n whom we shall hereafter recognise as the first \u201c Judge\u201d in Is-\n rael.

This great loss so broke the\n power and spirits of the Canaanites, that, while Joshua lived,\n no other powerful combination could be formed against the Is-\n raelites, who occupied themselves in reducing in detail the pet-\n ty kings and cities of the country. In the course of five years,\n thirty-one of these little states were subdued. This was the\n period of exterminating and merciless warfare, to avoid the hor-\n rors of which, it appears that some of these nations emigrated\n to foreign lands ; and there are traditions which might lead us\n to trace some of them to the northern shores of Africa.

Shiloh, in the territory of Ephraim, and\n near the centre of the land, was the place chosen ; and there\n it continued above 450 years, until the time of Samuel. It\n appears to have been on the way to this place that, the Israel-\n ites, in passing by the mountains of Ebal and Gerizim, went\n through the august and striking ceremonial which Moses had\n long before directed to be celebrated in that place, and\n whereby he had Avisely provided that the assembled peo-\n ple should, on taking possession of their inheritance, once\n more solemnly declare their acceptance of the institutions\n Avhich had been given to them (Deut. xxvii.) The fundamental\n laws were inscribed on plastered pillars, and sacrifices Avere of-\n fered on a large altar of unhewn stone.

The five or six following years were consumed in a desul-\n tory warfare with the unconquered states. It would appear\n that the existing population did not yet need all the country, and\n found enough to occupy them in what they had already acquir-\n ed. At all events, the first ardour of action had so much sub-\n sided, that at length Joshua rebuked the tribes for their back-\n wardness in taking full possession of their heritage. Anxious,\n however, that the territorial distribution should be settled be-\n fore his death, he determined that all that remained to be done\n with regard to such a distribution should be at once effected,\n leaving the tribes to assist one another in getting complete pos-\n session of the domains which fell to them. As it appeared pro-\n bable that the portions already given were too large in propor-\n tion to the whole, it was deemed necessary that properly quali-\n fied persons should be sent through the land to survey it, and to\n enter the particulars in a book. It is not improbable that some\n kind of map was constructed on this occasion ; and, altogether,\n the circumstance is interesting as indicating the earliest terri-\n torial survey on record.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The result of this operation manifested that too much land\n had been given at the previous distribution, and that the seven\n remaining tribes could not be adequately provided for out of u\n what remained ; and room was therefore made for two other\n tribes in the portion which had been assigned to Judah, and for\n one in that which had been given to Ephraim. To prevent\n disputes, the seven portions were distributed by lot to the seven\n tribes : and that the determination of the lot were divinely di-\n rected was evinced by the fact, that the position and territory\n given to each of the tribes corresponded exactly to the prophetic\n descriptions given by Jacob and Moses. The lot gave to Si-\n meon and Dan the two portions which had been formed out of\n the territory of Judah, and to Benjamin that which had\n been taken from Ephraim. The four portions in the north, form-\n ing what was afterwards called Galilee, were assigned by the\n lot to Zebulun, Issachar, Asher, and Naphtali. The tribe of\n Levi had no territory assigned to it: but each of the tribes gave\n four towns with their suburbs for the residence of the Levites,\n whereby the members of that tribe were equally and judiciously\n dispersed through the country : and, although there was but one\n tabernacle and one altar, a determinate localization, in every\n tribe, was made of the institutions and officers of the Divine\n King.

This important operation having- been completed under\n the direction of Joshua and Eleazer, the high-priest, it seemed\n proper to dismiss to their homes the warriors of the tribes be-\n yond Jordan, who, according to agreement, had hitherto accom-\n panied the other tribes, and assisted them in their warfare. \u2014\n Joshua, therefore, called them together, and, after ackowledg-\n ing their services, and exhorting them them to maintain their\n allegiance to the Divine King, and their union with the other\n tribes, sent them away with his blessing. The returning tribes\n having crossed the Jordan, erected, at the passage of Bethaba-\n ra, a great altar, which threatened to produce a serious misun-\n derstanding between them and the tribes on this side the river.\n The law allowed but one altar for sacrifices ; and it was hastily\n concluded that the trans-Jordanic tribes designed to destroy the\n unity of the nation, by setting up a separate altar and a separate\n establishment on their side the river. This apprehension so\n awoke the indignation and zeal of the other tribes, that they\n assembled in large numbers at Shiloh, bent^n making war\n with the tribes beyond Jordan, unless a satisfaCTory explanation\n were obtained. Delegates were sent to remonstrate with them,\n and to invite them to come and share the country west of the\n Jordan, if they deemed that river so great a barrier as to dis-\n connect them from the central altar and establishment at Shi-\n loh. The charge was, however, repelled with horror by the\n trans-Jordanic tribes, who explained that the altar was not in-\n tended for sacrifices, but for an abiding monument of their com-\n mon origin, interest, polity, and worship, \u2014 of that very unity\n which they were charged with an intention to discover. This\n statement was received with great satisfaction, and the name of\n Ed, \u201c a Witness,\u201d was given to the altar of memorial.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. Joshua appears to have lived about fourteen years after\n the second division of the lands. During this period, the peo-\n ple ceased to prosecute the war against the Canaanites. It\n would seem that the several tribes having as much land and\n as many towns as they at present wanted, applied themselves\n to agriculture and the pursuits of settled life, and each tribe be-\n came too much engrossed in its own concerns to assist the oth-\n ers in getting full possession of their territory. \u2022 It was well\n that they took so early and decided a turn towards their intend-\n ed vocation as an agricultural people, and that the old inhabi-\n tants were not too rapidly expelled before the Hebrews were\n able to take their place and to occupy their cities ; but it was\n dangerous to them as the peculiar people, that they were in a\n position to form connexion with the idolaters, and to be contam-\n inated by their abominations. There was also reason to fear\n that the Canaanites, by being left alone, would in time gather\n strength again to make head against the chosen race. All this\n happened accordingly, but not in the time of Joshua.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0067/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 423}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0067/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 846}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0067/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1692}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0067/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3385}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0067/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0067.jp2", "height": 3385, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 455507}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"67\">\n<p>\n OTHNIEL DELIVERS ISRAEL.\n</p>\n<p>\n B.

This increasing tendency to idolatry arose from the\n continued remissness of the Israelites in their conduct towards\n the Canaanites. Only a few tribes made war upon them, and\n these soon grew weary of the contest. In most cases where they\n had the ascendancy, they were content to hold the Canaanites\n under tribute, although this had been forbidden by an express\n law ; and their intercourse becoming gradually more intimate*\n they engaged in affairs of commerce, and intermarried with the\n native inhabitants.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Joshua has been blamed by some for not asking permission\n to appoint a successor in the government ; but his office was one\n in which no successor was needed. He was a military com-\n mander, not a civil governor. The Lord himself, enthroned in\n the Tabernacle, was the political and civil, as well as the reli-\n gious, head of the nation ; and there were established means of\n obtaining the commands of the Divine King on all questions\n that could arise, through the instrumentality of his chief min-\n ister, the high-priest. In those days the functions of general\n government were so simple, that this theocratical institution con-\n tained every element of stability and safety, had its principles\n and advantages been properly understood by the people. The\n administration of justice among them had been well provided\n for ; the business of public instruction was in the hands of the\n Levites, in their several cities ; and the internal concerns of the\n several tribes were sufficiently cared for by their own patriarchal\n or family chiefs and elders.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The only military operation of any note shortly after the\n death of Joshua, consisted in the endeavours of the tribe of\n Judah, assisted by Simeon, to get full possession of its terrritory.\n In this it seems to have succeeded generally; but it was un-\n able to expel the Jebusites from the strong fortress which form-\n ed the upper town of Jerusalem. In one action against Adoni-\n bezek, in Bezek, ten thousand Canaanites were slain, and the\n king was taken prisoner. His thumbs and great toes were cut\n off, in retribution for the manner in which he had been wont to\n treat his own captives ; for he himself declared that seventy\n kings, whose thumbs and great toes he had cut off, gathered\n their bread under his table.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The high-priest Eleazer did not long outlive Joshua, and\n he was succeeded by his son Phineas. Early in his administra-\n tion, \u201c the angel of the Lord,\u201d who had appeared to Joshua at\n Gilgal, again appeared to the people when assembled before the\n tabernacle at Shiloh, and, having solemnly reprehended their\n conduct with regard to the Canaanites, threatened no longer to\n vouchsafe Almighty power for their expulsion, but to leave the\n remainder of the Canaanites for a test and trial of faithfulness.\n This authoritative rebuke produced some effect, and moved them\n to such cries and tears as caused the place to be called Bochim\n {weepers).\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0069/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 423}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0069/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 846}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0069/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1692}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0069/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3385}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0069/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0069.jp2", "height": 3385, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 538439}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"69\">\n<p>\n DEATH OF OTHNIEL.\n</p>\n<p>\n 61\n</p>\n<p>\n b < c* 1405.]\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. But the impression produced was of short duration. The\n last five chapters of the book of Judges relate events which be-\n long to the time of Phineas, and give a melancholy view of the\n moral condition of the nation at this period. The tribe of Dan\n being pressed for room in its southern allotment, and being una-\n ble to get possession of the portions of territory which were suc-\n cessfully defended by the Canaanites, sent out a portion of\n its members to seek out a situation where they might more\n easily form a settlement. This they found near the source of the\n Jordan, where they took the town of Leshem or Laish from the\n inhabitants, who were living in security, and changed its name\n to Dan, \u2014 under which name it is often celebrated as the most\n northerly town of Palestine in tne popular phrase, \u201c from Dan\n v m the north) to Beersheba (in the south),\u201d which described the\n whole length of the land. On this occasion a modified system\n of idolatry w r as introduced into this tribe. The depravity of the\n inhabitants of the Benjamite city of G-isbah, and the grievous\n maltreatment of a Levite and his wife, roused the other tribes to\n warlike operations, on the refusal of the Benjamites to give up\n the offenders. This infatuated tribe had some success in the\n first and second actions ; but in a third, their reverse was so com-\n plete, and the ensuing carnage so dreadful, that the tribe was\n nearly exterminated, and never wholly recovered the blow, but\n ever after remained the smallest tribe in Israel.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. To punish the disorders, which these circumstances illus-\n trate rather than describe, the Lord in his anger brought the na-\n tion into subjection to a distant and unexpected enemy, Cushan\n Rishathaim, a king from beyond the Euphrates, who kept the\n Israelites under severe tributary bondage for eight years. At the\n end of that time tney turned to the Divine King against whom\n they had so grievously revolted ; am. he moved Othniel, the\n nephew of Caleb, to act for their deliverance. After some de-\n sultory warfare, a general action was fought, in which the com-\n plete victory of the Israelites effected their deliverance from\n the Mesopotamian yoke. After this, Othniel, as \u201cjudge,\u201d or re-\n gent for the Divine King, directed the foreign and military policy\n of southern Israel for forty years, during which time the people\n continued true to their allegiance, and dwelt in peace.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. On his death, the Israelites again returned to their idola-\n trous practices, and were punished by their jealous neighbours\n and relatives, the Moabites, who, finding the chosen people not\n invincible, ventured a battle, and, being victorious, reduced to\n subjection the tribes beyond Jordan, and, at length, also the\n southern tribes on this side the river. Eglon, the king, then fix-\n ed his residence at Jericho, as the best means of establishing his\n power, by controlling the communications of the tribes which\n the river separated. The Hebrews were kept under tribute for\n eighteen years ; at the expiration of which, one of the tribute-\n bearers, Ehud of Benjamin, secretly murdered the king, whose\n death struck the Moabites with such consternation, that the Is-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0070/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0070/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0070/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0070/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0070/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0070.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 597002}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"70\">\n<p>\n 62\n</p>\n<p>\n DEBORAH AND BARAK.\n</p>\n<p>\n [b. c. 1296.\n</p>\n<p>\n raelites were enabled, under the conduct of Ehud, to shake ofi\n their yoke.

In their deep trouble, the Israelites at length cried to the\n God who had so.often delivered them in time past. A prophet\n was then sent to\u2019rebuke their ingratitude ; but also to promise\n deliverance. Accordingly, as Gideon, a man of the tribe of Ma-\n nasseh, was secretly threshing wheat in a winepress, to hide it\n from the Midianites, an angel of God appeared to him, and\n commissioned him to undertake the deliverance of Israel. Gid-\n eon first sought to decline so high a trust, and then requested a\n token that the commission was indeed from heaven. His re-\n quest was granted ; for, at the touch of the angel\u2019s staff, fire\n broke forth and consumed, as a sacrifice, the kid and the bread\n which Gideon had set before his visitant, who disappeared, and\n left him \u201c filled with the Spirit of God,\u201d \u2014 a spirit of faith and\n fortitude, equal to the great enterprise which lay before him. \u2014\n In answer to his prayer, another sign was given to Gideon ; \u2014\n a fleece which he spread out upon the open threshing floor be-\n came wet with dew, while the ground was dry ; and again, the\n fleece alone was dry, while the soil was wet all around.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Now strong in faith, Gideon overthrew the altar which his\n father had erected to Baal, and cut down the trees of the \u201c sa-\n cred\u201d grove which he had planted around it. Then proceeding\n into the country, he blew the trumpet of war, when 32,000\n men gathered to his standard. But the Lord, knowing the un-\n belief and distrust that prevailed among them, directed Gideon\n to proclaim that all who were fearful and faint-hearted might\n withdraw. Availing themselves of this permission, 22,000\n took their departure, so that only 10,000 were left. Even these\n were too many for the Lord\u2019s purpose, which required that the\n means employed should be so evidently inadequate, that the\n glory of the deliverance might be entirely his own. Gideon\n was therefore directed to lead his thirsty troops to the river,\n and permit them to drink. The greater part bent down to the\n surface of the water, to imbibe large draughts at ease and lei-\n sure ; but a few lapped up the water in the hollow of their\n hands, as men in haste. Those who stooped down to drink\n were ordered by Gideon to retire to their houses ; and by the\n others, who were only 300 in number, the deliverance of Is-\n rael was promised. The host which this handful of men had\n to encounter, lay encamped in the plain of Esdraelon.

He had no claim to\n share with his brethren in their patrimony ; and, on the death of\n their father, was excluded with some harshness from the pater-\n nal home, and became a wanderer and exile. A number of men\n of like broken fortune and unsettled dispositions, joined them-\n selves to him, and they lived upon the prey which they acquired\n by harassing the Ammonites and other enemies of Israel. In\n this kind of predatory warfare, they became skilful, hardy, and\n bold ; and the name of Jephthah wes celebrated beyond Jordan\n as that of a valiant and successful leader. When, therefore,\n the tribes were encouraged to hope for deliverance, their eyes\n turned to him, and a deputation was sent to invite him to take\n the command in the war against the Ammonites. After some\n demur, he accepted the invitation, and repaired to Mizpeh of\n Gilead, where his appointment was solemnly ratified. His first\n act was to send an embassy to demand of the Ammonites why\n they invaded the territories of Israel. In reply, they advanced\n the claim of prior occupation, which has been mentioned ; to\n which J ephthah answered, that whoever were the prior occupants,\n the country belonged to Israel by right of conquest from the\n Amontes. Jepthah then went forth to the war, but in depart-\n ing, rashly vowed to devote in sacrifice to God whatever came\n forth to meet him on his return triumphant.

In early manhood, Samson became enamoured of a damsel\n of the Philistine town of Timnath, and persuaded his parents\n to go and ask her in marriage for him. On the way, he en-\n countered a lion, and without weapons, tore it asunder as if it\n had been a kid : but he did not deem the exploit worth relating,\n even to his parents. The offer of marriage was accepted ; and\n after a while, Samson again went to Timnath, to celebrate the\n nuptials and bring home the bride. On the way, he turned aside\n to see what had become of the lion ; and he found a swarm of\n bees in the dried frame-work of skin and bones which was left,\n after jackals (probably) had devoured the flesh.

Indignant at his wife for be-\n traying his secret, and at the guests for tampering with her,\n Samson left her and went home, after he had slain thirty Phi-\n listines of Askelon, and given their garments, as his forfeit, to\n the guests.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. After his anger had subsided, he went to visit his wife,\n with a present of a kid ; but he found her married to his friend,\n who had been his bridesman at the wedding. On this and other\n occasions, he allowed his private wrongs to stimulate him to\n the exercise of his vindictive mission, which otherwise he ap-\n pears to have been much disposed to neglect. Fired by the\n present insult, he vowed and took severe revenge. Collecting\n three hundred foxes, he tied them together by the tails, in pairs ;\n and then putting a firebrand between every pair, he turned them\n into the standing com of the Philistines, which was burnt with\n fire, along with the shocks of corn, and the vineyards and olive\n grounds. The Philistines laid the blame upon Samson ' s wife\n and her father, and came and burnt them both with fire ; but\n this cruel action was soon after punished by Samson with so\n great a slaughter, that he deemed it prudent to withdraw to the\n top of the almost inaccessible rock Etam, in the tribe of Judah.\n Determined to secure so implacable an enemy, the Philistines\n went in great force against him: but being unable to reach him\n in this position, they required the Judahites to yield him up.\n More disposed to dread the consequences of Samson\u2019s feats than\n to glory in them, three thousand men of Judah went to seize their\n hero, and deliver him up in bonds to the Philistines. He did\n not resist \u2014 and when the enemies and masters of Israel beheld\n their redoubted antagonist brought to them as a captive, they\n raised an exulting shout: but at that moment Samson burst\n asunder the new ropes with which he was bound, as if they had\n been burnt tow, and seizing the jaw-bone of an ass that lay\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0077/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 423}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0077/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 846}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0077/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1692}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0077/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3385}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0077/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0077.jp2", "height": 3385, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 517126}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"77\">\n<p>\n DEATH OF SAMPSON.\n</p>\n<p>\n 69\n</p>\n<p>\n B.

After this feat, which he very pro-\n perly felt to be \u201c a great deliverance which God had given to\n him,\u201d Samson, ready to perish with intense thirst, called upon\n God for relief; and immediately water rose from a hollow\n place close by, which ever after remained a perennial spring.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. We next find this very strong yet erring man in the house\n of a harlot, in the Philistine city of Gaza. When his arrival\n was known, the gates of the city were shut, and a guard set, to\n prevent his escape. But he arose in the night, and not only\n burst open, but rent away the gates, carried them off, posts and\n all, upon his shoulders, and left them upon a hill on the road\n to Hebron.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Another harlot, named Delilah, dwelling in the vale of\n Sorek, proved his ruin. Tempted by the rich bribes of the Phi-\n listine lords, Delilah endeavoured to extract from Samson the se-\n cret of his strength, for it was known that it was in something\n more than bone and sinews that he differed from other men.\n After some attempts to amuse her, Samson, tired by her impor-\n tunities, at length told her that his strength lay in his hair, as\n the sign of his devotement, and of the covenant by which he\n held his powers. While he slept upon her lap, she made the\n seven locks of his hair be cut off ; and instantly the covenant\n with God being broken, the strength of Samson departed from\n him, and he became weak as other men. The Philistines took\n him without difficulty, put out his eyes, and carried him to\n Gaza, where he was bound with fetters of brass, and put to a\n slave\u2019s labour in the prison-house. Blind and in prison, Sam-\n son had leisure to repent that he had trifled so lightly with the\n gift of God: and with his repentance and the growth of his hair,\n it pleased God to renew his strength. At this time the Philis-\n tines held a high day of festival and thanksgiving, to praise\n their god Dagon for having delivered their greatest enemy into\n their hands ; and Samson himself was brought from the prison,\n that the assembled people might behold their wretched victim,\n triumph in his misery, and make sport of his blindness. W ea-\n ried at length, the fallen champion applied to the lad who led\n him by the hand, to let him lean for rest upon the two pillars\n which chiefly supported the roof of the building, upon which\n three thousand people were at that time assembled to see the\n spectacle and celebrate the feast. Their impious rejoicing in\n their idol was so displeasing to God, that he granted the prayer\n of Samson, and endued him with such strength, that when, em-\n bracing the pillars, he bowed himself with all his might, they\n yielded to the vast force, and broke ; whereon the roof, with the\n mass of people upon it, fell in, and buried in the ruins Samson\n and the multitude below. At his death, Samson slew a great-\n er number of the Philistines than he had done during his life.\n (Judges, xvi. 4\u201431).\n</p>\n<p>\n 6.

As Samson did not appear to have exercised any authority,\n civil or military, even in the southern portions of Palestine ad-\n joining the Philistine territory, to which his operations were con-\n fined, he might be described as a scourge of the Philistines rather\n than a Judge of Israel. Without doubt, the civil government, as\n far as any existed in such disorderly times, was directed by the\n high priest, \u2014 which office, during a portion of Samson ' s time,\n appears to have been held by Eli, although, for chronological\n purposes, his administration is^aid to begin where the history\n of Samson ends. Eli judged Israel for forty years after the\n death of Samson. In the course of his administration, Hannah,\n the wife of Elkanah, a Levite, who had been barren, and on\n that account much insulted by another wife of Elkanah, who\n was fruitful, in her distress prayed to the Lord to give her a son,\n and vowed that if her suit were granted, she would dedicate\n that son as a Nazarite to the Lord all the days of his life. The\n petition was heard, and she called her son Samuel, signifying\n \u201c heard, 1 \u2019 or \u201c given of God.\u201d In accordance with the vow of\n special dedication, the child had no sooner reached a proper age\n than he was taken to the tabernacle at Shiloh, and left there\n under the care of Eli, who soon became much attached to him,\n and, as he grew up, employed him in personal attendance on\n himself, and in various services about the tabernacle.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0079/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 423}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0079/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 846}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0079/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1692}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0079/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3385}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0079/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0079.jp2", "height": 3385, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 525314}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"79\">\n<p>\n SAMUEL CALLED.\n</p>\n<p>\n 71\n</p>\n<p>\n B.

W e know not on what occasion\n the elder branch, descended from Eleazer, had been set aside.\n Eli was a pious man, but of too easy and mild a disposition for\n his high situation. His gentle rebukes had therefore very little\n effect upon his two sons, Hophni and Phineas, who proved so\n degenerate that they were guilty of the grossest excesses and\n most criminal abuses of their priestly office and hence the pre-\n sentation of offerings and sacrifices became disagreeable and\n hateful to all the people. Although sensible of their bad con-\n duct, Eli did not interpose his authority to put a stop to it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Thus matters proceeded until the boy Samuel had attained\n the age of twelve years, when he was called by night, in a very\n remarkable way, to the prophetic office. On that occasion the\n destruction and deposition of Eli\u2019s house were denounced, on\n account of the iniquities of his sons and his own criminal neg-\n lect, \u2014 \u201c because his sons made themselves vile, and he restrained\n them not.\u201d Samuel could not conceal this revelation from Eli.\n The aged pontiff, in conformity with the usual passive piety of\n his character, answered meekly, \u201c It is the Lord : let him do\n what seemeth to him good !\u201d From that time forward Samuel\n was favoured with frequent communications from God. The\n youth also conducted himself with so much propriety and dis-\n cretion, that the people generally looked to him with affection\n and confidence, as appointed of God to an office which appears\n for a long time to have been intermitted.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Ten years after the call of Samuel, the Israelites, without\n the consent or authority of their Divine king, whom they ought\n to have consulted, embarked in an ill-considered war with the\n Philistines. Being defeated in the first engagement with the\n loss of 4000 men, they had the presumption to send for the ark\n of God, out of the tabernacle, that they might fight under its\n protection. It was borne to the wars by Hophni and Phineas\n with other priests ; and its arrival filled the Philistines with\n dread, as they identified it with the presence of \u201c the mighty\n God, that smote the Egyptians with all the plagues.\u201d Yet they\n encouraged one another to fight manfully to save themselves\n from such bondage as that in which they had held the Israelites.\n Again they were victorious : 30,000 men of Israel fell in the\n battle ; Hophni and Phineas were slain ; and the ark of the cov-\n enant was taken. Eli, now blind with age, and his heart trem-\n bling for the ark of God, sat watching by the way side for the\n first news of the battle. He soon heard the disastrous tidings,\n and when the messenger announced that \u201c the ark of God was\n taken,\u201d he fell off his seat, and, being heavy and old, his neck\n was broken by the la.ll.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.

On successive nights, the image\n of Dagon was found thrice to have fallen prostrate before the ark,\n and the third time it was broken in pieces. He also smote the\n Philistines with a grievous disease, and with swarms of field-\n mice which marred the land ; and they were at length compel-\n led to appease the wrath of the God of Israel, by trespass-offer-\n ings expressive of the plagues with which they had been visited.\n These were five golden mice, and five golden emerods, which\n they put in a coffer beside the ark. They then set the ark on a\n new car, drawn by milch cows taken from their calves, which,\n without guidance, took the right road to the land of Israel, and\n stopped at Bethshemesh, a city of the priests in the tribe of Ju-\n dah. The restored ark, which had been seven months among\n the Philistines, was received with great joy by the people ; but\n this was soon turned into mourning, for not fewer than 50,070\n men were struck with sudden death for presuming to look into\n the ark. This made the men of Bethshemesh as much afraid as\n the Philistines had been to have the ark any longer among x\n them, and they invited the inhabitants of the neighbouring town\n of Kirjath-jearim to send and take it to themselves. They did\n so, and deposited it in the house of Abinadab, \u201c upon the hill,\u201d\n who set apart his son Eleazer to take care of it. There it re-\n mained for eighty-two years, or until the tenth year of the reign\n of king David.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Notwithstanding these signal events, the Israelites, who\n remained in subjection to the Philistines, continued careless of\n the obligations of the covenant, and negligent of the worship of\n God. The exertions of Samuel, however, in the course of time,\n brought them round to a better state of feeling ; and after twenty\n years, they were disposed to return to their allegiance to their\n Divine king. Having, therefore, put aside all their strange gods,\n they held a solemn feast of humiliation for their sins at Mizpeh\n in Benjamin, and there poured out water before the Lord in\n token of their grief. Samuel, who was then formally recognis-\n ed as judge over Israel, earnestly interceded for them, and im-\n plored deliverance from the Philistines, who had taken alarm at\n this large assemblage, and were then advancing to disperse\n them. This prayer was answered by a thunder-storm so tre-\n mendous and so entirely unexpected at that season of the year,\n as struck such terror and amazement into the Philistines, that\n they were easily put to flight, and were pursued and smitten by\n the Israelites. The consequences of this victory relieved them\n from the yoke of the Philistines, who were obliged to restore\n the places taken from Israel, and were not in a condition to give\n any further disturbance during Samuel\u2019s administration.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.

But the right\n working of this constitution depended on a continued obedience\n in the people, which they had not manifested, and an apprecia-\n tion of the system, of which they seem to have been scarcely\n capable. In short, the principle of this form of government was\n too refined for them ; and, notwithstanding its very numerous\n concessions to their weakness, they too often failed to compre-\n hend it as their principle, and to act up to its requirements.\n Hence arose internal disorders and confusions, which, although\n really owing to the short-comings of the people, yet seemed in\n some degree imputable to the practical inefficiency of the cen-\n tral principle, and created the desire for something less sublime\n and remote,\u2014 something visible, tangible, common, \u2014 suited to\n the apprehensions of an unintellectual people. Hence the de-\n mand for a king, and for the forms and institutions of a human\n monarchy, which might form a more sensible state-principle\n than the theocracy offered.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. When the elders made their application for this great\n change in the government to Samuel at Ramah, they found him\n strongly opposed to their wish. With becoming dignity, he vin-\n dicated the purity of his own administration, and challenged any\n one to charge him with corruption or wrong ; he reminded them\n that they had already a King, whose power and resources were\n illimitable, and under whom obedience only was necessary to\n render their welfare secure ; he placed before them, in the most\n vivid manner, the exactions and services to which they would\n be subject under human kings, and from which they were now\n so happily exempt ; and, in short, it was his desire that they\n should rather strive to bring the national character up to the re-\n quirements of their present state-principle, than bring down the\n principle to a lower standard of character. But the elders had\n made up their minds on the subject, and persisted in their de-\n mand. As, therefore, the demand was made in a becoming\n manner, which referred the whole matter to the Lord through\n his prophet ; as Moses had foreseen and provided for such a con-\n tingency ; and as it was more than probable, that, in their pre-\n sent temper, the people would set up a King for themselves, un-\n less indulged in their wish, Samuel was at length authorized to\n yield to their desire, although under a protest.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. We have now, therefore, to contemplate a new phase\n of the Jewish history, in which the government was not a pure\n theocracy, nor a simple monarchy, but a combination of the two.\n The Lord was still the Supreme King ; and the human monarch\n was to be appointed by him, and the line of succession determin-\n ed or changed at his pleasure. The king was to wield the or-\n dinary administrative powers of royalty, and its signs and sym-\n bols of dignity and honour ; but his real position was that of a\n vice-king,\u2014 the minister, regent, dr representative of the Divine\n King, whose counsel was to be sought, through the sacred ora-\n cles, on all occasions of importance, and whose directions, when\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0083/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 239, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0083/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 478, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 838}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0083/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1676}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0083/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1912, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3352}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0083/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0083.jp2", "height": 3352, "width": 1912, "levels": 6, "size": 518651}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"83\">\n<p>\n SAUL APPOINTED KING.\n</p>\n<p>\n 75\n</p>\n<p>\n B.C. 1095.]\n</p>\n<p>\n given, were to be implicitly followed by the sovereign.

This was the\n theory of the Hebrew monarchy, as, by anticipation, it had been\n settled long before by Moses (De,ut. xvii. 14-20) ; and we shall\n find in the sequel that the character of the kings, whether good\n or bad, was determined by their observance or neglect of these\n fundamental principles. The kings themselves were but too\n much disposed to forget the fact of their dependence upon the\n Invisible King.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Saul, the son of Kish, of the tribe of Benjamin, had wan-\n dered about for three days seeking the strayed asses of his fa-\n ther. Fatigued with the unsuccessful search, he was disposed\n to abandon it and return home, when, finding himself near Ra-\n mah, where Samuel lived, he resolved to consult one who was\n renowned in all Israel as a man from whom nothing was hid.\n Instructed in the Divine designs regarding Saul, the prophet re-\n ceived him with honour. He assured him that the asses which\n he had sought were already found, and invited him to stay with\n him until the next morning. Saul was in fact the man on\n whom the Divine appointment to be the first king of Israel had\n fallen. A hint of this high destiny, produced from the aston-\n ished stranger a modest declaration of his insufficiency. But the\n prophet gave him the place of honour before all the persons\n whom \u2014 foreknowing the time of his arrival \u2014 he had invited to\n his table. As is still usual in summer, Saul slept on the flat\n roof of the house ; and was called early in the morning by Sam-\n uel, who walked forth some way with him on his return home.\n When they had got beyond the town, they stopped, and Samuel\n then anointed Saul as the person whom God had chosen to be\n \u201c captain over his inheritance and gave him the first kiss of\n civil homage. In token of the reality of these things, and to\n assure the mind of the bewildered young man, the prophet fore-\n told the incidents of his homeward journey, and, in parting, de-\n sired his attendance on the seventh day following at Gilgal.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. On the day and at the place appointed, Samuel assembled\n a general convocation of the tribes for the election of a king.\n As usual, under the theocracy, the choice of God was manifest-\n ed by the sacred lot. The tribe of Benjamin was chosen ; and\n of the families of Benjamin, that of Matri was taken ; and, final-\n ly, the lot fell upon the person of Saul, the son of Kish. An-\n ticipating this result, he had modestly concealed himself, to\n avoid an honour which he so little desired. But he was found,\n and brought before the people, who beheld with admiration his\n comely and dignified person, \u2014 for he stood taller, by the head\n and shoulders, than any of the people.

Many persons in the great tribes,\n however, were dissatisfied that the election had vested the roy-\n alty over Israel in the smallest of the tribes, and in a person of\n so little consequence, even in that tribe, as Saul. They there-\n fore held proudly aloof, and the new king was allowed to return,\n with a very humble attendance, to his home in Gibeah. Saul,\n although sensible of the neglect, wisely \u201c held his peace\u201d for the\n time ; and it ultimately appeared that the different tribes could\n more readily unite around a monarch in his neutral position,\n than if a member of one of the more powerful tribes had been\n chosen. Judah would have been reluctant to submit to a king\n of Ephraim, and the proud and fiery Ephraimltes would not\n willingly have received a king from Judah. Perhaps, therefore,\n the choice which appears so strange at the first view, was the\n only one by which a civil war could have been averted.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Soon after these things, the Ammonites, under their king\n Nahash, took the field, on the other side of the Jordan, and laid\n siege to the important town of Jabesh-Gilead. Being forced to\n capitulate, the inhabitants could obtain no better terms than\n that every man should have his right eye put out. To this\n hard condition they agreed, unless relief should come within\n seven days. Messengers were immediately despatched to Saul,\n who had contentedly resumed his usual avocations in Gibeah,\n and, when the tidings were brought to him, was returning quiet-\n ly from the fields with his herd. Instantly the spirit of a king\n was roused within him ; and he felt the duties, and claimed the\n powers, of the Lord\u2019s anointed. He imperatively summoned the '\n warriors to his standard ; and speedily found himself at the head\n of a very large force, with which he crossed the Jordan, and\n by a forced march arrived before Jabesh, in time to save the in-\n habitants from their enemies, who were defeated with great\n slaughter. This splendid achievement manifested in Saul the\n qualities which, in these times, were most sought for in a king,\n and raised him so high in the estimation of the people, that\n Samuel deemed it proper to call another assembly at Gilgal, to\n confirm him in the kingdom. Here those who had hitherto\n manifested discontent, were obliged by the force of popular opin-\n ion, to join in a general and more formal recognition of the new\n king. It was then that Saul began really to reign.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.

Interpreting this as a declara-\n tion of war, the Philistines delayed not to bring into the field a\n vast force, which comprehended six thousand horsemen and\n three thousand chariots of war. Saul, on his part, had sum-\n moned all the tribes to send their levies to Gilgal. This they\n did in sufficient numbers ; but while they remained there wait-\n ing for Samuel, who had appointed to come and offer sacrifices,\n great numbers of the men slunk away, being appalled at the\n formidable aspect of the Philistine army. Saul was confessedly\n in a difficult position, and his obedience to the principle of the\n theocracy was severely tested. It failed ; for, becoming impa-\n tient at the delay of Samuel, he called for the victims, and him-\n self offered the sacrifices. By this act he not only seemed to\n make a claim to exercise the priestly office, as kings did in\n other countries, but gave indications of the dispositions which\n in the end proved his ruin. He was a brave and able comman-\n der ; but he too often forgot that, in his political capacity, he\n was but the vassel of the Divine king ; and he did not always\n execute the orders he received, but made exceptions according\n to his own views. Just as the sacrifices had been offered, Sam-\n uel arrived, and strongly testified the Divine displeasure at this\n disobedience, which he declared had manifested the unfitness\n of Saul to be the founder of a race of kings. He then quitted\n the camp : and Saul, hiding his concern, numbered his force,\n which he found dwindled away to six hundred men. Not dar-\n ing to encounter the Philistine host with this handful of men,\n he marched with them to his own town of Gibeah.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8.

They\n fpund means to ascend a steep cliff, where the enemy least of\n all expected an attack ; and early in the morning they fell upon\n the advanced guards of the Philistines. Some were slain by\n the sword, and the others thrown into such consternation, that\n they slew one another, mistaking friends for foes. As soon as\n Saul got intelligence of what had happened, he took advantage\n of the confusion into which they were already thrown, and fell\n upon the Philistines with such fury, that they were soon utter-\n ly routed. That the pursuit of the enemy might not be retard-\n ed, Saul, in the heat of the chase, proclaimed death to any one\n who should taste food before the night.

Several following years were distinguished by successful\n warfare with the enemies of Israel, \u2014 with Moab and Ammon\n in the east, with Edom in the south, with the Philistines in the\n west, and with the Syrian kings of Zobah in the north. At\n length, in the tenth or eleventh year of his reign, Saul received\n orders, through Samuel, to execute the Lord\u2019s \u201c fierce wrath\u201d\n upon the Amalekites, who had formerly been doomed to utter\n extermination for opposing the Israelites when they came out\n of Egypt. The result of the war put it fully in the king\u2019s\n power to fulfil his commission ; but he thought proper to retain\n the best of the cattle as booty, and brought back the Amalekite\n king Agag as a prisoner. Here again Saul ventured to use his\n own discretion where his commission left him none. For this\n the Divine decree, excluding his descendants from the throne,\n was again and irrevocably pronounced by Samuel, who met him\n at Gilgal on his return. The stern prophet then directed the\n Amalekite king to be brought forth and slain by the sword,\n after which he departed to his own home, and went no more\n to see Saul to the day of his death, though he ceased not to\n bemoan his misconduct and the forfeiture it had incurred. But,\n during the years in which Samuel mourned for Saul, the king\n himself seemed increasing in strength and power ; he became\n respected at home and feared abroad ; while the many virtues\n of his excellent son Jonathan, who was greatly beloved by the\n people, seemed to render his dynasty secure. Saul himself,\n however, seems to have had sad misgivings on this subject, and\n we may perhaps impute to the constant brooding of his mind\n upon the doom pronounced by the prophet, those fits of morbid\n melancholy into which he frequently fell. His general temper,\n at the same time, became sour, irritable, and sanguinary.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2.

For this purpose he was\n to proceed to Bethlehem, and there anoint one of the sons of a\n man named Jesse. This was a delicate commission, which,\n if known, might, as the prophet apprehended, induce Saul to\n slay him ; and he therefore veiled it under the form of a public\n sacrifice. The prophet appears to have made known his real\n purpose only to Jesse, who caused all his sons to pass before\n him, when they were rejected, one after another, until the\n youngest, David, was sent for from the fields, where lie was\n with the sheep. This youth, then about fifteen years of age,\n was the destined king ; and Samuel anointed him as such in the\n midst of his elder brethren, who, as well as himself, were pro-\n bably kept in ignorance of the purport of this act. Samuel\n returned to his own home, and David continued to tend his\n father\u2019s flock. David was not more distinguished by the come-\n liness of his person than by his accomplishments and valour ;\n he was skilled in music and poetical composition, and he had,\n without weapons, slain a lion and a bear which attacked his\n flock.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Meanwhile, the king\u2019s fits of melancholy madness went\n on increasing in frequency and duration, and no\u201d cure was found\n for his diseased mind. At length, some person who had ob-\n served that Saul was much affected by music, suggested that\n the soothing powers of the harp should be tried ; and another\n then recommended \u201c the son of Jesse\u201d as an accomplished mas-\n ter of that instrument, and withal, a man of valour. Saul\n therefore delayed not to send to Jesse, commanding him to send\n his son to court. Little thinking that in him he beheld his\n successor on the throne, Saul received the youthful minstrel\n with favour. When the fits came upon him, David played\n on the harp, and under its soothing strains his mind soon re-\n covered its usual tone. This service, together with his other\n engaging qualities, and his discreet behaviour, won the heart\n of the king, who conferred upon him the distinguished and con-\n fidential post of his armour-bearer.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Since their last great discomfiture, the Philistines had\n recruited their strength, and in the thirtieth year of Saul\u2019s\n reign, and the twentieth of David\u2019s life, they again took the\n field against the Israelites. It curiously illustrates the nature\n of warfare in those times to find that the presence, in the army\n of the Philistines, of one enormous giant about nine or ten feet\n high, filled them with confidence, and struck the Israelites with\n dread. Attended by his armour-bearer, and clad in complete\n mail, with weapons to match his huge bulk, the giant, whose\n name was Goliah, presented himself daily between the two\n armies, and, with insulting language, defied the Israelites to\n produce a champion who, by single combat, might decide the\n quarrel between the nations. This was repeated many days ;\n but no Israelite was found bold enough to accept the challenge.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0088/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0088/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0088/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0088/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0088/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0088.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 564040}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"88\">\n<p>\n 80\n</p>\n<p>\n DAVID MARRIES MICHAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n [b. c. 1060.\n</p>\n<p>\n At length David, no longer able to endure the taunts and blas-\n phemies of Goliah, offered himself for the combat.

But as David expressed his strong confidence\n that the God of Israel, who had delivered him from the lion\n and the bear when he tended his father\u2019s flock, would also de-\n liver him from the proud Philistine, Saul at length allowed him\n to go forth against Goliah.

Triumphant was the return of Saul ; but it mortified\n his pride to perceive that David was on all hands regarded as\n the hero of the day: and when the damsels made this the bur-\n den of their triumphal song, \u2014 \u201c Saul has slain his thousands,\n and David his ten thousands !\u201d he could not conceal his resent-\n ment that the honours of victory should be thus proportioned.\n From a fretful expression which he let fall, it seems more than\n likely that he then first suspected that David was \u201c the man\n after God\u2019s own heart,\u201d to whom his throne was to be given.\n His inquiries probably confirmed this impression, and thence-\n forth he lost no opportunity of exposing David to disgrace and\n danger. But all the schemes laid for his ruin served only to\n make more prominent David\u2019s valour in the field, and the wis-\n dom and generosity of his general conduct. Finding that the\n honours which were designed as snares for him, \u2014 including that\n of giving him his daughter Michal in marriage, \u2014 really exalted\n David, Saul could no longer confine his dark passions to his\n own bosom, but charged his son Jonathan and others to take\n some opportunity of destroying the son of Jesse for him. He\n little suspected that a most tender friendship, \u201cpassing the\n love of women,\u201d had grown up between Jonathan and David.\n To Jonathan, in particular, was this celebrated friendship highly\n honourable ; for it was not unknown to him that the son of\n Jesse was destined to exclude himself and his children from the\n throne of Israel.

On the present occasion Jonathan gave his friend timely\n notice of danger, and spoke so forcibly to his father, that his\n better feelings overcame his insane horror of David, and he\n promised to make no further attempt upon his life. But soon\n after this, David, having commanded an expedition against the\n Philistines, so distinguished himself as to increase the admira-\n tion of the people and to revive the hatred of Saul. When he\n resumed his place at court, and was one day playing on his harp\n to soothe the perturbed spirit of the king, he narrowly escaped\n death from a javelin which Saul threw with the intention of\n pinning him to the wall. He then withdrew to his own house,\n where he was followed by men whom the king sent to despatch\n him. But they were amused and deceived by David\u2019s wife Mi-\n chal, Saul\u2019s own daughter, while her husband was let down\n from the window in a basket and made his escape to Samuel at\n Hamah. Repeated attempts to take him thence or slay him\n there, the last of which was made by the king, in person, were\n defeated by the special interposition of Providence. But Saul,\n brooding gloomily over his doom, still cherished his cruel pur-\n pose against him ; and on one occasion he even threw hiis jave-\n lin at Jonathan for speaking in favour of his absent friend. This\n being made known to David, he resolved, after a private inter-\n view and tender parting with Jonathan, to withdraw himself\n effectually from the designs upon his life by retiring to a foreign\n land. For this purpose he made choice of Gath, one of the five\n Philistine states. In this choice he was probably guided by the\n consideration that the Philistines, from their enmity to Saul,\n were less likely than any other neighbouring nation to give him\n up at the demand of the king.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The tabernacle had by this time been removed from Shi-\n loh to Nob, in the tribe of Benjamin ; and David, with his few\n followers, called there on his way, and procured from the high-\n priest, ^himelech, a supply of provisions and the only weapon\n in his possession, \u2014 the sword which David himself had taken\n from Goliah, and which had been laid up in the tabernaele as a\n trophy of that victory. This assistance David obtained under\n the unjustifiable pretence of being on a private mission from the\n king.

Saul followed him thither ; and was close upon him,\n when he was providentially called off to repel an unexpected\n incursion of the Philistines. Here, being one day weary, the\n king withdrew into a cave to take some rest. In the provi-\u2019\n dence of God, it happened that this was the very cave in whose\n interior recesses David and his men lay concealed ; and whilst\n Saul slept, David advanced softly and cut off the skirt of his robe.\n When the king went out of the cave, David followed him at\n some distance, and at length called to him, and displayed the\n skirt in evidence of his innocence. Saul could not but feel that\n the man who had taken the skirt could quite as easily have\n taken his life ; and struck by this magnanimity, his stern heart\n war for the time subdued. \u201c Is that thy voice, my son David ? ,;\n he cried, and then he wept. He acknowledged that he had\n been foolish and criminal ; he admitted that the son of Jesse was\n worthy of the destinies which awaited him; and he exacted from\n him a promise, that when he became king he would not root out\n the family of his predecessor, as eastern kings were wont to do.\n Saul then withdrew: but David had too little confidence in his\n good resolutions to make any alteration in his own position.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The death of Samuel took place shortly after this, in the\n ninety-second year of his age. He appears to have retained his\n judicial authority, even after Saul became king: and he was\n much and deservedly lamented by the people before whom he\n had acted a public part from his very cradle, with equal credit\n to himself and benefit to his country. Soon afterwards, David\n retreated southward into the desert of Paran. The shepherds\n of southern Israel led their flocks into these distant pastures in\n the proper season; and the presence of David and his men, at\n this time, effectually protected them from the Bedouin tribes,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0092/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0092/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0092/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0092/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0092/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0092.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 568381}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"92\">\n<p>\n 84\n</p>\n<p>\n david\u2019s second flight to gath.

While at this place, David employed his men from\n time to time in expeditions against the Amalekites and other\n nations of the south ; and by the spoil thus acquired his men\n were greatly enriched. But, as these nations were friends and\n allies of the Philistines, he led Achish to believe that his ope-\n rations were directed against his own countrymen the Israelites,\n which gave the king of Gath great satisfaction, \u2014 in the belief\n that by thus making himself abhorred in Israel, he had rooted\n himself in the service of the Philistines. This duplicity, how-\n ever, soon brought its own punishment : for, when the Philistines\n were ready for the war against Saul, David found that no ground\n was left him on which he could decline the invitation of Achish,\n to go with him against Israel. He was only saved from his\n difficulty by the jealousy of the princes of the other Philistine\n states, who, justly suspecting the sincerity of his alleged enmity\n against his own people, compelled Achish to send him back to\n Ziklag. On his return, David found that the Amalekites had\n taken advantage of his absence to burn and pillage the place,\n and had carried away as captive ail the people, chiefly women\n and children, who had been left there. He immediately pur-\n sued after them, and having at length overtaken them, when\n they deemed themselves in safety, cut them in pieces, and not\n only recovered all that they had taken, but obtained a valuable\n prey, which they had collected in other places, and out of which\n he sent valuable gifts to his friends in Judah.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. Meanwhile the Philistine army continued its march into\n the land of Israel, and penetrated to the eastern part of the\n great battle-field of Esdraelon ; by which time Saul had form-\n ed an opposing camp on the mountains of Gilboa. When he\n beheld the vast force which the Philistine states had, by a\n mighty effort, brought into the field, dire misgiving as to the\n result arose in his mind; and now, at last, in this extremity, he\n sought counsel of God. But the Lord answered him not by any\n of (he usual means, \u2014 by dreams, by TJrim, or by prophets.\n Finding himself thus forsaken, he had recourse to a witch At\n Endor, not far from Gilboa, to whom he repaired by night in\n disguise, and conjured her to evoke the spirit of Samuel that he\n might ask counsel of him in this fearful emergency. Accord-\n ingly, an aged and mantled figure arose, which Saul took to be\n the ghost of Samuel, though whether it were really so or not\n has been much questioned. The king bowed himself reverent-\n ly, and told the reason for which he had called him from the\n dead. The figure, in reply, told him that God had taken the\n crown from his house, and given it to a worthier man ; that, on\n the next day, the Philistines would triumph (jver Israel ; and\n that he and his sons should be slain in the battle.

But he grie-\n vously misunderstood the character of David, who rent his\n clothes in bitter affliction, and ordered the Amalekite to be slain\n for laying his hands upon \u201c the Lord\u2019s anointed.\u201d David then\n poured forth his grief for Israel, for Saul, and for Jonathan, his\n friend, in one of the most beautiful elegiac odes to be found in\n any language.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0095/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0095/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0095/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0095/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0095/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0095.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 512694}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"95\">\n<p>\n 87\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER IV.

Saul being- dead, David inquired of God what course he\n should take, and was directed to repair to Hebron, the principal\n town in the tribe of Judah. At that place the men of Judah\n publicly anointed him as their king. But through the able\n management of Abner, a near relative of the late king, and the\n chief commander of his forces, the other tribes acknowledged\n Ishbosheth, the only surviving son of Saul, whose residence was\n fixed at Mahanaim, eastward of the Jordan. For two years no\n hostile acts took place between the two kingdoms ; but, at the\n end of that time, war was commenced by Abner, with the view\n of bringing Judah under obedience to the house of Saul. To\n oppose him David sent Joab, his sister\u2019s son, who, with his bro- ~\n thers Abishai and the swift-footed Asahel, had been amongst his\n most active and devoted followers in all his wanderings. The\n most remarkable action in this war took place at Gibeon, where\n the forces of Abner were defeated and put to flight. Abner be-\n ing closely pursued by Asahel, and having in vain entreated him\n to desist, smote him dead with his spear. At length a number\n of Benjaminites rallied under Abner, and faced the pursuers,\n when the opposing tribes came to a pa rley; and Joab, being\n persuaded by Abner to prevent the further effusion of kindred\n blood, drew off his forces, and went home. In most of the oth-\n er actions of this war David had the advantage, and his interest\n in the nation daily increased, while that of Ishbosheth declined.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. One so able and experienced as Abner could not but appre-\n ciate the final result ; and being stimulated by a personal dis-\n pute with Ishbosheth, he resolved to withdraw from him, and\n give to David that support by which the house of Saul was up-\n held. Having obtained authority from the other tribes to treat\n with David, he repaired to Hebron, and was there received and\n entertained with all honour and respect ; and after having con-\n ferred with the king, withdrew, with the intention of complet-\n ing the transaction.

He also burn-\n ed to avenge the death of his brother, which, indeed, the popu-\n lar ideas connected with \u201c blood-revenge,\u201d imposed upon him\n as a duty. He therefore despatched a messenger to recall Ab-\n ner, in the king\u2019s name, to Hebron. He met him at the gate\n of the town, and drawing him aside, as if to speak with him\n privately, treacherously stabbed him. This was likely to have\n the very worst effect upon the pending negociations. David, by\n the abhorrence he expressed at this cruel and treacherous deed,\n by his lamentations, and by a magnificent funeral, in which he\n appeared himself as a mourner, evidenced that he had no part\n in the murder; and of this the people were satisfied. But the\n influence of Joab with the soldiers was too great to allow the\n king, at that time, to inflict on him the punishment he deserved.\n The loss of Abner rendered the condition of Ishbosheth utterly\n hopeless ; and not long after, two of his officers, expecting great\n rewards from David, murdered him in his bed, and hastened\n with his head to Hebron. But no sooner had David heard their\n boastful confession, and seen the head of his rival, than, with\n great indignation, he condemned the assassins to an ignomini-\n ous death, for the crime by which they had hoped to win his\n favour.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The tribes now looked upon David as the man who had\n been specially nominated by the Divine Head of their theocracy,\n and as one whose military services in the time of Saul entitled\n him more than any living man to the distinction, unanimously\n offered him the crown. Having accepted the offer, with condi-\n tions annexed to it, David was, in the presence of the elders of\n all the tribes, anointed a second time at Hebron, and proclaimed\n king over all Israel. He* had then reigned seven and a half\n years as king of Judah only.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The resources of united Israel being now at his disposal,\n David turned his attention to such military enterprises as might\n consolidate and extend his empire. His first act was to gain\n possession of the fortress which was still held by the Jebusites\n in Mount Zion. This fortress being deemed impregnable, the\n attempt to take it was derided by the Jebusites. It was, how-\n ever, carried by storm, under the conduct of Joah, who was in\n consequence appointed captain-general of the forces of the whole\n kingdom, as he had been before of those of Judah. David then\n made Jerusalem the metropolis of his kingdom, and fixed his re-\n sidence upon Mount Zion. His success in accomplishing what\n for many ages had resisted all the efforts of the Israelites, seem-\n ed a most auspicious commencement of David\u2019s reign, and even\n attracted the attention of foreigners.

The Philistines regarded with apprehension the increasing\n prosperity of the Israelites; and to keep it in check, invaded\n the south with a large army. They had some success at first,\n David not being prepared to meet them in the field; but when\n he had collected his forces, he gave them battle, and discom-\n fited them so completely in two different engagements, that\n they were never again able to give any serious disturbance to\n Israel.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Having now a respite from war, David formed the design\n of removing to his new capital the ark of the covenant, which\n had so long remained in obscurity at Kirjath-jearim. A vast\n company of priests and Levites, chiefs and elders, from all parts\n of the land, attended at this important solemnity ; and nume-\n rous instruments of music sounded in harmony with the glad\n feelings of the people. But, through ignorance or inadvertence,\n the ark, which should ' have been borne by priests, was put upon\n a car drawn by oxen. On the way the animals stumbled, and\n Uzzah, the son of Abinadab, put forth his hand to support the\n tottering ark, for which he was struck dead upon the spot, none\n but priests being allowed to touch it on pain of death (Numb,\n iv. Jo). This threw a damp over the whole proceeding; and\n David, being afraid to take the ark farther, left it in the care of\n Obed-edom, a Levite, whose house was near at hand. This\n person experienced the Divine favour and blessing in a very re-\n markable manner, during the three months the ark remained\n under his roof. The news of this encouraged David to resume\n his original design, which he did with the more confidence, as\n he had taken care to acquaint himself with the prescribed ob-\n servances for the orderly removal of the ark. It was accord-\n ingly removed with great pomp and ceremony, and deposited in\n a tabernacle which David had provided for it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. About five years after, when the king was inhabiting his\n house of cedar, and God had given him rest from all his ene-\n mies, he meditated the design of building a temple in which\n the ark of God might be placed, instead of being deposited\n \u201c within curtains,\u201d or in a tent, as hitherto. This design was\n at first encouraged by the prophet Nathan ; but he was after-\n wards instructed to tell David that this work was less appro-\n priate for him, who had been a warrior from his youth, and had\n shed much blood, than for his son, who should enjoy in pros-\n perity and peace the rewards of his father\u2019s victories. Never-\n theless, the design itself was highly approved as a token of\n proper feelings ; and for this, and for his faithful .allegiance to\n the Supreme King of Israel, it was promised that the sceptre\n should be perpetuated in his family. To this was added an\n intimation \u2014 sufficiently intelligible to him, and which filled\n him with joy \u2014 that the long-promised Messiah, the Anointed of\n God, should be numbered among his descendants.

He\n divided the priests and Levites, who had become very numerous,\n into bands, and fixed a regular rotation of service. Music,\n instrumental and vocal, was also introduced by him into the\n sacred services. A great number of the sacred songs to be used\n in these services were composed by himself. These are to this\n day preserved to us in the Book of Psalms.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The next measures of David were calculated, if not de-\n signed, to give a peaceable and prosperous reign to his successor,\n by subduing or weakening all the neighbouring powers likely to\n disturb his repose. In successive campaigns he completed the\n reduction of the Philistines, and took possession of Gath and its\n towns, using them as barrier towns for Judah ; he utterly sub-\n dued the Moabites, and dismantled all their strongholds ; he\n cleared his eastern frontier to the Euphrates, and made the\n Syrians of Zobah and Damascus tributary, and brought the\n Edomites under the like subjection, after he had defeated them\n with great slaughter in the valley of Salt. From all these\n wars, which appear to have occupied about three years, he\n returned to Jerusalem with rich spoils, which he laid up for\n the use of the future temple. To the same use he applied the\n presents which he received from foreign kings, whose attention\n was drawn to his victories, and who deemed it expedient to\n propitiate so great a conqueror.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. The Scriptures describe David as \u201c a man after God\u2019s own\n heart.\u201d By this we are not to understand that David always\n acted rightly, or that God approved of all he did. Its meaning\n is, that, in his public capacity, as king of Israel, he acted in\n accordance with the true theory of the theocratical government ;\n was always alive to his dependence on the Supreme King ; took\n his own true place in the system, and aspired to no other ; and\n conducted all his undertakings with reference to the Supreme\n Will. He constantly calls himself \u201c the servant (or vassal) of\n Jehovah: and that, and no other, was the true place for the\n human king of Israel to fill. In thus limiting the description\n of David as \u201c a man after God\u2019s own heart,\u201d it is not necessary\n for us to vindicate all his acts, or to uphold him as an immacu-\n late character, which he was very far from being. The basis\n</p>\n<p>\n of his character, and the general tone of his conduct, was good,\n</p>\n<p>\n was better than we usually find among men. But the same\n ardent temperament which* sometimes betrayed his judgment\n in his public acts, led him into great errors and crimes ; it also\n made him the first to discover his lapse, and the last to forgive\n himself.

We find him engaged in a war with the Ammonites, in\n the 18th year of his reign, to avenge the insulting treatment\n which his ambassadors had received from their king. The\n conduct of this war David intrusted to Joab, and remained him-\n self at Jerusalem. There, while sauntering upon the roof of\n his palace, after the noon-day sleep which is usual in the East,\n he perceived a woman whose great beauty attracted his regard.\n She proved to be Bathsheba, the wife of Uriah, an officer of\n Canaanitish origin, then absent with the army besieging Kab-\n bah, the capital of Ammon. David sent for her, and, under the\n influence of criminal passion, became an adulterer. This first\n crime was followed by a greater ; for, to cover his own sin, and\n to save the woman from the doom of an adulteress, he sent for\n Uriah to Jerusalem. Having heard from him the particulars\n of the war which he pretended to require, the king dismissed\n him to his own home. But Uriah, considering that it ill be-\n came a soldier to seek his bed while his companions lay on the\n hard ground, under the canopy of heaven, exposed to all the\n attacks of the enemy, remained all night in the hall of the\n palace with the guards, and returned to the wars without hav-\n ing seen Bathsheba. This cost him his life ; for David, seeing\n no other way to prevent the consequences he apprehended,\n made him the bearer of an order to Joab to expose him to cer-\n tain death in some perilous enterprise against the enemy. He\n was obeyed by that unscrupulous general ; and when David\n heard that Uriah was dead, he sent for Bathsheba and made\n her his wife.

The prophet Nathan was sent to him, and by a fic-\n titious tale of oppression applicable to the case, (2 Sam. xii.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 \u2014 4,) so kindled the anger of David, that he not only sentenced\n the supposed offender to restore fourfold, according to the law,\n but condemned the criminal to death.

No sooner were the eyes of David thus opened, than he\n instantly confessed his crimes with great humility and contri-\n tion, and submitted himself to the chastisements of God. This\n \u2022becoming repentance averted the sentence of death from him-\n self, but it was transferred to th\u00a3 offspring of his crime, then\n newly born.

But it was already known to David, that\n Solomon, his eldest surviving son by Bathsheba (born in B. C.\n 1033), was destined by God to be his successor. The Lord, as\n we have already seen, reserved the right of appointing whom\n he pleased to the crown, although in the absence of any spe-\n cial appointment, it was supposed to descend in the ordinary\n course of succession. It is more than probable that this destin-\n ation of the crown of David was known to Absalom, and that\n the attempt to secure it in his father\u2019s lifetime was made with\n the design of averting his own exclusion. Had he been sure of\n succeeding when his father died, he would probably have wait-\n ed till then, for David was already old. At all events, he soon\n began to affect great state, and made much display of his chari-\n ots and guards, and appeared in public with a splendid retinue\n of fifty men. All this pomp the more enhanced the condescen-\n sion with which he behaved to the people, and the interest he\n took in the affairs of the suitors at the royal court. These acts\n of popularity, with his handsome person and engagingmanners,\n quite won the hearts of the undiscerning multitude ; and when\n at length he ventured to raise the standard of open rebellion,\n and to proclaim himself king, at Hebron, the people flocked to\n him in crowds, and David was nearly deserted, except by his\n guards and some faithful followers. Confounded at this intel-\n ligence, David abandoned Jerusalem in haste, to proceed to the\n country beyond Jordan, where the distance would allow him\n more time for collecting his resources and considering his course\n of action. Deeply humbled at what he .considered as the pun-\n ishment of God for his sins, David ascended the Mount of\n Olives, on the upper road to Jericho, as a mourner, weeping,\n barefoot, and with shrouded head.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. On his way David was deeply wounded by false intelli-\n gence of the ungrateful desertion of Mephibosheth, the son of\n Jonathan, whom, for his father\u2019s sake, he had treated with\n much kindness and distinction, and to whom he had restored\n the lands of Saul. These lands he now too hastily bestowed\n on the treacherous informant, Ziba, who had managed them for\n Mephibosheth. When he afterwards discovered his error, and\n found it was only his lameness which prevented the son of his\n friend from following him, Ziba\u2019s connections were too power-\n ful to allow him to revoke the grant entirely, and he directed\n that the land should be divided between them. Among the re-\n markable incidents of this mournful journey, was the abusive\n and insulting conduct of a man named Shimei, of the family\n of Saul, who manifested the most unseemly exultation at the\n forlorn condition of the king. Yet the chastened David would\n not allow his people to avenge this wrong.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4.

It was the advice of\n David\u2019s chief councillor, a Ahithophel, who was renowned in\n all Israel for his sagacity, and whose desertion to Absalom\n seemed one of the most serious of the king\u2019s disasters.

Meanwhile David fixed his residence at Mahanaim, be-\n yond Jordan, where Ishbosheth had formerly held his court.\n When Absalom heard where he was, he followed him across\n the river, with a powerful army, under the direction of his cou-\n sin Amasa. David and his general had not been idle, but had\n collected a force, which, although small in comparison, seemed\n to men who trusted in the righteousness of their cause, suffi-\n cient for the contest. David divided his force into three bat-\n talions, and entrusted the command to Joab, Abishai, andlttai;\n for the trrops refused to allow him to risk his own valuable life\n in the battle. Still feeling all a father\u2019s unreasoning love for\n his guilty son, the last words of David to his commanders\n charged them to respect the life of Absalom. This charge was\n but little regarded. The army of Absalom was defeated by the\n better disciplined troops of David, and the prince himself fled\n upon a swift mule ; but tis he passed under an oak, the long hair\n which he so carefully cherished became entangled in the pro-\n jecting boughs, from which he was left suspended. In this sit-\n uation he was found by Joab, who slew him on the spot. His\n death ended the war: the rebels dispersed, and went every\n man to his home. The king\u2019s joy at the victory was greatly\n damped by the news of his son\u2019s death. He shut himself in\n the chamber over the city gate ; and the returning warriors, who\n expected the reward of his presence and praise, heard only, as\n they entered, his loud and bitter lamentations for his lost Ab-\n salom.

He accordingly re-\n turned. This seems to have been a wrong step ; for the other\n tribes were offended that he had returned on the sole invitation\n of Judah, without their concurrence ; and at length the dissen-\n sion became so great, that the Israelites, as distinguished from\n the Judahites, refused to recognise the act or to acknowledge\n David as king ; and appointing one Sheba, of Benjamin, perhaps\n of Saul\u2019s family, for their leader, they raised the standard of re-\n volt, with the usual cry of civil war \u2014 \u201c To your tents, 0 Israel !\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. David, partly with the view of conciliating those who had\n followed Absalom, appointed Amasa his commander in chief, in\n place of Joab. Him he now ordered out in pursuit of Sheba;\n but as he failed to assemble the forces of Judah within the lim-\n ited time, David, who dreaded delay, sent out Abishai with the\n royal guards. With this force Joab went as a volunteer.* While\n they rested at Gibeon, Amasa came up with the force which he\n had at length got together. As he came on, Joab advanced to\n meet him ; and under the cover of a friendly salute, gave him\n a mortal stab, as he had formerly given Abner. Having thus\n treacherously removed his rival, and confiding in the attach-\n ment of the troops he had so often led to victory, he assumed\n the chief command, and the soldiers readily, perhaps gladly,\n followed their former general. The fact that they had to deal\n with so experienced a commander as Joab, appears to have\n helped to discourage the partisans of Sheba, who finding him-\n self abandoned by the greater part of his followers, as Joab\n approached, deemed it expedient to withdraw his few remain-\n ing adherents into the fortified town of Abel-beth-maachah, in\n Naphtali. But when Joab appeared under the walls, the in-\n habitants to save themselves, threw over to him the rebel\u2019s\n head; and the war being thus ended, Joab returned to Jerusa-\n lem. David detested his conduct, and was mortified at his pre-\n sumption ; but he dared not to call him to account for the mur-\n der of Amasa, or remove him from the place which he had as-\n sumed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. After these things a famine of three years afflicted the\n people : and as the principles of the theocracy, guaranteed to\n the Israelites prosperity and plenty as long as they continued in\n obedience, every public calamity was justly regarded as a pun-\n ishment for sin. David, therefore, somewhat tardily sought to\n know the cause of this famine. He was told that, although so\n long after the event, it was a punishment for innocent blood\n which had been left unatoned, namely, the blood of the Gib-\n eonites whose safety Israel had guaranteed by a covenant of\n peace ; but who had been massacred by Saul, on some pretext\n</p>\n<p>\n * As these persons were all related to the king, it may be well to define\n the relationship. David had two sisters , Zeruiah and Abigail. Zeruiah was *\n the mother of Joab, Abishai, and Asahel .(whom Abner slew); and Abi-\n gail was the mother of Amasa.

They therefore\n renewed the war, but were defeated in four engagements, and\n finally subdued. Among the Philistines were some families of\n gigantic stature, and in this campaign they brought several of\n G-oliah\u2019s family into the field. One of them had nearly over-\n powered David ; but he was rescued, and the giant killed by\n Abishai. After this the people would never allow David to go\n to the wars in person, \u201clest he should quench the light of\n Israel.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. The next year David, that he might know the real extent\n of his power, and that all competent Israelites should be enrolled\n for military service, ordered Joab to take a census of the adult\n male population. The schemes of enlarged dominion, with a\n view to which this census was probably ordered to be taken,\n were contrary to that divine policy which required Israel to re-\n main a compact and isolated people ; and the enrolment for such\n purposes seriously infringed the liberties of the nation. It also\n manifested great distrust of the Supreme King, who was known\n to be willing and able to give victory in every lawful enterprise,\n whether by many or by few. On these grounds the act was\n displeasing to God ; and it was distasteful even to Joab, who,\n after a vain remonstrance, proceeded to execute the order with\n great reluctance. The return which he made of men twenty\n years old and upwards, was 900,000 in the tribes of Israel, and\n 400,000 in Judah alone \u2014 amounting mail to 1,300,000. By this\n we see that the population had more than doubled since the\n nation left Egypt and entered Palestine. The total numbers\n may be reckoned at considerably more than 5,000,000.

At that moment the prophet Gad came commis-\n sioned to offer him the choice of three punishments: seven\n years of famine \u2014 three months of defeat and loss in war \u2014 or\n three days of pestilence. He chose the last ; and immediately\n the country was visited with a pestilence which in two days\n destroyed 70,000 men. David then vehemently interceded for\n his people, pleading that he alone had sinned, and praying that\n he and his might alone bear the punishment. His intercession\n prevailed, and the plague was stayed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. The eldest surviving son of David was Adonijah, who\n resembled Absalom in comeliness and ambition. Provoked at\n the prospect of his younger brother Solomon being considered\n heir to the throne, he plotted to secure the throne before the\n king\u2019s death, which his old age and feebleness showed to be\n near at hand. He gained over Joab and Abiathar the high-\n priest to his cause ; but the other high-priest,* Zadok, with the\n valiant Benaiah, the commander of the guards, and the great\n body of the \u201c worthies,\u201d remained faithful to the cause of Solo-\n mon, and thereby evinced their adherence to the great principle\n of the government, \u2014 the supremacy of the Divine King, and his\n right to bestow the crown according to his pleasure. Having\n taken all the preliminary measures which seemed necessary,\n Adonijah invited his supporters to a splendid feast in one of the\n suburbs of Jerusalem, near the fountain of the king\u2019s garden.\n Here he was proclaimed king, with great acclamation by his\n adherents. The news speedily reached the city, and was com-\n municated to the king by Bathsheba and the prophet Nathan.\n Now Adonijah was very dear to the heart of David ; and it is\n more than likely that, if left to his own feelings, he would have\n been willing that his eldest son should reign. But he was too\n much alive to the principle of the government to consider that\n he had any will in the majter, after the will of the Lord had\n been declared. He therefore immediately issued orders to Za-\n dok the priest, and to the officers of the court and army, to take\n Solomon, and anoint and proclaim him king. The prince was\n immediately mounted upon the king\u2019s own mule, and escorted\n by all the court and the royal guards to the fountain of Gihon,\n where he was anointed by Zadok with the sacred oil ; when\n the trumpets sounded, and the assembled concourse rent the air\n with shouts of \u201c Long live King Solomon !\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. When Adonijah and his party heard of this prompt and\n decided procedure, they were struck with fear, and dispersed to\n their own homes. Adonijah himself fled to the altar, which\n was a sanctuary from which none but murderers could be taken.\n</p>\n<p>\n * Abiathar will be remembered as the son of Ahimelech, who fled to\n David after the massacre at Nob. He naturally succeeded as high priest ;\n but Saul gave that dignity to Zadok, lhereby restoring the pontificate to\n the older line of Eleazar. When David succeeded to both kingdoms, he\n was unwilling to remove either, and therefore gave them co-ordinate\n powers.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0106/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0106/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0106/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0106/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0106/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0106.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 491969}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"106\">\n<p>\n 98\n</p>\n<p>\n i)AVID t)IESi\n</p>\n<p>\n [b. c. 1015.\n</p>\n<p>\n Hearing of this, Solomon sent to tell him that his safety depend-\n ed upon his future conduct, and directed him to retire to his own\n house.

He had not long ascended the throne\n when his sagacity detected the secret traitorous design which\n Adonijah still entertained. This prince had the adroitness to\n interest Bathsheba, the king\u2019s mother, in a scheme which he\n had formed of espousing Abishag, one of the wives of the late\n king, whom Ije had taken in his latter days. No sooner was\n this named by Bathsheba to Solomon, than he recognized in\n the insidious demand a plan formed by Adonijah to accredit his\n old pretensions; and as this was a breach of the conditions on\n which his life had been spared, he ordered him to be slain.\n Abiathar appears to have had some part in this intrigue; on\n which account, as well as for his first defection, he was depos-\n ed from the joint high priesthood to the ra nk of a common\n priest, and ordered to withdraw to his town of Anathoth. \u2014\n With some other persons, Solomon dealt according to the last\n instructions which his father had given him.

But the altar was allowed to be no refuge\n to so old a murderer: he was torn thence, and put to the sword\n by order of the king. This was an act of astonishing vigour\n for so young a ruler, when we consider the influence of joab\n with the army, which had secured him complete impunity in\n the time of David The valiant Benaiah was appointed captain-\n general in his stead; and Zadok remained the sole high-priest\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Solomon was not unmindful of Shimei, the Benjamite\n who had cursed David and pelted him with stones when he\n fled from Absalom.

He or-\n dered him to fix his residence in Jerusalem, and not to leave it\n on any occasion on pain of death.

The principal high place\n was at Gideon ; and at one of the religious festivals Solomon\n proceeded thither, in solemn pomp, with all his court, the offi-\n cers of the state and army, and the chiefs and elders of the\n people, to render his homage to Jehovah, and to offer sacrifices\n to him. With this homage and with these sacrifices God was\n well pleased ; and the night following he manifested himself to\n Solomon in a dream, and offered to bestow upon him whatever\n blessing he might choose. The young king evinced the wis-\n dom he already possessed, by asking an understanding heart to\n enable him to discharge the awful responsibilities that rested\n on him, in governing the numerous people and the various in-\n terests under his sway. Because he had made so excellent a\n choice from among all the gifts which the Lord of the Universe\n had to bestow, not only was surpassing wisdom given to him,\n but \u2014 what he had not asked \u2014 glory, and riches, and length ol\n days, were added to the gift. His extraordinary sagacity was\n early shown in his judicial decisions, one example of which is\n given in the celebrated case of the two women living together,\n each of whom had a child. One of the children died in the\n night, and the living child was claimed by both the mothers,\n with equal apparent truth and zeal. When the case came be-\n fore the kiDg, he saw there was no way of discovering the real\n mother of the living child, but by an appeal to the truthfulness\n of maternal affection, and he therefore ordered the living child\n to be cut in two and one half given to each. The earnestness\n with which one of the women entreated that the life of the child\n might be spared, at once discovered the real mother.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Solomon had a great taste for magnificence, which he dis-\n played in many ways. In the State, he introduced a most skil-\n ful organization of all its departments, which were severally\n entrusted to men whose abilities had been tried in the time of\n David ; and the splendour and beautiful order of every depart-\n ment in the court claimed admiration, But the inordinate\n magnificence and extent of all the regal establishments may be\n justly blamed, when we learn tha*t the expenses were too great\n for even his large resources ; so that at length the royal profu-\n sion could only be supported by such oppressive exactions upon\n the people, as in the next reign led to the division of his domin-\n ion into two kingdoms. Some idea of this extravagant magni-\n ficence may be formed from the fact that he had 4000 stalls or\n stables for the horses of his various carriages. The provisions\n required by the court for one day, amounted^ to thirty bushels of\n fine flour, sixty bushels of common flour, ten fat oxen, twenty\n oxen from the pastures, and a hundred sheep, besides venison\n and poultry of all descriptions.

It is said that Solomon\u2019s wisdom greatly exceeded that of\n the wisest men, Jewish or foreign, of his own day ; there were\n none equal to him among the people of the east or the Egyp-\n tians, who were justly famous for their knowledge of every use-\n ful science. Three thousand proverbs, many of which remain\n to us, embodied his moral sayings and sage remarks on human\n character. A thousand and live songs, of which only the Canti-\n cles and 127th Psal m remain, ranked him among the first of\n Hebrew poets ; and his perfect knowledge of all kinds of plants,\n beasts, birds, and fishes, was shown by writings, which are\n supposed to have been lost in the Babylonian captivity.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. An embassy of condolence and congratulation from Hiram\n king of Tyre, kept open the friendly relations with that king,\n which David had cultivated. It also led to an arrangement\n under which the king of Tyre engaged to bring from Lebanon,\n and land at the port of Joppa, the timber which Solomon re-\n quired for the building of the temple. For this he was to pay\n in corn and oil ; for the Tyrians having only a small tract of\n territory, and being chiefly employed in commerce and manufac-\n tures, obtained their provisions chiefly from the fertile lands of\n Canaan. In return for this, in the ordinary course of traffic, the\n Israelites received the manufactures of the Phoenicians and the\n products of foreign lands. The timber, when landed at Joppa,\n was conveyed by the Tyrians to Jerusalem ; and they also as-\n sisted in preparing the stones for the building. Three years\n were spent in these preparations ; and in the fourth year, the\n foundation of the temple was laid, and in seven years the fabric\n was completed (B. C. 1005.) The temple appears to have been\n a truly splendid structure, and great wealth was consumed in\n its various utensils of precious metal, the whole of which were\n executed by Phoenician artists supplied by Hiram. From the\n connexion of Solomon with Egypt, it is also probable that he\n availed himself of the talent which, in every branch of art, that\n country abundantly supplied. To foreigners certainly much of\n the beauty and perfection of the celebrated temple was owing;\n for the Israelites being chiefly an agricultural people, had but\n little skill in those arts of design and ornament which the un-\n dertakings of Solomon required. The general plan of the temple\n seems to have much resembled that of the tabernacle ; being\n composed of extensive courts for worship and sacrifice in the\n open air, in front of an oblong building comparatively of small\n dimensions, but in all its parts rich and elaborate beyond de-\n scription. This was not, like our churches, for the use of the\n worshippers. It w.as never entered by them ; but was the abode\n of the Divine symt & ls, which were the same as in the taberna-\n cle ; the ark with its hovering cherubim, and the Shechinah, or\n radiant symbol of the Divine presence, being within the interior\n or most sacred of the two apartments into which the building\n was divided,\n</p>\n<p>\n 8- A high feast was held on the day when the temple was\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0111/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0111/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0111/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0111/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0111/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0111.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 543023}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"111\">\n<p>\n WEALTH OF SOLOMON.\n</p>\n<p>\n 103\n</p>\n<p>\n B. c. 1005.]\n</p>\n<p>\n dedicated to its destined purpose, and when the sacred services\n commenced.

The remainder of king Solomon\u2019s reign is a history rather\n of peaceful undertakings than of warlike exploits. He built a\n number of splendid palaces, with pleasure grounds, and basins\n of water. Of these the most celebrated was \u201c the house of the\n forest of Lebanon,\u201d all the plate and furniture of which seems\n to have been of pure gold, while in the hall hung two hundred\n</p>\n<p>\n f olden bucklers, each of which must have been worth fifteen\n undred pounds, and three hundred smaller ones, each worth\n half the former. There also was the royal hall of audience and\n of judgment, where the king sat publicly upon a lofty throne of\n ivory and gold. Many cities were built, others rebuilt, and\n others fortified by Solomon. Of the former the most celebrated\n was Tadmor in the eastern wilderness (B. C. 991,) better known\n by its later name of Palmyra, whose splendid rums excite to this\n day the admiration and wonder of travellers. These, however,\n are not the ruins of Solomon\u2019s buildings, but of others erected in\n after ages on the same site.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. The king also engaged in maritime and inland com-\n merce. Being possessed of Eziongeber, a port on the Red Sea,\n which opens into the Indian Ocean, he united with king Hiram\n in sending ships into the eastern seas, which, after an absence\n of three years, returned laden with the valuable products of dis-\n tant climes, \u2014 gold, silver, ivory, beautiful and costly woods, and\n precious stones ; gums, spices, and perfumes ; and collections of\n curious plants, animals, and birds, which must have ministered\n much delight to the scientific mind of Solomon, He also car-\n ried on a great trade in the fine linens, the yarn, the horses,\n and the chariots of the Egyptians ; which he bought by his fac-\n tors of the Egyptians, and sold at an enhanced price to the\n Syrian nations. From these sources, and from the tribute of\n the subject nations, vast treasure came into the royal coffers.\n We are told that the commercial voyages alone brought, in one\n year, no less than 666 talents of gold, which some compute at\n \u00a33,646,350 sterling. As for silver, it was of no account in his\n days ; and the previously costly wood of the cedar became as\n common as that of sycamore had been. But most of this pros-\n perity was rather the result of a temporary excitement, than of\n a regular developement of the national resources. Even the\n commercial enterprises were monopolies of the crown ; and the\n greater part of the wealth arising from all sources went into\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0112/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0112/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0112/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0112/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0112/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0112.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 556191}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"112\">\n<p>\n 104\n</p>\n<p>\n SOLOMON SEDUCED TO IDOLATRY.

It is true,\n however, that, taking his reign in the whole, the nation was\n prosperous, as the long continued peace enabled the population\n to increase without check, while every man could attend to his\n lands without distraction.

The vast knowledge of Solomon, his profound sagacity,\n and the order and splendour of his court, attracted many foreign\n princes to Jerusalem. The most celebrated of these visitors\n was the queen of Sheba, supposed by some to have come from\n southern Arabia, but who is more generally thought to have\n been the queen of Abyssinia, which is the firm belief of the\n Abyssinians themselves to this day. The distance from which\n she came, the costly gifts which she brought, and her splendid\n train, excited much admiration. The king satisfactorily solved\n the \u201c hard questions\u2019\u2019 by which she tried his wisdom ; and all\n that she heard and saw led her to confess that the reality great-\n ly exceeded the scarcely credible rumours which had reached\n her distant land.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. Unfortunately, that vain and costly appendage of royal\n state in the east, a large seraglio of women, was deemed by\n Solomon necessary to his magnificence. He had no fewer than\n 700 wives of high family, and 300 secondary or concubine wives.\n Many of these were foreigners and idolaters from the neigh-\n bouring nations ; and they, in his latter days, drew him astray,\n not only to participate in their acts of homage to their native\n idols, but to build temples to their honour and for their worship,\n on the hills facing Jerusalem, and in front of the Lord\u2019s own\n temple. Here he joined in sacrifices to Chemosh or Peor, the\n obscene idol of the Moabites, to Moloch the god of the Ammon-\n ites, and to Ashtaroth the goddess of the Sidonians. These do-\n ings greatly provoked the Divine indignation. The splendid\n endowments of Solomon served the more to aggravate his of-\n fence : and at length it was solemnly announced to him, that\n since he had broken the covenant by which he held his crown\n from the Divine King, the kingdom should be rent from him,\n and given to his servant. Nevertheless it was added, that, for\n David\u2019s sake, this should not be done in his time, but in the\n time of his son ; and that, also for the sake of David, one tribe,\n that of Judah (with which Benjamin had now coalesced), should\n remain under the dominion of his house.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13.

The prophet accompanied the\n message by the significant act of rending his own new garment\n into twelve pieces, ten of which he gave to Jeroboam, and re-\n served only two for the house of David. It was then announced\n that the dominion over the ten tribes was given to him ; and\n that it should be confirmed to his descendants, if he and they\n maintained their allegiance to the Divine King. This soon\n came to the knowledge of Solomon, whose attempts to destroy\n the destined rival of his son, taught Jeroboam the prudence of\n leaving the country. He retired into Egypt, where he was well\n received by the king, Shishak, and protected by him till the\n death of Solomon. The repose of the king\u2019s latter days was\n also disturbed by the revolt of the Edomites and the Syrians of\n Damascus. There is reason to hope, that these just punish-\n ments opened the eyes of Solomon to the enormity of his offen-\n ces, and that his last days were repentant.

The tribes were now determined to relieve themselves\n from the burdens which, in the later years of his reign, had\n been imposed upon them by Solomon. They therefore recalled\n Jeroboam from Egypt ; and, with him at their head, applied to\n Rehoboam for redress of the grievances under which they had\n laboured. It is evident that the ten tribes were predisposed to\n separate themselves from Judah, and establish an independent\n government. Their sentiments were influenced chiefly by those\n of Ephraim, which proud and powerful tribe could not brook\n that the sovereignty should be in the great rival tribe of Judah.\n They were, therefore, in all probability, rather glad than sorry\n when a rough refusal of redress from Rehoboam gave them a\n reasonable pretext for revolt, and for abandoning their alle-\n giance to the house of David. Accordingly, they revolted, and\n made Jeroboam their King.\n</p>\n<p>\n 16. As this separation was in accordance with the intentions\n of the Divine King, to punish the house of David for the guilt\n of Solomon, the Sacred Oracle forbade Rehoboam to pursue the\n design which he had formed of reducing the revolted tribes to\n obedience by force of arms.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0114/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0114/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0114/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0114/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0114/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0114.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 496609}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"114\">\n<p>\n 106\n</p>\n<p>\n BOOK V.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER I.

Al-\n though the kingdoms were separated, there was but one tem-\n ple and one altar, one ecclesiastical establishment, for both.\n To the place of the temple and altar all the Israelites were, by\n the law, obliged to repair three times every year, and that\n place was Jerusalem, the metropolis of the rival kingdom.\n Fearing that this might ultimately lead to the re-union of the\n tribes, and to the extinction of his separate kingdom, Jeroboam\n most presumptuously and wickedly dared to abrogate the unity\n of the nation (which might still have been maintained under\n two kingdoms), by forbidding his subjects to repair to Jerusa-\n lem, to render their homage to the Divine King. He alleged\n that the distance made the journey burdensome to them: and,\n therefore, he established two places, towards the opposite ex-\n tremities of his own kingdom, to which they might repair.\n These were Bethel in the south, and Dan in the north. Hav-\n ing himself resided in Egypt, and recollecting the readiness\n with which the Israelites had, in the wilderness, set up a fi-\n gure of the Egyptian ox-god (Mnevis) as the symbol of the\n true God, he now reverted to that superstition, and set up\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0115/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0115/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0115/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0115/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0115/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0115.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 546485}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"115\">\n<p>\n NADAB.\n</p>\n<p>\n 107\n</p>\n<p>\n b. c. 954*.]\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c golden calves\u201d at Dan and Bethel, as objects of religious ser-\n vice and homage.

To their very great honour, no priests or Levites could be\n found who would connect themselves with this abomination.\n After a vain attempt to stem the evil, the Levites abandoned\n their cities, and removed into the kingdom of Judah. The\n priests were already there, for their towns were all in the ter-\n ritories of Judah. Jeroboam could not induce any respectable\n persons to arrogate the priestly office, and, therefore, the low-\n est and most unprincipled of the people became the fitting\n priests of the golden calves. As to the high-priesthood, he took\n that office to himself, according to the practice in Egypt and\n other countries, where the sovereign was also supreme pontiff.\n As such, he officiated at high festivals, one of which, the Feast\n of Tabernacles, he presumed to change from the seventh to\n the eighth month. These innovations were so shocking to\n every mind well imbued with the principles of the theocracy\n and the true religion, that, by degrees, a large proportion of the\n most valuable men in Israel removed into the sister kingdom.\n By this and other accessions, the kingdom of Judah soon be-\n came, in real strength and power, less unequal to that of Is-\n rael, than the proportion between two and ten tribes would\n seem to indicate. Indeed Judah was already a formed king-\n dom, with well-organized resources and establishments, and\n with much treasure ; so that the balance of power may be\n deemed to have inclined in its favour.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Jeroboam was not allowed to remain long unwarned. He\n was officiating as high-priest at Bethel, at his feast of taber-\n nacles, when a prophet appeared and foretold that a future\n king of Judah, Josiah by name, should profane and destroy\n that very altar at which he was burning incense. The pow-\n er by which the prophet spoke was evinced by the instant\n withering of the hand which the king stretched forth to lay\n hold on the prophet ; and not less by its being instantly re-\n stored at that prophet\u2019s prayer. This, however, had no abid-\n ing effect upon Jeroboam ; he persisted in his evil ways, and at\n length brought ruin upon his house. This doom was announ-\n ced to his wife by the prophet who had anointed him for the\n kingdom. Ahijah was now blind with age ; but when the\n queen, disguised, went to consult him about a beloved son who\n was dangerously ill, he knew her, and not only told her that\n the child should die, but that the dynasty of Jeroboam should\n soon be extinguished ; and that the Israelites for their iniqui-\n ties, should, in the end, be carried away as captives beyond the\n Euphrates. After a reign of twenty-two years Jeroboam died\n (B. C. 954), and was succeeded by his son Nadab, in the second\n year of Asa, king of Judah.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0116/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0116/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0116/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0116/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0116/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0116.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 476968}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"116\">\n<p>\n 108\n</p>\n<p>\n OMRI DIES.\n</p>\n<p>\n [b. c. 918 .\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.

In Judah, the conduct of Rehoboam was without reproach\n during the three first years of his reign. After that, he, and his\n subjects with him, fell into the same gross idolatry and abomi-\n nable practices, which had proved the ruin of the Canaanites.\n To punish them for this apostacy, God allowed an invasion of\n the land by Shishak king of Egypt, (B. C. 970,) who took some\n of the fortified towns, entered Jerusalem, and carried off the\n treasures of the temple and the palace. As this produced re-\n pentance, the remainder of the reign was prosperous. Reho-\n boam reigned seventeen years.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Abijah, the son of Rehoboam by a grand-daughter of Ab-\n salom, succeeded his father. He was an active and martial\n prince, and determined to endeavour, by force of arms, to bring\n back the ten tribes to obedience. He raised a large army for\n that service ; and was met by Jeroboam with an army twice as\n large. Before the battle, Abijah harangued the opposing force\n from Mount Zemaraim. He asserted the indefeasible right of\n the house of David to reign over all the tribes ; he alleged that,\n in the revolt, undue advantage had been taken of Reboboam\u2019s\n inexperience ; and he gathered confidence of success from the\n adherence of Judah to the theocratical institutions, which Israel\n had so heinously forsaken. This reliance gained him the vic-\n tory. Jeroboam lost two-thirds of his immense army, and never\n recovered the strength he then lost. Abijah was thus enabled\n to advance his frontier, by taking from Israel several border\n towns, among which we find the name of Bethel, where was\n one of the golden calves. We are not, however, told that he\n destroyed that idol ; and it would appear that the town itself was\n ultimately recovered by Israel ; perhaps on the death of Abijah,\n Which soon followed, after a short reign of three years.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0118/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0118/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0118/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0118/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0118/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0118.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 590531}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"118\">\n<p>\n 110\n</p>\n<p>\n ASA.\n</p>\n<p>\n [b. c. 955 .\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Asa, who then ascended the throne, was a prince of great\n piety and virtue. He ruled quietly for ten years, which he em-\n ployed in the reformation of the abuses of former reigns. He\n destroyed all idols and their altars, and employed all the means\n in his power to restore the pure worship of God, and re-establish\n the principles of the theocratical government. His own adhe-\n sion to these principles, which required implicit confidence in\n the Divine King, was severely tried by an invasion of the coun-\n try by a vast host of the Cushites (called Ethiopians), under\n Zerah, their king (B. C. 941). Strong in the confidence that it\n was equally in the Lord\u2019s power to give the victory with few as\n with many, the pious Asa advanced with a comparatively small\n force to his southern frontier, to meet this immense horde. In\n that confidence, the Cushites were totally overthrown before\n him, and the victory gave him the abundant spoil and numerous\n cattle of this pastoral horde. This repulsion of a torrent which\n had threatened to overwhelm all the neighbouring states, and\n which must have been regarded with general apprehension,\n could not but enhance his credit in the adjoining countries.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Five following years of profound peace he employed, under\n the advice of the prophet Azariah, in pursuing his reformations\n with a still more vigorous and less sparing hand. Even his own\n grandmother, the guardian of his youth, was banished from\n court on account of her idolatries. These reforms put the king-\n dom in such advantageous contrast with that of Israel, that the\n well-disposed subjects of that kingdom removed in great num-\n bers into Judah. Alarmed at this, Baasha of Israel, took the\n measures which have been already mentioned to check the com-\n munication between the two kingdoms. The conduct of Asa,\n in hiring the Syrians with the gold of the temple, to make a\n diversion in his favour, did not become his character, nor evince\n that confidence in the Great King which he had on more trying\n occasions exemplified. He also imprisoned the prophet Hanani,\n who reproved him for his conduct on this occasion. His latter\n years were also stained by several acts of oppression ; and when\n afflicted with a grievous disease in the feet, he manifested more\n confidence in his physicians, and less in God, than was con-\n sidered becoming. He died after a reign of forty-one years, and\n was honoured by his subjects with a magnificent funeral ; for\n the Jews, like other Orientals, were in the habit of making\n known, by funeral testimonials, the estimation in which they\n held their deceased kings.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The excellent father was succeeded by the still more ex-\n cellent son Jehoshaphat. The first act of his reign was to re-\n move the high places and the groves, which Asa had left un-\n touched. Then, becoming convinced that the most effectual\n means of preventing the return of the corruptions which had\n with so much difficulty been rooted out, was to provide for the\n suitable instruction of the people, in the third year of his reign,\n he sent out, through all the cities of Judah, a number of chiefs or\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0119/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0119/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0119/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0119/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0119/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0119.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 553761}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"119\">\n<p>\n JEHOSHAPHAT.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ill\n</p>\n<p>\n B. c. 914.]\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c princes,\u201d whose rank and influence secured respect and atten-\n tion to the priests and Levites who, with them, were to instruct\n the people in the law of Moses.

In consequence of this con-\n nection a friendly intercourse was established between the two\n kings ; and on a visit paid by Jehoshaphat to the court of Ahab,\n he allowed himself to be persuaded to accompany him in an ex-\n pedition to recover Ramoth-Gilead from the Syrians. In that\n action Ahab was killed, and Jehoshaphat narrowly escaped with\n his life to Jerusalem. On his arrival he was severely reproved\n by the prophet Jehu for so injurious and improper a connection.\n The king testified his repentance in the best possible way by pro-\n secuting his reformations with renewed vigour. A personal\n tour through the kingdom evinced the sincerity of his endeavour\n to bring his subjects into a right state of feeling towards the God\n of their fathers. In this tour the king discovered many abuses\n and irregularities in the administration of justice ; and he there-\n fore established local courts in every important town, with a\n right of appeal to the superior courts at Jerusalem. To all these\n courts competent judges were appointed ; and they were dis-\n missed to their duties with a plain and forcible charge from the\n king.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8.

Omri was succeeded by his son Ahab, the events of whose\n reign are related at greater length than those of any other king\n of Israel. His reign was for the most part contemporary with\n that of Jehoshaphat in Judah. In both their public and private\n character there never was a greater contrast than between these\n two kings. We have seen how zealously Jehoshaphat laboured\n to restore and establish the knowledge and the worship of the\n true God among his people But Ahab exceeded all former\n kings in his abominations. His predecessors had been content\n to make religion an implement of human policy, by the unwar-\n rantable worship of God, under the profane symbol of the gold-\n en calves ; but Ahab betook himself to the worship of foreign\n</p>\n<p>\n f ods instead of the God of Israel. The preference appears to\n ave been given to Baal, the great sun-god of the Phoenicians ;\n which is to be ascribed to the influence of Ahab\u2019s wife Jezebel,\n who was a daughter of Ethbaal, king of Tyre, \u2014 an unscrupu-\n lous and wicked woman, who was very zealous for her national\n idol. She soon procured his worship to be established in the\n land of Israel ; and as the religious sentiments of the people\n had been corrupted by the worship of the golden calves, it is\n not wonderful that they very readily transferred their homage\n to an idolatry pleasant to the natural depravity of man. Jeho-\n vah was not formally rejected or abandoned ; but Baal received\n at least equal worship from the multitude, and greater from the\n court.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. To stem the tide of corruption, and to prevent the total\n apostacy of Israel, God raised up a man endued with extraor-\n dinary gifts and powers, ardent zeal, and stern virtues, such as\n the time required. This was Elijah, the Tishbite,* by far the\n greatest prophet, both in word and deed, which had appeared\n since Moses. He is introduced abruptly, as boldly announcing\n to Ahab in person the national punishment of a long drought,\n and consequent scarcity, not to be removed but by his own inter-\n</p>\n<p>\n * So called from his native place, which was probably Thebez, a town\n of Manasseh beyond Jordan.\n</p>\n<p>\n K*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0122/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0122/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0122/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0122/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0122/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0122.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 558584}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"122\">\n<p>\n 114\n</p>\n<p>\n ELIJAH.\n</p>\n<p>\n [b. c. 906.\n</p>\n<p>\n cession. This last condition made it necessary for the prophet\n to withdraw himself from the presence and solicitations of the\n king. When, therefore, the drought began to be felt, in the\n eighth year of Ahab\u2019s reign, Elijah retired beyond the Jordan,\n and concealed himself by the brook Cherith, where Providence\n directed ravens to furnish him with regular supplies of bread\n and meat, morning and evening. When the brook was dried\n up for want of rain, the prophet crossed the country to Sarepta,\n a town in the kingdom of Jezebel\u2019s father, to which also the\n drought and famine had extended. He remained at this place\n two years, lodging with a poor widow and her son ; and during\n all that time of famine, they were supported through the miracu-\n lous inexhaustion of a handful of flour and a little oil, the only re-\n maining food of the poor woman when the prophet met with her.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Three years had Elijah remained in obscurity \u2014 one year\n by the brook Cherith, and two in Sarepta. During this time\n Israel suffered greatly ; and Ahab had sought for the prophet\n in every quarter, convinced that the remedy was in his hands.\n God, intending now to give rain, and to remove the famine, or-\n dered the prophet to return to Israel. On the way, he met Oba-\n diah, one of the king\u2019s household, who had been sent out to\n seek forage for the cattle. This person, at the risk of his own\n life, had sheltered many holy persons in a cave, and supplied\n them with victuals, during a recent persecution by Jezebel.\n Elijah sent Obadiah back to announce his re-appearance to\n Ahab, who then came out to meet him. When the king saw\n him, he said, \u201c Art thou he who troubleth Israel ?\u201d But the\n prophet sternly retorted the charge, alleging that the apostacy\n of himself and his people was the cause of the national suffer-\n ing. He further required the king to convene a general assem-\n bly of his priests and people at Carmel.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. In that great assembly there were no fewer than 450 priests\n of Baal. Elijah proposed that these priests should call upon\n Baal, and that he should call upon the name of Jehovah, and\n that the Deity who should make it appear that he had heard\n their prayers, by consuming with fire from heaven the sacrifices\n to be offered, should be acknowledged as the true God. It was\n impossible for the priests of Baal to decline so fair a trial, espe-\n cially as fire was the congenial element of the god they wor-\n shipped. Accordingly, they prepared their altar, and laid out\n upon it their sacrifices, and continued, with frantic invocations,\n to ask the required sign, until above half the day was spent ;\n but no sign in heaven or earth answered to their cry. Then\n Elijah rose, and after some biting ridicule of the impotent god\n and his votaries, proceeded to repair an old altar, which had\n formerly been erected there. Upon this he placed his sacrifices,\n and called solemnly upon the God of Israel to manifest his pow-\n er. He was instantly answered by fire from heaven, \u2014 so in-\n tense, that it consumed not only the victims and the wood, but\n the very stones and dust of the place, and absorbed the water\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0123/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0123/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0123/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0123/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0123/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0123.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 634522}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"123\">\n<p>\n ELIJAH.\n</p>\n<p>\n 115\n</p>\n<p>\n Mount Sinai, or Horeb.\n</p>\n<p>\n had been originally delivered, the Lord manifested himself to\n</p>\n<p>\n his servant, not in the whirlwind, the earthquake, or the fire\n</p>\n<p>\n but in \u201c a still small voice,\u201d which spoke comfort to his own\n desolate soul, and encouraged him by the assurance, that where-\n as he deemed that he was himself the only worshipper of God\n left in Israel, there were indeed seven thousand who had not\n bowed the knee to Baal.

The kingdom was too much exhausted by the\n recent famine to allow Ahab to make any effectual resistance.\n But although he was unworthy of any help, yet God, for the\n glory of his own great name, sent a prophet to promise him\n victory, and to instruct him how to act.

To correct so\n dishonouring a notion of his power, God again gave the victory\n to Ahab. But instead of following up this success, Ahab con-\n cluded a league of amity with Benhadad, which was so dis-\n pleasing to God, that, a prophet was sent to announce the evils\n which would befall his house through the neglect of this oppor-\n tunity of breaking the Syrian power.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.

For his great iniquities the prophet\n declared that his posterity should be cut off; and that, for this\n iniquity in particular, dogs should lap his own blood in the\n place where they lapped the blood of Naboth ; and that the\n dogs should eat the flesh of Jezebel under the wall of Jezreel.\n On hearing this dreadful denunciation, the king manifested\n some signs of humiliation and contrition, in consequence of\n which the doom upon his wife and family was postponed from\n his own time to that of his successor.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The last act of Ahab\u2019s reign was the expedition against\n the Syrians, in which Jehoshaphat took part, as noticed in the\n preceding chapter.

When Athaliah saw that her son was dead, she resolv-\n ed to take the sovereign power into her own hands. She\n therefore destroyed all of the royal family whose present or\n prospective claims stood in the way of her ambition. No one\n escaped, except her grandson Joash, the son of Ahaziah, an\n infant of a year old. He was hidden from her rage, with his\n nurse, in the chambers of the temple, by his aunt Jehosheba,\n the wife of the high-priest. Athaliah now ruled Judah with\n a high hand. She established the worship of Baal through the\n land, and persecuted the faithful few who still adhered to the\n worship of Jehovah. Thus six year passed ; when Jehoiada,\n the high-priest, resolved to endure her usurpation and profligacy\n no longer, but to produce Joash, then seven years old, to the\n people as their king. Having engaged the Levites to support\n the design, a time was fixed for its execution. On that day the\n avenues and gates of the temple being strictly guarded by well-\n armed Levites, the young prince was carried into the inner court\n of the temple, under a strong escort of priests, and was there\n anointed and proclaimed king of Judah.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4 The blast of the trumpets, and the shouts .and acclama-\n tions of the people, attracted the attention of Athaliah, who re-\n paired in haste to the temple. A glance revealed to her the\n hateful truth, and she turned away with a cry of \u201c Treason !\u201d\n But no one moved in her favour, not even when, by order of\n Jehoiada, the guards seized her and led her forth to inevitable\n death. The high-priest now charged the king and people to\n renew the national covenant with God, and to serve and wor-\n ship him only. He then led the willing people to destroy the\n temple and idols of Baal, whose priests and prophets were also\n slain.

While the young king acted under the direction of Jehoiada,\n he reigned well, and order was restored to the kingdom. But\n after the death of that eminent person, he fell under the in-\n fluence of bad advisers \u2014 idolaters at heart \u2014 by whom he was\n seduced from the worship of the true God to those abomi-\n nations through which the nation had already suffered so deep-\n ly. This provoked the Divine anger, of which he was already\n warned by the piophets. Arlength when the king and people\n were celebrating a festival in the temple, Zechariah, the son\n and successor of Jehoiada, remonstrated so strongly against his\n conduct, that the indignant king commanded Zechariah, his\n cousin and the son of his benefactor, to be stoned, even in that\n sacred place; and his cruel and unjust command was but too\n readily obeyed by the apostate multitude. Many evils fell\n upon Judah for these iniquities. The land was invaded by the\n Syrians, who ravaged the country and plundered Jerusalem.\n Many of the inhabitants, as well as of the king ' s court and\n household, were put to the sword, and the invaders withdrew\n with immense booty to Damascus. Shortly after this, Joash,\n being afflicted with grievous diseases, was assassinated by two\n of his attendants, after a reign of forty and a life of forty-seven\n years.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Amaziah, the son of Joash, was twenty-five years old\n when he succeeded his father. He began his reign well, and\n re-established the worship of Jehovah : but he, like all his pre-\n decessors, continued the unsanctioned practice of offering sacri-\n fices in the high places. When he was settled in the throne,\n he brought the murderers of his father to condign punishment;\n but showed his respect for the law (Deut. xxiv. 16) by sparing\n their children, contrary to the general practice of the East. Af-\n terwards, about the twelth year of his reign (B. C. 827*), he\n undertook to reduce to obedience the Edomites, who had re-\n volted in the reign of his father. He got together 300,000 men\n for this expedition; and not deeming this a sufficient num-\n ber, hired 100,000 warriors from the king of Israel, for 100\n talents of silver. This was displeasing to God, who ordered\n him, by a prophet, to send them back again ; and he manifested\n a just sense of his position, as the viceroy of the Divine King,\n by his compliance, which involved the loss of the money he\n had advanced. The Israelites were very far from being pleased\n at their dismissal, and testified their resentment by the ravages\n and barbarities which they committed on their way home.\n Ahaziah was rewarded for his obedience by a complete victory\n over the Edomites, of whom he slew ten thousand in battle ;\n and ten thousand more, whom he had taken prisoners, he un-\n justifiably destroyed, by casting them down from the cliffs of\n their native mountains.

The chief events of his reign were the revolt of\n the Moabites, and his unfortunate alliance with Jehoshaphat in\n the attempt to recover the maritime traffic by the Red Sea.\n Being greatly injured by a fall from the lattice of an upper\n chamber, Ahaziah sent messengers to consult the oracles of\n Baal-Zebub, the fly-god of Ekron, respecting his recovery. The\n messengers were intercepted by Elijah the prophet, who sent\n them back, and afterwards went himself, to denounce, as a pun-\n ishment of his impious abandonment of the God of Israel, and\n his resorting to foreign idols, that he should rise no more from\n the bed on which he had lain down.

The beginning of Jehoram\u2019s reign was prosperous ; for, as\n Elisha declared, on account of Jehoshaphat having joined him in\n the enterprise, his army was, by special interpositions of Provi-\n dence, delivered from circumstances of great danger, and ena-\n bled to subdue the Moabites, who had revolted in die preceding\n reign. In this campaign, the king of Moab, when besieged by\n the allies in his capital, and pressed to extremities, offered up\n in sacrifice his eldest son, upon the wall of the city, hoping thus\n to render his idols propitious. Horror-struck at such a sight,\n the allies raised the siege and returned home. Elisha also re-\n turned to Samaria, where in his prophetic capacity, he wrought\n several signal miracles, which gave him a great and useful in-\n fluence with the people.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The partial reformations with which Jehoram commenced\n his reign, were not the result of decided principles. They\n were, therefore, soon abandoned, or not carried out ; and both\n king and people speedily relapsed into the former idolatries.\n This was punished by a new invasion by the Syrians under their\n king Benhadad. He subdued the whole country to the metrop-\n olis, Samaria, which he could only hope to reduce by famine,\n and to which, therefore, he laid seige. The famine and attend-\n ant miseries which were experienced in Samaria during this\n siege defy description. The extremity of hunger at length be-\n came so great, that every kind of edible substance, however un-\n usual or unwholesome, was devoured ; and some women were\n known to have fed on the flesh of their own children. When\n the king heard of this he rent his robes with horror and an-\n guish of soul, and disclosed the penitential sackcloth which he\n wore next his skin. But he was still as far as ever from a right\n mind. His indignation turned against Eli sha, whom he suppos-\n ed to have the power to avert these evils ; and he swore that\n he should be put to death that day. Aware of this intention,\n the prophet refused to admit the king\u2019s messenger into the\n house he occupied. Jehoram himself followed, perhaps to\n countermand the order he had given; and to him the prophet\n announced an immediate deliverance, and a superabundance of\n provisions in Samaria on the following day. This seemed in-\n credible to some of those who heard the announcement. But\n the night following it was found that the Syrians had raised the\n siege and fled away in great alarm, leaving every thing behinu\n them.

Towards the end of this reign, the king of Syria, Benha-\n dad, was secretly murdered in his sick-bed by Hazael, one of\n his chief officers, who then usurped the throne. Soon after this,\n Jehoram determined to make another effort to recover Ramoth-\n Gilead from the Syrians ; and, as we have seen in the previous\n chapter, persuaded Ahaziah, the king of Judah, to go with him.\n The king of Israel was severely wounded and obliged to leave\n the army and retire to Jezreel, and was soon followed by Aha-\n ziah. Long before this, when in Horeb, Elijah had been com-\n missioned to anoint, as king of Israel, Jehu, the son of Nimshi,\n who was to execute the doom of extermination upon the house\n of Ahab. This charge he had delayed to execute, and it now\n therefore devolved upon Elisha. Now, Jehu was one of the\n generals left in charge of the military operations before Ramoth-\n Gilead after the king had departed. One of the \u201c sons of the\n prophets\u201d was sent to anoint him there, and to charge him at\n once to execute his commission as the Lord\u2019s avenger upon the\n house of Ahab. Jehu was popular with the army ; and when\n the officers heard of this appointment they haileff it with ac-\n clamations, and immediately proclaimed him publicly as king\n of Israel. They then followed Jehu to Jezreel, whither, with\n his usual promptitude, he determined to proceed before any\n others could convey the tidings. When his approach was dis-\n covered from the walls of that city, Jehoram, quite ignorant of\n these transactions, and being impatient to know whether he re-\n turned in triumph or defeat, went forth to meet him, accom-\n panied by the king ot Judah. But when they met in the fatal\n field of Naboth, after a few bitter words, Jehu slew him, and\n his body was left unburied in the open field. Ahaziah of Ju-\n dah, being of the house of Ahab by his mother Athaliah, was\n also slain ; but his body was conveyed for interment to Jeru-\n salem.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. As Jehu entered Jezreel, the queen-mother Jezebel present-\n ed herself, royally attired, at a window of the palace; but at\n the command of Jehu, she was cast down by her own servants,\n and dashed to pieces, and trodden under foot by horses. It was\n found, not long after, that her body had been devoured by dogs,\n according to the prediction of Elijah. The rest of Ahab\u2019s family,\n seventy in number, who were at Samaria, were killed, and their\n heads sent to Jehu by the men in authority there, in evidence\n of their obedience to the new king. After he had rooted out all\n of the doomed race that were in Jezreel, he proceeded himself\n to SK ^taria, and extirpated all who bore affinity to the family.\n ^The establishment at Samaria for the service of Baal, \u2014 temple,\n idol, and priests, were totally destroyed by Jehu; and he de-\n nounced a similar fate against whoever should attempt to re-\n vive what he had overthrown.

Indeed, Jehu made no attempt to interfere with the\n golden calves ; and, altogether, his zeal, although effective and\n vehement in operation, only led him to do what coincided with\n his interest or humour. For the completeness with which he\n had accomplished his avenging mission, it was promised to Je-\n hu that his dynasty should endure for four generations. The\n defects of his obedience probably prevented a more extended du-\n ration; but still his family sat on the throne above a hundred\n years, which is longer than the rule of any other dynasty in Is-\n rael. The result of the war on the other side of Jordan was,\n that Hazael proved victorious, and deprived Israel of all its\n possessions on that side of the river.

Soon after, he\n visited the prophet Elisha when on his death-bed, and was en-\n couraged by the dying prophet, who assured him of three suc-\n cessive victories over the Syrians. He accordingly ventured to\n rise against them, and succeeded in expelling them from his do-\n minions. He also repulsed the Moabites, who invaded his ter-\n ritories. These successes procured for troubled Israel a few\n years of tranquillity and peace. Joash reigned sixteen years.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. Jeroboam II. succeeded his father. He was as bad as most\n of his predecessors : and the condition of the Israelites was dai-\n ly becoming more depressed. The country was succsssively in-\n vaded by the Syrians, the Moabites, Ammonites, and Edom-\n ites : who, however, were severally defeated and driven off by\n Jeroboam, encouraged by the prophet Jonah (B.

At length he shut up the sacred building altogether. To\n punish him for these crimes, his kingly slate was brought very\n low. In the early part of his reign, a formidable confederacy\n was formed against him by Pekah king of Israel, andRezin king\n of Syria, with the fixed intention of dethroning the house of\n David, and of bestowing the crown on some person whom we\n only know as \u201c Tabeal\u2019s son.\u201d In this war, Rezin stripped Ju-\n dah of its external territories, and carried away great numbers\n of Jews as captives to Damascus. Pekah was equally success-\n ful: he slew in one day 120,000 men of Judah, and carried\n away 200,000 as captives to Samaria. But he was induced to\n treat them well, and send them back again, at the instance of\n the prophet Obed and other prophets of influence, who refused\n to hold their brethren in bondage, and were in this supported\n by public feeling in Israel. This shews that, after all, the\n separation had not produced an exasperated state of feeling be-\n tween the nations. After this, the allies besieged Jerusalem,\n but were unable to take it; while the general distress was\n aggravated by the incursions of the Edomites on the south and\n the Philistines on the west, who took several cities and villages\n in the low country, and settled in them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. In this extremity, Ahaz sought the assistance of Tiglath-\n pileser, the king of Assyria, to whom he sent an embassy, de-\n claring himself his vassal, and bearing a subsidy of all the\n sacred and the royal treasures. Glad of a pretext for interference,\n Tiglath-pileser readily promised the assistance thus required.\n Accordingly, he defeated and slew the king of Syria, and took\n possession of his dominions ; he also made himself master of all\n the Hebrew possessions beyond Jordan, and sent away captive,\n into Assyria and Media, the three tribes \u2014 Reuben, Gad, and\n Manasseh.* Ahaz visited the Assyrian king at Damascus, to\n congratulate him, and to render him homage. He found, how-\n ever, that although temporarily relieved from an imminent dan-\n ger, he had little cause to rejoice in the result. He had become\n the tributary of a foreign power ; and instead of a rival, he had\n now a powerful and overbearing master for his neighbour. Little\n is known of his future reign, except that he persisted in his old\n courses, and lived, it would seem, under the odium of the whole\n nation for having been the apparent cause of the captivity into\n which three tribes of Israel had fallen. When, therefore, he\n died, after an inglorious and disastrous reign of sixteen years,\n he was refused a place in the royal sepulchres, although a\n grave in Jerusalem was allowed him.

Hezekiah, the son of Ahaz, was twenty-five years old\n when he ascended the throne. In all respects his character\n was the very reverse of that of his father, entitling him to rank\n as one of the very best kings of David\u2019s line ; indeed, the Scrip-\n ture seems to give him the preference to them all (2 Kings,\n xviii. 5.) The characteristics of a good king under the Hebrew\n system of government have been so often mentioned, that it is\n scarcely needful to repeat that they consisted in a faithful obe-\n dience to the revealed will of God, first, in his general char-\n acter, as Creator and sole Lord of the Universe ; secondly, in\n his more particular character, as the God who had made\n Israel his chosen people, and to whom, therefore, he was a\n national God, as distinguished from the national gods of the\n heathen around; and, thirdly, in the still more intimate charac-\n ter of the actual King and political Head of the nation, and who,\n as being incapable of error, exacted and was en tided to the\n most unlimited and confiding obedience. In all these charac-\n ters Hezekiah understood him ; and hence he also understood his\n own true position in the state. The first act of his reign was\n to open and purify the temple, and to extirpate all the idolatries\n which his father had sanctioned or introduced. He even went\n so far as to destroy the brazen serpent of Moses, which had\n been preserved as a memorial, the people having manifested a\n disposition to burn incense to it as a holy relic.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. This conduct of Hezekiah was rewarded by prosperity in\n all his undertakings. He subdued the Philistines ; and at length\n ventured to withhold the yearly tribute which his father had\n agreed to pay to the Assyrians. Shalmaneser, the son and suc-\n cessor of Tiglathpileser, was too much occupied in other quar-\n ters to pay much attention to Hezekiah ; but in the sixth\n year of his reign, he carried away into captivity the flower of\n the seven tribes of Israel on the west side of Jordan, thus com-\n pleting the ruin of the ten tribes. This event appears to have\n made a salutary impression on Judah, and probably afforded\n much aid to Hezekiah in his reformations. These were\n more radical than any former kings, however well disposed,\n had thought necessary; for Hezekiah not only abolished idola-\n try and restored the worship of God, but he revived The nation-\n al observances, which had been altogether neglected in former\n reigns, \u2014 such as the passover, which he celebrated at Jerusalem\n with greater solemnity than had been observed since the time\n of Solomon. Not only his own subjects, but the desolate rem-\n nants of the ten tribes were invited to this great feast ; many of\n whom came, but others mocked and refused.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. At length the Assyrians, having subdued the small na-\n tions between the Mediterranean and the Euphrates, found lei-\n sure to call Hezekiah to account for his arrears of tribute.

He accordingly paid\n the heavy ransom of three hundred talents of silver and thirty\n talents of gold, although this obliged him not only to exhaust the\n sacred and the royal treasures, but to strip off the gold which\n covered the doors and pillars of the temple. Sennacherib took\n the money, and went towards Egypt, which he intended next\n to invade ; but on the way he changed his mind and resolved\n not to leave unbroken in his rear a power so well inclined to\n ally itself with the Egyptians. He therefore took the strong\n towns of the south ; and, while he laid siege to Libnah and\n Lachish, sent his general Rabshakeh against Jerusalem. The\n language which this man used in summoning Hezekiah to sur-\n render, was in the highest degree offensive and blasphemous.\n Hezekiah, with humble confidence, referred the matter to God,\n and was answered by the promise of deliverance. Accordingly,\n a rumour reached Sennacherib that Tirhakah the Ethiopian,\n king of Upper Egypt, was marching with an immense army to\n cut off his retreat ; so that he deemed it prudent to abandon his\n operations, but not without sending a boastful and threatening\n letter to Hezekiah respecting his future intentions.

The baffled tyrant hastened home to Nineveh, where he\n behaved with great severity to the captive Israelites. But\n his career was short ; for, seven weeks after his return, he was\n slain by his own sons while worshipping in the temple of Nis-\n roc, the great idol of the Assyrians. The parricides fled, and\n left the throne open to their younger brother Esarhaddon.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9.

To as-\n sure him that his recovery was indeed miraculous, and not \u201c a\n chance,\u201d and to give confidence in the promise, a token was\n given in the going backward of the sun\u2019s shadow ten degrees,\n as measured by the sun-dial of Ahaz.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. The great loss which the Assyrians had sustained in\n Palestine, enabled the governor of Babylon, Merodach-baladan,\n to declare himself independent ; and he naturally desired to form\n amicable relations with the monarch in whose dominions As-\n syria had been so much disabled.

His prophetic ministry, therefore, extends\n over the whole period which also embraced the prophets\n Amos, Hoshea, Joel, and Micah. His extensive predictions\n embrace every matter in which the Jews or their neighbours\n were interested. They are delivered with marvellous sublimi-\n ty of thought and language, especially in those portions in\n which he foretells the advent of the Messiah, and the circum-\n stances attending his birth, his ministry, his death, and ultimate\n glory of his kingdom. Micah prophesied in the reigns of\n Jotham, Ahaz, and Hezekiah. He was a native of Morasthi,\n a small town in the southern part of Judah ; and this is\n all we know of him. His prophecies relate to both the king-\n doms, which he invites to repentance by threatenings and pro-\n mises. He also spoke of the Messiah, and named Bethlehem as\n the place of his birth. Nahum appears to have prophesied in\n the time of Hezekiah, and not long after the subversion 6f ihe\n kingdom of Israel by Shalmaneser.

This\n conqueror was advancing to invade Israel, when Menahem\n made submission to him, and, by the payment of one thousand\n talents of silver, procured his assistance against his refractory\n subjects. Menahem exercised with great barbarity the power\n he had thus acquired by foreign help; and the heavy annual\n tribute which he had engaged to pay the Assyrians in some de-\n gree compelled him to extort large sums of money from the\n people.

Israel was thus in\n a most miserable condition. The land became impoverished ;\n the people were in a stafe of exasperation ; and the Assyrians,\n having so largely profited by the invasion of Israel, were ready\n to avail themselves of any pretext for repeating the experiment.\n The state of religion and morals corresponded with this external\n condition.

It was evident that the nation was ripening\n fast for that destruction which the prophets had foretold. Af-\n ter a troubled reign of ten years, Menahem died.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Pekahiah, his son, reigned two years, and was then put\n to death by Pekah, the commander of the forces.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Pekah then ascended the throne. The principal\n events of this reign were those which arose from the alli-\n ance of Pekah with Rezin, king of Syria, against Ahaz king of\n Judah, as related in the preceding chapter. Pekah was victo-\n rious in this war, which induced Ahaz to apply to Tiglath-pile-\n ser, the son of Pul, king of Assyria, who cameand chastized the\n belligerents into quietness, after which he removed the tribes\n beyond Jordan to Media and Assyria. After a reign of twenty\n years, Pekah was slain by Hoshea.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Ten years of the most cruel anarchy elapsed before Ho-\n shea was able to establish himself on the throne. About this\n time the Egyptians became seriously alarmed at the progress\n of the Assyrians in their neighbourhood ; and So or Sabaco, the\n king of Egypt, adopted the policy of procuring employment for\n them elsewhere, to avert their attention from his own country.\n To this end he induced Hoshea in Israel, and Hezekiah in Ju-\n dah, by insincere promises of support, to hold back the tribute\n they had paid to the Assyrians. This soon brought Shalman-\n eser, the son of Tiglath-pileser, with a mighty host into Pales-\n tine. Having easily subdued the country, he advanced to lay\n siege to the metropolis, in which Hoshea had shut himself with\n the remnant of his forces. It was not taken until the third\n year, and in the interval the inhabitants endured great priva-\n tion and distress. At length it fell ; and Shalmaneser extin-\n guished the kingdom of Israel, and sent Hoshea in chains to\n JNineveh. Thus perished the kingdom of Israel, which was\n annexed to the Assyrian crown under an Assyrian governor, af-\n ter it had endured, as a separate state, 271 years, under seven-\n teen kings.\n</p>\n<p>\n The king of Assyria adopted the policy which appears to have\n been usually followed in those times with regard to such coun-\n tries or provinces as the conqueror designed to incorporate with\n his own dominions. The flower of the nation, composed of all\n who were distinguished for their rank and wealth, for their abil-\n ities or personal qualifications, and for their knowledge of arms\n and useful arts, were taken away to the region beyond the Eu-\n phrates, in which the three tribes carried off by Tiglath-pileser\n were already settled. Their place was partly supplied by the\n inhabitants of other conquered countries in distant parts. In the\n present case, the new settlers in Israel were brought from the\n region of the Lower Tigris and Euphrates; and being intended\n merely to keep the land occupied, were a far less numerous and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0141/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0141/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0141/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0141/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0141/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0141.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 527035}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"141\">\n<p>\n 133\n</p>\n<p>\n B.

This\n design was more fully worked out by Esharhaddon, the son of\n Sennacherib, who gleaned the remnant left in the land, and sub-\n stituted other foreigners. The new comers gradually combin-\n ed with the dregs of the Israelites who remained in the country,\n and the population thus formed took the name of Samaritans\n from the city of Samaria.

This know-\n ledge they obtained from a priest who fixed his residence at\n Bethel ; and the result was, that they combined the worship of\n the true God with that of their own idols. Very gradually,\n however, their system purified itself from the idolatrous dross,\n and the Samaritans at length rested in a system of belief as pure\n as that of the Jews, although less regular in some of its obser-\n vances. In some respects their creed may have been the purer\n of the two, seeing that it was based entirely upon the Books of\n Moses, whereas that of the Jews became encumbered with a\n great mass of oral traditions.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. As henceforth the Jews only, that is, the inhabitants of the\n Kingdom of Judah, have historical existence, it may be well to\n offer a few concluding remarks regarding the ten tribes, who\n were earlier brought under the yoke of bondage by the Assy-\n rians. They were settled in Assyria and Media, and nothing of\n tbeir further history is known. Much, however, has been con-\n jectured ; and their destiny has often been made a subject of en-\n quiry and dispute. Many believe that they are destined to take\n part in those purposes of divine mercy for which their brethren\n of Judah and Benjamin have been kept for so many ages separ-\n ate and apart among the nations, a wonder and a byword in them\n all. In this belief they have sought for them, and have found\n in various countries, and under a variety of disguising circum-\n stances, races or tribes of men whom, from analogous customs,\n rites, and features, they have supposed to be descendants of the\n ten tribes. Such have been found in Asia, Europe, and Amer-\n ica, among heathens, Moslems, Jews, and Christians. All these\n identifications cannot be true ; and there are none of them\n which quite satisfy the mind, for many of the analogies rest on\n circumstances which belong to the Israelites, not as the sons of\n Abraham, but only as Orientals.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. It is to be borne in mind that the land of Israel was not al-\n together divested of its inhabitants, as many of the poorer peo-\n ple were allowed to remain. Then, also, the proclamation of\n Cyrus, under which the Jews eventually returned to build again\n their city and temple, was addressed not to the tribes of Judah\n and Benjamin alone, but to all the people of Jehovah (Ezra, i.\n 1 \u2014 3) ; and being proclaimed throughout the Persian empire,\n which included the former dominions of Assyria, it is probable\n that not a few of the ten tribes were induced to return to Pales-\n</p>\n<p>\n M\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0142/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0142/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0142/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0142/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0142/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0142.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 416775}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"142\">\n<p>\n 134 AMALGAMATION OF THE TRIBES.

The threatened doom was at length inflicted. By the\n twenty-second year of his reign, Esarhaddon, king of Assyria,\n had repaired the losses which the death of Sennacherib had oc-\n casioned. Having invaded Palestine, he removed the remnant\n which lingered upon the mountains of Israel, and dispatched his\n generals against Jerusalem. The city was taken ; and Manas-\n seh was sent in chains to Babylon, which the Assyrians had re-\n covered, where he was thrown into a dungeon. There he had\n leisure for thought ; and the remembrance of what he had been,\n of what he had lost, and how he had lost it, tilled him with\n poignant sorrow. At length his heart was softened ; he wept,\n and turned repentingly to God, from whom he had revolted.\n God heard the moaning of the prisoner, and had pity upon him,\n and forgave him, and inclined the heart of the successor of Esar-\n haddon to restore him to his kingdom. The remainder of his\n reign was good, and he found ample employment in undoing all\n that he had before done. His reign of fifty-five years was the\n longest that had occurred in either Judah or Israel.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Amon, his son, succeeded at the age of twenty-two years.\n But although brought up in the best days of his father, he fol-\n lowed the example of the worst. He was slain in a conspiracy\n by his own servants, after a short reign of two years.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Josiah was only eight years old when the people, after ha-\n ving punished the murderers of his father, made him king. His\n guardianship devolved upon the high priest, who bestowed upon\n him an education worthy of a king. Josiah began very early to\n manifest the good dispositions and excellent character which\n distinguished his reign. As early as the age of twelve he inter-\n ested himself in seeing Jerusalem purged of the idolatries which\n his father had in his short r eign introduced. Afterwards he\n conducted this expurgation in person, not only in his own do-\n minions, but throughout the territories which had belonged to\n Ephraim, Manasseh, Zebulun, and Naphtali. On this occasion\n he executed the sentence against the altar at Bethel, denounced\n to the first Jeroboam three hundred and fifty years before, when\n Josiah had been appointed to the work by name.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. In the eighteenth year of his reign, the temple was put in\n complete order and repair. In the course of these labours, the\n original book of the law, as written by the hand of Moses, and\n deposited beside the ark, was discovered by Hilkah the high-\n priest.

In tne year 606, B. C., Nineveh was besieged by the Medes\n and Babylonians, who had revolted from Assyria. Taking ad-\n vantage of these affairs, the king of Egypt marched an army to\n possess himself of Carchemish, an important pass of the Euphra-\n tes. He marched through Palestine. But Josiah, as a tributary\n to the Assyrians, felt himself bound to oppose his passage. He\n was defeated, and mortally wounded in a battle at Megiddo, and\n soon after died at Jerusalem, sincerely lamented by all his peo-\n ple, and bewailed by the prophet Jeremiah. He left three sons,\n Eliakim, Jehoahaz or Shallum, and Zedekiah.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Jehoahaz or Shallum, the second of these sons, was elected\n king by the people. We know not the cause of this preference,\n which was very little justified by his conduct during the three\n months of his reign, in which he manifested a disposition to imi-\n tate the worst of his predecessors. At the end of the three\n months, Necho returned triumphant from the Euphrates, and\n came to Jerusalem to reap the fruits of his victory at Megiddo.\n He laid on the city a heavy tribute, and deposed Jehoahaz, and\n carried him away captive into Egypt where he died. Necho\n bestowed the crown on Josiah\u2019s eldest son, Eliakim, whose name\n he changed to Jehoiakim, in token of subjection.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. Jehoiakim was twenty- five years old when he ascended\n the throne as the vassal of Egypt. He trod in the footsteps of\n his idolatrous predecessors, and the people imitated his exam-\n ple. The Babylonians wished to succeed to the western empire\n of the Assyrians, and not to destroy it. Nabopolassar, the king\n of Babylon, while besieging Nineveh, beheld, therefore, with\n displeasure the disturbances west of the Euphrates, and sent his\n son Nebuchadnezzar to reduce the provinces to obedience. In\n this he succeeded, and Jehoiakim, among the rest, became his\n vassal, and continued so for three years. During this time\n Nineveh was taken, and Nabopolassar, dying soon after,\n was succeeded by his son Nebuchadnezzar. While the atten-\n tion of the new monarch was otherwise engaged, Jehoiakim\n had the temerity to revolt from him. To this he was probably\n persuaded by the king of Egypt, who undertook a second expe-\n dition against Carchemish, which Nebuchadnezzar had recover-\n ed. He was defeated by the Babylonian, and stripped of all\n his possessions between the Euphrates and the Nile.

Among\n these were the prophet Daniel and his companions. Upon the\n whole Nebuchadnezzar behaved more leniently than might\n have been expected, owing, probably, to a desire of maintaining\n Judah, if possible, as a frontier state between himself and\n Egypt. He did not even depose Jehoiakim, who, uncorrected\n by adversity, proved the same remorseless tyrant, regardless of\n God and man. It does not appear that he again revolted, but\n after some years his conduct appeared so displeasing to the king\n of Babylon, who was then in the north of Syria, that he sent a\n number of local auxiliaries against him. They took him priso-\n ner and carried him to Nebuchadnezzar, who put him in fetters,\n and designed to take him to Babylon. But he first proceeded\n with him to Jerusalem, where he died.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. On Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s arrival at Jerusalem, he was little\n pleased to find that, without consulting him, the people had in\n in the meantime raised to the throne Jehoiachin (or Jeconiah or\n Coniah), the son of Johoiakim. This prince, in the brief inter-\n val of three months, had found time to evince the most depraved\n dispositions. He surrendered to Nebuchadnezzar, and was taken\n to Babylon, where he spent the rest of his days. Nebuchadnez-\n zar made Zedekiah, the third son of Josiah, king; but left him\n a much impoverished kingdom. All the portable wealth that\n could be found in the palace or the temple, was seized and sent\n off to Babylon ; and along with the deposed, were taken away\n all the persons of note, and all the skilful craftsmen of the king-\n dom.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. In appointing Zedekiah to the throne, Nebuchadnezzar ex-\n acted from him a very solemn oath of allegiance. Accordingly,\n when in the fourth year of his reign, the kings of Edom, Moab,\n Ammon, and Tyre invited him to join in a confederacy to shake\n off the Babylonian yoke, he would not listen to their proposals.\n Zedekiah set an example of iniquity to his people which they\n willingly followed. They were rapidly ripening for the de-\n struction which had been so long foretold; and which was\n brought about by means of the revolt of Zedekiah from the king\n of Babylon, in the ninth year of his reign. This step was ta-\n ken in reliance upon Pharaoh Hophra\u2019, king of Egypt, in spite of\n the earnest remonstrances of Jeremiah, who repeatedly, and in\n the face of cruel treatment, warned both the king and people,\n that their only hope of safety and quiet lay in their adhesion\n to Nebuchadnezzar.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. In ' consequence of this revolt, the Babylonian king inva-\n ded Judea with a great army, and, after taking most of the\n principal towns, sat down before Jerusalem.

The return of\n the Chaldeans to the siege, destroyed all the hopes which the\n approach of the Egyptian succours had excited. The siege was\n now prosecuted with redoubled vigour ; and at length Jerusa-\n lem was taken by storm at midnight, in the eleventh year of\n Zedekiah, and in the eighteenth month from the commence-\n ment of the seige. Dreadful was the carnage. The people,\n young and old, were slaughtered wherever they appeared ; and\n even the temple was no refuge for them : the sacred courts\n streamed with blood. Zedekiah himself, with his family and\n some friends, contrived to escape from the city ; but he was\n overtaken and captured in the plains of Jericho. He was sent\n in chains to Nebuchadnezzar, who had left the conclusion of the\n war to his generals, and was then at Riblah in Syria. After\n sternly reproving him for his ungrateful conduct, the conqueror\n ordered all the sons of Zedekiah to be slain before his eyes, and\n then his own eyes to be put out, thus making the slaughter of\n his children the last sight on which his tortured memory could\n dwell. He was afterwards sent in fetters of brass to Babylon,\n where he remained until his death.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. Nebuchadnezzar appears to have felt that his purposes\n had not been fully executed by the army, or else he was urged\n by the Edomites and others to exceed his first intentions. He\n therefore sent Nebuzaradan, the captain of the guard, with a\n sufficient force, to complete the desolation of Judah and Jeru-\n salem. He burned the city and the temple to the ground ; he\n collected and sent to Babylon all the gold and silver which for-\n mer spoilers had left ; and he transported all the people who\n had been left behind in Jehoiachin\u2019s captivity, save only the\n poor of the land, who were left to be vine-dressers and hus-\n bandmen. Four years after, Nebuzaradan again entered Judea,\n and gleaned a few more of the miserable inhabitants, whom he\n sent off to Babylon.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. Thus was the land left desolate ; and thus ended the\n kingdom of Judah and the reign of David\u2019s house, after it had\n endured four hundred and four years under twenty kings. It is\n remarkable that the king of Babylon made no attempt to colo-\n nize the country he had depopulated, as was done by the Assy-\n rians in Israel ; and thus, in the providence of God, the land\n was left vacant, to be re-occupied by the Jews after seventy years\n of captivity and punishment.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. Sacred Writers . \u2014 Zephaniah prophesied in the early\n part of Josiah\u2019s reign; and his reprehension of the existing\n abuses would appear to have roused that excellent prince to\n undertake those reformations which honored his reign.

Their countrymen of the earlier captivities were\n settled in various stations and employments, some of them held\n posts of trust under the government. By that government they\n were regarded not as prisoners, but as useful emigrants ; and\n after a while they appear to have experienced no other incon-\n veniences than those which naturally flowed from their position\n as foreigners in a strange country ; from the derison of the na-\n tives at the peculiarities of their religion ; and, probably\n from a distinctive poll-tax, from which the Babylonians were\n exempt.

This training lasted\n three years, when they were examined in the presence of the\n king: and Daniel and three of his friends were found to have\n made far greater progress than any of those who had been edu-\n cated with them. They were therefore enrolled among the\n magians or learned men.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. A few years after, Nebuchadnezzar was greatly troubled\n with a dream, which made a profound impression upon his\n mind ; but the particulars of which quite passed from his memo-\n ory when he awoke. Great importance was attached to dreams\n in\u2019those days, and men skilled in the sciences were supposed to\n be able to discover their meaning. Therefore, the king sent for\n his court magians, and required them not only to interpret the\n dream, but to discover the dream itself, which he had forgot-\n ten. This they declared to be impossible; on which the exas-\n perated tyrant ordered all the magians to be massacred. Dan-\n iel and his friends, although not present, were included in such\n a sentence. On learning this, he beg;ged a respite for the whole\n body, undertaking to find, through his God, the solution of tne\n difficulty. The respite was granted ; and at the earnest pray-\n er of Daniel, God made the secret known to him.

There appear to have been good and generous qualities\n in the character of Nebuchadnezzar ; but the pride with which\n he contemplated the grandeur of his empire, and the magnifi-\n cence of his undertakings, was most inordinate, and he requir-\n ed to be taught that \u201c the Most High ruleth over all the king-\n doms of the earth, and giveth them to whomsoever he will.\u201d\n He was warned of this in a dream, which was interpreted to\n him by Daniel ; but, neglecting the warning, \u201c his heart was\n changed from man\u2019s, and a beast\u2019s heart was given to him.\u201d\n He was afflicted with a madness which made him think himself\n a beast, and, acting as such, he remained constantly abroad in\n the fields, living upon wild herbs. In this debased and forlorn\n condition the mighty conqueror remained seven years, when\n he was restored to his reason and his throne ; and one of his first\n acts was to issue a proclamation, .humbly acknowledging the\n signs and wonders which the Most High God had wrought to-\n wards him, and declaring his conviction, that \u201c those who walk\n in pride he is able to abase.\u201d He died soon after. He was\n succeeded by Evil-Merodach, who had administered the govern-\n ment during the insanity of his father.

His son Belshazzaf succeeded. Of him nothing is record-\n ed but the circumstances in which his reign concluded. There\n was a great festival, which Belshazzar celebrated by a magnifi-\n cent feast to all his nobles. They talked of iheir gods, whose\n power had proved so much greater than that of the gods of\n other nations; and this suggested to the king to send for the\n sacred vessels of the temple of Jerusalem, to be used as wine-\n cups in their riotings. While thus profanely engaged, their\n attention was arrested by a mysterious hand, tracing on the\n wall words which no one understood. The magians tried in\n vain to interpret them. Daniel was then sent for, and he, after\n solemnly rebuking the king for his profanation of that Great\n Name which his proud grandfather had been compelled to hon-\n our, explained the terrible purport of the inscription to be, that\n the end both of his life and dynasty was close at hand. He lost\n his life that very night by the conspiracy of two nobles, whom\n he had grievously wronged ; and a year after, the death of his\n son, a boy, named Laborosoarchad, left the heritage to Darius\n (or Cyaxares) the Mede, who accordingly took possession of the\n kingdom. Thus the Babylonian empire was merged in that of\n the Medes and Persians.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. A very high place in the favour of Darius was occupied\n by Daniel ; and in re-distributing the government of the provin-\n ces, the prophet was set at the head of all. This excited the\n jealousy and discontent of many, and the destruction of\n Daniel was determined. His hands were too clean, and his\n conduct too upright, to allow them to hope that they could fas-\n ten any charge upon him, except on the score of his reli-\n gion. They therefore persuaded the weak old king to issue a\n decree, that no one should, for thirty days, make prayer to\n any god but himself, under pain of being cast alive into the den\n of lions. Daniel, however, made no change in his usual habits\n of prayer to the God of Israel, with his face turned towards\n Jerusalem. He was, therefore, accused to Darius, who saw too\n late the folly into which he had been drawn, and would fain\n have spared his friend. But being reminded, that among the\n Medes and Persians a royal decree could not be revoked or al-\n tered, he reluctantly consented that his own should take effect.\n Daniel was then thrown into the den of lions. The unhappy\n king spent the night in sorrow; and early in the morning he\n hastened to the den, hoping that perhaps the Mighty God whom\n Daniel served had not allowed him to perish. The cheerful\n voice of the prophet from within the den answered to the call,\n for the lions had not been allowed to hurt him. Daniel was\n taken from the den, and his accusers cast in ; and on them the\n lions had no mercy. This produced from Darius a remarkable\n proclamation of the greatness and supremacy of \u201c the Most\n High God,\u201d whom Daniel served.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9.

Cyrus, the illustrious nephew of Darius, was for\n several years too much engaged in other wars to attend to him.\n But at length, he led his troops against Babylon. The city held\n out for two years against him; and was then only taken by the\n remarkable stratagem of diverting the course of the river Eu-\n phrates, which flowed through the city, and entering by night\n through the dry channel. This taking of Babylon, with all its\n circumstances, was minutely described by the prophet Isaiah,\n and Cyrus mentioned by name, above a century before that\n conqueror was born.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. The prophet Daniel was still alive when Babylon was\n taken by Cyrus ; and there is reason to conclude, that this ven-\n erable personage was high in the esteem of that conqueror.\n In some decrees, Cyrus intimates his knowledge of those pro-\n phecies in Isaiah which speak of himself, and there is little\n question that Daniel called his attention to them. We know\n that the prophet had at this time looked much into the writings\n of former prophets (Dan. ix. 1. 2), and had ascertained that the\n duration of the captivity was to be seventy years (Jer. xxv. 11,\n 12 ; xxix. 10) ; and now he found that the expiration of the\n seventy years left the sovereign power in the hands of Cyrus,\n of whom Isaiah had so particularly prophesied as the person\n destined \u201c to restore the captivities of Judah. The communi-\n cation of these facts must have made a strong impression on\n the conqueror, accompanied as it was by the claim, that the\n Jehovah whom the Hebrews worshipped was He who had rais-\n ed him up, and had given to him all that greatness and glory\n by which he was now surrounded.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. Sacred Writers . \u2014 The most eminent writer of this pe-\n riod was Daniel, whose history has been given above. He liv-\n ed throughout the captivity in great esteem and honour.

On reaching\n Palestine, the caravan repaired at once to Jerusalem, which\n they found utterly ruined and desolate. Before they separated\n to seek habitations for themselves, they raised a large sum by\n voluntary contributions towards the rebuilding of the temple.\n They then employed themselves in securing dwellings and\n necessaries for their families ; and at the ensuing Feast of Taber-\n nacles again repaired to Jerusalem, where sacrifices were offered\n on an altar erected upon the ruins of the temple. After this the\n people applied themselves zealously to the necessary prepara-\n tions for the restoration of that edifice. In a year from the de-\n parture from Babylon the preparations were sufficiently ad-\n vanced to allow the work to be commenced ; and, accordingly,\n the foundations of the second temple were then laid with great\n rejoicings and songs of thanksgiving. While the work pro-\n ceeded, the Samaritans manifested a desire to assist in the\n work, and to claim a community of worship in the new temple\n This was declined by the Jews, on the ground that the decree\n of the Persian king extended only to the race of Israel.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Being thus frustrated in their design, the Samaritans em-\n ployed every means they could devise to thwart the undertaking.\n Their origin appears to have given them considerable influence\n at the Persian court ; and although they could not act openly\n against the plain decree of Cyrus, an unscrupulous use of their\n money and influence among the officers of the government\n enabled them to raise such obstructions that the people were\n much discouraged, and the work proceeded but languidly, and\n at length was suspended altogether. This was one cause of the\n enmity which always afterwards subsisted between the Jews\n and the Samaritans. The suspension of the work commenced\n in the time of Cyrus, and continued through the reign of Cam-\n byses and Smerdis, to the second year of Darius Hystaspes. In\n this long period the people gradually lost all heart for the work,\n and were disposed to conclude that the set time for it had not\n yet come. From this lethargy they were roused by the ex-\n hortations and reproaches of the prophet Haggai ; and the\n building was resumed with fresh zeal. This zeal was, indeed,\n somewhat damped by the discouraging regrets of the old men,\n who had seen in their youth the temple of Solomon, and who\n cleariy perceived that this would be a far inferior building.\n But to obviate this discouragement the prophet Haggai was\n commissioned to declare that the ultimate glory of this second\n temple should greatly exceed that of the first, \u2014 not by greater\n splendour of fabric, but by the presence within its walls of the\n Messiah, so long expected and foretold\u2014 \u201c the desire of all na-\n tions.\u201d\u2014 (Haggai, ii. 1-9.)\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.

The Jews being now in some sense restored to their own\n land, it is proper to mention the footing on which they stood as\n a people. Like all the surrounding nations, they were under\n tribute to the Persians, and subject to the general policy of that\n government. They appear to have been favourably considered\n by it, at first on account of Daniel, and afterwards on account\n of the hatred of idolatry which was common to the Jews and\n to the Persians.* They were allowed the free exercise of their\n religion and laws, and the internal government was directed by\n a governor of their own nation, or by the high-priest when there\n was no other governor. There was, in fact, a distinct common-\n wealth, with its own peculiar institutions ; and although\n responsible to the Persian king, and to his deputy the governor-\n general of Syria, it was more secure under the protection of the\n Persian monarch than, considering its feeble condition, it would\n have been in complete independence. With regard to religibn,\n the dreadful lesson taught by the desolation of the land, the\n destruction of the temple, and the captivity of the people, had\n effectually cured the Jews of that tendency to idolatry which\n had been their ruin. But, as time went on, the distortion of\n character which had been restrained in one direction broke forth\n in another ; and although they no longer went formally astray\n from a religion which did not suit their carnal minds, they, by\n many vain and mischievous fancies, fabricated a religion suited\n to their dispositions out of the ritual to which they formally\n adhered.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Sacred Writers .\u2014 The prophet Haggai was the first of the\n three prophets who were commissioned to make known the will\n of God to the Jews after their return from captivity. He is\n supposed to have been born at Babylon, and to have returned\n with Zerubbabel, under the edict of Cyrus. The object of his\n prophecy was to stimulate the building of the temple. Zecha-\n riah was also one of the returned exiles ; and his prophecies\n were delivered at the same time, and with the same object. He\n also speaks of more remote times, \u2014 the coming of Christ, and\n the Roman war.\n</p>\n<p>\n * The Persians worshipped the sun as a symbol of the Deity, and the fire\n as a symbol of the sun.

Hence, an order was ob-\n tained that the building of the walls should not be allowed.

An exemption from all taxes was also promised to persons\n engaged in the service of the temple ; but this boon did not in-\n duce any of the Levitical tribe to join the caravan which assem-\n bled on the banks of the river Ahava, in Babylonia ; and it was\n with some difficulty that Ezra at last induced some of the priest-\n ly families to go with him. The whole caravan was composed\n of 1754 adult males, \u2014 making, with wives and children, about\n 6000 persons. As a party thus composed had little military\n strength, and as the journey across the desert was then, as it al-\n ways has been, dangerous, from the predatory Arab tribes by\n which it is infested, they felt considerable anxiety on this ac-\n count. But Ezra, from having said much to the king of the pow-\n er of God to protect and deliver those that trusted in him, felt\n disinclined to apply fora guard of soldiers; and thought it bet-\n ter that the party should, in a solemn act of fasting and prayer,\n cast themselves upon the care of their God. Their confidence\n was rewarded by the perfect safety with which their journey\n was accomplished. In four months they arrived at Jerusalem.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Having deposited in the temple the donations with which\n he was charged, and imparted his commission to the royal offi-\n cers in that quarter, Ezra applied himself earnestly to the work\n he had undertaken. He does not himself record any of his acts\n particularly, excepting the removal of the foreign and idolatrous\n women, whom many of the people, and even of the priests and\n Levites, had married, contrary to the law. But we are inform-\n ed by Nehemiah, that Ezra caused the law to be publicly read to\n the assembled people, and to be explained by interpreters to\n those who understood only the Chaldean dialect, in which they\n had been brought up. This doubtless gave occasion for the in-\n crease of the copies of the law ; and it is well understood that\n Ezra collected and revised the sacred books which compose the\n Old Testament, and arranged them in the form which they now\n bear.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. While Ezra was engaged in these labors, a great danger\n threatened the Jews who remained beyond the Euphrates. In\n the third year of his reign, the Persian king had put away his\n queen Yashti, and had taken in her place a beautiful Jewish\n damsel named Esther, the niece ofMordecai, a Benjaminite, and\n one of the officers of the palace. Years passed away, in the\n course of which the chief place in the king\u2019s favour was acquir-\n ed by Haman, an Amalekite.

This act of\n homage was refused by Mordecai,* who constantly allowed the\n great man to pass by without shewing that respect which all\n others paid. This attracted the attention and excited the inqui-\n ries of Hainan ; and learning probably that all other rigid Jews\n would act in the same manner, he vowed the extinction of the\n whole race. Having fixed, by lot, what he considered a propi-\n tious day for the execution of his design, he proceeded to the\n king, and without naming the people, but describing them* in\n general terms, as of peculiar customs and unpleasant manners,\n and of a refractory and rebellious disposition, he obtained an or-\n der for their extermination. Couriers were accordingly sent to\n all the provinces, commanding that the Jews everywhere, with-\n out regard to age or sex, should be utterly extirpated on the\n thirteenth day of the month of Adar, and their property taken\n as prey. When this became known in Shushan (Sesa) the me-\n tropolis, all the Jews there declared their concern in loud la-\n mentations, and by garments of mourning. On learning these\n things from Mordecai, Esther, at his desire, undertook to inter-\n cede with the king in behalf of her people.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. This was an undertaking of great danger ; for it was death\n for any one to appear before the king uncalled, and she had not\n for some time been invited to his presence. She went, howev-\n er, attended by her maidens ; and the king happening to be in\n good humour, extended to her the golden sceptre, by which act\n her intrusion was forgiven. She invited the king and Haman\n to a banquet, at which she improved the favourable opening with\n such consummate tact, that the design of Haman appeared in\n the king\u2019s view as a plot for the destruction of the queen and her\n people ; and in his rage he commanded him to be hanged upon\n a high gallows which he had prepared for Mordecai. It was\n less easy to revoke the murderous order which had at Haman\u2019s\n instance been issued, by reason of that peculiar practice of the\n Persians which made the word of the king a law that could not\n be altered. All that could be done was to allow the Jews to\n stand upon their defence against those who might attempt to\n put the first order into execution. These conflicting orders oc-\n casioned much bloodshed in different parts; but the Jewish na-\n tion was preserved, and the deliverance is to this day comme-\n morated by an annual feast, called Purim.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. There is yet another incident in this remarkable history.\n In the interval, after the first order had been issued, the king\u2019s\n attention was providentially drawn to the fact, that a domestic\n plot against his life had been formerly detected and made\n known by Mordecai. He then asked what reward had\n been conferred on the man to whom he owed his life;\n</p>\n<p>\n * The precise ground of this refusal is not well known. Some think that\n it was because the form of homage was deemed idolatrous by Mordecai ;\n others, that he would not bow to one of the race which had been doomed to\n extermination as the implacable enemies of Israel.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0160/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0160/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0160/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0160/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0160/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0160.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 405486}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"160\">\n<p>\n 152\n</p>\n<p>\n SACRED WRITERS.\n</p>\n<p>\n [B.

On making known his commission to the principal per-\n sons of the nation, he found them all disposed to engage zeal-\n ously in the undertaking. The building of the new wall was\n accordingly commenced upon the old foundations. The Sama-\n ritans, and other enemies of the Jews, took alarm at this move-\n ment, and endeavoured in every possible way to thwart the de-\n sign. The Jews were, however, too much in earnest to be dis-\n couraged ; they armed the workmen, and still further pro ected\n them by a guard, of armed citizens, as they worked in bands up-\n on different parts of the wall. Thus, by the most arduous and\n patriotic exeriions, the whole wall, with its gates and towers,\n was finished 1 in the short space of fifty-two days.

Tiie neglected service of the temple was re-established,\n and care was taken that the people should be properly instruct-\n ed in the hw of Moses. The public reading of the law, and its\n interpretation, under the direction of Ezra, as mentioned in the\n former chapter, took place at this time, with every encourage-\n ment from Nehemiah. This ended in a joyful celebration^ of\n the Feast of abernacles, which had, since the days of Joshua,\n been neglected and almost forgot r en ; and after this the people\n were found to be in so devout a frame of mind, that Ezra and\n Nehemiah seized the occasion to engage them to enter into a\n solemn covenant to serve God with singleness of heart, and to\n obey in all things the law of Moses. Of such covenants we\n have had more than one previous example. Thisone was seal-\n ed by the principal heads of families, as representing the whole\n of the people.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

His absence was not\n supplied by the presence of any person uniting the same de-\n gree of power and influence in ' the nation. The consequence\n was that the people soon began to neglect the divine law, and\n to contract mischievous connexions with the heathen nations\n by whom they were surrounded. This misconduct was by no\n means confined to the inferior classes of the people; out\n the evil example was set by the leading men, by the priests,\n and even by the high-priest himself. The intelligence of such\n proceedings at length brought Nehemiah back again from the\n Persian court. He applied a vigorous and unsparing hand to\n the reformation of these abuses. Tne Jews who had married\n heathen females were compelled to part from them ; the ob-\n servance of the sabbath was enforced ; and the condition of the\n people was much improved by the abolition of illegal usury,\n which had operated in bringing great numbers of the poor un-\n der personal servitude to the rich.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here, properly speaking, the history of the Old Testament\n ends ; and our further information is obtained from Josephus,\n and from the books of the Maccabees.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. After Nehemiah, Judaea ceased to form a distinct govern-\n ment, and was annexed to the satrapy of Syria. The internal\n government was, however, administered by the high-priests,\n under the appointment of the satraps of Syria. This annexa-\n tion of the civil government to the pontificate, soon made that\n office one of high ambition to the different members of the sa-\n cerdotal family, and gave occasion to most disgraceful contests\n among them. At the time which we have now reached, there\n had been three high-priests since the return from Babylon,\n namelv, Joshua, Joachim, and Eliashib. This last died in B.\n C. 413, and was succeeded by his son Joiada or Judas, whose\n pontificate extended to B. C. 373. Until the death of Joiada,\n nothing particularly worthy of notice occurs in the history of\n the Jews. They remained quiet under the Persian government,\n to which they were as much attached as they could be to any\n foreign rule, and to which they were always faithful.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The death of Joiada occurred in the thirty-first year of Ar-\n taxerxes Mnemon, when the Satrapy of Syria was vested in Ba-\n goses. But soon after, Joshua, another son of the late high-\n priest, arrived at Jerusalem, and claimed that high office on the\n ground of having been appointed by Bagoses. This occasioned\n a violent dispute between the two brothers in the interior court\n of the temple, and Joshua was slain in that sacred place. On\n hearing of this, Bagoses repaired to Jerusalem, and after stern-\n ly rebuking the Jews for thus defiling the temple of their God,\n he imposed as a punishment a heavy tax upon the lambs offer-\n ed in sacrifice, which was not remitted until after the death of\n Artaxerxes, when Bagoses was recalled to Persia, and the tax\n was not enforced by his successor.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6.

It would\n seem that Jaddua was a just pontiff, who endeavoured to up-\n hold the reforms of Nehemiah. Of this he gave a remarkable\n proof by expelling his own brother Manasses for marrying the\n daughter of Sanballat, the Cuthite governor of Samaria. Ma-\n nasses then repaired to that personage ; and the Samaritans,\n not being allowed access to the temple at Jerusalem, were in-\n duced by the presence of a member of the pontifical family\n among them, to think of having a temple for themselves. San-\n ballat accordingly obtained from Darius Codomanus permission\n to build a temple for them on Mount Gerizim, and when it was\n finished, Manasses became their high-priest. This measure\n greatly widened the breach between the Jews and the Samari-\n tans. Each party contended for the exclusive claims of its own\n temple. The Jews alleged that sacrifices ought to be offered\n only at Jerusalem ; but the Samaritans affirmed that the true\n place of worship was Mount Gerizim, where they alleged Joshua\n had built the first altar. The continuance and growth of this\n controversy produced that mortal antipathy between the two\n nations to which there is more than one allusion in the New\n Testament. (Luke ix. 51-56 ; John iv. 9-29 ; viii. 48.)\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. It was in the time of Jaddua that the great event arrived\n which had long been foreshewn in the prophetic visions of Dan-\n iel (ii. 39 ; xi. 4). The great victory over the Persian king, at\n Issus, opened up the south to Alexander the Great, who com-\n menced operations in Syria, and, while engaged in the siege of\n Tyre, summoned the neighbouring nations to render their sub-\n mission. The Samaritans obeyed the summons very early, and\n were treated with indulgence ; but it does not seem that any\n attention was paid to it by the Jews. Therefore, after he had\n destroyed Tyre, he turned aside on his way to Gaza, to march\n against Jerusalem. As he approached, his hostile purposes are\n said to have been averted by an imposing and submissive pro-\n cesssion of the priests and citizens, headed by the high priest in\n his pontifical robes. In him the conqueror is said to have re-\n cognized the person who in a dream had foretold to him the\n conquest of the Persian empire. If so, it was quite in the pow-\n er of Jaddua to fulfil this dream by shewing him these pro-\n phecies of Daniel, in which his existence and victories had been\n clearly foretold. That the high-priest did bring these prophe-\n cies to his knowledge, may account for the favour with which\n the Jews, notwithstanding the tardiness of their submission,\n were treated by Alexander. At their request, he secured to\n them the undisturbed enjoyment of their national laws and ex-\n emption from tribute every seventh year ; but he demurred\n when the latter privilege was also sought by the Samaritans.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0165/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0165/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0165/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0165/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0165/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0165.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 553448}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"165\">\n<p>\n 157\n</p>\n<p>\n B.

It is our purpose not to\n relate the particulars of these contests, but to glean from them the\n facts which directly affected the condition of the Jewish people.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. In the first division of Alexander\u2019s empire, Syria with Pa-\n lestine devolved to Laomedon, and Egypt to Ptolemy Lagus.\n Between them a war arose, and the former was defeated by\n Nicanor, one of the generals of Ptolemy. All the provinces of\n Laomedon then submitted to Ptolemy ; but the Jews manifest-\n ed so much reluctance to violate their engagements, that Ptole-\n my advanced against Jerusalem with a large army and laid\n close siege to the city. Knowing that the religious veneration\n of the Jews for the Sabbath prevented them from fighting on\n that day, he assaulted and took the city on the Sabbath. But\n he did not treat them with severity ; for although he sent a large\n number of. Jews into Egypt, it was rather as colonists than as\n prisoners. Indeed, before this, many Jews had been removed\n to Egypt by Alexander, to help to people his new city of Alex-\n andria, where they were allowed civic privileges of the first\n class,. the same as the Greek inhabitants enjoyed, These pri-\n vileges were confirmed by Ptolemy, who also advanced many\n of those he took away to places of authority and trust, in con-\n sequence of which many more went to Egypt of their own ac-\n cord. Eight years after, Ptolemy transported another large\n body of them, whom he settled in the provinces of Lybia and\n Cyrene. By successive deportations of this description, and\n by the voluntary removals of Jews, who sought under the sha-\n dow of the Egyptian throne the peace which they could not find\n in their own country, Egypt became, and long continued, an\n important seat of the Jewish population.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. Sacred Writers . \u2014 The book of Nehemiah has the singu-\n</p>\n<p>\n larity of being written in the first person, and was, therefore,\n without doubt, the production of the eminent man whose name\n it bears. It gives a clear and plain account of his administra-\n tion, and has, more than any other portion of Scripture, the ef-\n fect of an autobiographical narrative. Malachi, the last of the\n prophets, belonged to the time of Nehemiah. Nothing what-\n ever is known of him. He reproved the abuses which Nehe-\n miah laboured to correct. It is remarkable that his prophecy\n closes the Old Testament with an announcement of John the\n Baptist, with whose birth and ministry the history of the New\n Testament opens. o\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0166/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0166/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0166/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0166/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0166/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0166.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 490084}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"166\">\n<p>\n 158\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER V.

His dominion extended from the Euxine to\n the borders of Arabia, and from the Mediterranean to the Indus.\n His eastern capital was Seleucus on the Tigris, aud his west-\n ern Antioch. Both these cities, and many others, were found-\n ed by him. Being, like Ptolemy, convinced of the value of\n the Jews as good and faithful citizens, he endeavoured to\n attract them to his new cities in Asia Minor by the offer of\n the same privileges as Ptolemy had allowed them in Egypt.\n Many Jews accepted the invitation ; and hence, in later periods,\n we find them established in considerable numbers in the prin-\n cipal cities of Asia Minor as well as of Egypt.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Ptolemy Philadelphus sncceeded his father Ptolemy Lagus\n in B. C. 285. He confirmed to the Jews all their former privi-\n leges. He induced large numbers of them to settle in Egypt,\n and to promote that object ransomed many who had been sold\n for slaves. This king was a great patron of literature, and\n spared no cost in procuring curious books for the famous library\n which he established at Alexandria. He caused the Hebrew\n Scriptures to be translated into Greek, and deposited in that li-\n brary. This important translation still exists under the name of\n the Septuagint, from the tradition that seventy persons were\n employed in the translation. The prophecies of the Hebrew\n books had lately attracted some attention, and the authentic his-\n tory of a people so closely connected with Egypt as the Jews,\n must have been deemed interesting. These were probably the\n reasons which led Philadelphus to desire this translation. By\n its means the religion of the Jews became better known to the\n heathen, and we afterwards hear of magnificent presents being\n sent by them to the temple of Jerusalem. The translation may\n be referred to the year B. C. 278 : a correct copy of the original\n also was provided by the care of Eleazer the high-priest, son of\n Simon the Just.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4.

Unfortunately the beauty and rich-\n ness of the building attracted his attention, and he desired to\n view the interior. This was resisted by the high-priest Simon\n II. who informed him that it was unlawful even for the priests\n to enter the inner sanctuary. The king persisted; but as he\n was walking across the inner court to enter the sacred place, a\n sudden dread and horror came over him, and he fell speechless\n to the ground. He was carried out, half dead by his attendants.\n This circumstance \" acting upon an ill constituted mind, filled the\n king with great resentment against the Jewish people, and, on\n his return to Egypt, he raised a bitter persecution against those\n who had settled in that kingdom. He took away their high\n privileges, and caused them to be enrolled with the lowest class\n of the native Egyptians ; and many were, on various alleged\n grounds, consigned to slavery and to death. It is even said that\n he contemplated the extirpation of the Jewish race, and that\n beginning with those of Egypt, he caused a large number of\n them to be brought together at Alexandria, with the view of\n having them publicly destroyed by elephants in the hippodrome.\n A vast multitude of people assembled to view the horrid spec-\n tacle, and the king himself was present with his court. The\n elephants, to render them furious, had been previously inebria-\n ted with wine and frankincense ; but instead of slaying the vic-\n tims exposed to their rage, they turned their fury upon the\n spectators, of whom great numbers were destroyed, while the\n Jews remained altogether unhurt. Public opinion recognized\n in this an interposition of Heaven in their behalf ; and we are\n told that Philopater desisted from his designs, and restored to\n the Jews their former privileges. The whole of this account,\n however, rests on authority in which implicit confidence cannot\n be placed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Philopater died in B.

Considering their general at-\n tachment to Egypt, this must be accounted for by their resent-\n ment at the treatment of Philopater, and by their satisfaction\n at the kindness and liberality of Antiochus to the numerous\n Jews who were settled in his dominions on both sides of the\n Euphrates. Antiochus was much gratified by the proofs of at-\n tachment which he received ; and when he visited Jerusalem\n in B.

Of this number was Jesus, the brother of\n the high-priest Onias, whose predilections were manifested by\n the Greek name of Jason which he assumed. He offered a\n large sum of money for the high priesthood to Antiochus Epi-\n phanes, who succeeded Seleucus Philopater in B. C. 175. His\n offer was accepted. Onias was called to Antioch, and kept there\n a prisoner at large, and Jason took his place. The party which\n gathered around this man was considerable ; for not only was\n there among the educated classes a strong leaning towards the\n Greek customs, to which he was known to be favourable, but\n the citizenship of Antioch, which he had been empowered to\n bestow, was to them an object of great desire. Jason delayed\n not to establish at Jerusalem a gymnasium for athletic exercises,\n which soon became so popular, that even the priests neglected\n the temple services to be present at the games. Jason also\n established an academy for bringing up the Hebrew youth after\n the manner of the Greeks ; and by every kind of influence he\n encouraged the adoption of Greek customs and habits, not only\n of external life, but of action and thought. It appears, however,\n that the Jews generally, and even his own adherents, were not\n prepared to go so far as himself; and when he sent some young\n men to Tyre, to assist at the games celebrated there in honour\n of the Tyrian Hercules, and entrusted them with large sums of\n money to expend in sacrifices to that idol, they chose rather to\n give the money for the building of ships. Jason did not long\n enjoy his ill-gotten dignity ; for after three years he was sup-\n planted in turn by his younger brother, Onias IV., or Menelaus,\n who offered the king three hundred talents more for that dig-\n nity than Jason had given. Jason fled to the country of the\n Ammonites. Menelaus proved even more wicked than his\n brother. One of his first acts was to abstract some of the gold-\n en vessels of the temple, and to send them secretly to Tyre for\n sale. The fact, however, transpired, and excited considerable\n ferment, especially among the numerous Jews art Antioch, where\n the exiled high-priest, the venerable Onias, took such notice of\n it as gave deep offence to his brother, who prevailed on Andro-\n nicus, the king\u2019s deputy at Antioch, to put him to death; for\n which deed Andronicus was nimself slain on the same spot by\n order of the king when he returned to the capital.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Soon after Antiochus engaged in a war with Egypt. He\n invaded that country twice with success; but a rumour of his\n death was believed in Palestine. This, together with the ab-\n sence of the Syrian forces, encouraged the exiled Jason to at-\n tempt the recovery of his lost power. With a body of one\n thousand men, assisted by friends within the city, he surprised\n Jerusalem, and inflicted great severities upon the adherents of\n Menelaus, who himself sought refuge in the castle.

He bent his\n proud heart to the hard task of obedience, and turned homeward\n with the formidable army he had assembled for this enterprise.\n Burning with the sense of his disgrace, he failed not to wreak\n a portion of his wrath on the Jews as he returned.

Apollonius entered the city peaceably, and\n gave no sign of his intentions until the first Sabbath-day after\n his arrival. Then, while the people were engaged in the solemn\n worship of the Most High, he executed this dreadful commission\n with unrelenting ferocity. After having slain great multitudes\n of the people, and sent away ten thousand captives, he plunder-\n ed the city, after which it was set on fire, and the wall demo-\n lished.

C. 168.\n</p>\n<p>\n against the Jewish people ; but it is more probable, that his ob-\n ject was to find a pretext for plundering the temples of the re-\n cusants ; and as the temples were, from their sanctity, the great\n banks of deposit in those times, their spoils offered great temp-\n tations to so needy a king as Antiochus. Although the temple\n of the Jews had been already plundered, his hatred to that peo-\n ple was gratified by the sufferings in which this law involved\n them ; and so rigidly was it enforced, that death was the pe-\n nalty of disobedience. What reception this decree met with\n among the heathen, is scarcely known ; but except the Jews\n and the Persians there were few nations likely to offer any seri-\n ous opposition. Officers were especially appointed to enforce\n the decree in every province. In the different towns, many of\n the Jews submitted to sacrifice to idols, and to profane the Sab-\n bath. The Samaritans consented to receive the statue of Jupi-\n ter Xenius into their temple on Mount Gerizim ; and the temple\n of God at Jerusalem was dedicated to Jupiter Olympius, his\n statue placed therein, and sacrifices regularly offered to him.\n Such of the Jews as refused to share in this worship, or to\n evince their conformity by eating swine\u2019s flesh, were cruelly\n massacred, or subjected to the most exquisite tortures. The\n same proceedings were repeated in other towns ; for the idol\n altars, groves, and statues were everywhere set up, and every-\n where the tests of obedience were exacted. It was not long,\n however, before Antiochus perceived that, in as far as the Jews\n were concerned, his decree was less effectual than he had ex-\n pected. He therefore issued another decree, forbidding, under\n pain of death, the worship of Jehovah, and the observance of\n the distinctive requirements of the Mosaical law, such as cir-\n cumcision and the Sabbath. He went further, and endeavoured\n to extinguish the law itself, forbidding it to be read, and com-\n manding every copy to be given up under pain of death. It was\n in this emergency that the Jews commenced reading lessons\n from the prophets instead of the law, in their synagogues ;\n and when afterwards they resumed the reading of the law,\n they did not cease to read the prophets ; whence arose the sub-\n sequent use of both in their synagogues. Many, as we have\n said, apostatized under these trying circumstances ; but many\n also were found faithful to the death, and many others went\n forth to wander in deserts and in mountains, in dens and caves\n of the earth, subsisting on such herbs and roots as they could\n find in those solitary places.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Astonished at the obstinacy which the Jews manifested,\n Antiochus, mistrusting the zeal of his officers, repaired himself\n to Jerusalem to see that his decree was rigidly enforced. It\n were charity to suppose that Antiochus Epiphane? had by this\n time become mad ; for it is difficult otherwise to imagine how\n any human creature would endure to witness, much less to take\n delight in, the horrid tortures and cruel deaths to which the un-\n happy recusants were subjected.

The standard of revolt being now erected, all who were\n zealous for liberty and truth repaired to it, so that Mattathias\n soon found himself sufficiently strong to act on the offensive.\n They then left their retreat, and went, chiefly by night, through-\n out the country, pulling down the idolatrous altars, and destroy-\n ing their persecutors wherever they met with them. They also\n re-opened the synagogues, enforced the rites enjoined by the\n law, and recovered many of the sacred books which had fallen\n into the hands of the heathen.

With a force not exceeding 6000 men he took the field\n against the large and well-disciplined armies of Antiochus, com-\n manded by warriors of reputation, and defeated them all. In\n the first instance, the defeat of Apollonius the governor of Sa-\n maria, enabled him to make himself master of some of the prin-\n cipal towns and fortresses of Judaea, from which he expelled\n the Jews who had turned to idolatry. Then a powerful army\n under a great general called Seron, took the field against Judas.\n After encouraging his men, who were somewhat alarmed at\n the immense disparity of numbers, the hero fell upon the en-\n emy with great fury, so that their force was broken and they\n fled before him. This victory made the name of Judas renown-\n ed in all the neighbouring states. Antiochus himself saw that\n this revolt required more attention than he had given to it, and\n resolving to crush it, he repeatedly sent formidable armies into\n Judaea, commanded by his most able officers. But the valiant\n Maccabeus maintained his ground, and in one year defeated the\n Syrians five times, in as many pitched battles. The last of\n these engagements was with Lysias, the regent of Syria, dur-\n ing the absence of Antiochus in Persia, whose army amounted\n to 60,000 choice infantry and 5000 horse.

The army\n which was raised for this purpose, was evidently intended to\n extinguish the nation. It consisted of 100,000 foot, 20,000 horse,\n 32 war elephants, and 300 chariots armed with scythes. With\n this mighty host, Lysias proceeded southward and besieged\n Bethsura, a strong fortress which had been built to protect the\n frontier towards Idumaea. Judas could not induce his men to\n risk a pitched battle with such a host: but they fell upon the\n invaders by night, and before they knew who had entered their\n camp, four thousand of them were dead men.

But at this junc-\n ture the regent received intelligence that Philip, a rival regent,\n whom the late king had appointed on his death-bed, had en-\n tered Syria with a large army, and had taken possession of An-\n tioch. He therefore concluded a treaty with the Jews, grant-\n ing all their demands.

This commander entered the country without\n any hostile manifestations ; and many Jews, who, relying on\n his fair professions, had put themselves into his power, were\n treacherously slain. Bacchides then, having met with no op-\n position, left the country in charge of Alcimus, with a force\n considered sufficient to secure him in his place. But he had\n no sooner withdrawn, than Judas, who had retired before him,\n appeared again, and easily recovered the position which he had\n seemed for the moment to abandon. Alcimus, being unable to\n offer any effectual resistance, again repaired to Antioch, with\n renewed and more earnest complaints to the king. Another\n and more powerful army was accordingly sent into Judaea, un-\n der Nicador. He was twice defeated by Judas, \u2014 the last time\n so completely, that of 35,000 men, not one escaped alive to\n bear the tidings to Antioch. This great victory procured the\n nation an interval of rest, and was deemed of so much impor-\n tance by the Jews, that they established an annual festival of\n commemoration. (1 Macc. vii. 4 \u2014 50 ; 2 Macc. xiv. 2 \u2014 16; xv.\n 1\u201437).\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. A step was then taken by Judas, which some have prais-\n ed, and others blamed ; but which will probably be considered,\n by those who are the most intimately acquainted with the his-\n tory of the time, to be the best which could have been taken\n under all the circumstances. He sent an embassy to Rome, to\n solicit the friendship of that powerful nation, whose influence\n had for some time been paramount in Syria and in Egypt. It\n quite consisted with the policy of the Roman senate to weaken\n the great states, by forming alliances with the lesser nations\n which depended on them. The Jewish ambassadors were\n therefore received with favour, and the Romans readily con-\n cluded a treaty, which could not possibly be injurious to them-\n selves, and might yet be of some advantage to the Jews. The\n immediate result of this alliance was, that the senate sent a\n missive to Demetrius, commanding him, on pain of their dis-\n pleasure, to abstain from persecuting the Jews in time to come.\n But before the ambassadors returned, the valiant Judas had met\n his death, in a desperate conflict with Bacchides and Alcimus,\n who had been sent to avenge the destruction of Mcanor and\n his host. The brothers of Judas, Simon and Jonathan, having\n made a truce, deposited the body of the hero in the family\n sepulere at Modin, which was not far off, and all Israel mourn-\n ed for many days, crying \u201c How is the valiant fallen, that de-\n livered Israel !\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The death of their great leader threw the Jews into such\n consternation, that the Syrians easily reaped the fruits of their\n victory. They reduced Jerusalem, and slew many of the adhe-\n rents of the Maccabees ; and Alcimus was once more restored\n to the high-priesthood.

He made many in-\n novations in the religion of his country, in order to produce a\n greater conformity to the practices of the heathen. At length,\n with the view of admitting the Gentiles equally with the Jews\n to the inner courts of the temple, he proceeded to break down\n the separating wall, when he was suddenly cut off in the full\n career of his guilt, and died in the most dreadful agonies. On\n the occurrence of this event, Bacchides, who had remained in\n the country, returned to Syria, and the Jews were left for two\n years unmolested. Jonathan, the youngest brother of Judas,\n who had been elected by the orthodox Jews as their prince and\n leader in his place, employed this interval in establishing a re-\n gular government, and in effecting various important reforms in\n the civil and ecclesiastical affairs of his country.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. After two years, the adverse faction, growing uneasy at\n the prospect of continued peace, recommenced their operations.\n They conspired to seize Jonathan, and all his adherents through-\n out the land, in one night ; and invited Bacchides to aid their\n project by a military force. This became known to Jonathan,\n who, after putting fifty of the leading conspirators to death,\n withdrew with Simon and his friends to Bethbasi in the wild-\n erness, not feeling strong enough to meet Bacchides in the field.\n This was a strong post ; and the dilapidated fortifications hav-\n ing been put into complete repair, the besieged were enabled\n to hold out so long, and so to harass the enemy by daring sal-\n lies and excursions, that Bacchides at length grew weary of an\n expedition from which so little honour was to be won, and put\n those to death who had engaged him in it. In this mood he\n listened to the overtures of peace made by Jonathan, and, after\n an exchange of prisoners, withdrew his forces, engaging to\n trouble the land no more.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Three years after this, a conjuncture of affairs arose in\n Syria highly favourable to the Jewish cause. A claim was set\n up by Alexander Balas to the crown of Syria, which not only\n gave the reigning king, Demetrius, sufficient employment for\n all his disposable forces, but made it the interest of the compe-\n titors to outbid each other for the support and favour of so war-\n like a people as the Jews had now become. Jonathan had,\n meanwhile, been proceeding quietly with his improvements\n and repairs, which, while they enhanced his reputation, gave\n the promise of stability to his government. When the compe-\n titors began to court his friendship, the remembrance of the\n wrongs which Demetrius had inflicted upon the nation, no less\n than good policy, induced him to espouse the cause of Alexan-\n der, who, in return, offered him the high-priesthood. That of-\n fice had been vacant for seven years, and with the unanimous\n consent and approbation of the people, it was accepted by Jon-\n athan.

As Jonathan had remained true to Balas in this struggle,\n his enemies hailed the success of Demetrius Nicator as the sig-\n nal for his overthrow; and through their representations, he\n was summoned to Antioch. He went, carrying with him val-\n uable presents, and conducted himself so discreetly, that so far\n from disturbing him, Demetrius not only confirmed him in the\n dignities he had received from Balas, but added all the valua-\n ble privileges which had been offered by his father, when he\n endeavoured to outbid Balas for the friendship of Jonathan.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. Among his other public acts, Jonathan renewed the trea-\n ty with the Romans, and formed another with the Lacedaemo-\n nians. His government of seventeen years was in the highest\n degree beneficial to his country, and tended much to give to the\n peculiar institutions of the people, which he laboured to reno-\n vate, that determined character which was essential to their\n continuance. His end was afflicting. Disgusted by the perfidy\n of Demetrius, the Jews eagerly espoused the cause of a young\n son of Alexander Balas, who was brought forward by Tryphon,\n formerly governor of Antioch. Eventually this youth was rais-\n ed to the throne, under the name of Antiochus Epiphanes. But\n Tryphon had used him only for his own objects, and contempla-\n ted his removal to make room for himself. To this he saw an\n obstacle in the known attachment of Jonathan to the house of\n Balas ; and this obstacle he resolved to remove by his death,\n which he treacherously and barbarously accomplished at Ptole-\n mais, where Jonathan was slain, with a thousand men who at-\n tended him as guards. This was speedily followed by the mur-\n der of the young king ; and Tryphon placed on his own head\n the blood-stained crown.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0181/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0181/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0181/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0181/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0181/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0181.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 481692}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"181\">\n<p>\n 173\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER III.

The people\n were encouraged and animated bv the terms in which the of-\n fer was made, and they accepted it with joy. The first act of\n Simon was to put the country in a state of complete defence,\n by repairing all the fortresses, and storing them with provi-\n sions and munitions of war. Then considering, that, bad as the\n conduct of Demetrius Nicator had been, that of Tryphon was\n much worse, Simon sent an embassy to the former offering to\n acknowledge his sovereignty, and to assist him against Try-\n phon. Demetrius, who led an indolent and dissipated life at\n Laodicea, and left the war to his generals, saw the value of\n this offer, which he gladly accepted, and, in return, agreed to\n acknowledge Simon as the high-priest and prince of the Jews,\n to relinquish all claim upon them for tribute, customs, and tax-\n es, and to grant an amnesty for all past offences against him-\n self. This being committed to writing in the form of a royal\n edict, and properly ratified, amounted to a charter of freedom\n and independence ; and was so considered by both parties. Ac-\n cordingly, with this year (B. C. 143), the Jews commenced a\n new epoch, dating from it as from the first year of \u201c the freedom\n of Jerusalem. \u2019\u2019 This era is used on the coins of Silicon, as well\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0182/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0182/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0182/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0182/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0182/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0182.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 561445}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"182\">\n<p>\n 174 JERUSALEM BESIEGED BY ANTIOCHUS.

The next care of Simon was to reduce the fortresses which\n still held out ; and he had the inexpressible satisfaction of com-\n pelling the Syrian garrison in the citadel of Jerusalem, which\n had so long been a standing grievance to the Maccabees, to\n surrender. He made his son John commander of the forces,\n and ultimately sent him with king Demetrius to the wars in the\n East, where, from his exploits in Hyrcania, he acquired the\n surname ofHyrcanus. In the third year of his reign, he renew-\n ed the alliance with the Romans and Lacedaemonians, and sent\n as a present to the former, a great shield of gold, worth fifty\n thousand pounds. The senate was pleased, and wrote to all\n the kings in these parts, commanding them to consider the\n Jews as friends and allies of the Romans. The next year (B.\n C. 140), Antiochus Sidetes ascended the Syrian throne, his\n brother Demetrius being held in bondage by the Parihians. He\n confirmed to Simon all the grants of his predecessor, and added\n the regal prerogative of coining money. When, however, he\n had subdued and slain the usurper Tryphon, he altered his tone,\n and demanded back the strongholds which Simon had taken,\n and the tribute which had been relinquished. He sent a pow-\n erful army to enforce his demand ; which was met and defeat-\n ed by the Jews under the conduct of Simon\u2019s two eldest sons,\n John and Judas. This victory procured an interval of repose,\n during which Simon and two of his sons were treacherously\n murdered, while on a visit at Jericho to his son-in law, Ptole-\n my, who aspired to his office and power (B. C. 136). He sent\n also to destroy John Hyrcanus, who, however, had timely warn-\n ing, and fled to Jerusalem, where the people elected him in\n his father\u2019s room, and shut their gates against the murderer.\n Baffled in this, Ptolemy applied to Antiochus for an army to\n assist him in bringing the country again under the Syrian yoke.\n Without waiting for his movements, Hyrcanus marched against\n him, and besieged him in a fortress near Jericho, to which he\n had fled. The siege was, however, broken up when the sab-\n batical year opened, and Ptolemy sought refuge beyond the Jor-\n dan until Antiochus should arrive (B. C. 135).

When the feast of taber-\n nacles approached, Hyrcanus begged a week\u2019s respite for the\n celebration of the festival. This was not only granted, but the\n king supplied rations for the sacrifices, and was in the end so\n much mollified that he concluded a peace, although he knew\n that the city lay at his mercy.

He, with the principal men of the par-\n ty, which had been paramount in the time of his father, ap-\n peared before the throne, and asked permission to quit the coun-\n try, or to reside in the frontier towns, out of the way of the\n Pharisees. The request was granted, excepting that they were\n not permitted to withdraw to those towns in which the queen\n kept her treasures. Aristobulus was afterwards entrusted with\n some force to relieve Damascus; but he only used the occasion\n as an opportunity of making himself agreeable to the soldiers,\n and returned without having done any thing of importance.\n After a peaceful reign of nine years, queen Alexandra fell sick,\n and died, after having in her last days, as one who had noth-\n ing more to do with government, refused to nominate her suc-\n cessor.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The Pharisees, however, placed Hyrcanus II. on the throne.\n But he reigned only three months; for his brother Aristobulus,\n having possession of most of the fortresses of the kingdom, dur-\n ing the illness of his mother, advanced his own claims to the\n sovereignty.

Aretas espoused his\n cause, brought him back to Judaea with an army of 50,000 men ;\n and being joined by many Jews of the same party, he gave\n battle to Aristobulus, who was defeated, and obliged to retreat\n to the temple-mount, which had by this time become a strong\n fortress. The siege of this fortress was carried on with the\n animosity which was usual in civil wars. Heathen kings had\n almost invariably, during a siege, allowed the lambs for sacri-\n fice at the great festivals to be introduced into the temple ; hut\n this was refused by the party of Hyrcanus, at the passover, al-\n though Aristobulus gave, over the walls, money to pay for\n them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. At this time, the Romans, in accordance with the national\n policy for establishing a universal empire, had a large army in\n Asia, under the command of the great Pompey, who was war-\n ring in Armenia against Tigranes and Mithridates, while some\n of his officers were employed in Syria. In this emergency,\n Aristobulus sent to Severus the Roman general, who had taken\n possession of Damascus, imploring his assistance against his\n brother, not forgetting to send a present of 400 talents with the\n application. Although Hyrcanus offered to buy his aid at the\n same price, the Roman preferred the cause of Aristobulus, as\n one whom it might be the most easy to assist, and the most\n easy to subdue : and, therefore, he commanded Aretas instantly\n to withdraw his forces from Judaea, under pain of a war with\n the Romans. The Arabian king obeyed at once ; but on his re-\n treat he was overtaken by Aristobulus, and was defeated in a\n bloody conflict, in which many of the friends of Hyrcanus per-\n ished. Being thus master of the country, Aristobulus anxious-\n ly endeavoured to procure from the Romans a recognition of his\n title. Accordingly, when Pompey soon after came to Damascus,\n and twelve kings and many ambassadors appeared before him,\n the ambassadors of Aristobulus were among the number, bear-\n ing, as a present, an exquisitely wrought vine of pure gold,\n valued at 500 talents. His suit was waived for the time,\n and although his present was accepted, not his own name but\n that of his father was inscribed upon it, as the donor.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The next year, when both Hyrcanus and Aristobulus sent\n ambassadors to Pompey, inviting him to consider and decide\n their difference, he put them off to the year ensuing, when\n they again appeared before him, each furnished with a multi-\n tude of witnesses to prove his claim; while another body of\n Jews came and accused both of having changed the govern-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0188/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0188/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0188/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0188/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0188/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0188.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 576857}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"188\">\n<p>\n 180\n</p>\n<p>\n JUDJEA SUBJECTED TO THE ROMANS.

Hyrcanus urged his right as the elder born ;\n which right, Aristobulus contended, was neutralized by his in-\n competency.

But the impetuous Aristobulus, perceiving that\n imbecility in a dependent prince was far from being objection-\n able to the Romans, and that the ultimate decision was likely\n to be against him, abruptly withdrew to make preparations\n for war. Enraged at this, Pompey, on his return from an ex-\n pedition against the Nabathaean Arabs, marched into Judaea,\n and summoned Aristobulus, who was in the strong fortress of\n Alexandrium, to appear before him. He obeyed ; and Pompey\n no sooner had him in his power, than he compelled him to\n sign an order for all the fortresses to be given up to the Ro-\n mans.

But\n when Pompey advanced, the gates were opened to his troops\n by the party of Hyrcanus; and Aristobulus and his party with-\n drew once more into the temple, determined to hold out to the\n last. Here they were closely besieged by Pompey, who found\n his proceedings greatly facilitated by the strictness with which\n the Jewish people observed their Sabbath. It was true, that\n since the Maccabsean wars, they would on that day stand on\n their own defence; yet they still considered it unlawful to take\n any steps to hinder the works or operations of the enemy. The\n Romans were, therefore, allowed, without the slightest moles-\n tation, to carry on during the Sabbath-days their preparations\n for the assaults of the ensuing weeks ; by which means they\n at length carried the temple by assault, after a siege of three\n months, on the very day which the Jews observed as a fast for\n the taking of the city and temple by Nebuchadnezzar. A\n dreadful carnage now ensued, during which the officiating\n priests continued, with the utmost composure, their solemn ser-\n vices at the altar, until they were themselves smitten down\n before it without resistance.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6.

In the sanctuary, Pompey noted with a cu-\n rious eye the objects presented to his view ; but he left un-\n touched all the sacred utensils, and even the treasures of the\n temple, which amounted to ten thousand talents of gold. The\n walls and fortifications of Jerusalem were then demolished by\n order of Pompey ; who also made no ceremony in reducing the\n recent \u201c allies \u201d of Rome to the condition of a tributary people.\n He indeed appointed Hyrcanus to be high-priest and prince of\n the country ; but he required him to pay tribute to the Romans,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0189/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0189/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0189/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0189/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0189/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0189.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 534482}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"189\">\n<p>\n THE SANHEDRIM ABOLISHED.\n</p>\n<p>\n 181\n</p>\n<p>\n b. c. 57.]\n</p>\n<p>\n and forbade him to assume the crown, or extend his territories\n beyond their ancient limits.

Alexander, the eldest son of Aristobulus, escaped from\n Pompey during the journey to Rome, and got back to his own\n country. He must, however, have kept quiet for a time, as we\n do not hear of him till the year B. C. 57, when he had found\n means to collect a considerable force, with which he seized and\n garrisoned several strong fortresses, and from them ravaged the\n whole country. Hyrcanus had no means to oppose him, and\n as Jerusalem would probably be the next point of attack, he\n wished to rebuild the walls of the city, but he was forbidden\n by the jealousy of the Romans. On his calling upon them for\n succour, however, the pro-consul, Gabinius, marched an army\n into Judaea, and was accompanied by the celebrated Mark An-\n thony, the commander of his cavalry. The Roman troops were\n joined by those of Hyrcanus, under Antipater ; and in the battle\n which followed, Alexander was completely routed. He sought\n refuge in the strong fortress of Alexandrium, whence, through\n the mediation of his mother, he concluded a peace with Gabi-\n nius, on condition of surrendering the fortresses held by him,\n which were then demolished.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The general then employed himself in settling the country,\n after the manner of the Romans. He was probably, in many\n respects, guided by the advice of Antipater, who made it his\n policy to ingratiate himself with the Romans. The most im-\n portant measure was the change of the government to an aris-\n tocracy. Before this, the administration of affairs had been con-\n ducted by two sanhedrim, or councils, or courts of justice \u2014 the\n lesser consisting of twenty-three members, existed in every\n city, and all these local sanhedrims were subject to the jurisdic-\n tion of the Grand Sanhedrim of seventy-two members, which\n sat at Jerusalem. These were put down by Gabinius, who, in\n their place, established five separate and independent tribunals,\n \u2014 at Jerusalem, Jericho, Gadara, Amathus, and Sephoris\u2014 giving\n to each the power of administering summary justice upon the\n inhabitants of the several districts. This threw the whole\n power into the hands of the nobles, who presided in these\n courts, whereas by the former practice the power had ulti-\n mately centered in the prince. This, or anything that lowered\n the regal principle, was no doubt acceptable to the Jews in ge-\n neral ; for they were unwilling to have any king not of the house\n of David to reign over them, especially as they were now anx-\n iously expecting the appearance of the promised Messiah.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0190/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0190/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0190/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0190/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0190/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0190.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 449241}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"190\">\n<p>\n 182\n</p>\n<p>\n ANTIPATER.\n</p>\n<p>\n [b.

But he was poisoned in the way by the\n adherents of Pompey ; by whom also his son, Alexander, who\n had begun to raise forces to assist his father, was seized,\n brought to Antioch, and after a mock trial, beheaded. Two\n years after, the surviving son, Antigonus, presented himself be-\n fore Caesar when he returned, through Judea, from his cam-\n paign in Egypt, and solicited to be restored to the principality\n of his father. He mentioned the claims of his family, its\n wrongs, and how much it had suffered in his cause. But Cse-\n sar was now under a new influence, and he therefore not only\n rejected the petition, but treated it as an impertinence. The\n new influence was that of Antipater, who swayed the real pow-\n er of the province in the name of Hyrcanus. He had employed\n that power and the near resources of a neighbour, so much to\n the advantage of the Romans in this campaign, he had devo-\n ted himself so sedulously to Csesar, and, withal, he had found\n occasion to display so much valour and conduct, that Caesar felt\n grateful to him, and held him in high estimation.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Antipater failed not to employ, for the advancement of his\n own fortunes, the influence he had thus acquired. Caesar was\n induced to confirm to Hyrcanus the full and ancient powers of\n the high priesthood and the ethnarchate. This had the effect\n of indirectly restoring the real character of the government,\n which had been impaired by the measures of Gabinius, and of\n destroying the independent jurisdictions which he had esta-\n blished. To do this, and to do it without a direct decree against\n a popular measure, appears to have been the real object of the\n restoration. Hyrcanus personally derived no increase of power\n from it ; for at the same time Antipater himself, who had before\n been admitted to the dignity of Roman citizenship, was appoint-\n ed Roman procurator of Judaea, which vested in him all the\n substantial powers of the state. Caesar also granted permis-\n sion for rebuilding the walls of Jerusalem which Pompey had\n destroyed ; and at this and other times, such other signal mea-\n sures were, through Antipater, bestowed by Caesar upon the\n Jewish nation, that in his time the weight of the Roman yoke\n was scarcely felt. One of the first acts of the new procurator\n was to raise his two sons, Phasael and Herod, to stations of trust\n and distinction. Herod was made governor of Galilee, and\n Phasael governor of Jerusalem. The former exercised him-\n self in clearing his province of the bands of daring robbers by\n which it was infested. But his mode of action was so sove-\n reign and arbitrary as to excite the notice of the Sanhedrim,\n which summoned him to Jerusalem to give an account of his\n conduct. He came indeed, but he came clothed in purple, with\n a numerous retinue, and bearing a letter from the president of\n Syria, with express orders for his acquittal. This, with his\n haughty and imperious carriage, quite intimidated the assem-\n bly, until an address from one of their number kindled their re-\n sentment as well at his past as present conduct.

Burn-\n ing with resentment, Herod would have marched to Jerusalem\n to punish the Sanhedrim and depose Hyrcanus, had not his fa-\n ther and brother persuaded him to abandon the design.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The greater struggles and confusions in the state of Rome\n were accompanied by smaller conflicts and troubles in Syria\n and Palestine ; but in all these, it was the lot of the family of\n Antipater to be always uppermost. After the assassination of\n Julius Caesar at Rome by Brutus, Cassius, and their confede-\n rates, and of his relative Sextus Caesar in Syria by Bassus, the\n flames of war broke forth anew. Cassius being, like others,\n obliged to withdraw before the paramount influence of Anthony\n and Octavius in Italy, passed over into Syria, and, seizing that\n province, made head there against the pro-consul Dolabella.\n Cassius was obliged to raise heavy contributions to maintain\n the large army he had collected. Judsea was assessed in 700\n talents; and Antipater commissioned Herod to* raise one half,\n and Malichus, one of the principal supporters of Hyrcanus, to\n collect the other. Herod won high favour with Cassius by the\n speedy payment of his portion ; but Malichus, being more dila-\n tory, would have been put to death, had not Hyrcanus redeem-\n ed him by paying 100 talents out of his own coffers. This af-\n fair seems to have quickened the bad feeling with which Mali-\n chus and other leading Jews regarded the power and authority\n which Antipater had acquired and was acquiring over the na-\n tion. They therefore plotted to destroy him and his whole fa-\n mily ; and soon after Antipater was poisoned with a glass of\n wine, which the high-priest\u2019s brother was induced to give him\n at an entertainment in the palace. Herod avenged his father,\n by inducing Cassius to order Malichus to be slain at Tyre by\n the Roman soldiers. The party of which Malichus had been\n the head, countenanced by Hyrcanus himself, then made a ve-\n hement struggle to relieve themselves from the grasp of An-\n tipater\u2019s sons. They failed, and the failure gave the more\n strength to Herod and Phasael. Herod upbraided Hyrcanus for\n the part he had taken in this affair; but he did not come to an\n open rupture with him, as he wished to bring into his own fa-\n mily the claims of the Asamonean house by a marriage with\n Mariamne, the high-priest\u2019s accomplished and beautiful grand-\n daughter.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The party adverse to Herod and Phasael, was, however,\n far from being extinct. It soon found another and more dange-\n rous head in the person of Antigonus, that younger son of Aris-\n tobulus, whom there has been more than one occasion to men-\n tion. He came to claim his father\u2019s throne; and his claim\n was well supported. But when Antigonus arrived in Judsea\n With his army, he received from Herod a complete overthrow.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0193/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0193/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0193/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0193/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0193/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0193.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 541028}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"193\">\n<p>\n B.

A deputation, composed of\n a hundred influential Jews, came to him at Daphne, near Anti-\n och, with complaints against the usurping sons of Antipater.\n Anthony gave them a hearing, and then turning to Hyrcanus,\n who was present, asked whom he thought the most competent\n to govern the state under himself? To the surprise of many, he\n named the two brothers, influenced possibly by the projected\n marriage between Herod and his grand-daughter. On this, An-\n thony, who had received gifts from Herod, and who well re-\n membered the services of Antipater, raised Herod and Phasael\n to the rank of tetrarchs, and committed the affairs of Judaea to\n their administration. Not long after, however, when Anthony\n was at Tyre, another more numerous deputation came to him\n with the same complaints; but Anthony ordered the soldiers\n to disperse them, which was done without loss of life.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Antigonus was not yet disheartened. The Parthians, for a\n brief period, became masters of Syria, and held possession of\n Sidon and Ptolemais. Antigonus engaged their assistance by\n the promise of a thousand talents and five hundred Jewish wo-\n men, .and advanced at the head of a powerful army against Je-\n rusalem ; and after many strong efforts, succeeded in recover-\n ing the kingdom. Herod escaped by flight; but Hyrcanus and\n Phasael were thrown into dungeons. Knowing that his death\n was determined, Phasael dashed out his brains against the pri-\n son walls. Antigonus dared not incur the odium of destroying\n his aged uncle; \" but he barbarously cropped off his ears, and\n sent him far away to Seleucia in Babylonia, in the safe keeping\n of the Parthians.\n</p>\n<p>\n C. Herod made the best of his way to Rome, where he found\n his friend Anthony in the very zenith of his power ; and was\n by him introduced to the favourable notice of Octavius, his co-\n adjutor, by an account of the services which Antipater had ren-\n dered to Julius Caesar in the Egyptian campaign, and of the es-\n teem in which he was held by that emperor. All that Herod\n came prepared to solicit was, that Aristobulus, the brother of\n his espoused Mariamne, should have the throne of Judaea, pur-\n posing himself to govern under him, as he had governed under\n Hyrcanus. But Anthony would hear of nothing less than that\n he should be king himself, and, with the concurrence of Octa-\n vius and of the senate, he was solemnly inaugurated king of\n Judaea, in the Capitol of Rome. He had still, however, to gain\n possession of his kingdom, and this he found an arduous under-\n taking.

There is no person who, singly, fills so large a\n place in the history of the Jews, or whose character has been\n brought so completely into view.

He was a slave to the\n most furious passions : his natural disposition was severe and\n unrelenting, and no regard for human suffering formed an ob-\n stacle to the least of his designs. His inexorable cruelties\n against those whom he suspected or feared, excited against him\n the hatred of all his subjects, \u2014 and then, his only care was how\n to make that hatred a source of gain, by new exactions and\n confiscations. Although a Jew by profession, he was in heart\n a heathen, and it displeased him that the severe principles of\n that religion which made more account of righteousness than\n of glory, precluded his subjects from honouring him as the great\n ones of the heathen were honoured, \u2014 by statues, temples,\n games, and offerings. In a word, the good qualities of Herod,\n real or seeming, were kept bright for holiday show to the Ro-\n mans; but the bad ones were displayed without reserve to his\n own people, his own kindred, and, above all, to those who stood\n in his way, or whom he counted his enemies.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The leading acts of his reign class themselves so naturally\n under the heads of jealousy and pride, that it may be well thus\n to arrange them. Of his jealousy, the prime objects were the\n members and the adherents of the Asamonean house. He be-\n gan his reign by a most dreadful persecution of the adherents\n of the fallen Antigonus ; and here policy went along with his\n hatred, for with his exhausted treasury and lavish expenses, he\n found it exceedingly convenient to put the more affluent of them\n to death, and confiscate their estates. The blood which he\n shed, and the inexorable cruelty which he manifested, in the\n beginning of his reign, made his person and government hate-\n ful to the Jews ; and hatred rose to abhorrence when the ob-\n jects of the public love, the last remains of a noble race, be-\n came the victims of his murderous jealousy.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4.

The next object of Herod\u2019s jealousy was a boy, the grand-\n son of Hyrcanus, and brother of Mariamne.

C. 29.] DEATH OF MARIAMNE. 189\n</p>\n<p>\n into a youth of wonderful beauty ; and the hearts of the Jews\n were fixed upon him as the last of the glorious Maccabees.\n His of right was the high-priesthood, which Herod had bestow-\n ed upon an obscure priest of the name of Ananel ; but perceiv-\n ing, at length, that it was no longer safe to withhold the ponti-\n ficate from him, the king removed Ananel, and gave his place\n to Aristobulus, then but seventeen years of age. When he first\n appeared in the gorgeous robes ol his office, at the Feast of\n Tabernacles, the assembled people could not restrain a burst of\n admiration and delight : and that testimony of affection sealed\n the doom of Aristobulus. Very soon after, he was drowned, by\n alleged \u201c accident,\u201d while bathing at Jericho ; but the whole\n nation knew that the act was Herod\u2019s, and saw through the\n show of mourning and parade of grief displayed on the occa-\n sion.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Of his wife, Mariamne, who has been so often named, He-\n rod was doatingly fond ; and this he shewed in his own pecu-\n liar manner, by more than once leaving private orders, when he\n had occasion to leave Judaea, that she should be put to death if\n he failed to return. This happened to transpire, and gave oc-\n casion to jealousy and suspicion on the part of Herod, and to\n anger and indignation on the part of the high-spirited and vir-\n tuous princess. The result was, as usual, death. In the rage\n of his jealousy and anger, he poured out that life which was the\n dearest to him, and which his groans and tears could not after-\n wards restore. The death of her mother, Alexandra, followed\n soon after. The three sons of Mariamne by Herod himself,\n also excited his jealousy and dislike by resting upon their Asa-\n monean descent through her, and malting that their ground of\n claim to the favour of the people, were at length consigned to\n the same doom, and were, by their father\u2019s order, strangled in\n the prison-house (B. C. 7). In short, such was his jealous\n temper, that he spared neither his own family, his friends, nor\n the noblest, wealthiest, or most powerful of his subjects. It is\n not wonderful that such conduct procured him the intense ha-\n tred of the Jews, and that various plots were laid for his de-\n struction. In such plots a very active part was taken by the\n Pharisees ; but they were all abortive, and only served to in-\n crease the distance between the tyrant and his people, and to\n render the former so suspicious, that the innocent were often\n cruelly tortured, lest the guilty should escape.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The knowledge of how deeply he was disliked by the peo-\n ple, also made him more and more careless of public opinion ;\n and when he supposed that all his enemies were put down, and\n his power well established, he evinced a marked neglect of the\n Jewish religion and laws, and as marked a preference of Ro-\n man customs and practices. There was, perhaps, policy in\n this ; for he owed everything to the Romans, and had no trust\n but in their favour. Not being a Levite, or even, by birth, a\n Jew, he did not venture to seize the priesthood.

[b. C. 17 .\n</p>\n<p>\n licy and that of his successors, was, therefore, to degrade that\n sacred office, and to render it entirely dependent on his will.\n From the beginning of his reign to the destruction of the tem-\n ple, the hereditary principle of succession to the priesthood was\n utterly neglected ; and the high-priests were set up and remov-\n ed at pleasure. He destroyed the authority of the Grand San-\n hedrim, before which he had formerly been summoned ; and\n he is said to have burned the public genealogies, that no evi-\n dence might exist against his claim to be considered an Israel-\n ite. In all parts of his kingdom, except Judaea, Herod built\n temples in the Grecian style of art, set up statues for idolatrous\n worship, and even dedicated a magnificent theatre and amphi-\n theatre to the celebration of games in honour of Augustus, which\n it is known, implied the deification of the person in whose hon-\n our the games were celebrated. His ordinary habits were\n framed after the manners and customs of the Romans ; and\n along with the usages, his influence and example failed not to\n impart the luxuries and vices of that licentious people.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. To Herod\u2019s pride may be ascribed his buildings and pub-\n lic works. His design to rebuild the temple in a style and\n scale of superior grandeur, may certainly be attributed to his\n wish for the glory of being thought another Solomon, rather\n than to his piety or zeal. He was likewise sensible of the fact,\n that there was scarcely any step he could take by which he\n could so well please and soothe the people he had done so\n much to exasperate. Accordingly, having obtained the consent\n of the people, he spent two years in bringing together all the\n materials for the work, after which the old fabric was pulled\n down, and the new one begun, in the twentieth year of his\n reign. For nine or ten years, no less than 18,000 workmen\n were employed upon. The sanctuary, or actual temple\n itself, was completed in a year and a half; and the rest of the\n pile, with its courts, porticoes, offices, and outer buildings, in\n eight years more, so as to be fit for the usual services of reli-\n gion ; but the whole was not completed till long after the death\n of Herod. This temple is that which Christ and his apostles\n so often visited, and which is minutely described by Josephus.\n It seems in many respects to have been a much more magnifi-\n cent pile than the great temple built by Solomon, although it\n may not have exceeded that celebrated structure in its wealth\n of gold. It was built with hard white stones of vast size ; and,\n rising in all its grandeur from the summit of an eminence, it\n formed the most conspicuous object in a general view of the\n city, and excited the admiration of all beholders. The exteri-\n or was covered profusely with solid plates and pinnacles of gold ;\n and when the rays of the sun were reflected from it, it shone\n like a meteor, which the eye could not rest upon. The noble\n porticoes which surrounded the temple courts, also claimed no\n small share of admiring wonder. Incalculable wealth was ex-\n pended on. them ; and the refined taste was gratified by grace\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0199/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0199/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0199/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0199/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0199/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0199.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 541034}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"199\">\n<p>\n b. c. 17.] herod\u2019s kingdom enlarged. 191\n</p>\n<p>\n of form and proportion, by vast extent, by costliness of materi-\n als, and by every variety of beauty and embellishment which\n art or imagination could devise.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. Herod also built a magnificent palace for himself, which\n subsequently became the residence of the Roman procurators\n at Jerusalem. This, next to the temple, was considered the\n finest building in Jerusalem. Many other great works were\n undertaken by him, not only in his own dominions but in for-\n eign cities, with the view of spreading the fame of his magnifi-\n cence in the Roman empire. In many other cities, the travel-\n ler might hear in those days, as he went from place to place,\n that the city walls, the porticoes, the gymnasiums, the thea-\n tre, the temple, the bath, the bazaar, the aqueduct, were built\n by a munificent foreigner, Herod, king of Judaea; or else that\n he had planted the grove, had founded the public games, or had\n made rich gifts to the city. Although this lavish expenditure\n upon foreigners was a grievance to the people over whom he\n ruled, it must be admitted that his own dominion was by no\n means overlooked. Many new cities were built by him, and\n old ones restored ; bridges, roads, baths, aqueducts, were form-\n ed wherever needed, which gave a new aspect to the country\n under his reign. At Caesarea, which was built by him, he\n framed by art the safest and most convenient port on all the\n coast. Among the cities rebuilt by him on an enlarged and\n beautiful plan, was Samaria, to which he gave the name of\n Sebaste, in honour of Augustus. All these were great, and\n in themselves useful works ; yet we may gather from the\n Jewish writings, that the people were but little grateful for\n them, while they groaned under the exactions by which their\n cost was defrayed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. We have seen that Mark Anthony was the original pa-\n tron of Herod, and that to him chiefly he owed his kingdom.\n In the conflict that eventually arose between Anthony and Oc-\n tavius, Herod adhered to the cause of the former ; but at length,\n not feeling it his interest to connect his fortunes with those of\n a man whose infatuations were leading to his inevitable ruin,\n he made a timely and by no means ungraceful transfer of his al-\n legiance to Octavius. To that person the attentions and servi-\n ces of Herod were very acceptable ; and when he became the\n sole master of the Roman world, under the name of Augustus,\n he continued to manifest towards him the highest degree of\n favour and personal esteem. By successive additions his king-\n dom was more extensive than that of any king since Solomon,\n and embraced not only the whole country from Dan to Beershe-\n ba, but as extensive domains beyond the Jordan as had at al-\n most any time belonged to the crown of Israel. Besides this\n he was the emperor\u2019s procurator in Syria, and the governor of\n that important country undertook nothing without his concur-\n rence.

The jealousy\n of that tyrant had been awakened by their inquiry for the\n \u201c King of the Jews and as their neglect to return prevented\n him from distinguishing the object of their homage, he had the\n inconceivable barbarity to order that all the children in Bethle-\n hem under two years of age should be put to death, trusting\n that the intended victim would fall in the general slaughter ;\n but Joseph had previously been warned in a dream to take his\n wife and the infant to the land of Egypt, whence they did not\n return till after the death of Herod.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. That event was not long delayed. In the sixty-ninth year of\n his age, Herod fell ill of the disease which occasioned hi3\n death. That disease was in his bowels, and not only put him\n to the most cruel tortures, but rendered him altogether loath-\n some to himself and others. The natural ferocity of his tem-\n per could not be tamed by such experience. Knowing that the\n nation would little regret his death, he ordered the persons of\n chief note to be confined in a tower, and all of them to be slain\n when his own death took place, that there might be cause for\n weeping in Jerusalem. This savage order was not executed.\n After a reign of thirty-seven years, Herod died in the seventieth\n year of his age.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. By his will, which was, of course, left subject to the ap-\n proval of the emperor, Herod divided his dominions among his\n three sons, Archelaus, Herod Antipas, and Herod Philip. To\n Archelaus he bequeathed what was regarded as properly the\n kingdom, namely, Judaea, Samaria, and Idumaea ; to Antipas\n was left the tetrarchy of Galilee and Perea; and Philip was\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0202/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0202/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0202/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0202/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0202/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0202.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 570559}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"202\">\n<p>\n 194 \u00ab JUDiEA REDUCED TO A ROMAN PROVINCE, [a.

The relative\n value of the territories may be estimated by the revenue derived\n from them. Archelaus\u2019s territory yielded six hundred talents a\n year, that of Antipas two hundred, that of Philip one hundred.\n This distribution was confirmed by Augustus, excepting that he\n recognized Archelaus as ethnarch only, reserving the title of\n king, as the future reward of his good conduct in the govern-\n ment. His subjects, however, regarded him as their king, and\n entertained favourable anticipations of his reign. But he soon\n showed himself as great a tyrant as his father, without the re-\n deeming qualities that had been some time visible in Herod.\n At the very beginning of his reign, his refusal of a popular de-\n mand, raised a commotion in the temple, to quell which he let\n loose the soldiers upon the people, whereby not fewer than\n three thousand persons were destroyed. This and other acts\n revived the general unpopularity of the rule of the Herodian\n family; and, therefore, when the several members of that fami-\n ly, interested in the will of Herod, proceeded to Rome to pro-\n mote their claims, a deputation of Jews also went to petition\n that they might be no longer harassed by a show of indepen-\n dence, but should be allowed to live according to their own\n laws under a Roman governor. Their suit was, however, re-\n fused, and the will of Herod was confirmed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. On his return, Archelaus conducted himself with great\n harshnness towards his refractory subjects. This produced new\n disorders, and the ensuing years were disturbed by insurrections\n against the Romans, by pretenders to the crown, and by power-\n ful bands of brigands, who kept the kingdom in continual\n alarm, and checked communication between one part of the\n country and another. At length the maladministration of Ar-\n chelaus, and his unfitness to govern, became so evident, that\n the complaints of his subjects were no longer treated with neg-\n lect at Rome. In the tenth year of his reign he was deposed,\n and banished to Vienne in Gaul.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. At the same time Judaea was reduced to the form of a Ro-\n man province, annexed to Syria, and governed by Roman pro-\n curators. This change threw into the rough hands of stran-\n gers those powers which the kings had previously exercised.\n Thus, tribute was paid directly to the Romans ; the power of\n life and death was taken away ; and justice was administered\n in the name and by the laws of Rome. The procurators were\n appointed directly by the emperors, and the place of their resi-\n dence was Caesarea, which hence became the reputed capital of\n the province. A magnificent palace which Herod had built\n there for himself, became the residence of the procurators. At\n the great festivals, the procurators usually visited Jerusalem,\n attended by some cohorts (or regiments) of soldiers, with the\n view of repressing any disturbance which might arise in so vast\n a concourse of discontented people.

The duty of the procurator was to maintain good order in\n his province, to collect the imperial revenues, and to administer\n justice. Some of those who came to Judaea, held independent\n jurisdiction, while others were dependent on the president or\n general governor of Syria, whose seat was at Antioch. The\n tribute paid to the Romans was peculiarly galling to the Jews,\n many of whom, arguing on abstract tenets, without reference\n to its being compulsory, held that it was \u201c unlawful\u201d for the\n chosen people of God to pay tribute to the heathen. The per-\n sons holding this doctrine, or making it a cover for their rest-\n lessness, were called \u201c zealots and under that name they are\n distinguished in the few sad pages that remain of the Jewish\n history. Such people were not likely to admit of any middle\n course, nor indeed was there any open to them. They raised\n numerous insurrections against the Roman government, or uni-\n ted in formidable bodies of brigands; and considering all those\n Jews who were willing to rest quiet under the Romans, as un-\n worthy and degenerate sons of Israel, they counted them as\n enemies, and treated them as such. The effect of this was in-\n creasing disorder, insecurity, and rapine.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. Even the more quietly disposed who, from seeing no hope\n of deliverance, were disposed to submit to the Roman yoke,\n detested the tribute in their hearts : and hence those Jews who\n assisted in the collection, and were called \u201c publicans,\u201d were\n disliked beyond all men, being regarded as betrayers of their\n country\u2019s liberties, and extortioner\u2019s in behalf of the Romans.\n This feeling naturally threw the office of collector or publican\n into the hands of men of low character, whose conduct gene-\n rally justified the dislike with which they were regarded. The\n lofty notions entertained by the Jews of their national privileges\n as the peculiar people of Jehovah, rather than any enlarged\n and patriotic views of public liberty, fostered those feelings of\n hatred to the Roman government. Besides, the Romans, being\n idolaters, were looked upon by the Jews with disgust, as pollu-\n ted and abominable men, with whom thdy could not sit at the\n same table or mix in any social intercourse. This marked and\n avowed abhorrence of the Jews to the persons of the Romans,\n was by no means calculated to produce in that overbearing\n people a kind feeling towards their tributaries.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. But for their national prejudices the Jews would have had\n no good ground for complaint. They were allowed the free ex-\n ercise of their own religious rites ; they worshipped in their\n temple and synagogues without restraint ; they followed their\n own customs, and were still in a great degree governed by\n their own laws.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0204/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0204/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0204/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0204/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0204/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0204.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 541522}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"204\">\n<p>\n 196\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER III.

D. 25, and continued\n in it ten years. His conduct from the first excited the dissatis-\n faction of the people. He was an impetuous, greedy, sanguin-\n ary, and obstinate tyrant, who sold justice, plundered the peo-\n ple, and slew the innocent. Although the abhorrence in which\n idolatrous images were held by the Jews, was perfectly well\n known to all the Romans, he persisted in bringing into Jerusa-\n lem the images of Caesar, which were on the military ensigns ;\n and by this and other acts of insult and oppression, he raised\n frequent tumults even among those of the Jewish people who\n were the most inclined to submit to the Roman government.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. But the government of Pilate is made chiefly memorable\n by the public appearance, ministry, and death of Jesus Chiust.\n His birth has already been mentioned. Of his history, while\n he remained in private life, that is, until he attained the age of\n thirty years, little further is known than that he remained with\n his parents at Nazareth in Galilee, to which town they had re-\n turned as soon as the death of Herod rendered it safe for them\n to leave Egypt. His actual appearance as the expected Mes-\n siah, was harbingered by John the Baptist, who had lived in\n the solitudes of the wilderness, clad in hairy raiment, and sub-\n sisting on locusts and wild honey, and came thence to the river\n Jordan, where, by his preaching of repentance and remission of\n sins, with his baptism of those who came to him, he attracted\n great attention. But the interest of his countrymen was in-\n creased when he announced that he came but as the forerunner\n of One whose sandal-thong he was not himself worthy to un-\n loose. This accorded with the expectations then prevalent\n among the Jewish people, that the time for the coming of the\n long-desired Messiah, the Deliverer, was very near. The ex-\n pectation was founded on a calculation of the time mentioned\n by Daniel the prophet, # which calculation still remains as one\n of the strongest evidences that Jesus of Nazareth was the very\n Christ of whom Moses and the prophets wrote. The Jews\n were, however, utterly mistaken in their conception of the cha-\n racter and offices of the expected Messiah. They thought he\n was to appear as a great and glorious king, claiming his place\n upon the throne of David, and going forth conquering and to\n conquer, until Israel not only broke the yoke that fretted her\n neck, but until she became the head of the nations, and the\n proudest of her enemies licked the dust beneath her feet. This\n expectation was one of the circumstances which made the na-\n tion so impatient of the Roman yoke.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4.

Had the power been with them,\n they would have stoned him. Pilate, however, saw very plainly\n that there was no real ground of charge against him, and was\n reluctant to condemn him. But, on the other hand, he was at\n that time anxious to gratify the Jewish people, and was fearful\n of the impressions which the jealous and suspicious Tiberius\n might receive from their accounts of the transaction.

As to the surviving tetrarch, Herod\n Antipas, he put John the Baptist in prison, on account of his\n public reprobation of a very unseemly act of which he had been\n guilty. He took Herodias, the wife of his living brother, and\n married her himself, putting away his former legitimate wife,\n a daughter of the king of Arabia-Petrsea. Herod had no wish\n or intention to put John to death, but was reluctantly induced\n to do so in compliance with a foolish vow which the dancing of\n the daughter of Herodias extracted from him. He afterwards\n happened to be at Jerusalem when Christ was brought before\n Pilate, and that person, hearing that the accused belonged to\n Galilee, sent him to the tetrarch of that district. Herod was\n glad to see him, having heard much of his preaching and mira-\n cles; but, finding that Jesus was not disposed to gratify his cu-\n riosity, he treated him with insult, and sent him back to Pilate.\n This civility between the governor and the tetrarch, at the ex-\n pense of Jesus, paved the way for making up a difference which\n had existed between them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. Pilate retained his government some years longer, and\n continued his oppressions and exactions, among which may be\n reckoned his attempt to drain the treasury of the temple, under\n cover of making it chargeable for the expenses of carrying an\n aqueduct into Jerusalem. At length, a gross outrage upon the\n Samaritans, in which a number of innocent people were put to\n the sword, occasioned such complaints to Yitellius, the governor\n of Syria, that he ordered Pilate home to give an account of his\n conduct to the emperor. Tiberius was dead before he arrived,\n and his successor Caligula, banished him to Vienne in Gaul,\n where he is said to have perished miserably by his own hand.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9.

We must now remind the reader of the two sons of Herod\n the Great by the Asamonean Mariamne, whom their father had\n put to death. One of them, Aristobulus, left a son called Herod\n Agrippa, who was sent to Rome, and brought up there in the\n imperial family. While Tiberius lived, he attached himself to\n Caligula, and became his intimate friend and companion. An\n unguarded expression of the wish that his friend might soon be\n emperor, was reported to Tiberius, who threw him into prison,\n laden with chains. The first act of Caligula, when he came to\n the throne, was to liberate Herod Agrippa, and to bestow on him\n a chain of gold, of the same weight as that chain which he had\n worn for his sake. Nor was this all : he bestowed on him the\n tetrarchy of his late uncle Philip, together with that of Abilene,\n with the title of king. This unexpected advancement of his\n nephew was highly unpalatable to Herod Antipas, who, greatly\n coveting the royal title himself, went to Rome to endeavour to\n obtain it ; but in seeking it he lost all, and was sent to join Pi-\n late at Vienne in Gaul. His territory was given to the fortu-\n nate Agrippa; Judaea and Samaria were added a few years af-\n ter; so that the kingdom of Herod the Great was once more\n reconstructed in behalf of his grandson.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0209/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0209/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0209/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0209/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0209/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0209.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 541141}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"209\">\n<p>\n FELIX.\n</p>\n<p>\n A.

Caligula grew intoxicat-\n ed with power, and wished to be worshipped as a god. The\n Jews were likely to have been in great difficulty through their\n resistance to the introduction of his image into their temple.\n The emperor was greatly enraged ; but at length the solicita-\n tions of Agrippa gave effect to the remonstrances of a deputa-\n tion from the Jews, and the temple was reluctantly exempted\n from the threatened pollution. Caligula died soon after ; and\n the part taken by Agrippa in promoting the succession of Clau-\n dius, procured the gratitude and favour of that emperor. It\n was he who added Judaea to his kingdom.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. It appears to have been less from an intolerant disposition\n than from a wish to please the Jews, at all hazards, that Herod\n Agrippa persecuted the Christians. He put the apostle James,\n the brother of John, to death, and Peter escaped only through\n the interposition of an angel.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Latterly the mind of Herod was so inflated by the sense\n of his increasing power and greatness ' that he received with\n complacency the salutation of the people, who, on some public\n occasion, hailed hin as a god in the theatre of Caesarea. A\n grievous and loathsome disease with which he was immediate-\n ly smitten, and of which he soon died, convinced him and them\n that he was a mortal man.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. His son Agrippa was only seventeen years of age, and was\n deemed too young to be put in possession of the dominions of\n his father. When, however, three years after, his uncle Herod,\n king of Chalcis, died, the emperor gave him that kingdom, to\n which was annexed the government of the temple at Jerusa-\n lem, and the power of appointing and removing the high-priests.\n Afterwards a more important kingdom was given for that of\n Chalcis. It was composed of the provinces of Batanea, Gaulo-\n nitis, Trachonitis, and Abilene. But on the death^ of Herod\n Agrippa, Judaea was again reduced to the cond ition of a Roman\n province, in which state it afterwards remained.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Under the successive governments of Cuspius Phadius, of\n Tiberius Alexander, and Yentidius Cumanus, which together\n occupied not more than eight years, various acts of tumult, po-\n pular frenzy, delusion, and crime, afford indications to the care-\n ful observer of the commencement of that troubled condition of\n society which ended in the destruction of Jerusalem and the ruin\n of the nation.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. After these, Claudius gave the government of Judaea to his\n freedman, Felix. He was the brother of Pallas, the celebrated\n freedman and favourite of the emperor. The common obser-\n vation, that the government of a slave is always tyrannous,\n was confirmed in the case of Felix. He acted with great seve-\n rity, and with utter disregard to public opinion. He began his\n government by clearing the country of the numerous banditti,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0210/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0210/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0210/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0210/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0210/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0210.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 570751}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"210\">\n<p>\n 202\n</p>\n<p>\n PORCIUS FESTUS.\n</p>\n<p>\n [a. d. 60 .\n</p>\n<p>\n and the clandestine assassins called Sicarii,* by whom it was\n infested.

No one can examine the history of this\n period without perceiving that the leaders of the people, whe-\n ther priests or laymen, were, as Josephus, who knew them well,\n describes, as vile misceants as ever lived. The immediate cause\n of quarrel among the priests was connected with the frequent\n changes of the persons holding the office of the high-priest,\n and the extravagant claims of the persons who had once enjoyed\n that dignity.

Other go-\n vernors had been tyrannical, cruel, avaricious ; but the tyranny\n of Florus knew no bounds, his cruelty was a habit, and his ava-\n rice was utterly unsatiable. He gave protection to all robbers\n who would divide the spoils with him, and thus practically\n gave licence to all kinds of violence and spoliation. His mal-\n administration was so outrageous as must have insured his dis-\n grace, had it been a subject of complaint at Rome ; and the\n knowledge of this made him do his utmost to urge on the ten-\n dencies of the people to intestine commotion and open revolt,\n hoping: that, in the storm the voice of complaint against him\n would not be heard, and that a wider field for spoliations would\n be opened up. The measures of Florus can, however, only be\n said to have hastened by a few years that result which the\n madness of the people had made inevitable.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0212/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0212/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0212/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0212/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0212/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0212.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 508649}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"212\">\n<p>\n m\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER V.

The condition of the country became so deplorable, that a\n great number of the well-disposed inhabitants sought in foreign\n countries that peace which was denied them in their own. The\n land was distracted by tumult, and overrun by robbers, who,\n professing to be actuated by zeal for liberty and religion, plun-\n dered, without mercy, the defenceless towns and villages which\n refused to give in their adhesion to what was called the patriot\n cause. Meanwhile justice was sold by the Roman governor,\n and even the sacred office of the high-priesthood was offered to\n the highest bidder. Hence, those who got that dignity were\n often profligate wretches, who, having obtained the office by\n bribes, used it for their own purposes, and maintained them-\n selves in it by the darkest iniquities. Being of different sects\n and parties, of which there was now a great number, they and\n the leading men of the nation acted with all the animosity of\n sectarianism against each other. With such examples in their\n superiors, the ordinary priests and the scribes became, in the\n highest degree, dissolute and unprincipled ; while the mass of\n the people abandoned themselves to all evil ; and seditions, ex-\n tortions, and robberies, were matters of every day occurrence.\n The bands of society were loosened ; and it became clear that\n the nation was fast ripening for destruction.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Some transactions at Caesarea gave occasion for the actual\n outbreak. That place, the seat of the Roman governor, was\n built by Herod, and had a mixed population of Syrians and\n Jews. It was disputed between these two classes, to which of\n them the city really belonged. The dispute had been referred\n to the Emperor, and about this time the decree was announced\n in favour of the Syrians, whose boundless exultation greatly\n exasperated all the Jews, who had felt a prodigious interest in\n the question. This, with insults on their religion, of which the\n governor refused to take cognizance, fanned into a flame the\n smouldering embers of revolt. Acting upon the impulse thus\n given, a party of hot-brained young men surprised a Roman\n garrison at Massada, near the Dead Sea, and put all the sol-\n diers to the sword. The act was recognised at Jerusalem\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0213/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0213/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0213/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0213/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0213/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0213.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 548665}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"213\">\n<p>\n VESPASIAN INVADES JUDiEA.\n</p>\n<p>\n 205\n</p>\n<p>\n A.

Instead of going at once to Jeru-\n salem, he employed himself in reducing Galilee, and in reco-\n vering the fortresses which had been taken by the insurgents.\n At Jotapata he was opposed by Josephus, the historian of the\n war, to whom the provisional Jewish government had confided\n the defence of Galilee. The fortress fell, and Josephus was ta-\n ken alive. He was at first treated rather roughly, but after-\n wards with consideration and respect. At the commencement\n of the campaign the Romans behaved with great severity\n wherever they came. No mercy was shown to age or sex, but\n cities, towns, and villages were cruelly ravaged and destroyed.\n Nor were these desolations confined to Judaea ; for in many fo-\n reign cities in which Jews were settled, they were slaughtered\n in multitudes by the Roman soldiers and the other inhabitants.\n Some idea of these dreadful massacres may be formed from the\n facts, that above 20,000 Jews were slain in one day at Caesarea,\n 13,000 in one night at Scythopolis, 50,000 at Alexandria, 8,000\n at Joppa, and above 10,000 at Damascus. Nor need we won-\n der at such extent of destruction among a people who were\n so infatuated as to rush into a warfare, in which, according to\n Josephus, the odds were so fearfully against them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Though the war was steadily prosecuted, Vespasian\n evinced no haste to march against Jerusalem; and when urged\n by his impatient officers, he told them that it was better to let\n the Jews destroy one another.

Thus they obtained little\n real benefit from the respite which arose from the attention of\n the Roman army being diverted for a while from them by the\n revolution which at this time happened in imperial Rome, in\n consequence of the death of Nero.

He then departed for\n Rome, leaving the conduct of the war to his son Titus.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. At the feast of the Passover, in the ensuing year, when\n the city of Jerusalem was, as usual at that time, crowded with\n people from all quarters, the Roman army appeared before the\n wails. It was probably his anxiety to save the city and the\n temple, that induced Titus to commence the siege at this sea-\n son; as it might have been expected, that where such multi-\n tudes were shut up in an ill-provisioned city, famine alone\n would soon make a surrender inevitable. The besieged were\n very earnestly invited to open their gates to the Romans, and\n were with all sincerity assured of their liberty and safety. Jo-\n sephus was also commissioned to harangue them, and to point\n out to them the folly of supposing that they could hold out\n against, or successfully resist, the power of Rome. But all\n warning and counsel were treated with insult and scorn ; and\n the factions expressed the resolution of defending the city to\n the very last, in the confidence that God would not permit his\n temple and city to fall before the heathen. Such repeated re-\n fusals of mercy and compassion, and the very desperate defence\n made by the besieged, compelled Titus, much against his own\n will, to become the unconscious instrument of accomplishing\n that doom of the city and temple which Christ had nearly forty\n years before denounced. The folly of resistance was so clear\n to Titus, that he became exasperated at the unpleasant task\n which their obstinacy imposed upon him. Resolved that none\n of them should escape, but such as surrendered to him, he\n raised around the city a strong wall of circumvallation, strength-\n ened with towers. This great work was accomplished in the\n short space of three days.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The city was very strong, being surrounded by three\n walls, one within another; and then there was the temple,\n which itself was an exceedingly strong fortress.

After the Roman armies were withdrawn from Jerusalem\n many of the Jews returned to dwell in the ruined city, though\n the Roman Emperor, indignant at the late rebellion, had placed\n a garrison of 800 troops on Mount Zion, in order to prevent any\n attempt to rebuild the sacred capital. A portion of the country\n was yet, indeed, unscathed by the flames of war ; the towns\n on the coast submitting to the conquerer, escaped the horrors of\n a siege and the penalties of rebellion, while the provinces be-\n yond Jordan enjoyed tranquillity under the rule of the conquer-\n ors. But the Jews were discontented and rebellious under the\n yoke of Rome ; they still fondly believed that an earthly Messiah\n was shortly to arise, to free them from bondage, and to give\n them the dominion of the whole earth.

In the city of Jeru-\n salem, which was to a certain extent repaired, and received the\n name of iElia Capitolina, a colony of Greeks and Latins was\n established, in order to preclude the return of the Jews, and all\n farther hopes of the restoration of their kingdom. But the po-\n licy of the Romans was of no avail against the deep-rooted pre-\n judices of this infatuated people ; and no sooner had a new im-\n postor arisen, of the name of Barcochab {the son of a star,) than\n the deluded Israelites hailed him as the light that was to dawn\n in the latter days, and usher in the day of their long expected\n rest. They accordingly crowded to his standard ; and in a\n short time he had mustered a powerful army of 200,000 devot-\n ed followers. Owing to the absence of the Roman legions, en-\n gaged at that time in distant service, important advantages were\n gained, and Jerusalem was again occupied by the insurgent\n Jews, besides about fifty castles, and numbers of open towns.\n But this career of success was speedily terminated by the arri-\n val of Severus, afterwards emperor, with a large and well-ap-\n pointed body of legionary troops ; the Jews were overwhelmed\n by numbers, discipline, and military skill ; their cities were\n taken and destroyed ; and Bither, where the leader of the re-\n bellion, Barcochab, had made his last stand, was stormed with\n great slaughter, and himself slain. Of the Jews it is estimated\n that 580,000 died on the field, and the remnant who escaped\n mostly perished by famine and disease, or amid the flames of\n their ruined cities. Under these ruthless devastations, the\n country was at last converted into a desert; the inhabitants\n were either slain or driven into exile; and the divine denuncia-\n tions were now fully accomplished against this misguided peo-\n ple, that they should be scattered among all the nations of the\n earth.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The victors having thus satiated their vengeance, began in\n due time to relax their stem and intolerant policy. Under the\n mild rule of Antoninus Pius, the Jews were restored to their an-\n cient privileges, to the freedom of worship, and to all their other\n national rights. They were now mingled with the nations, and\n were found dwelling in all parts of the Roman empire ; and their\n general condition under the Roman emperors was not unfavour-\n able. The numerous remains of that people, though they were\n excluded from the precincts of Jerusalem, were permitted to\n form and to maintain considerable establishments both in Italy\n and in the provinces, to acquire the freedom of Rome, to enjoy\n municipal honours, and to obtain at the same time an exemption\n from burdensome and expensive offices. The moderation or\n indifference of the Romans gave a legal sanction to the form of\n ecclesiastical police which was instituted by the vanquished\n sect.

No great change appears to have taken place in the con-\n dition of Palestine, until Constantine ascended the imperial\n throne. He was, as is well known, the first Christian emperor;\n and under his powerful patronage, and that of his mother, the\n Empress Helena, splendid structures were everywhere erected\n in the Holy Land, in honour of the Christian faith. The land\n was gradually overspread with memorials of Christianity ; and\n chapels, altars, and houses of prayer, marked every spot which\n was memorable for the sayings or doings of the Saviour. The\n Jews beheld with indignation the rise of these Christian monu-\n ments within the precincts of the holy city. They were as much\n opposed to the Christian worship as to the heathen idolatry,\n but their influence was now at an end. Scattered in distant\n parts, they could no longer act with consistency or vigour ; yet,\n so attached were they to their peculiar rites, that, however faint\n the chance of success, they were ready in crowds to raliy round\n the standard of their ancient faith, wherever it was displayed,\n and to follow any daring leader into the field. But the time\n was past. They were rejected by the divine decree, and were\n no longer to be assembled as a nation in their own land. Jeru-\n salem was now filled with the emblems of a new faith, and\n crowds of pilgrims were attracted from the most distant coun-\n tries, by the eager desire of contemplating the place of the Re-\n deemer\u2019s passion, and of all the previous incidents of his holy\n life. These visits weie encouraged from various motives. They\n evinced, no doubt, the zeal of the new converts; and being at\n once a proof of piety and a source of profit, they were encour-\n aged by the clergy of Jerusalem.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The reign of Julian was a new era in the history of Pales-\n tine, and the Jews anticipated, from his declared enmity to\n Christianity, his favour for their own faith. The policy of this\n heathen emperor countenanced them in this belief, when he\n endeavoured, by rebuilding the temple of Jerusalem in its former\n splendour, to discredit the truth of those prophecies which de-\n nounced perpetual desolation on the devoted city. He chose the\n commanding eminence of Mount Moriah for the site of a new\n structure, which was to eclipse the splendour of the Christian\n church on the adjacent hill of Calvary : and he resolved to esta-\n blish a Jewish order of priests, who might revive the observance\n of the Mosaic rites, together with as numerous a colony of Jews\n as could be collected, in the holy city.

After the death of Julian, it was the policy of the Christian\n emperors to depress the Jews in Palestine, though they were\n not ill treated throughout the provinces, and were even granted\n considerable privileges and immunities. But it is astonishing\n how carefully fathers instilled into the minds of their children,\n along with their ancient faith, the fondly cherished delusion,\n that some new and happier era of freedom and independence\n was yet to dawn on Judaea ; and how eagerly the children, im-\n bibing this idea, became the prey of every impostor, and, under\n the blind impulse of enthusiasm, rashly entered into new con-\n flicts with their enemies in the field \u2014 where they perished, the\n willing victims of a hopeless cause. About the beginning of the\n seventh century, the peace of Judaea was seriously disturb-\n ed by the Persian invasion of Khosroes. The Greeks and the\n Persians were for a long period rivals for the dominion of the\n East ; and Khosroes, the grandson of Nushirvan, now invading\n the Roman empire, stormed and sacked the city of Antioch.\n From Syria the flood of invasion rolled southward on Palestine,\n and the Persian army was joined by the Jews to the number of\n 24,000, still burning with the love of independence. The Chris-\n tians and the Jews were inflamed against each other by a long\n course of deep injuries given and received. Those of the former\n nation within the walls of Jerusalem were massacred without\n mercy by their Christian enemies, while the Jews on the out-\n side were burning with the desire of revenge. The advance of\n the Persians secured the triumph. The city was stormed by\n the combined armies, and the Jews were satiated with a full\n measure of revenge. The Christians neither sought nor found\n mercy : it was estimated that 90,000 of them perished in the\n storming of the city. Some were sold for slaves, and others\n were bought for the purpose of being murdered. The city was\n sacked, and the magnificent mouments of the Christian faith\n were mostly consumed by fire. But this, like all the other tri-\n umphs of the Jews, was short-lived.

The mixed multi-\n tude were harangued by the zealous enthusiasts of this sacred\n cause ; their pity and indignation were alternately roused by\n the sufferings of their brethren in the Holy Land ; the flame of\n enthusiasm was propagated by sympathy and example; and the\n eager champions of the cross, the flower of the European chi-\n valry, assembled in martial array, to march against the ene-\n mies of their common faith. To defray the necessary expen-\n ses of the expedition, princes alienated their provinces, nobles\n their lands and castles, peasants their cattle and instruments of\n husbandry; and vast armies were transported to Palestine, in\n order to accomplish the deliverance of the holy sepulchre. \u2014\n These rude and undisciplined bands died in great numbers on\n reaching the shore of Asia, from disease, famine and fatigue ;\n and, of the first Crusaders, it is estimated that 300,000 had per-\n ished before a single city was rescued from the infidels. Of the\n leaders in the Christian host, the first rank is due to Godfrey,\n duke of Brabant and Bouillon, who was accompanied by his\n two brothers, Eustace the elder, who had succeeded to the coun-\n ty of Boulogne, and Baldwin the younger. The other chiefs\n were, Robert of France, the brother of King Philip ; Robert\n Duke of Normandy, the son of William the Conqueror; Bohe*\n mond, the son of Robert Guiscard ; Tancred, his cousin ; and\n Raymond of Thoulouse. The vast armies that were collected\n under the guidance of these leaders, arrived by various routes,\n at Constantinople, the Greek capital; after having lost, some\n say, half their number, in the intermediate march through un-\n known countries, by famine, disease, and the assaults of the in-\n habitants into whose countries they had made so unexpected\n an irruption. After some time spent in the capital of the East,\n they crossed to the opposite shore of Asia. Having taken the\n towns of Nice and Antioch in the year 1098, they, about a year\n after, laid siege to Jerusalem, and carried it by assault, with a\n prodigious slaughter of the garrison and inhabitants, which\n was continued for three days, without respect either to age or\n sex.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Eight days after the capture of Jerusalem, the Latin chiefs\n proceeded to the election of a king, who should preside over\n their conquests in Palestine, and Godfrey of Bouillon was\n unanimously raised to this high office.

Sybilla, the mother of\n Baldwin, was the next heiress, who chose for her second hus-\n band, and consequently for king of Jerusalem, Guy of Lusignan,\n base in character, but handsome in his person. This choice\n was universally blamed, and excited the hatred of Count Ray-\n mond, who had been excluded from the succession and regen-\n cy, and who, entertaining an implacable hatred against the\n king, was seduced into a traitorous correspondence with the\n sultan. Many of the barons were also so dissatisfied, that\n they refused to take the oath of allegiance to the new king.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. It was in the midst of these internal dissensions that the\n kingdom of the Latins was assailed by a new enemy, namely,\n ihe Sultan Saladin, who joined refined humanity to valour, po-\n licy, and military skill. He had risen from a private station\n to the sovereignty of Egypt, and he had been for years extend-\n ing his influence and dominions. A fortress had been seized\n by a soldier of fortune, Reginald of Chatillon, from which he\n issued with his followers to pillage the caravans and insult the\n Mohammedans, and he even threatened the holy cities of Medi-\n na and Mecca. Saladin. complained of these injuries, and be-\n ing refused satisfaction, invaded the Holy Land with an army\n of 80,000 horse and foot. He advanced against Tiberias, to\n which he laid siege ; and a decisive battle was hazarded by\n the king of Jerusalem, in defence of this important place. The\n two armies met on the plain of Tiberias, and in a sanguinary\n Conflict, which lasted two days, the Christians were completely\n overthrown, with the loss of 30,000 men. The king, the Mar-\n quis of Montserrat, and the master of the templars, with many\n of their followers, were made prisoners ; and two hundred and\n thirty gallant knights of the cross were cruelly led out to exe-\n cution after the battle. This great victory placed the whole\n country at the mercy of the conqueror. The Christians were\n left without a head ; the towns and castles, drained of their\n governors, fell successively before Saladin\u2019s victorious force ; and\n scarcely had three months elapsed when he appeared in arms\n before the gates of Jerusalem.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0224/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 236, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0224/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 851}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0224/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0224/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1890, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3407}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fp:al:es:ti:00:ki:tt:_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1:historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0224/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fp/al/es/ti/00/ki/tt/_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1/historyofpalesti00kitt_1_0224.jp2", "height": 3407, "width": 1890, "levels": 6, "size": 558317}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"224\">\n<p>\n 216\n</p>\n<p>\n THE THIRD CRUSADE.\n</p>\n<p>\n [a. d. 1190.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.

A severe winter inter-\n rupted the operations of the field. But Richard, issuing from\n his winter quarters with the first gleam of spring, advanced\n with his army within sight of Jerusalem, the great object of\n his enterprise. Saladin had chosen Jerusalem for his head-\n quarters, where the sudden appearance of the Christian con-\n queror spread universal consternation. The holy city was, how-\n ever, relieved by the hasty retreat of the English king, dis-\n couraged by the difficulties of the enterprise and the murmurs\n of his troops. In the meantime, the town of Jaffa was vigor-\n ously assaulted by Saladin with a formidable force, and was on\n the point of surrendering, when Richard, hastening to its relief,\n encountered the besieging army of Saracens and Turks, amount-\n ing to 60,000 men, who yielded to the vigour of his attack. In\n the meantime, the miseries of a protracted war began to be se-\n verely felt, and the ambitious views of Richard were obstruct-\n ed by the discontent of his troops. Negociations were commen-\n ced, which were broken off, and as often resumed. The views\n of both parties varied with the fortune of war. At last, how-\n ever, both Saladin and Richard were equally desirous of termi-\n nating an unpopular and ruinous contest. The first demands\n of Richard were, the restitution of Jerusalem, Palestine, and\n the true cross. These terms were rejected by the sultan, who\n would not part with the sovereignty of Palestine, or listen to\n any proposition for dismembering his dominions. A truce was\n at length concluded for three years, by which it was stipulated\n that the Latin Christians should have liberty to visit the holy-\n city without being liable to tribute ; that the fort of Ascalon\n should be dismantled ; and that Jaffa and Tyre, with the inter-\n vening territory, should be surrendered to the Europeans.

A truce for six years had been concluded with Sa-\n phadin, the brother and successor of the sultan Saladin. The\n sovereign of the Latin kingdom at this time was Mary, the\n daughter of Isabella by Conrad of Tyre, Almeric and his wife\n being dead. In order to strengthen the government of Jerusa-\n lem, it was resolved to request the king of France, Philip Au-\n gustus, to provide a husband for Mary. John de Brienne, one\n of the most accomplished cavaliers in Europe, of tried valour\n and experience in war, was chosen ; and the Christian chiefs\n were so elated by this union, that they sought a pretence for\n breaking the subsisting truce between them and the sultan, and\n bringing matters to the arbitration of the sword. War accord-\n ingly ensued, and the new monarch of Jerusalem displayed all\n the great qualities of a statesman and a soldier, for which he\n was chosen ; and though his success did not entirely corres-\n pond to his hopes or wishes, yet he made a successful defence,\n and maintained for a time the Latin kingdom against the grow-\n ing power of its enemies. He foresaw, however, that its gra-\n dual decline and final ruin were approaching, as it was now\n reduced to two or three towns, and preserved only in a preca-\n rious existence by the divisions and civil wars that prevailed\n among its enemies.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. This intelligence rekindled the dying zeal of the Christian\n world. A new Crusade was commenced, and a large force,\n chiefly Hungarians and Germans, landed at Acre.

It was his\n policy, therefore, rather to disarm the hostility of these power-\n ful armies by treating with them, than to encounter them in\n the field ; and, accordingly, a treaty was concluded, by which\n Jerusalem, Jaffa, Bethlehem, Nazareth, and their dependencies,\n were restored to the Christians ; religious toleration was esta-\n blished, and the contending parties of Christians and Mahom-\n medans were allowed each to offer up their devotions, the first\n in the mosque El-Aksa, and the last in the mosque of Omar.*\n But all these services were performed by Frederic while under\n the stain of excommunication ; and hence the patriarch, when\n he made his entry into Jerusalem, refused to crown him, or to\n be present at the ceremonial; Frederic, therefore, himself took\n the crown from the holy sepulchre, and placed it on his own\n head.

[a.D. 1249\n</p>\n<p>\n raised in Europe for the holy war, and a large force of French\n and English, led by the chief nobility of both nations, landed\n in Syria. Numerous battles were fought, which terminated in\n favour of the Saracens ; and the French Crusaders, accordingly,\n after severe losses, were glad to purchase peace by the cession\n of almost all their conquests in Palestine. Next year, when\n the Earl of Cornwall, with the English levy, arrived at the\n scene of action, he found, to his surprise, that all the territories\n and privileges which had been ceded to the emperor of Ger-\n many were lost ; and that a few fortresses, and a small strip of\n territory on the coast, comprised all that the Latins possessed\n in Palestine. He immediately prepared for the vigorous prose-\n cution of hostilities. But the sultan, being involved in war\n with his brother in Damascus, readily granted favourable terms\n as the price of peace, namely, the cession to the Christian ar-\n mies of Jerusalem, Beirut, Nazareth, Bethlehem, Mount Tabor,\n and a large tract of the adjoining country. But the kingdom of\n Jerusalem, thus so happily established, was subverted by a ca-\n lamity from a new and unexpected quarter. In the interior of\n Asia the conquests of Ghenghis Khan had brought about the\n most stupendous revolutions, and the barbarous hordes of the\n desert, flying before his conquering sword, rushed like a torrent\n on other nations. The Kharjsmians, unable to withstand this\n powerful invader, were driven upon Syria, and the coalesced\n powers of Saracen and Christian were unable to resist their\n powerful assault. The Christian host was overthrown in a\n great battle, which lasted two days, and in which the grand\n masters of two orders, and most of the knights, were slain.\n The merciless invaders revelled in the sack and pillage of the\n holy city, sparing neither sex nor age ; and it was not until the\n year 1247 that they were routed near Damascus, by the Syrians\n and Mamlouks, and driven back to their former settlements on\n the Caspian Sea.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Each new disaster of the Christian arms served to re-\n kindle the languishing zeal of the Europeans ; and Louis IX.\n of France fitted out an immense armament for the Holy Land,\n consisting of 1800 sail, in which he embarked an army of\n 50,000 men. He landed in Egypt, and, after storming the town\n of Damietta, advanced along the sea-coast towards Cairo, when\n his troops were so wasted by sickness and famine, that they fell\n an easy prey to the enemy. The king, the most of his nobles,\n and the remnant of his army, were made prisoners; and it was\n owing to the clemency of the sultan Moadhdham, who accepted\n a ransom for their lives, that Louis, with his few surviving fol-\n lowers, was permitted to embark for Palestine.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The power of the Christians in Palestine, weakened,\n among other causes, by internal dissensions, was now vigo-\n rously assailed by the sultan Bibars, the Mamlouk sovereign\n of Egypt.

In\n place of directing his arms immediately against Palestine, he\n landed in Africa, and laid siege to Carthage, which he reduced.\n But he perished miserably on the burning sands of Africa, of a\n pestilential disease, which proved fatal also to many of his\n troops; and thus ingloriously terminated this expedition, which\n was the last undertaken by the Europeans for the recovery of\n the Holy Land.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. The Europeans in Palestine were now confined within the\n walls of Acre, their last stronghold, which was besieged by a\n Mamlouk host of 200,000 troops, that issued from Egypt, and\n encamped on the adjacent plain. In this their last conflict with\n the infidels of the Holy Land, the Europeans fully maintained\n the glory of their high name.

But, equalled as they were in discipline, and fearfully\n overmatched in numbers, by their enemies, they were over-\n borne by the weight and violence of their attacks, and in the\n storm and sack of the city, all either perished or were carried\n into captivity. Thus terminated for ever all those visions of\n glory and conquest by which so many adventurers were se-\n duced from Europe to the Holy Land, there to perish under\n the complicated perils of disease and the sword. The other\n smaller towns which still remained in possession of the Chris-\n tians yielded without a struggle to the Moslem arms, and un-\n der the religious tyranny of the infidels which succeeded, the\n Christians in Palestine were every where reduced to the lowest\n degree of debasement. The pilgrims who still visited Jerusa-\n lem were exposed to insult and danger ; and large contributions\n were exacted by their oppressors for a free passage through\n the Holy Land. The Mamlouk sultans of Egypt continued to\n rule over Palestine till the year 1382, when the country was\n overrun by a barbarous tribe from the interior of Asia. On\n their expulsion, the sovereignty of the Egyptian sultans was\n again acknowledged, until the country yielded to the formida-\n ble irruption of the great Tamerlane. At his death Jerusalem\n reverted to the kingdom of Egypt, and was finally subdued by\n the Turks, under whose barbarous rule it has continued for\n more than 300 years. The country was partitioned into pro-\n vinces, in each of which a pasha ruled with a despotic autho-\n rity equal to that of the sultan..\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.
