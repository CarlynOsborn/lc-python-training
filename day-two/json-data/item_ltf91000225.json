We all remember the means by which he\n obtained and procured his election to fhe UnU\n ted States Senate, and that the whole Whig\n party of Ohio at the Lime denounced it as eor- '\n rr.pt and unfair. But if that were all, we might\n .still be content to go to the polls and cast our\n suffrages for such other candidates as we could\n support, simply declining to vote for him. I\n know that in alluding to that genleman ' s past\n history and present position as a sectional agi\u00ac\n tator. and in pronouncing his election now aa\n endorsement of ideas and conduct dangerous\n to the existence of the nation, we shall be\n scoffed at and stigmatised by the cant term of\n \u25a0\u201c Union Savers.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n We shall be sneered at lor saying that our\n reasons for so believing him, consist in the\n conviction that the principles and objects of\n that gentleman and his political friends cavmok\n be practically affected and carried on:, without\n imperiling the Union of these States. It is\n strange, lamentably strange, that we have fal\u00ac\n len upon tiiue3 so full of evil, that devotion to\n the permanency of this Republic is to be treat\u00ac\n ed with taunts, jeers and derision.

It is proposed that each county\n shall send twice as many delegates as she lias\n representatives, according to the last apportion\u00ac\n ment. It will be seen that this plan works\n very badly lor those counties having a large\n slave population, and which are really more in\u00ac\n terested in this Southern movement than any\n others. Take for example. Brazoria. This\n county has a lu r ger number of slaves in propor\u00ac\n tion to the whites than any other county m the\n state. It is by far the wealthiest county in the\n State in proportion to her population, ai.d as*\n fixation and representation ought in some de\u00ac\n gree to go together, it would seem,but ' just and\n right that she should be represented in a cun-\n veutfon of this kind. But Although Brazoria\n county has a population of nearly eight thou\u00ac\n sand, white and colored, yet by the late appor\u00ac\n tionment, she is not allowed a representation.\n In connection with Galveston she is to elect a\n floater, who may, Galveston consenting, come\n from this county. It is the same way with the\n delegates to the convention. Galveston will\n probably be courteous enough to allow us ore\n delegate out of four lor the two counties. There\n will be counties having two delegates in the\n convention, which have not half as many slaves\n in the whole county as can be found on one\n plantation in Brazoria. To show the unfairness\n i d this plan still more clearly, let us take two\n other counties, Com 1 and Wharton. Comal\n county has 141 slaves, and is allowed two del-\n t gates in the Convention : Wharton county\n \u20182730 slaves and will have no delegate in the\n Convention ! Now which is more interested in\n guarding and perpetuating the institution of\n slavery, the planting county of Wharton, or the\n Dutch county of Comal? The fact is the coast\n counties, and those having the largest slave\n population, are allowed tbe least voice in the\n matter.\n</p>\n<p>\n Commenting upon that as any man jealous of\n the righls of the people would do has excited\n much ire and indignation. It is denounced as\n *\u2022 rank Ilelperism/\u2019 which I suppose is the most,\n damnable of all epithets that our enemies can\n use in these limes ol terrible words and furious\n raids, ot vigilance committees and committees\n of public safety. 1 know- not myself, what i*- <\n</p>\n<p>\n | full tenor is. since sir, 1 never have seen or read\n ; the work of Helper from which this word has\n been coined, nor do I believe that any of those\n j who united with me in issuing that address to\n ; the paople of Texas know anything more about\n it.\n</p>\n<p>\n To ail that appears in that address, sir. j did\n I and still do subsetibe, and to all such 1 hold\n ! myself responsible, but 1 deny that any one\n can draw from that the inter nee that I am an\n j abolitionist or untrue to the South or her insti-\n | lotions, I am not sir. and God forbid that 1 ever\n l should he!
