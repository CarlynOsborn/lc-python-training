On these three points it is proposed to\n dwell in this discourse.\n</p>\n<p>\n I. Let us consider the foundation of civil government. This\n is expressed in the declaration, \u201c The powers that be are ordain\u00ac\n ed of God.\u201d By the powers that be, are meant civil powers.\n Rulers are styled powers, because to them is committed the office\n of government, in the discharge of the duties of which they ex\u00ac\n ercise a controlling influence over their fellow men. The foun\u00ac\n dation of this power is the will of God, who is the great source\n of all power, and who hath so constituted the state and relations\n of society as to render government indispensable to its highest\n good. God so estabhshed the nature of things, as to make gov\u00ac\n ernment a necessary part. Law, which is the rule of govern\u00ac\n ment, is primarily from God, the great creator of the universe,\n the great author of aU beings and of all things,\u2014and lies at the\n foundation of universal good.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is by law that all created beings and things are regu\u00ac\n lated. Even the natural as well as the moral world has its\n established laws, which it obeys. These, in fanuliar language,\n are called the laws of nature ; though they are truly the laws\n of God,\u2014being the uniform method by which God governs the\n natural world.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0006/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 146, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0006/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0006/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1072}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0006/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1173, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2145}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0006/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2346, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4290}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0006/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ci/vi/lg/ov/er/nm/en/ti/00/pu/tn/civilgovernmenti00putn/civilgovernmenti00putn_0006.jp2", "height": 4290, "width": 2346, "levels": 6, "size": 577464}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"6\">\n<p>\n 4\n</p>\n<p>\n God\u2019s moral law is of a higher order; carried on, not like\n natural law, by means of physical impulsions and adherences, or\n by movements resulting from animal instinct, but by the power\n of motives.\n</p>\n<p>\n The moral law is adapted to rational beings, and appeals to\n reason and conscience. It has its rewards and punishments ;\n rewards, in case of obedience, and punishments, in case of dis\u00ac\n obedience. This law is as extensive as the whole range of mind\n in the great creation of God, and is applied to all beings having\n rational faculties, whether angels or men. It is the golden chain\n that binds together the moral universe. In his own law God has\n laid the foundation of all law, and has given a model of the kind\n of government which meets his sanction. Law, as beautifully\n defined by Burke, is beneficence acting by rule.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n II. We are to consider the obligations of civil govermnent.\n Civil government is binding, on the ground that it is an ordi\u00ac\n nance of God. The text is very explicit on this point: \u2018\u2018 Let\n every soul be subject to the higher powers ; for there is no power\n but of God: the powers that be are ordained of God.\u201d The\n apostle adds : \u201c Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resist-\n eth the ordinance of God; and they that resist shall receive to\n themselves damnation. For rulers are not a terror to good\n works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the\n power ? Do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of\n the same. For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But\n if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the\n sword in vain : for he is the minister of God, a revenger to exe\u00ac\n cute wrath upon him that doeth evil. Wherefore ye must needs\n be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience\u2019 sake.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n These directions are plain and unequivocal. They establish,\n beyond a doubt, the binding authority of human governments\n over their subjects. Their authority is binding, because God\n has made it so.\n</p>\n<p>\n It may be argued also that human governments are binding,\n on the ground of their reasonableness, their adaptedness to the\n wants of mankind, and their tendency to promote the general\n good. This idea seems to be suggested by the apostle. \u201c Ye\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0007/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 146, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0007/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0007/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1072}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0007/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1173, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2145}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0007/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2346, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4290}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0007/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ci/vi/lg/ov/er/nm/en/ti/00/pu/tn/civilgovernmenti00putn/civilgovernmenti00putn_0007.jp2", "height": 4290, "width": 2346, "levels": 6, "size": 544738}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"7\">\n<p>\n 5\n</p>\n<p>\n must needs be subject,\u201d he says, \u201cnot only for wrath^ but also\n for conscience^ sake.\u201d That is to say,\u2014we should yield obedi\u00ac\n ence to civil rulers, not merely through fear of punishment, if\n we transgress, but because it is right; because it corresponds\n with reason and the enlightened dictates of conscience.

Rulers, he says, are not a terror to\n good works, but to the evil. Do that which is good, and thou\n shalt have praise of the same.\n</p>\n<p>\n In these expressions it is implied that the laws are based on\n right principles, such as God approves, who put a conscience in\n our breasts to decide on right and wrong; that they are laws\n which, while they are sure to bring terror to the hearts of evil\n doers, will not fail to secure the meed of praise to those who do\n well. The ruler \u201c is the minister of God, a revenger to execute\n wrath\u201d\u2014upon whom ? \u201c Upon him that doeth m7.\u201d There is\n</p>\n<p>\n nothing to fear on the part of those that do well; because it is\n taken for granted that there is no injustice done\u2014the laws being\n based on the true principles of right. Conscience, therefore,\n gives in its approval, and decides in favor of obedience. It is\n on this ground the apostle inculcates subjection for conscience\n sake ; on the ground that government is an ordinance of God,\n exercised in conformity to its true design. We come now,\n</p>\n<p>\n III. To consider the proper limitations of civil government.\n The commands in the holy scriptures to obey rulers are in gen\u00ac\n eral terms, and without any specific qualifications. They are,\n however, by no means to be regarded as unlimited in their appfi-\n cation, any more than commands to children are to obey their\n parents, or wives to submit to their husbands. These commands\n are indeed positive. \u201c Children, obey your parents in all things.\u201d\n Col. 3 : 20. \u201c Let the wives be subject to their own husbands\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0008/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 146, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0008/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0008/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1072}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0008/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1173, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2145}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0008/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2346, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4290}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0008/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ci/vi/lg/ov/er/nm/en/ti/00/pu/tn/civilgovernmenti00putn/civilgovernmenti00putn_0008.jp2", "height": 4290, "width": 2346, "levels": 6, "size": 554989}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"8\">\n<p>\n .G\n</p>\n<p>\n in every thing.\u2019^ Epli. 5 : 24.

It thus stands on\n the platform of the Divine will; but whenever it steps from this\n platform, upon which God has placed it, it loses its basis, and\n stands on nothing. Just so far as it arrogates to itself rights\n which God has not conferred, by assuming the right to enact or\n enforce laws which are contrary to the laws of God and to con\u00ac\n science, the right arm of its strength is broken, and it ceases to\n have the power to enforce its requirements. ,\n</p>\n<p>\n A stream cannot rise higher than its fountain, nor can civil\n government exercise prerogatives greater or beyond those which\n are to be found in the Great Source whence its power came. And\n let it be considered, God himself, by his own holy nature, is lim\u00ac\n ited to that which is right. Of course, whenever rulers attempt\n to pass this boundary, and legislate wrong into right; or, as the\n scriptures very forcibly express it, \u201c frame imQUiTY by law,\u201d\n their laws can have no binding force. They not only act without\n God\u2019s authority in such a case, but against his authority. They\n set themselves up against Jehovah, and assume to themselves\n prerogatives which Jehovah himself disclaims. They pass off\n from the foundation on which God has placed them, as law-mak\u00ac\n ers, and assume a position beyond and above the authority from\n which all their power is derived.

The Constitution is founded on the great principles stated in the De\u00ac\n claration of Rights which preceded it,\u2014expressed in the following language:\n \u201cWe hold these truths to be self-evident\u2014that all men are Created equal;\n that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights ;\n that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness ;\n that to secure these rights, governments are instituted among men.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In accordance with these great principles,\u2014principles on which all gov\u00ac\n ernments are properly founded,\u2014we find it laid down in the very platform\n and declared basis of the Constitution, that it is the object of that instru\u00ac\n ment to ESTABLISH JUSTICE, * * * PROMOTE THE GENERAL WEL\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n FARE, and SECURE the blessings of liberty.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, compare the fugitive slave bill with this; the object of which is, to\n deprive men of those very rights and privileges which it is the express ob\u00ac\n ject and fundamental design of the Constitution to establish. How perfectly\n absurd, then, to pronounce the law constitutional.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The Constitution declares, (Art. 1: Sec. 9,) that \u201c the privilege of the\n writ of habeas corpus shall not be suspended, unless when, in cases of re\u00ac\n bellion or invasion, the public safety may require it.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The habeas corpus provision is designed as a security against hasty pro\u00ac\n ceedings ; and affords to a person arrested and held in custody for any al\u00ac\n leged misdemeanor, the privilege of being taken before a magistrate, or\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0027/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 146, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0027/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0027/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1072}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0027/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1173, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2145}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0027/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2346, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4290}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0027/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ci/vi/lg/ov/er/nm/en/ti/00/pu/tn/civilgovernmenti00putn/civilgovernmenti00putn_0027.jp2", "height": 4290, "width": 2346, "levels": 6, "size": 618287}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"27\">\n<p>\n 25\n</p>\n<p>\n court of justice, in pursuance of a writ issued from the Judge, and there\n ^J^joying the opportunity of showing his innocence.\n</p>\n<p>\n ^ In opposition to this provision of the Constitution, the fugitive slave law\n directs that the proceeding in the case of the alleged fugitive be \u201c in a sum\u00ac\n mary/ manner.** The commissioner may hear as brief testimony from the\n claimant as he may please to pronounce sufficient, and then immediately\n grant to such claimant a certificate of his rights, * * * which certifi\u00ac\n cate shall authorize such claimant to seize or arrest and transport\u2019* the person\n claimed, to the State or Territory from which he is alleged to have es\u00ac\n caped.

It is argued, by certain apologists for this law, that it does not cut\n off the right of trial by jury,\u2014there being an opportunity for returned fu\u00ac\n gitives to secure for themselves such a trial in the Southern States. But\n such sophistry will not deceive those who think for themselves. Let it be\n considered, that the moment the commissioner before whom the alleged\n fugitive is tried, decides against him, all his rights are regarded, in law, as\n annihilated. He is decided to be a mere thing, a \u201cchattel personal,\u2014\n TO ALL INTENTS, CONSTRUCTIONS, and PURPOSES WHATSOEVER.\u201d Has\n a thing of this description \u201c the right of trial by jury ?\u201d The fact is, when\n the fugitive is delivered over into the hands of the claimant by the commis\u00ac\n sioner, he is delivered over as a slave, and not as a man. No such thing as\n atrial by jury is ever thought of, or dreamed of, in such a case, by the framers\n of this law. Slaves are defined in slave laws to be chattels personal. And\n what is the meaning of this term ? \u201c chattels,\u201d says Webster, \u201c are things\n movable, as animals, furniture of a house, jewels, corn, & c.\u201d Such things\n are slaves; and we might as well talk about a man\u2019s horse having a right to\n a jury trial, as his slaves. Judge Stroud, in his \u201c Sketch of the Laws relat\u00ac\n ing to Slavery,\u201d lays it down as the cardinal principle of slavery, that\n \u201c the slave is not to be ranked among sentient beings, but among things !\u201d\n \u201c This,\u201d he says, \u201c obtains as undoubted law in all these States,\u201d (the Slave\n States.)\n</p>\n<p>\n 4\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0028/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 146, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0028/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0028/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1072}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0028/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1173, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2145}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0028/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2346, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4290}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ci:vi:lg:ov:er:nm:en:ti:00:pu:tn:civilgovernmenti00putn:civilgovernmenti00putn_0028/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ci/vi/lg/ov/er/nm/en/ti/00/pu/tn/civilgovernmenti00putn/civilgovernmenti00putn_0028.jp2", "height": 4290, "width": 2346, "levels": 6, "size": 662300}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"28\">\n<p>\n 26\n</p>\n<p>\n 6.

Art. 3.\n</p>\n<p>\n But the fugitive slave law places the judicial power,\u201d in deciding one\n of the most important of all questions, viz : whether a man shall, or shall\n not, be compelled to resign his manhood and become a thing, in the hands\n of commissioners, who may be created by scores at any time, for the con\u00ac\n venience of slave holders, without any limitation, except the discretion of\n courts. These commissioners, though they may be entirely destitute of all\n legal qualifications, and incompetent to judge of the character and value of\n testimony, it is declared in the fugitive slave law \u201c shall have concurrent\n jurisdiction with the judges of the circuit court and district courts of the\n United States.\u201d Thus they are authorized fully to execute the judicial\n power which the Constitution has vested in the United States\u2019 courts.\n And from their decision there is no appeal. They may receive a false affi\u00ac\n davit, or the testimony of a perjured witness, and decide merely from\n such testimony, without being called to any account. There is no jury\n allowed to make up its verdict on the facts. A simple writing from their\n hands, though entirely founded on falsehood, is \u201c conclusive\u201d in deciding\n the case, whether a man shall be a man or a brute. This simple writing is\n made sufficient by the law to prevent any interference with the claimant,\n \u201c by any process issued by any court, judge, magistrate, or other person\n whomsoever,\u201d even the Chief Justice of the United States. If this is not an\n abuse of the judicial power, as laid down in the Constitution, it is difficult\n to conceive what would be. Such a provision would form a blot upon the\n code of the veriest despotisms of the Old World.

It will be seen by the language of the\n law itself, that it is not necessary that we should receive any notice whatever,\n from legal authority, or any other authority^ that the fugitive is such, in or\u00ac\n der to subject ourselves to the punishment which the law prescribes. All\n that is necessary is, that we should have \u201c knowledge\u201d of the fact. The\n law says,-\u2014\u201c After notice, or KNOWLEDGE of the fact that such person\n was a fugitive,\u201d & c.
