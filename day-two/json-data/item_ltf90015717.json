Our\n national distaste for whatever is abstract in political science amounts undoubtedly\n to a fault ; yet it is perhaps a fault on the right side.

Yet in almost all periods of time,\n and in all lands, the welfare of society has been supposed to\n depend upon an alliance between them. Bishop Warburton\n may be selected as the expositor of the theory which has\n obtained greatest currency in relation to this subject : that both\n are independent and sovereign spcieties, proposing different\n ends and hence not clashing even though the same persons are\n under the jurisdiction of both; that civil society labors under\n certain defects in attaining its ends, because it can only restrain\n from open transgression, because it cannot enforce the duties of\n imperfect obligation, and because it often inflames the appetites\n it proposes to correct ; that religion having the sanction of re-\n wards, while civil government has only that of punishments, ex-\n actly supplies ihese defects, and so the church becomes necessary\n as the complement of the state. A union is therefore formed for\n their mutual benefit, in which the state pledges itself to protect,\n endow, and extend the church, and the church to lend her whole\n influence to the state. The reciprocal concessions are that the\n church resigns her supremacy by constituting the civil magis-\n trate her earthly head and by submitting her laws to the state\u2019s\n approval ; and the state, in compensation, gives to the church a\n coercive power for the reformation of manners, and secures her\n a seat and representation in the national council. From imme-\n morial antiquity this union has subsisted, justified sometimes\n by one theory, and sometimes by another. In the Jewish theo-\n cracy, of course, the state existed for the church, and was simply\n the ark which enshrined it. The founder of Christianity, it is\n true, distinctly proclaimed his kingdom to be not of this world,\n and uttered the words of divorce between them, when he said,\n \u201c render unto Caesar the things which are Caesar\u2019s, and to God\n the things which are God\u2019s.\u201d Certain it is that during three\n centuries the church not only sustained herself separately\n from the state, but sustained herself against the whole power\n of the latter ; and was most characterized by vigor and expan-\n sion during this very period when she was known as \u201c ecclesia\n</p>\n<p>\n 3\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ou:rh:is:to:ri:cm:is:si:00:pa:lm:ourhistoricmissi00palm:ourhistoricmissi00palm_0020/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 154, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 265}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ou:rh:is:to:ri:cm:is:si:00:pa:lm:ourhistoricmissi00palm:ourhistoricmissi00palm_0020/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 308, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 530}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ou:rh:is:to:ri:cm:is:si:00:pa:lm:ourhistoricmissi00palm:ourhistoricmissi00palm_0020/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 617, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ou:rh:is:to:ri:cm:is:si:00:pa:lm:ourhistoricmissi00palm:ourhistoricmissi00palm_0020/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1235, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2121}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ou:rh:is:to:ri:cm:is:si:00:pa:lm:ourhistoricmissi00palm:ourhistoricmissi00palm_0020/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2471, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4243}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ou:rh:is:to:ri:cm:is:si:00:pa:lm:ourhistoricmissi00palm:ourhistoricmissi00palm_0020/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ou/rh/is/to/ri/cm/is/si/00/pa/lm/ourhistoricmissi00palm/ourhistoricmissi00palm_0020.jp2", "height": 4243, "width": 2471, "levels": 6, "size": 645170}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"20\">\n<p>\n [ 18 ]\n</p>\n<p>\n pressaP Yet no sooner did she come to empire through the\n conversion of Constantine than the fatal union was again formed\n with the state, and has been perpetuated ever since with all\n its pernicious results.
