It is intended for beginners, and is therefore written in a simple\n style, and, to render it convenient both for the pupil and teacher, it is divided into brief\n paragraphs and short chapters. Ample questions for examination are appended to the\n work. The teacher will doubtless find it better, in many cases, to substitute questions\n of his own, adapting them to the various capacities of his pupil.\n</p>\n<p>\n The publishers believe that the manner in which the work is prepared, together with\n its cheapness, will render it fit to be introduced into the Common Schools throughout our\n country. It will be seen that a pupil may commit the whole volume to memory during a\n winter\u2019s schooling; and, if in this brief space a clear outline of Universal History may\n be established in the memory, it is obvious that the subject is worthy the attention of\n every person interested in education.\n</p>\n<p>\n Entered according to the Act of Congress, in the year 1849, by\n E. H. BUTLER,\n</p>\n<p>\n in the Clerk\u2019s Office of the District Court of the Eastern District of\n</p>\n<p>\n Pennsylvania.\n</p>\n<p>\n NOTE TO THE REVISED EDITION.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this revised edition, the Author has corrected a few errors, introduced recent events,\n and attempted certain emendations, where criticism had suggested their propriety. For\n the sake of greater convenience, the questions are arranged at the bottom of the pages.\n The chapters, however, are the same as before, and no change has been made which will\n render it inconvenient to use this edition in the same classes with previous editions.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n hAthaoge\n</p>\n<p>\n 19 6\n</p>\n<p>\n O u \u2022 >\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0007/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 445}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0007/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 891}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0007/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1077, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1782}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0007/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2154, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3564}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0007/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/pe/te/rp/ar/le/ys/co/mm/00/go/od/_0/peterparleyscomm00good_0/peterparleyscomm00good_0_0007.jp2", "height": 3564, "width": 2154, "levels": 6, "size": 457118}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"7\">\n<p>\n INTRODUCTION.\n</p>\n<p>\n (HATTER FAos\n</p>\n<p>\n I.

I suppose you have often met with the words History and Ge-\n ography. History tells the story of mankind since the world was\n created, and may be compared to an old man who has lived for\n thousands of years, and who has seen cities built and fall into decay ;\n who has seen nations rise, flourish, and disappear; and who, with a\n memory full of wonderful things, sits down to tell you of all that has\n happened during so many ages.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Geography is a desc ription of towns, rivers, mountains, and\n countries; the things which a traveller sees in going from one place\n to another. Geography, then, may be compared to some roving fel-\n low who has been all over the world in ships, stages, and steamboats,\n and who has come back to give us an account of all he has seen.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. You will see, then, titat History is a record of events that have\n happened, and that Geography tells you of the places where they\n happened. In order to understand the former, you must know some-\n thing of the latter. How, in this little book I propose to recount the\n history of the world ; I shall therefore sometimes seem to put on the old\n grey-beard of history, who has lived for thousands of years, and tell\n you of what has come to pass; and sometimes I shall make you fancy\n yourself in a balloon or vessel, and carry you with me to the places\n where the events I am to relate, have occurred.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. I shall, in the progress of my story, tell you about the creation\n of the first man and woman; of tne large family they had; and how\n these increased and spread themselves throughout different countries.\n I shall tell you of the great nations that have existed, of the great\n battles that have been fought, and of the deeds of celebrated persons.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. But, before I proceed, I must remind you that the world is mund,\n and that men and animals live upon the surface ; that the face of the\n</p>\n<p>\n Questions for examination. Chap. I. \u2014 1. What is history ? To what may it be com-\n pared ? 2. What is geography ? To what may it be compared ? 5. What is the shape\n</p>\n<p>\n of the earth? Where do men and animals live ?

A high piece of land, you know, is called a mountain or hill ; a\n low piece ofland is called a valley. You often see water running in\n a stream through a valley, which is called a river; and you some-\n times see a still piece of water surrounded by hills, which is called a\n lake\n</p>\n<p>\n 7, About one third of the face of the earth is land, and two thirds\n are water. The land is divided into two great continents; the\n western continent consists of North and South America; the eastern\n continent consists of Europe, Africa, and Asia.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER II.\u2014 INTRODUCTION CONTINUED.\n</p>\n<p>\n Parley proceeds to tell how the World is divided into\n Land and Water.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. I have just told my readers, that about two thirds of the face\n of the earth are covered with water. This water is one vast salt sea,\n but to different parts of it we give different names.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. That part which lies between America and Europe is called the\n Atlantic Ocean, and is about three thousand miles wide; that part\n which lies between America and Asia is called the Pacific Ocean, and\n is about ten thousand miles wide. There are many other names given\n to other parts of the great salt sea.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Ships, as you well know, sail from one country to another upon\n the water, and in this way a great deal of trade or commerce is car-\n ried on. But, as mankind live on the land, my stories will chiefly re-\n late to what has happened on the land.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. I suppose you have heard people speak of the four quarters of\n the world. By this they mean America, Europe, Africa, and Asia\n Besides these, there are a great many pieces of land encircled by\n water, called islands.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. In the Pacific Ocean there are many of these, the inhabitants oi\n which are very numerous. These islands are considered a fifth di-\n vision of the world, and are called Oceania.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Now what I am going to tell you has happened in these differ-\n ent parts of the world. In order to understand my stories, it is ne-\n cessary you should look over the maps which are here given. These\n will show you where the different countries are, about which I am\n going to speak.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. What is a mountain or hill ? A valley ? A river ? Lake ? 7. What part of the face\n of the earth is land ? What portion is water ? How is the land divided ? What of the\n westeru continent ? The eastern ? Ch. II. \u2014 1.

Before I proceed farther, I must tell you that Asia is a vas\n country with a multitude of cities, occupied by a great many differen\n nations.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The principal of these nations are the Tartars, who wander from\n place to place, and dwell chiefly in tents ; the Arabs, who have large\n flocks of camels and fine horses, with which they roam over the des-\n ert ; the Hindoos, or inhabitants of India, who travel about on ele-\n phants, and worship idols ; the Persians, who are very fond of poetry\n and have splendid palaces; the Chinese, from whom we get tea; and\n the Turks, who sit on cushions instead of chairs.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The whole population of Asia is about four hundred millions\n which is about half the inhabitants of the whole globe. It has ten\n times as many people as the whole of North and South America put\n together.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Africa, you know, is the native land of the negroes. It has a\n few large cities, but the whole number of people is but sixty millions.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Europe is divided into several nations, such as the English,\n French, Italians, Spaniards, German ' s, Russians, and others. It has\n many fine cities, and about three hundred millions of inhabitants.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. America is the country where we live. It has some large cider\n and many pleasant towns and villages, but more than half the countn\n is uninhabited. The whole population is about forty millions.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Oceania, as I have before said, consists of many islands in the\n Pacific Ocean. Some o f these, as Java, Sumatra, Borneo, and New\n Holland, are very large, me latter being the largest island on the globe.\n From these countries we get pepper, cloves, coffee, and other nice\n things.

The people have many ingenious arts,\n but the schools are poor, and but a small portion are taught to read\n and write.

The people and animals now came out of the ark, and from\n them the world was again stocked with inhabitants. The animals\n spread themselves abroad, and after many centuries they were ex-\n tended into all countries.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Noah had three sons, Shem, Ham, and Japheth. These, with\n their families, proceeded to the country of Shinar, which lies to the\n south of Mount Ararat.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.

The people increased very rapidly, and, at the end of a hundred\n years from the deluge, they were quite numerous. Most of Noah\u2019s\n family were at this time alive.

All who remembered the deluge, or had heard of it, were afraid\n that the wickedness of mankind would again be punished in a simi\n lar way. They therefore resolved to build a tower, that they might\n mount upon it, and save themselves from destruction.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. Accordingly they laid the foundation of the edifice on the\n eastern bank of the river Euphrates. Perhaps they expected to\n rear the tower so high, that its top would touch the blue sky, and\n enable them to climb into heaven.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. Their building materials were bricks that had been baked in\n the sun. Instead of mortar, they cemented the bricks together with\n a sort of slime or pitch.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. The workmen labored very diligently, and piled one layer of\n bricks upon another, till the earth was a considerable distance be-\n neath them.

If any of the workmen called for bricks, their companions at\n the bottom of the tower might mistake their meaning, and bring\n them pitch.

This event caused such confusion that they could not go on\n building the tower.

He knew that his people hated him ; and therefore he kep\n guards in his palace; but he was afraid to trust even his guards\n Whether he was murdered at last, or whether he died quietly in his\n bed, is more than I can tell, for history does not inform us.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. After the reign of Ninias, there was an interval of eight hun\n dred years, during which it is impossible to say what happened in\n the kingdom of Assyria. It is probable that most of the kings were\n like Ninias, that they wasted their time in idle pleasures, and never\n did any thing worthy of remembrance.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. When Pul was king of Assyria, he conquered the Israelites and\n forced them to pay him tribute. He is supposed to have been the\n king of Nineveh to whom the prophet Jonah was sent to preach\n repentance, about eight hundred and sixty years before Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Some years afterwards, there was a king upon the throne of\n Assyria whose name was Sardanapalus. He is said to have been a\n beautiful young man; but he was slothful, and took no care of his\n kingdom, and made no attempt to promote the welfare of his people.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. He never went outs\u2019de of his palace, but lived all the time\n among the women. And in order to make himself more fit for their\n company, he painted his face, and sometimes put on a woman\u2019s\n dress. In this ridiculous guise, the great king Sardanapalus used to\n sit down with the women, and help them to spin.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. But while Sardanapalus was feasting, and dancing, and painting\n his face, and dressing himself lure a woman, and helping the women\n to spin, a terrible destruction was impending over his head.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. Arbaces, governor of the Medes, made war against this un-\n worthy monarch, and besieged him in the city of Babylon. Sarda-\n hapalus saw that he could not escape, and that, if he lived any longer,\n he should probably become a slave.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. So, rather than be a slave, he \" esolved to die. He therefore\n collected his treasures, and heaped them into one great pile in a\n splendid hall of his palace, and then set fire to the pile. The palace\n was speedily in a blaze, and Sardanapalus, with his favorite officers,\n and a multitude of beautiful women, were burnt to death in the\n flames.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. Thus ended the great Assyrian monarchy, the country being\n conquered by Arbaces. It was afterwards revived, and continued\n till the time of Cyrus, 538, B. C., but this is usually considered\n another empire.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. What was his character? What did he do? 3. What else of Ninias? 4. What of\n Assyria tor eight hundred years after Ninias? S.

The rest of the inhabitants of Chaldea were idolaters, and wor\n shipped the sun, moon, and stars; but Abraham worshipped the true\n God whom we worship. In the early part of his life he was a\n shepherd on the Chaldean plains. When his father was dead, God\n commanded him to leave his native country, and travel westward to\n the land of Canaan.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. This region was afterwards called Palestine. It lies north of\n Arabia, is on the eastern border of the Mediterranean sea, and is\n nearly six thousand miles southeasterly from New York. It was a\n rich and fertile country ; and God promised Abraham, that his de-\n scendants should dwell there.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Many years of Abraham\u2019s life were spent in wandering to and\n fro. His wife Sarah went with him, and they were followed by a\n large number of male and female servants, and by numerous flocks\n and herds. They dwelt in tents, and had no settled home.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Abraham and Sarah had one son, named Isaac. His father\n loved him fondly ; but, when God commanded him to sacrifice the\n child, he prepared to obey. But an angel came down from heaven,\n and told him not to slay his son.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. The life of Abraham was full of interesting events, but I have\n not room to relate them all here. He lived to be a hundred and\n seventy-five years old, and then died at Hebron, in Canaan. His\n burial-place was in a cave at Machpelah where Sarah had been\n buried, many years before.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The Jews and the Arabians are descended from this ancient pa-\n triarch. They have always called him Father Abraham. It is said,\n that to this day, they show the place where Abraham and Sarah lie\n buried, and that they consider it a holy spot.

The Egyptians treated them like slaves. All the hardest labor\n was performed by the Hebrews. It is thought by some writers, that\n the immense piles of stone, called the Pyramids, were built by them.\n These vast edifices are still standing on the banks of the Nile.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The cruel king of Egypt was named Pharaoh, like his predeces-\n sor. One of the most wicked injuries that he iuliicted on the Hebrews\n was the following: \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. He commanded that every male child should be thrown into the\n river Nile the instant he was born. The reason of this horrible cru-\n elty was, that the Hebrews might not become more numerous than\n the Egyptians, and conquer the whole country.\n</p>\n<p>\n t3. One of the Hebrew women, however, could not make up her\n mind to throw her son into the Nile. If she had positively disobeyed\n the king\u2019s order, she would have been put to death.

At that period they were the most learned people\n on earth.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. But, though he himself was so well treated, Moses did not for-\n get the sufferings of the other Hebrews. He remembered that they\n were his brethren, and he resolved to rescue them from their oppres-\n sors.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. He and his brother Aaron received power from God to perform\n many wonderful things, in order to induce Pharaoh to let the He-\n brews depart out of Egypt.

She pretended to love Samson in\n return ; but her only object was to ruin him.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. This woman used many persuasions to induce Samson to tell\n her what it was that made him so much stronger than ^ther men.\n At first Samson deceived her. He said, that if he were bound with\n seven green withs, his strength would depart ; or that, if he were\n tied with new ropes, he should be as weak as an ordinary man.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. So Delilah bound him first with seven green withs, and after-\n wards with new ropes. But Samson snapped the withs like burnt\n tow, and the ropes like thread. At length, however, Delilah pre-\n vailed upon him to tell her the real cause of his great strength.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. When she had found out the secret, she cut off the hair of his\n head while he was sleeping, and then delivered him to her country-\n men, the Philistines.

One day the Philistines were offering a great sacrifice to their\n idol, whose name was Dagon. They feasted, and their hearts were\n merry. When their mirth was at its height, they sent for poor blind\n Samson, that he might amuse them by showing specimens of his\n W T onderful strength.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. Samson was accordingly brought from prison and led into\n Dagon \u2019s temple. His brazen fetters clanked at every step. He was\n a woful object with his blinded eyes.

Many other judges ruled over Israel, in the space of about foui\n hundred years from the time that Moses led the Hebrews out of\n Egypt, But at length they became dissatisfied with this mode of\n government, and demanded that a king should be placed over them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Samuel was then the judge of Israel. He was an old man, and\n a wise one; and, besides the wisdom that he had collected in the\n course of a long life, he possessed wisdom from on high.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. When the people demanded a king, Samuel endeavored to con-\n vince them, that they were much better off without one. He de-\n scribed the tyrannical acts which kings have always been in the habit\n of committing, whenever they have had the power to do so.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. But the Israelites would not hearken to this wise and good old\n man. They still wished for a king. They imagined that none but\n a king would govern them well in time of peace, or fight success-\n fully against their enemies in war.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Samuel therefore consulted the Lord, and was directed to find\n out a king for the Israelites. The person who was fixed upon was\n a young man named Saul, the son of Kish. He possessed great\n beauty, and was a head taller than any other man among the Israel-\n ites. Samuel anointed his head with oil, and gave him to the\n Israelites as their king.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. For a considerable time king Saul behaved like a wise and\n righteous monarch. But at length he began to disobey the Lord, and\n seldom took the advice of Samuel, although that good old priest\n would have been willing to direct him in every action of his life.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. In the course of Saul\u2019s reign, the Israelites were often at war\n with the neighboring nations. At one time, when the Philistines\n had invaded the country, there was a great giant in their host, whose\n name was Goliath, of Gath.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. He was at least ten or twelve feet high, and was clothed from\n head to foot in brazen armor. He carried an enormous spear, the\n iron head of which weighed as many as thirty pounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. Every day did this frightful giant stride forth from the camp ot\n the Philistines, and defy the Israelites to produce a champion who\n would stand against him in single combat. But, instead of doing\n this, the whole host of Israel stood aloof from him, as a flock of\n sheep from a lion.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ch. XVII.\u2014 1.

But little David was not at all abashed. He made a bold an-\n swer, and told Goliath that he would cut off his head, and give his\n enormous carcass to the beasts of the field. This threat so enraged\n the giant, that he put himself in motion to slay David.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The young man ran forward to meet Goliath, and, as he ran, he\n took a smooth stone from his scrip, and placed it in his sling. When\n at a proper distance, he whirled the sling, and let drive the stone. It\n went whizzing through the air, and hit Goliath right in the centre of\n the forehead.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. The stone penetrated to the brain ; and down the giant fell at\n full length upon the field, with his brazen armor clanging around\n him. David then cut off Goliath\u2019s head with his own sword.

David had won so much renown by his victory over Goliath,\n that Saul becattie envious of him, and often endeavored to kill him.\n But Jonathan, the son of Saul, loved David better than a brother.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. During the lifetime of Saul, David was forced to live in exile.\n But, after a reign of about twenty-four years, king Saul was slain on\n the mountains of Gilboa, in a disastrous battle with the Philistines.\n Jonathan was likewise killed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. When David heard of these sad events, he expressed his sorrow\n by weeping, and rending his garments. Yet he gained a kingdom by\n the death of Saul and Jonathan; for the men of Judah first elected\n him to reign over them, and afterwards the whole people of Israel\n chose him for their king.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. A great part of David\u2019s life was spent in war. He gained many\n victories, and enjoyed hig. A lenown as a gallant leader.

But\n he also won a peaceful kind of fame, which will last while the world\n endures, and be remembered through eternity.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. He won it by his heavenly poesy ; for king David was the sweet\n Psalmist of Israel ; and in all the ages since he lived, his psalms have\n been sung to the praise of the Lord. It is now about three thousand\n years since David died ; yet to this hour every pious heart loves to\n commune with God in the beautiful words of this inspired man.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. In the latter part of his life, David was much grieved by the re-\n bellious conduct of his son Absalom. But it grieved him more when\n Absalom was slain by Joab, who found him hanging by his long hair\n on the branches of an oak, and pierced his body with three darts.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. When David had reigned forty years, and was grown a very old\n man, he died in his palace at Jerusalem. The kingdom was inherited\n by his son Solomon. This prince was very young when he ascended\n the throne, but he was wiser in his youth than in his riper years.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8.

When she came to Jerusalem, she beheld Solomon seated on\n a great throne of ivory overlaid with pure gold. His feet rested on a\n golden footstool. There were lions of gold about the throne.

His death .\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. In a former part of this book I have told the story of Assyria,\n the first great empire of ancient times. It was situated, as you re-\n member, on the borders of the rivers Tigris and Euphrates. In this\n region the climate is warm, and the soil exceedingly fruitful\n Here the human race seemed to multiply in the most wonderful\n manner.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Thus many nations soon sprung up and increased, till the whole\n surrounding country was filled with multitudes of people. Assyria,\n at one time, extended its dominion over most of these nations ; but\n at length Persia became a powerful monarchy, and not only Assyria,\n but a great many other nations, became subject to it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The first inhabitants of Persia were descended from Elam, the\n eldest son of Shem. They were therefore called Elamites. Very\n little is known of their history till about eighteen centuries after the\n deluge. Cyrus, a great conqueror, then ascended the throne of Per-\n sia. Some historians have spoken of Cyrus as a wise and excellent\n monarch, but it appears probable that he was no better than most\n other conquerors.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Cyrus continued to extend his empire in all directions. Media,\n Parthia, Mesopotamia, Armenia, Syria, Canaan, and parts of Arabia,\n were subdued, and made portions of his kingdom. One of his chief\n exploits was the taking of the city of Babylon, the capital of Assyria.\n The walls of this great city were so thick and high, that it would\n have been impossible for an enemy either to break them down, or to\n climb over them. It was therefore a very difficult matter to take\n this strong place.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Now the channel of the river Euphrates ran directly through\n the centre of Babylon. Cyrus caused deep ditches to be dug around\n the city, so that he could draw off all the water of the river, and\n leave the channel dry. When the ditches were completed, he waited\n for a proper time to draw off the river.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. On a certain night, Belshazzar, king of Babylon, made a great\n festival. His guards, and nearly all the inhabitants, were eating and\n drinking, thoughtless of the enemy on the outside of their walls.\n The Persians seized this opportunity to throw open the dams of the\n ditches.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.

Cambyses, the son of Cyrus, seems to have been a worse man\n than his father. He was addicted to drinking wine ; and Prexaspes,\n a favorite courtier, hinted to him that he injured his health and\n faculties by this practice. When Prexaspes had done speaking,\n Cambyses called for wine, and drank off several large goblets. \u201c Now\n we shall see,\u201d said he, \u201c whether the wine has dimmed my sight, or\n rendered my hand unsteady !\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 2.

It is true that in many countries, particularly in Asia, the divine\n laws of Christ are not known ; but in most places the kings are\n Detter than they were in the time of Cambyses. In our happy coun-\n try we have no kings, and therefore the stories I am telling you about\n the cruelties of the ancient monarchs of Asia appear very shocking.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. But I must go on with my story. Cambyses made war against\n the Egyptians. At the siege of one of their cities, he contrived a\n very cunning method to take the place. The Egyptians believed\n that cats and dogs were sacred, and they worshipped them as gods.\n This foolish superstition induced Cambyses to collect all the cats and\n dogs in the country, and place them in front of his army.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The Egyptians were afraid to discharge their arrows, lest they\n should kill some of these divine animals. The Persians therefore\n marched onward, with the dogs barking and the cats mewing before\n them, and the city was taken without the slightest resistance.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The chief deity of the Egyptians was a great bull, to whom\n they had given the name of Apis. Cambyses killed this holy bull,\n and bestowed the flesh on some of his soldiers for dinner. Soon\n afterwards, to the great joy of the Egyptians, he killed himself acci-\n dentally with his own sword.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER XXVI.\u2014 ASIA CONTINUED.\n</p>\n<p>\n Expedition of Xerxes into Greece.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. Another king of the Persians was named Darius. He was\n likewise a cruel tyrant. When he was going on an expedition\n against the Scythians, he compelled an old man\u2019s three sons to join\n his army. These were all the children the old man had. He came\n into the king\u2019s presence, and earnestly entreated that one of his sons\n might be left at home.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. \u201c I am very poor and infirm,\u201d said the old man. \u201c I am unable\n to work. If you take away all my three children, I shall starve to\n death.\u201d \u201cIndeed,\u201d answered king Darius in a very compassionate\n tone, \u201c then they shall all three remain with you !\u201d Immediately\n he ordered the three young men to be slain, and gave their dead\n bodies to their poor old father.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. While Darius was preparing to make war on Greece he fell\n sick and died. His successor was his son Xerxes.

You may well believe, that a king, who could collect so large\n an army, had great wealth and power. At this time the Persian\n empire was of vast extent, but still Xerxes wished to conquer other\n nations. His capital was Persepolis, one of the most splendid cities\n that ever existed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Here Xerxes had magnificent palaces ; he had gold and silver\n in abundance, he had precious stones more than he could count ; he\n was indeed surrounded with pomp and magnificence ; but all these\n could not bring contentment. He was still desirous of conquering\n other nations; and for this purpose he collected the greatest army of\n which history gives us any account.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. When Xerxes arrived in Greece, it so happened that a great\n mountain, called Mount Athos, stood directly in the way that he\n wished his ships to sail. He therefore wrote a letter to the moun-\n tain, commanding it to get out of his way ; but Mount Athos would\n not stir one step.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. In order to bring his land-forces from Asia into Greece, Xerxes\n built a bridge of boats across a part of the sea called the Hellespont.\n But the waves broke the bridge to pieces, and Xerxes commanded\n the sea to be whipped for its disrespectful conduct.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The greater part of the cities of Greece submitted to Xerxes,\n but Sparta and Athens made a stubborn resistance. Though they\n could muster but few soldiers, these were far more valiant than the\n Persians.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. At Thermopylae, Xerxes wished to lead his army through a\n narrow passage between a mountain and the sea. Leonidas, king\n of Sparta, opposed him with six thousand men. Seventy thousand\n Persians were slain in the attempt to break through the pass.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. At last, Leonidas found that the Persians would not be kept\n back any longer. He therefore sent away all but three hundred men,\n and with these he remained at the pass of Therm opylse. The im-\n mense host of the Persians came onward like a flood ; and only one\n soldier of the three hundred escaped to Sparta to tell that the rest\n were slain.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. But Xerxes did not long continue to triumph in Greece. His\n</p>\n<p>\n fleet was defeated at Salamis, and his army at Platsea. In escaping,\n he was forced to cross the Hellespont in a little fishing-vessel ; for\n the sea, in spite of its being whipped, had again broken his bridge\n of boats. \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n 12.

Between one and two centuries after the death of Xerxes, that\n is, about 330 years before Christ, Persia was invaded by Alexander\n the G-reat, king of Macedon. Darius the Third was then king o t\n Persia. Being defeated by Alexander, two of his own subjects bound\n him with golden chains, and put him in a covered cart.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. They intended to murder Darius, and get possession of the king-\n dom. But Alexander came suddenly upon the conspirators, and\n forced them to take flight. As they rode away, they discharged\n their darts at Darius, and slew him.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. After this time, Persia became subject to the Parthians, whose\n country had formerly been a province of the Persian empire. It con-\n tinued under the government of the Parthian kings nearly five hun-\n dred years. About the year 230 after the Christian era, a Persian,\n named Artaxerxes, excited a rebellion and made himself king.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. His descendants occupied the throne for many generations.\n One of the most distinguished was Chosroes the Great, who lived\n about six hundred years after Christ. He made war against the Ro-\n mans, and ravaged their provinces in Asia.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. One of his successors was likewise named Chosroes. This\n hateful monster caused his own father to be beaten to death. But\n Heaven punished him by the wickedness of his eldest son, whose\n name was Siroes. He dethroned his father, and murdered all his\n brothers in his presence.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6.

In ancient times, the people worshipped the sun, and\n bowed down to idols. But, for more than a thousand years, they\n have been believers in a false prophet, called Mahomet.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. They have never become acquainted with the religion of Jesus\n Christ, which teaches us to be gentle and forgiving one to another\n and thus cruelty has ever been common among them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. The climate of Persia is mild, and the country abounds in beau-\n tiful and fragrant trees, shrubs, and flowers. The people are less\n warlike than in former times. The rich live in splendid palaces, and\n the poor in mud huts. The kingdom is small, compared with the\n vast empire of Xerxes. Persepolis, the ancient capital, is now a heap\n of ruins. Teheran and Ispahan, the two principal cities, are of com-\n paratively modern date.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. From what I have told you, you will not like the Persian char-\n acter; yet it is not altogether bad. The people are very fond of read-\n ing, and telling instructive stories; many of these were written ages\n since, and are exceedingly beautiful.

In this man-\n ner he did so much mischief, that his subjects resolved to destroy him.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. There was a large river, which the emperor was often in the\n habit of crossing.

Manners of the Chinese .\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. I must now give you a short account of the cities and people of\n China as they are at this day. Nankin was formerly the capital of\n China. Pekin, which contains two millions of inhabitants, is now\n the capital. The emperor\u2019s palace stands in a part of Pekin called\n the Tartar city.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2 . The walls of Pekin are built of brick, and aie nearly one hun-\n dred feet high, so that they hide the whole city. They are so thick\n that sentinels on horseback ride round the city on the top of the wall.\n There are nine gates, which have marble arches, and are prodigiously\n high.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The people of China have an olive complexion, with black hair,\n and small black eyes. The chief part of their dress is a long loose\n robe, which is fastened round the body with a silken girdle. In this\n girdle they carry a knife, and two sticks for eating instead of a knife\n and fork.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The Chinese are great fibbers, and are very much addicted to\n cheating. There are some horrible customs among them. For\n instance, if parents have a greater number of children than they can\n conveniently support, they are permitted to throw them into a river !\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The people are not nice about what they eat. Dead puppy-dogs\n are publicly sold in the streets for food. Rats and mice are frequently\n eaten. There is a sort of bird\u2019s nest which is made into a jelly, and\n is considered a great delicacy.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. The Chinese ladies are chiefly remarkable for their little feet.\n A grown woman in China is able to wear smaller shoes than a young\n child in America. But their feet are kept merely for show, and are\n almost good for nothing to walk with.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Religion among the Chinese is in a very sad condition. The\n people are given up to idolatry. Almost all religions are tolerated,\n although but little reverence is paid to any. There are more temples\n than can be easily numbered.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. When a Chinese wishes to be married, he buys a wife of her\n parents, but he is not permitted to see her till she is sent home. The\n young lady is brought to her husband\u2019s door in a palankeen. He puts\n aside the curtains of the palankeen, and peeps in at his new wife.\n If he does not like her looks, he sends her back again.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. In China there are some very singular punishments. Sometime*\n a wooden frame, weighing two hundred pounds, is put round a man\u2019s\n neck. He is compelled to carry it about with him wherever he\n</p>\n<p>\n Ch. XXXI. \u2014 1. What was formerly the capital of Ci. iia ? What is now ? How many\n Inhabitants does Pekin contain?

One of the most curious customs of China was that of excluding\n foreigners from the country. A few American and European\n merchants were permitted to reside at Canton, but they were obliged\n to leave their wives at Macao. No other strangers were permitted\n in the kingdom. The people think that their manners and customs\n are the best in the world, and they do not wish foreigners to come\n and introduce new notions. By the treaty of peace with Great\n Britain in 1842, five ports are now open to strangers.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11.

I*\n was foretold of him, that \u201c his hand should be against every man,\n and every man\u2019s hand against him.\u201d In all ages this prophecy has\n been fulfilled among his posterity ; for they appear to have been\n enemies to the rest of mankind, and mankind enemies to them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Arabia consists of several separate states or nations. The whole\n country is bounded on the north by Palestine, Mesopotamia, & c. ; on\n the east by the Persian Gulf and the Gulf of Ormuz, on the south by\n the Indian Ocean, and west by the Red Sea.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The Arabs have always been wandering tribes, and have dwelt\n in tents, amid the trackless deserts which cover a large portion of\n their country. Their early history is very imperfectly known. The\n first event that is worth recording, was the birth of Mahomet. This\n took place at Mecca, a city on the borders of the Red Sea, in the\n rear 570 of the Christian era.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4.

Finally, Ali was victorious, and confirmed his sway\n over all the disciples of Mahomet, and over the countries which they\n had won.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The Saracen empire was thus established. The kings were\n called Caliphs. They reigned at Bagdad for the space of six hundred\n and twenty years. One of the most distinguished of them was Mah-\n mud Gazui. He was a great conqueror, and added a part of India\n to his dominions.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. A poor man once complained to Mahmud Gazui that a soldier\n had turned him and his family out of doors, and had kept possession\n of his house all night. When the caliph, Mahmud Gazui, heard this,\n he suspected that the soldier was his own son. \u201c If he ill-treats you\n again, let me know,\u201d said he.\n</p>\n<p>\n (i. Accordingly, a few nights afterwards, the poor man told the ca-\n liph that the same soldier had turned him out of his house again.\n The caliph took his cimeter and went to the house; but before enter-\n ing, he caused all the lights to be extinguished, so that his heart\n might not be softened by the sight of the offender.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. When all was darkfiess, he entered the house, and struck the\n soldier dead with his cimeter. \u201c Now bring a light,\u201d cried the caliph.\n His attendants did so. Mahmud Gazui held a torch over the bloody\n corpse of the soldier, and found that his suspicions were correct. He\n had killed his own son !\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The last of the caliphs was named Mostasem. He was so proud\n and vainglorious that he considered his subjects unworthy to behold\n his face. He therefore never appeared in public without wearing a\n veil of golden tissue. Whenever he rode through the streets, thou-\n sands would flock to get a glimpse of his golden veil.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. But at length Hulaki, chief of the Tartars, took the city of Bag-\n dad. He stripped off the golden veil of the caliph Mostasem, and\n put him alive into a leathern bag. The bag, with the poor caliph in\n it, was dragged by horses through the same streets where he had for-\n merly ridden in triumph.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. Thus perished the caliph Mostasem, being bruised to death on\n the pavements. With him ended the empire of the Saracens, in the\n year 1258 of the Christian era.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11.

I must not forget to mention Phoenice, or Phoenicia, which lay\n along the border of the Mediterranean Sea; it contained the cities of\n Tyre, Sidon, Ptolemais, and other celebrated places.

In all parts of Asia, there are many people who are full of su-\n perstition, and there are very few who worship God in sincerity and\n truth. Jesus Christ is hardly known among the many millions of peo-\n ple in Asia ; and though some of the rich men, kings, and princes\n live in gorgeous palaces, and are decked with gold and jewels, yet the\n mass of the people live as they have done for ages, ignorant, poor,\n and degraded.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ch.

It is separated from Europe by the Mediterranean Sea, and from\n Asia by the Red Sea. It is, however, attached to Asia by a narrow\n neck of land, called the Isthmus of Suez.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Africa is less known than any other portion of the globe. Many\n parts of the interior have never been visited by Europeans. The\n greater part of the inhabitants are negroes, of which there are many\n tribes. Some of these are intelligent, and live tolerably well, but the\n greater part are either in a savage or a barbarous state.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The climate being warm, they need little shelter or clothing\n Their houses are therefore poor mud huts, or slight tenements, made\n of leaves or branches of trees. Their dress is often but a single piece\n of cloth tied around the waist. They are however a cheerful race,\n and spend much of their time in various amusements.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Beside the negroes, there are several other races of Africans.\n The inhabitants from Egypt to Abyssinia appear to consist of the\n original Egyptian people, mixed with Turks, Arabs, and others. The\n people of the Barbary States are tne descendants of the ancient Car-\n thaginians, mingled with the Saracens who conquered the country,\n together with Turks and Arabs.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. The immense desert of Sahara, with all the adjacent regions,\n appears to be occupied by wandering tribes of Arabs, who move from\n place to place with their horses and camels, like the people ol\n Arabia, for pasturage or plunder.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Africa may be considered as, on the whole, the least civilized\n</p>\n<p>\n { )ortion of the earth. The people are mostly Mahometans, and one\n lalf of them are nearly in a savage state. The rest are in a bar-\n barous condition.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The central parts of Africa abound in wild animals, such as\n lions, panthers, leopards, elephants, rhinoceroses, zebras, and quaggas.\n The woods are filled with chattering monkeys, the thickets are in-\n fested with monstrous serpents, ostriches roam over the deserts, va-\n rious kinds of antelopes and deer, in vast herds, graze upon the plains,\n hippopotami are seen in the lakes and rivers, and crocodiles abound\n in the stagnant waters.

He attempted to escape,\n but was drowned in the Nile. His wife, whose name was Cleopatra,\n then became sole ruler of Egypt.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. She was one of the most beautiful women that ever lived, and\n her talents and accomplishments were equal to her personal beauty.\n But she was very wicked. Among other horrid crimes, Cleopatra\n poisoned her brother, who was only eleven years old. Yet, though\n all the world knew what an abandoned wretch she was, the greatest\n heroes could not or would not resist the enticements of her beauty,\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. When Mark Antony, a Roman general, had defeated Brutus and\n Cassius, at Philippi, in Greece, he summoned Cleopatra to come to\n Cilicia, on the northeastern coast of the Mediterranean. He intended\n to punish her for having assisted Brutus.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. As soon as Cleopatra received the summons, she hastened to\n obey. She went on board a splendid vessel, which was richly adorned\n with gold. The sails were made of the costliest silk. Instead of\n rough, sunburnt sailors, the crew consisted of lovely girls, who rowed\n with silver oars ; and their strokes kept time to melodious music.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. Queen Cleopatra reclined on the deck, beneath a silken awn-\n ing. In this manner she went sailing along the river Cydnus. Her\n vessel was so magnificent, and she herself so lovely, that the whole\n spectacle appeared like a yision.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. Mark Antony was first warned of her approach by the smell\n of delicious perfumes, which the wind wafted from the silken sails\n of the vessel. He next heard the distant strains of music, and saw\n the gleaming of the silver oars.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. But when he beheld the beauty of the Egyptian queen, he\n thought of nothing else. Till Mark Antony met Cleopatra, he had\n been an ambitious man and a valiant warrior. But from that day\n forward, he was nothing but her slave.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. Owing to Cleopatra\u2019s misconduct and his own, Antony was\n defeated by Octavius, another Roman general, at Actium, in Greece.\n He then killed himself, by falling on his sword. Cleopatra knew\n that if Octavius took her alive, he would carry her to Rome, and\n expose her to the derision of the populace.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. She resolved not to endure this ignominy. Now in Egypt there\n is a venomous reptile, called an asp, the bite of which is mortal, but\n not painful. Cleopatra applied one of these reptiles to her bosom.\n In a little while her body grew benumbed, and her heart ceased to\n beat ; and thus died the beautiful and wicked queen of Egypt. This\n event occurred thirty years before Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15. The story of queen Cleopatra is very instructive. It shows\n that a person on whom Heaven has bestowed the richest gifts may\n use them to cause mischief and misery to all around, and to bring\n ruin on himself.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. What of Cleopatra ?

After the death of Cleopatra, Egypt became a province of the\n Roman empire ; and it continued to belong to that, and the portion ol\n t called the Eastern empire, till the year 640 after the Christian era.\n t was then conquered by the Saracens. It remained under theii\n overnment upwards of six centuries.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The Saracen sovereigns were dethroned by the Mamelukes\n whom they had trained up to be their guards. The Mamelukes ruled\n Egypt till the year 1517, when they were conquered by the Turks.\n They kept possession of Egypt till the year 1798. It was then invaded\n by Napoleon Bonaparte, with an army of forty thousand Frenchmen.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The Turks, ever since their conquest of Egypt had kept a body\n of Mamelukes in their service ; these made a desperate resistance.\n A battle was fought near the pyramids, in which many of them were\n slain, and others were drowned in the Nile. Not long after this vic-\n tory, Bonaparte went back to France, and left general Kleber in com-\n mand of the French army.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. General Kleber was a brave man, but a severe one, and his se-\n verity cost him his life. He had ordered an old Mussulman, named\n the Sheik Sada, to be bastinadoed on the soles of his feet. Shortly\n afterwards, when the general was in a mosque, a fierce Arab rushed\n upon him, and killed him with a dagger.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. In 1801, the English sent Sir Ralph Abercrombie with an army\n to drive the French out of Egypt. General Menou was then the\n French commander. Sir Ralph Abercrombie beat him at the battle\n of Aboukir, but was himself mortally wounded.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. In the course of the same year the French army sailed from\n Egypt back to France. The inhabitants lamented their departure\n for the French generals had ruled them with more justice and mod\n eration than their old masters, the Turks. Egypt is now governed by\n a Chief named Mehemet Ali, who bears the title of pacha, but the\n country is no longer a part of the Turkish empire.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The present capital of Egypt is Grand Cairo. It is much infe-\n rior to what it was in former times, but still contains about three\n hundred thousand inhabitants. Alexandria, built by Alexander the\n Great, as I have before said, is now much reduced, but the ruins\n around it show that it was once a splendid city. There is no part of the\n world that seems more gloomy to a traveller than Egypt.

All the interior parts of Africa were anciently called ^Ethiopia.,\n But, properly speaking, ^Ethiopia comprised only the countries now\n cailcd Nubia and Abyssinia. This region lies south of Egypt, and\n extends along the shore of the Red Sea. The first inhabitants oi\n ./Ethiopia are supposed to have emigrated from Arabia the Happy, a\n part of Arabia. Their early history is almost unknown.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. ^Ethiopia, or at least a portion of it, was formerly called Sheba,\n and from thence it is supposed that the queen of Sheba went to visit\n Solomon. About thirty years ago, it is said that one of her descend-\n ants was king of Abyssinia.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. It used to be the custom to confine the ^Ethiopian princes on a\n high mountain, which was named Geshen. It was very high and\n steep, and looked like an enormous castle of stone. No person could\n ascend this mountain, or come down from it, unless he were raised or\n lowered by means of ropes.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The princes lived on the summit of the mountain, in miserable\n huts. The greater part of them never came down till their dying\n day. But whenever the king died, one of the princes was summoned\n to the throne. Perhaps, however, he found himself no happier in the\n royal palace, than in his hut on the summit of Mount Geshen.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The ^Ethiopians were believers in the Jewish religion till the\n midd]^ of the fourth century after the Christian era. Candace, the\n queen of the country, was then converted to Christianity, and her sub-\n jects followed her example.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. The inhabitants of ^Ethiopia, or Abyssinia, are still called Chris-\n tians, but their mode of worship is mixed up with many Jewish prac-\n tices. They also worship the Virgin Mary and the saints, like the\n Roman Catholics.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The people of this part of Africa are not generally negroes.\n They are of an olive complexion, and have long hair and agreeable\n features. But in the northeastern part of Abyssinia, there is a race\n of negroes called Shangallas.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. These negroes have been described as having faces resembling\n apes, and as being little more intelligent than the monkey tribe.\n They have no houses, but sleep under the trees, and sometimes bur-\n row in caves. The Abyssinians hunt them as they would wild\n beasts.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ch. XLIII. \u2014 1. What was anciently called Ethiopia ? In which direction is it from\n Egypt?

The Barbary states are Morocco, Algiers, Tunis, and Tripoli.\n They are bounded north by the Mediterranean Sea, east and south by\n the desert, and west by the Atlantic Ocean. These countries were\n inhabited in the time of the Romans. Morocco was called Maurita-\n nia ; and Algiers Numidia. These regions were first settled by colo-\n nies from Phoenicia, Greece, and other countries.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. In this region stood the celebrated city of Carthage in ancient\n times. Its site was about ten miles northeast of the city of Tunis.\n It was founded by some Phoenicians, eight hundred and sixty-nine\n years before the Christian era. The Phoenicians, as I have told you,\n were the first people who engaged in commerce, and founded colo-\n nies for the purpose of carrying on trade.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. In the history of Rome I shall tell you how Carthage was de-\n stroyed. The Romans erected a new city where it had formerly\n stood. This was conquered and destroyed by the Saracens, who\n then built the city of Tunis. In the year 1574, Tunis was seized by\n the Turks.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The city of Algiers was built by the Saracens, in the year 944-\n</p>\n<p>\n The government, called the regency of Algiers, was founded in 1518^\n by two Turks, named Horuc and Hagradin. They were brothers,\n and both bore the name of Barbarossa, or Red-Beard. #\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The country now called Morocco was conquered by the Sara-\n cens about the same time with the other Barbary states. So also\n was Tripoli. All these states, except Morocco, afterwards fell into\n the hands of the Turks.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. During a long period, the Barbary states were in the habit of\n fitting out vessels to cruise against the ships of every nation. Their\n prisoners were sold as slaves, and never returned to their own coun-\n try, unless a high ransom were paid for them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The Americans were the first who made any considerable resis-\n tance to these outrages. In the; year 1803, commodore Preble sailed\n to the Mediterranean Sea with a small American fleet. He intended\n to attack Tripoli ; but one of his frigates, the Philadelphia, got aground\n in the harbor.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The Turks took possession of the Philadelphia.

Most of the other regions of Africa can hardly be said to have\n any history. The inhabitants possess no written records, and cannot\n tell what events have happened to their forefathers.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The ancients had very curious notions about Africa ; for they\n had visited only the northern parts, and contented themselves with\n telling incredible stories about the remainder. They supposed that\n towards the eastern shore of the continent, there were people without\n noses, and others who had three or four eyes apiece.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. In other parts of Africa there were said to be men without\n heads, but who had eyes in their breasts. Old writers speak also of\n a nation whose king had a head like a dog.

They have\n now acquired considerable knowledge respecting it ; but the subject\n belongs rather to geography than history. Nearly the whole of the\n central part of Africa, through which the river Niger flows, is called\n Nigritia, or Negro-land. It is inhabited by several different nations.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. The principal city of Nigritia is called Timbuctoo. No white\n people have ever visited it, except one American, one Englishman,\n and one Frenchman. The name of the latter was M. Caillie. He\n was there in 1827, and describes the city as built in the shape of a\n triangle, and situated eight miles from the Niger.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. The houses are only one story high, and are built of round\n bricks baked in the sun. The poor people and slaves dwell in huts\n of straw, shaped something like bee-hives. All around the city, there\n is an immense plain of yellowish white sand.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. There are English and French settlements on the western coast\n of Africa. There was formerly a Dutch settlement at the southern\n extremity of the continent, but the English have had possession of it\n since the year 1 806.

From the earliest ages, when human soci-\n ety was yet in a rude state, it was the custom to make slaves of those\n who were taken in war. This practice was continued in after times,\n and thus, for thousands of years, slavery was established in nearly all\n the nations of the earth.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2.

For at least two hundred years, this traffic was carried on to a\n great extent. The custom was for vessels to go to the western coast\n of Africa, and purchase of the African princes such prisoners as they\n had for sale. Sometimes, however, the captains of the vessels would\n rob the people of their children, or they would go on shore with a\n body of armed men, and carry away the inhabitants of a whole\n village.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The poor negroes thus taken from their homes, and separated\n forever from all they held dear, were crowded into the vessels, where\n they were often half-starved, and where they sometimes suffered from\n disease, or unkind treatment. Such was frequently their distress,\n that they would jump into the sea, or beat out their own brains in\n despair.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Millions of these poor negroes have been taken from their homes\n and probably more than half of those who entered the ships, from the\n beginning of the trade to this day, have perished before they reached\n the countries to which they were bound.

At the straits of Gibraltar, the distance\n from Europe to Africa is but twenty-one miles.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2.

In all parts of Europe except Turkey, the religion of Jesus\n Christ prevails. If you were to travel in Asia or Africa, you would\n meet with no churches, or only now and then one, where the true\n God is worshipped. But you would see a great many mosques dedi-\n cated to the false religion of Mahomet, and a great many temples\n where the people bow down to idols of wood, stone, or metal.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. But in Europe, the traveller everywhere meets with churches\n and these show that the people are Christians. In Europe, also,\n there are many colleges, academies, and schools, which prove that\n the people set a high value upon education. It is a fact which I\n wish you to remember, that in all parts of the world where you find\n churches, you find that the people are more or less advanced in civi-\n lization and the arts which render mankind happy.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. This may show to us that the Christian religion tends to make\n people wiser and happier ; and this is rendered still more clear by\n the fact that in all those countries where the Christian religion is un-\n known, the greater part of the people are ignorant, degraded, and\n miserable. All false religions tend to injure mankind ; the true reli-\n gion tends to the improvement of mankind. How important is it,\n then, that every individual should be a real Christian.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. As Europe is the smallest of the four quarters of the earth, so\n it was behind Asia and Africa in being settled and civilized. Long\n after the Assyrian empire had risen to great power and splendor, long\n after Babylon and Nineveh had flourished on the banks of the Eu-\n phrates, long after Egypt had become a mighty kingdom, long after\n Thebes, Memphis, and other magnificent cities had risen upon the\n borders of the Nile, Europe continued to be inhabited only by wan-\n dering tribes of savages.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Greece was the first portion of Europe that was settled. About\n the time that Moses led the Israelites out of Egypt, the Greeks began\n to build houses, found cities, and emerge from the savage into a more\n civilized state. By degrees they advanced in knowledge and refine-\n ment, and at length became the most polished people in the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. Afterwards Rome, situated in Italy, became a mighty city, and\n the Roman people extended their empire over the greater part of\n Europe, and the most civilized portions of Asia and Africa. Carthage,\n Egypt, Greece, Asia Minor, Palestine, Syria, and other Asiatic coun-\n tries, bowed to the Roman yoke.\n</p>\n<p>\n How large is Euro pe compared with Asia ? Africa ? The United States ?

Rome was the most splendid empire that the world has ever\n seen. But as it crushed other kingdoms beneath its foot, so, in turn,\n imperial Rome was itself trampled down by the northern nations ol\n Europe. Great ignorance followed this event, and the different\n nations and tribes of Europe seemed like broken and crushed limbs\n and members of the great empire, almost without life.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. But these separate fragments of the human family grew up in\n due time to be separate nations, and these advanced in knowledge\n .rntil they reached the condition in which we now find them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. Europe may be divided into two parts, the northern and south-\n ern. In the former, the climate is about as cold as it is in our\n middle and eastern States, in the latter, it is about as warm as in\n the southern States. The principal kingdoms in the northern sec-\n tion of Europe are Russia, Norway, Sweden, Prussia, several German\n states, Denmark, Holland, Belgium, Switzerland, France, and Great\n Britain.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. Among the southern kingdoms of Europe are Portugal, Spain,\n Italy, Greece, and Turkey. In these latter countries the soil is gene-\n rally fertile, and here grapes, olives, oranges, lemons, melons, and\n other delicious fruits, are abundant.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. Here, too, all the wants of man for food are easily supplied,\n and so warm and gentle is the climate, that the people do not find it\n necessary to build tight houses, and put on thick clothing, and pro-\n vide stores against the winter ; yet it is remarkable, that where nature\n has done so much, the people think it hardly necessary to do anything,\n and consequently they are less industrious, less comfortable, and less\n happy, than in more cold and severe climates.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. In the northern parts of Europe, the people find it necessary to\n cultivate the soil with care, and lay up in summer a store of provi-\n sions against the long, cold winter. They build themselves good\n houses, they furnish them with many convenient articles, and thus, by\n their industry and care, they live more happily than those who inha-\n bit the gentler climes of the south.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15. The wild animals of Europe resemble those of this country,\n though they are in some respects different. The trees, plants, shrubs,\n and flowers, are similar to those we find here, though not exactly the\n same.\n</p>\n<p>\n 16. If you were to go to Europe, you would everywhere feel that\n you were in a strange land, but still many things would remind you\n of your own dear home in America. But if you were to go to Asia\n or Africa, the houses, the fields, the dress of the people, and all their\n manners and customs, would impress you with the idea that you\n were in a strange land, far, very far, from your native country.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9.

Greece is a small strip of land extending into the Mediterra-\n nean Sea. It lies almost exactly east of New York, at the distance\n of about five thousand miles. It is nearly at an equal distance from\n Asia Minor on the east, and Italy on the west.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Greece is bounded on the north by Macedonia, which is now a\n part of Turkey ; on every other side it is bounded by the sea. To\n the south and east of it are a great number of islands, some of which\n are extremely beautiful.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Several of them have towns and cities upon them, and one,\n called Antiparos, is remarkable for a grotto beneath the earth, which\n appears like a beautiful palace. When lighted up with lamps, it\n seems a vast hall, with a thousand pillars and ornaments of silver.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Some of the islands of Greece have been thrown up from the\n sea, and others which formerly existed have disappeared. These\n strange things have been caused by volcanic fires under the sea.\n Nothing can be more wonderful than the scenes which have some-\n times been exhibited by these convulsions of nature. _\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. In the southern part of Greece, and among the islands, the cli-\n mate is as mild as in Virginia, and here the country abounds in all\n sorts of delicious fruits. In the northern part, the climate is some-\n what colder.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. If you were to travel through Greece, you would discover that it\n is naturally very beautiful. Along the shores, you would meet with\n many little bays and harbors, and you would easily believe that the\n people living there would be tempted by the placid water to become\n seamen. You would accordingly find a large portion of the inhabit-\n ants to be seafaring people.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. In the interior of the country you would meet with lofty moun-\n tains. whose tops in winter are covered with snow. You would meet\n with smiling valleys, bright, rapid streams, and steep hill-sides cov-\n ered with olive-groves, vineyards, and fig-trees.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. You would discover that the people of the present day live in\n miserable villages or towns, all wearing an aspect of poverty and\n decay. But you would often meet with the ruins of temples and other\n edifices, built by the ancient Greeks two or three thousand years ago.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. These would show you, that, though the modern Greeks appear\n to be a degraded people, yet the former inhabitants of this country\n were among the most remarkable people that ever lived.

First Settlement of the Country .\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. Though Greece is one of the most famous countries on the face\n of the globe, it is not very extensive; its boundaries varied at differ-\n ent times, but it never exceeded four hundred miles in length, and\n about one hundred and fifty in width. That portion to which the\n name of Greece is properly applied, was not much larger than the\n State of New York.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. I must now carry you back to the first settlement of this coun-\n try, which took place more than four thousand years ago. When\n the human race was scattered from the tower of Babel, it is supposed\n that the family of Japheth, Noah\u2019s youngest son, travelled from Asia\n into Europe. As Greece lay nearer to the land of Shinar than the\n other parts of Europe, it was probably settled first.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The Greeks themselves believed that their ancestors had sprung\n up out of the earth. The first inhabitants were mere savages. They\n dwelt in wretched huts, and fed on acorns. Their garments were the\n skins of wild beasts.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. There are so many fables about the early history of Greece, that\n I shall pass very briefly over the first three or four centuries. Ce-\n crops, an Egyptian, seems to have been the first who introduced\n civilization among the Greeks. He came with a number of his coun-\n trymen, and founded the city of Athens. This event took place about\n fifteen hundred and fifty-six years before the Christian era.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Thirty or forty years afterwards, Cadmus came from Phoenicia\n and built the city of Thebes. He was one of the greatest benefac-\n tors of the Greeks, for he taught them the cultivation of the vine, the\n manufacture of metals, and the use of the alphabet.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Other parts of Greece were also settled by colonies from foreign\n nations. The country then consisted of a number of small kingdoms,\n which had little or no connection with one anothor. These were fre-\n quently at war among themselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Twelve of these little kingdoms, or states, soon united them-\n selves into a confederacy. Their deputies held a meeting twice a\n year, in order to consult respecting the welfare of the country. They\n were called the council of the Amphyctions. By means of this coun-\n cil, the different states were kept at peace with each other, and were\n united against foreign enemies.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ch. L. \u2014 1. What of the extent of Greece?

One of the famous events of Grecian history was the Argonautic\n expedition. It is said that a prince named Jason, with a company of\n his friends, sailed to Colchis, which lay eastward of the Black Sea.\n Their object was to find a wonderful ram with a fleece of gold; but\n the Avhole story is supposed by some to be a fable.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. The Trojan war was still more famous than the expedition in\n search of the golden fleece. Troy was a large city on the Asiatic\n side of the Hellespont, which is now called the Dardanelles. Paris,\n the son of the Trojan king, had stolen away the wife of Menelaus, a\n Greek prince.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. All the Grecian kings combined together to punish this offence.\n They sailed to Troy in twelve hundred vessels, and took the city after\n a seige of ten years. This event is supposed to have occurred eleven\n hundred and ninety-three years before the Christian era.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. But most historians are of opinion that the Trojan war was a\n much less important affair than Homer has represented it to be.\n Poets do not always tell the truth ; and Homer was the father and\n chief of poets. He was a blind old man and used to wander about\n the country, reciting his verses.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER LI. \u2014 EUROPE CONTINUED.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Grecian Lawgivers.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. One of the principal states of Greece was called Sparta or Lace-\n daemon. It was founded by Lelex, 1516, B. C. It received a code of\n laws from Lycurgus, who lived nearly nine centuries before Christ.\n He was strict and severe, but wise and upright.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Lycurgus ordered that all the Spartans should eat together at\n public tables. The reason of this law was, that the rich citizens\n might not feast luxuriously at home, but that rich and poor should\n fare alike. As for the children, they were not allowed any thing to\n eat, unless they could steal it. This wicked custom was adopted\n with the idea that it would train up the young Spartans to be cun-\n ning in war.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. In order that the people might not be avaricious, Lycurgus for-\n bade any gold or silver to be coined into money. All the money was\n made of iron. It could not very easily be carried in the pocket, for a\n Spartan dollar weighed as much as fifty pounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The children were all brought up at the public expense. They\n Were allowed to stand near the dinner-tables and listen to the wise\n conversation of their parents. The Spartans were very anxious that\n their children should abhor drunkenness.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. What of the Argonautic expedition? 9. What of the Trojan war ? 11. What of Ho-\n</p>\n<p>\n mer? Ch.

Three years before the death of Pericles, a war had commenced\n between Athens and Sparta.

In the course of this war, Alcibiades made a conspicuous figure\n among the Athenians. He was the handsomest and most agreeable\n man in Athens.

He was the cause of much trouble, not only in his native city,\n but all over Greece. At last, when he had lost the good-will of\n every-body, he retired to a small village in Phrygia, in Asia Minor,\n and dwelt there with a woman named Timandra.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. His enemies sent a party of assassins to murder him. These set\n fire to the house in which he lived. Alcibiades was a brave man,\n and he rushed out, sword in hand, to fight the assassins.

Nevertheless, in order to disgrace him as much as possible, hf\n was appointed to clean the streets of Thebes. Epaminondas was\n not mortified; for he knew that the Thebans might disgrace them\n selves by such ingratitude, but could not disgrace him.

One night, while this great philosopher was taking a walk, he\n looked upward to contemplate the stars. Being much interested in\n this occupation, he strayed out of his path, and tumbled into a ditch.\n An old woman who lived in his family ran and helped him out, all\n covered with mudi \u201c For the future, Thales,\u201d said she, \u201cI advise\n you not to have your head among the stars, while your feet are on\n the earth !\u201d Some people think that the old woman was the wiser\n philosopher of the two.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Another philosopher was named Pittacus. He was the first\n temperance man on record ; for, though there were many sorts of de-\n licious wines in his country, he never drank any thing but water.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The philosopher Bias lived in the year 517 B. C. Some fisher-\n men once found a golden vase in the belly of a large fish. On the\n vase were engraved these words, \u2014 \u201cTo the wisest.\u201d It was there-\n fore sent to Bias, who was thought to be at least as wise as anybody.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. But Bias did not care for gold or riches. When his native city\n was taken by the enemy, all the other inhabitants endeavored to hide\n their most valuable property. Bias alone gave himself no trouble.\n \u201cRiches are but playthings,\u201d said he. \u201cMy only real treasures are\n my own thoughts.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Epimenides was a very wonderful philosopher. My readers\n must not put too much faith in the story which I am going to tell\n them. It is as follows : \u2014 One day, when Epimenides was young, his\n father sent him in search of a sheep that was lost. After finding the\n sheep, Epimenides entered a cave by the wayside, and sat down, for\n he was tired, and the sun was very hot. In this cave he fell asleep,\n and slept a good deal longer than he intended.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. It was no less than fifty-seven years before he awoke.

Democritus, who lived not long after Hereclitus, was quite a\n different sort of philosopher. Instead of shedding tears, he laughed\n so continually that his townsmen thought him mad. And, to say the\n truth, I think so too.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The philosopher Anaxagoras believed that the sky was made of\n stones, and that the sun was a great mass of red-hot iron. This may\n seem very strange ; but in these ancient times the people did not\n know the shape of the earth.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. The philosopher Empedocles went and lived near Mount iEtna,\n in Sicily. He was a man of very grave and majestic appearance, and\n everybody knew him, because he used to wear a crown of laurel on\n his head. People generally acknowledged him to be a very wise\n man ; but, not content with this, he wanted to be thought a god.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. One day, after he had prepared a great festival, Empedocles dis-\n appeared, and was never seen again. The people took it for granted\n that he had ascended to heaven. But shortly afterwards, there was\n an eruption of Mount iEtna, and an old shoe was thrown out of the\n crater. On examination, it was found out that this shoe had belong-\n ed to Empedocles. It was now easy to guess at the fate of the foolish\n old man. He had thrown himself into the crater of the blazing vol-\n</p>\n<p>\n /cano, in order that people might think him a god and that ne had\n gone to heaven.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. Socrates was one of the wisest and best philosophers of Greece.\n Indeed he was so wise and good, that the profligate Athenians could\n not suffer him to live.

The entertainment being ended, a hymn was sung to the gods.\n After this, the company was amused with music, dancing, and mim-\n icry, or whatever could tend to excite mirth or cheerfulness.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. The houses of the rich were built of stone, and many of them\n were highly ornamented. A large part of the people, however lived\n in huts made of rough stone laid in clay.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. In war, the Greeks fought with various weapons. Some of\n the soldiers had bows and arrows; some had javelins or spears,\n which they hurled with great force and precision of aim, and some\n had slings, with which they threw stones. They usually carried\n shields for warding off the weapons of their enemies.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. You must recollect that in these ancient times, gun-powder\n was not known, and muskets and cannon were therefore not in use.\n In battle, the warriors often engaged in close conflict, foot to foot, and\n breast to breast. The strife was therefore very exciting, and the men\n usually fought with furious courage.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. As mankind were very much given to making war upon one\n another, it was the custom in all countries to surround the cities with\n high walls for defence. This practice, indeed, continued for many\n ages, and if you ever go to Europe, you will see that the principal\n cities of France, Germany, and many other countries, are still secured\n in this way.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. In modern times, when an army attacks a city it batters down\n the walls with cannon shot, or by undermining them, placing gun-\n powder beneath, and then setting it on fire.

But the Athenians were beaten at Cheronea, in the year 338\n before the Christian era. Thenceforward, Philip controlled the af-\n fairs of Greece, till his death. Pe r haps, after all, he was a better\n ruler than the Greeks could have found among themselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. But he had many vices, and among the rest, that of drinking to\n excess. One day, just after he had risen from a banquet, he decided\n a certain law-case unjustly. The losing person cried out, \u201c I appeal\n from Philip drunk, to Philip sober !\u201d And, sure enough, when Philip\n got sober, he decided the other way.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. A poor woman, who had some business with Philip, tried in\n vain to obtain an audience. He put her off from one day to another,\n saying that he had no leisure to attend to her. \u201c If you have no leisure\n to do justice, you have no right to be king !\u201d said the woman. Philip\n was struck with the truth of what the woman said, and he became\n more attentive to the duties of a king.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. He lived only about two years after he had conquered the\n Greeks.

Alexander\n defeated him, and killed a hundred and ten thousand of his soldiers.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Darius soon assembled a mightier army than before. He had\n now half a million of men. He advanced to battle in the midst of his\n troops, seated on a lofty chariot, which resembled a moving throne.\n Around him were his life-guards, all in splendid armor.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. But when the Persians saw how boldly the Macedonian horse-\n men advanced, they took to flight. Poor king Darius was left almost\n alone on his lofty chariot.

In the early part of his career, Alexander had shown many ex-\n cellent and noble traits of character. But he met with such great\n and continual success in all his undertakings, that his disposition was\n ruined by it. He began to consider himself the equal of the gods.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Yet so far was Alexander from being a god, that some of his\n actions were unworthy of a man. One of his worst deeds was the\n murder of Clitus, an old officer who had fought under king Philip.\n He had once saved Alexander\u2019s life in battle ; and on this account he\n was allowed to speak very freely to him.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. One night, after drinking too much wine, Alexander began to\n speak of his own exploits ; and he spoke more highly of them than\n old Clitus thought they deserved. Accordingly, he told Alexander\n that his father Philip had done much greater things than ever he had\n done.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The monarch was so enraged, that he snatched a spear from one\n of his attendants, and gave Clitus a mortal wound. But when he\n saw the old man\u2019s bloody corpse extended on the floor, he was seized\n with horror. He had murdered the preserver of his own life !\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Alexander\u2019s remorse, however, did not last long. He still in-\n sisted on being a god, the son of Jupiter Ammon ; and he was mor-\n tally offended with a philosopher named Callisthenes, because he re-\n fused to worship him. For no other crime, Callisthenes was put into\n an iron cage, and tormented, till he killed himself in despair.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6 After Alexander\u2019s return from India to Persia, he met with a\n great misfortune. It was the loss of his dearest friend, Hephestion,\n who died of a disease which he had contracted by excessive drink-\n ing. For three days afterwards, Alexander lay prostrate on the\n ground, and would take no food.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. He erected a funeral pile of spices and other precious materials,\n so that it was as costly as a palace would have been. The lifeless\n body of Hephestion was placed on the summit. Alexander then set\n fire to the pile, and stood mournfully looking on while the corpse of\n his friend was consumed to ashes.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. It would have been well if he had taken warning by the fate of\n Hephestion. But Alexander the Great was destined to owe his de-\n struction to the wine-cup. While drinking at a banquet in Babylon,\n he was suddenly taken sick; and death soon conquered the con-\n queror.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9.

But the most powerful of these officers were determined to have\n more than their share ; and in the year 312, before Christ, four of\n them had got possession of the whole.

Such is the story which the old historians tell about this bat-\n tle ; it is doubtless much exaggerated, for some of the particulars ap-\n pear hardly credible. But, at any rate, this was the last great victory\n that the ancient Greeks ever achieved over their enemies.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER LXV.\u2014 EUROPE CONTINUED.\n</p>\n<p>\n End of Grecian Independence.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. The Greeks had now almost entirely lost their love of liberty,\n as well as the other virtues which had formerly distinguished them.\n In proof of this, I will relate the story of Agis, the young king of\n Sparta.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. King Agis was anxious for the welfare of Sparta, and he greatly\n desired to restore the ancient laws which Lycurgus had enacted. But\n the Spartans were now vicious and cowardly. They hated the very\n name of Lycurgus, and resolved not to be governed by his severe\n laws.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. They therefore seized the virtuous young king, and dragged him\n to prison. He was condemned to death. The executioner shed tears\n at the moment when he was going to kill him. \u201c Do not weep for\n me,\u201d said Agis; \u201c I am happier than my murderers.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. A little while after Agis was killed, his mother and grandmother\n came to the prison to see him, for they had not heard of his death.\n They were led into his dungeon ; and the murderers of Agis immedi-\n ately strangled them both, and threw their dead bodies upon his.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.

Some time after this horrible event, the Spartans had a king\n called Nabis. He was such a cruel monster, that Heaven seemed to\n have made him a king only for the punishment ol the people\u2019s wick-\n edness. Nabis had an image in his palace. It resembled his own\n wife, and was very beautiful; it was likewise clothed with magnifi-\n cent garments, such as were proper for the queen to wear. But the\n breast and arms of the image were stuck full of sharp iron spikes.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. These, however, were hidden by the rich clothes. When king\n Nabis wished to extort money from any person, he invited him to his\n palace, and led him up to the image. No sooner was the stranger\n within reach, than the image put out its arms and squeezed him\n close to its breast.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. This was done by means of machinery. The poor man might\n struggle as hard as he pleased ; but he could not possibly get away\n from the cruel embrace of the statue. There he remained, with the\n iron spikes sticking into his flesh, until his agony compelled him to\n give Nabis as much money as he asked for.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8.

But, in course of time, the genius of the Greeks seemed to have\n deserted them, as well as their ancient valor. They were then\n wholly despised.

Above a thousand years elapsed, and nothing happened of such\n importance that it need be told in this brief history. But, about the\n year 1450, the Turks invaded the Eastern empire of the Romans.\n Greece then fell beneath their power. During almost four centuries,\n the Greeks were treated by the Turks like slaves.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. At last, in the year 1821, thev rebelled against the tyranny of\n the Turks. A war immediately broke out. It continued a long time,\n and was carried on with the most shocking cruelty on both sides.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Many people from other countries went to assist the Greeks.\n The ancient renown of Greece made friends of all who were ac-\n quainted with her history. Lord Byron, the illustrious English poet,\n lost his life in Greece, for the sake of this famous land.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The Turks are a fierce people, and they resolved not to give up\n the country. The Greeks, on the other hand, determined either to\n drive away their oppressors, or to die. But they would not have suc-\n ceeded, if England, France, and Russia had not taken their part.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The fleets of these three nations formed a junction off the coast\n of Greece. They were all under the command of the English admi-\n ral Sir Edward Codrington. In October, 1827, they attacked a Tur-\n kish fleet of more than two hundred vessels, in the bay of Navarino.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. The Turks were entirely beaten, and their vessels were sunk or\n burned. In consequence of their losses in this battle, they were una-\n ble to continue the war. Greece was therefore evacuated by the\n Turks.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. But as the Greeks were not considered entirely fit to govern\n themselves, a king was selected for them, by England, France, and\n Russia. The new king was a young man of eighteen, named Otho.\n He was placed on the throne in the year 1829.

The famous city of Rome stands on the river Tiber, in Italy.\n Its distance from the sea is about sixteen miles. It is supposed to\n have been founded by Romulus, in the year 752 B. C. Romulus was\n the captain of about three thousand banditti, of outlaws. These men\n built some huts on a hill called the Palatine, and enclosed them with\n a wall. This was the origin of the most famous city the world ever\n saw.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. It is said that this wall was so low, that Remus, the brother of\n Romulus, leaped over it. \u201c Do you call this the wall of a city ?\u2019\u2019\n cried he, contemptuously. Romulus was so enraged, that he struck\n his brother dead; and this was the first blood that bedewed the walls\n of Rome.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. When Romulus and his fellow robbers were comfortably settled\n in their new houses, they found themselves in want of wives. At\n this time, Italy was inhabited by many rude tribes. Among these\n were the Sabines, who lived in the neighborhood of Rome. These\n would not allow their young women to marry the Romans ; but Ro-\n mulus contrived a scheme to get wives by force.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. He invited the whole Sabine people to witness some games and\n sports. Accordingly, the Sabines came; and, as they suspected no\n mischief, they brought almost all the marriageable young women\n in the country.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. At first, the Sabines were highly delighted with the feats of\n strength and agility, which were performed by the Romans to enter-\n tain them. But, in a little while, Romulus gave a signal* and all\n his men drew their swords, and rushed among the j eaceable\n spectators.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The Sabines were of course taken by surprise, and could make\n no resistance. Each of the Romans caught up the prettiest young\n woman he could find, and carried her away. There was no longer\n any scarcity of wives in Rome.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. This outrageous act of violence caused a war between the Ro-\n mans and Sabines. The latter mustered a large army, and would\n probably have exterminated Romulus and his banditti. But when\n they were about to engage in battle, the yoUng wives of the Romans\n rushed into the field.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. They besought the two hostile parties to make peace. They\n said that Avhichever side might gain the victory, it would bring\n nothing but sorrow to them ; for, if the Sabines should conquer, their\n husbands must lose their lives ; or if the Romans should win the day,\n their kindred would perish.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. Both parties were much moved by these entreaties. The Sa-\n bines saw that the young women had become attached to their hus-\n bands ; and therefore it would be a pity to separate them, even if it\n could be done without bloodshed. In short, the matter ended peace-\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. On what rivet- is Rome ? How far is it from the sea ? When and by whom was it\n found*- ' vV ho was Romulus? What did the outlaws do ?

The coachman did so; and as the street was too narrow to per\n mit him to turn out, the chariot passed directly over the murdered\n king. But Tullia rode on without remorse, although the wheels\n were stained with her father\u2019s blood.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Her husband now ascended the throne, and was called Tarquin\n the Proud. The Romans abhorred him, for he was a hateful tyrant.\n Several almost incredible stories are told respecting his reign.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. One day, it is said, that a woman of singular aspect entered the\n king\u2019s presence, bringingnine large books in her arms. No one kaew\n whence she came, nor what was contained in her books. She re-\n quested the king to buy them. But the price was so high, that Tar-\n quin refused ; especially as he did not know what the books were\n about.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. The unknown woman went away and burnt three of her books.\n She then came back, and again offered the remaining ones to Tar-\n quin. But, she demanded as much money for the six as she had be-\n fore asked for the whole nine ; and Tarquin of course refused to buy\n them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The woman went away a second time. But shortly afterwards\n she was again seen entering the palace. She had now only three\n volumes left; and these she offered to the king at the same price\n which she had before asked for the whole nine.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. There was something so strange and mysterious in all this, that\n Tarquin concluded to give the woman her price. She put the three\n volumes into his hands, and immediately disappeared.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. The books were found to be the oracles of a sibyl, or prophetess.\n They were therefore looked upon with superstitious reverence, and\n were preserved in Rome during many ages ; and in all difficult and\n perplexing cases, the rulers looked into these old volumes, and read,\n as they supposed, the secrets of their country\u2019s fate.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. The above story is probably a fable. So also is that of the dis-\n covery of a man\u2019s head, while the workmen were digging the foun-\n dation of the temple of Jupiter. Yet the Romans firmly believed\n that a human head was found there under the earth, and that it\n looked as fresh as if just cut off.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. When Tarquin the Proud had reigned more than twenty years,\n he and his family Were driven out of Rome by the people. This\n event was brought about by the wickedness of his son Sextus, whose\n conduct had caused a noble Roman lady to commit suicide. Her\n name was Lucretia.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. The expulsion of the Tarquins took place in the year 509 be-\n fore the Christian era. The Romans never had another king. Be-\n sides the senate, the government now consisted of two magistrates\n called consuls, who were chosen every year. Brutus and Collatinus\n were the first.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13.

Acts of heroism were common among the Romans, in those\n days. A young man, named Mutius Scaevola, gained great credit for\n his fortitude.

By this act, he showed Porsenna that no tortures could\n induce him to turn traitor.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Almost from the first foundation of Rome, the inhabitants had\n been divided into two classes; one called patricians, and the other\n plebeians. The senate and most of the rich men were included\n among the patricians. The consuls were also chosen from this class.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Thus the patricians had nearly all the power in their hands.\n This caused frequent quarrels between them and the common people,\n or plebeians. But at length it was ordained that five magistrates,\n called tribunes, should be annually chosen by the plebeians.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5 . These tribunes took away a great deal of power from the patri-\n cians, and were therefore hated by them. Coriolanus, a valiant, but\n proud patrician, endeavored to have the office of the tribunes abolish-\n ed. But they were more powerful than he, and succeeded in procur-\n ing his banishment.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Coriolanus left the city, and went to the territories of the Volsci,\n who were bitter enemies of the Romans. There he gathered a large\n army, and advanced to besiege Rome.

They therefore sent an embassy to meet him, consisting of the\n oldest senators. But these venerable men could make no impression\n on Coriolanus.

It was taken by an army of Gauls, inhabitants of the country\n now called France. When Brennus, their general, had entered Rome,\n he marched with his soldiers to the senate-house.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. There he beheld an assemblage of gray-bearded senators, seated\n in a noble hall, in chairs of ivory. Each held an ivory staff in his\n hand. These brave old men, though they could make no resistance,\n considered it beneath their dignity to run away from the invaders.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The Gauls were awe-struck by their venerable aspect. But\n finally, one of the soldiers, being ruder than his companions, took\n nold of the long gray beard of an aged senator, and pulled it.

But Marius could not escape the misery which his wickedness\n deserved. He was so tortured by remorse, that he contracted a habit\n of drinking immoderately. This brought on a fever, of which he died.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. After the death of this wicked man, Sylla returned to Rome at\n the head of a large army. He declared himself dictator; and his\n word then became the sole law of Rome. Like Marius, he deter-\n mined to massacre all his enemies. As fast as they were killed, their\n bloody heads were brought to them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. When Sylla had shed as much blood as he desired, he suddenly\n resigned his power.

Thus the very same\n causes which rendered the Romans so invincible to their enemies\n made them liable to be enslaved by any great general who shoul- be\n ambitious of enslaving them. And such a general soon appeared.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. After the death of Sylla and Marius, the two most valiant\n distinguished warriors were Pompey and Caesar. Pompey was th\n eldest.

The name of this illustrious leader\u2019s rival was Julius Caesar. He\n was the most beautiful person in Rome.

The\n best part of Pompey\u2019s army consisted of a multitude of the young\n Roman nobility. These youths had very handsome faces ; and it\n was chiefly owing to this circumstance that Pompey lost the victory.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Caesar ordered his rough and weather-beaten soldiers to aim\n their blows right at the faces of their enemies. The latter were so\n afraid that their beauty would be spoiled, that they immediately\n turned and fled. A complete victory was gained by Caesar.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8.

As Caesar passed through the streets of Rome, he looked round\n at the crowd of obsequious senators, and listened to the shouts of the\n multitude. He felt that he was the most exalted man in all the\n world. But his heart was not at ease ; for he also felt that he had\n enslaved his country.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The proud procession ascended the steps of the senate house\n and passed into the hall. Along the sides of this hall were ranged\n statues of many famous Romans, and among them stood the marble\n image of Pompey, whose bloody head had been brought to Csesar.\n Just as Csesar was passing in front of Pompey\u2019s statue, Metellus\n Cimber, one of the conspirators, knelt down and took hold of his robe.\n This was the signal for the attack.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4.

But he defended himself with the valor he had shown in a\n hundred battles.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. At length Brutus pressed forward and struck him with his\n dagger. When Csesar saw that the hand of his dear friend was\n raised against his life, he made no more resistance. \u201c And thou too\n Brutus !\u201d he said, with one reproachful look.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Then covering his head with his mantle, that his enemies\n might not behold the death-pang in his face, he fell down at the\n pedestal of Pompey\u2019s statue. The marble countenance of the statue\n seemed to look down upon him, and Pompey was avenged.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The conspirators dipped their weapons in the blood that flowed\n upon the pavement.

Brutus, Cassius, and the other conspirators were compelled to\n flee from the city. Three men then usurped the government, and\n were called triumvirs, or a triumvirate. Their names were Mark\n Antony, Lepidus, and Octavius. The latter was Caesar\u2019s nephew,\n</p>\n<p>\n and had been his adopted son. ; \u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The triumvirate resolved to secure themselves in power by \" ^\n murdering all who were opposed to them. They made a list of three\n hundred senators and more than two thousand knights, and offered\n rewards for killing them. They exulted when the heads of theii\n victims were laid at their feet.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. One of these wicked triumvirs presented the head of his own\n brother to his colleagues.

The good fortune of Octavius gave him the victory, and Antony\n killed himself with his own sword, as I have related in the history of\n Egypt.

In addition to several other titles, the senate gave him that of\n Pater Patriae, or Father of his Country. This was merely a piece of\n flattery.

His reign from this time was peaceful and quiet, and offers few\n events that need to De recorded in this brief history. Nearly the\n whole world was under his sway, and therefore he had no occasion\n to increase his dominions by going to war. The greatest glory of his\n times consists in the works of poets and other men of genius.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10.

This was\n the whole of Africa then known ; the interior being only inhabited\n by scattered bands of negroes.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. It seems wonderful that one country could govern so many\n rations. This was done, however, by placing Roman governors over\n these various kingdoms ; the governors being sustained by a multi-\n tide of Roman soldiers.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. During this period, the people of Rome had great skill in archi-\n tecture, sculpture, painting, and many other arts. These arts were\n extended to all parts of the empire.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7- Thus a multitude of cities in various parts of Europe, Africa,\n and Asia, were tilled with costly temples and palaces of marble, with\n beautiful statues and valuable paintings. The splendor and magnifi-\n cence of many of these cities, at this period, was indeed wonderful.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. Nor was this all ; the Romans built many public works of great\n utility; they constructed roads paved with stone; they built durable\n bridges, and made aqueducts lor supplying the cities with water.\n So numerous and so permanent were these vast works, that the\n remains of them are still to be found in most of those countries over\n which the Roman dominion was then established, though they were\n executed nearly two thousand years ago.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9.

It is said that Constantine was one day riding at the head of his\n army, v\u00bb hen he saw a splendid cross in the heavens, upon which was\n written, \u201c Conquer by this sign.\u201d It is supposed that this vision per-\n suaded the emperor of the truth of the Christian religion, and induced\n him to adopt it as the religion of the state.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. From this period, Christianity flourished for a considerable time.\n The mythology of Greece and Rome, which had been extended\n throughout the Roman empire, gave way before it. Many of the\n temples were converted into churches, and the people who had been\n accustomed to bow down before the statues of Jupiter and- other\n imaginary gods, knelt in humiliation at the foot of the cross.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. In the year 364 after the birth of Christ, the Roman dominions\n were divided into the Eastern and Western empires. The capital of\n the Eastern empire was Constantinople, formerly Byzantium. The\n fate of this will be briefly related in the history of the Turks.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The capital of the Western empire was Rome.

The number of deities whom the Romans worshipped occasioned\n the erection of a great multitude of temples. Many of these were\n very splendid edifices, adorned with all the arts of sculpture, and\n filled with offerings and sacrifices.

At\n one period, the censors obliged all the young bachelors to make oath\n that they would marry within a certain time. Augustus increased\n the penalties on bachelors, and bestowed rewards on those who were\n parents of a numerous offspring.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. The parties were betrothed some time before the actual cele-\n bration of the marriage. This was attended with many ceremonies,\n at which the priests and augurs assisted. The contract of marriage\n was drawn up in the presence of witnesses, and confirmed by the\n breaking of a straw between the engaged pair.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The bridegroom then presented his bride with the wedding\n ring, and the father of the bride gave a great entertainment. The\n wedding ring was worn on the third finger of the left hand, from a\n notion that a nerve of that finger communicated directly with the\n heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. In dressing the bride, they never failed to divide her locks with\n the point of a spear, to signify that she was about to become the wife\n of a warrior.

The funeral rites of the Romans present a very interesting\n subject. Burning the dead, though practised by the Greeks from very\n early times, was not adopted in Rome till the later ages of the re-\n public. It afterwards became universal, and was continued without\n interruption till the introduction of Christianity. It then gradually\n fell into disuse.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Among the Romans, the bed of the sick was never abandoned\n to hired nurses and servants. It was attended by the relatives and\n intimates, who waited till the last hour, and bade a last farewell to\n their dying friend.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The body of the dead was bathed in perfumes, dressed in rich\n garments, and laid out on a couch strewed with flowers. The\n outer door of the house was shaded with branches of cypress. Ac-\n cording to the heathen mythology, Charon would not convey the de-\n parted spirit across the Styx, without payment of a fixed toll. A\n small coin was therefore placed in the mouth of the deceased to\n meet this demand.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The funeral took place by torchlight. The body was borne by\n near friends and relatives, on an open bier covered with the richest\n cloth. Lictors dressed in black regulated the procession. If the\n deceased had been a soldier, the badges of his rank were displayed,\n and the corps to which he belonged marched with their arms re-\n versed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Before the corpse were carried images of the deceased and his\n ancestors. Then followed musicians, and mourning women, who\n were hired to sing his praises, and dancers and buffoons, one of whom\n attempted to represent the character of the dead man, and imitate\n his manner when alive.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. The family of the deceased followed the bier in deep mourning;\n the sons with their heads covered, and the daughters unveiled and\n with their hair dishevelled. Magistrates and patricians attended\n without their badges or ornaments, and the procession was closed by\n the freed men of the deceased, with the cap of liberty ^n their\n heads.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.

It was their custom to sacrifice\n on the tomb of the deceased those animals to which he was most at-\n tached during his life.

No burial was allowed within the walls of the city, except to\n the vestal virgins, and some families of high distinction. The tombs\n of military men were usually raised in the field of Mars, and those of\n private citizens in the gardens of their villas, or by the side of the\n public roads,\n</p>\n<p>\n 13.

It is probable that at this period the ground was broken up only\n by the spade. Afterwards, when the farms were enlarged, more ex-\n peditious means were discovered. Some of the Roman modes of\n ploughing are still in use. They always ploughed with oxen, a sin-\n gle pair, or sometimes three abreast, yoked, by the neck and horns.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The farm-houses were at first little huts, but they were soon en-\n larged to suit the increasing possessions of the owners.

The kinds of grain in common cultivation were the same as\n those known in Europe, with the exception of maize, or Indian com,\n which was first found in this country. The ancient mode of convert-\n ing grain into meal was by pounding it, with an instrument something\n like the pestle and mortar. Mills moved by cattle, and by water, are\n later inventions.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Much care was paid by the Romans to the rearing of cattle.\n Sheep were secured under cover during the winter, notwithstanding\n the mildness of the Italian climate. Shearing time was a season of\n general festivity.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Goats were made as profitable to the farmer as sheep. Their\n hair was clipped every year and woven into a kind of coarse stuff, and\n their milk was the chief supply of the dairy.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The Roman farmers were very superstitious.

One of them I will now tell you\n about. It was seated on a rising ground, facing the south, with the\n Apennine mountains raising their tall cliffs in the distant background.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. A portico fronted the house, with a terrace before it, adorned\n with various figures, and bounded by a hedge of box. Hence you\n passed by an easy descent into a lawn surrounded by walks, and\n adorned with box cut into the shapes of various animals.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Beyond this lawn you entered a ground for exercise, laid out in\n the form of a circus, ornamented with well trimmed box and other\n shrubs, and fenced with a wall covered by box. On the outside of\n the wall was a meadow, and beyond were other meadows, fields, and\n thickets.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Opposite the portico stood a square edifice which encompassed\n a small area or space, shaded by four plane trees, with a fountain in\n the midst, refreshing the surrounding verdure. This apartment con-\n sisted of a bed-chamber and a dining-room. A second portico looked\n out upon this little area.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Another room situated by the nearest plane tree, enjoyed con-\n stant greenness and shade. In the same building were dressing-rooms,\n porticos, baths, and rooms for playing different games. The sides of\n one room were encrusted half way with carved marble; thence, to\n the ceiling, branches of trees were painted, with birds intermixed\n with the foliage.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. In front of these buildings and porticos was a spacious circus,\n surrounded by plane trees covered with ivy. Between these were\n</p>\n<p>\n f danted box and bay trees, mingling their shade. The inward circu-\n ar walks were perfumed with roses.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. A thousand different and fantastic shapes were given to the box\n that bordered the straight and winding alleys that crossed the grounds.\n At the end of one of these walks was an alcove of white marble,\n shaded with vines and supported by four pillars.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. A fountain here emptied itself into a marble basin contrived\n with so much art as to be always full without overflowing. Some-\n times Pliny supped here with his friends, and then the basin served\n for a table, the larger vessels being placed about the margin, and the\n smaller ones swimming about in the form of little boats and water-\n fowl.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. In front of the alcove stood a summer-house, of exquisite mar-\n ble, with projecting doors which opened into a green inclosure. Next\n to this was a private recess, furnished with a couch, and shaded by a\n spreading vine which reached to the top. Here, also, a fountain al-\n ternately rose and disapperred. In different parts of the walks were\n several marble seats, and throughout the whole circus were small\n rills refreshing the grass and other plants.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12.

According to the Roman laws, every\n freeborn citizen was a soldier, and bound to serve in the army at any\n period from the age of seventeen to that of forty-six.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The Roman forces were divided into legions, each of which con-\n sisted of three thousand foot soldiers, and three hundred horsemen.\n The standard of the legion was the imperial eagle.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. This was made of gilt metal, was borne on a spear by an officer\n of rank, and was regarded by the soldiers with a reverence which ap-\n proached to devotion. The cavalry carried pennons, on which the\n initials of the emperor or of the legion were embroidered in letters\n of gold.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The only instrument of martial music among the Romans was\n the brazen trumpet. Some of the soldiers were armed with light\n javelins, and others with a heavier weapon of a similar description.\n All however carried shields and short swords, which they wore on\n the right side.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13.

The first amphitheatre erected in Rome, for the shows of wild\n beasts and gladiators, was a mere temporary building of wood, pro-\n bably erected by Julius Caesar.

The wild beasts were secured in dens round the arena in\n the centre, which was strongly fenced, and surrounded by a canal, to\n guard the spectators against their attacks. A vast number of wild\n beasts were made to destroy each other in these very cruel exhibi-\n tions.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8.

The first public combats of gladiators took place at Rome in the\n close of the fifth century from the foundation of the city. They\n were exhibited at a funeral.

Five hundred pairs of these wretched beings have frequently\n been led to the public games to sacrifice each other for the amuse-\n ment of barbarous spectators.

For the better enjoyment of horse and chariot races, there was\n an enclosed course immediately adjoining the city, called the circus.\n It was rather more than a mile in circumference, and was surrounded\n with seats and three tiers of galleries.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. In the centre, was a barrier of twelve feet in breadth, and four\n feet high, around which the race was performed ; and at one end was\n a triumphal arch, through which the successful charioteer drove,\n followed by the shouts and applause of the assembly.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Four chariots usually started together, the drivers of which\n were distinguished by dresses of different colors. Each color had its\n particular partizans, who betted largely on the success of their\n favorite. These sports were exceedingly popular, and repeated in\n endless succession.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Of the form of carriages in use among the Romans, we have no\n precise description. They were of various kinds, open and covered,\n chairs and couches, borne on poles by slaves in livery. The couch\n was furnished with pillows and a mattress, and with feet of silver or\n gold to support it when set down. There were also close litters,\n drawn by mules, and carriages on two and four wheels, painted of\n various colors, and highly ornamented.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. The horses were yoked to the carriage by means of a curved\n cross-bar passing over their necks, and were directed by bridles and\n reins, which were sometimes of embroidered silk with gold bits.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Besides mules and horses, many other animals were occasionally\n used in carriages, such as dogs, goats, and deer, and even bears,\n leopards, lions, and tigers. But this of course was merely for a\n whimsical amusement, and not for real service.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. When the Romans were poor and simple, they lived chiefly on\n milk and vegetables, with a coarse kind of pudding made of flour and\n water. But as they began to grow powerful, and to conquer the\n neighboring nations, they became acquainted with the luxuries of\n the people they subdued, and introduced them into their own state.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. As they found in Greece models of the fine arts, so Asia fur-\n nished them with new and numerous sources of pleasure in the\n gratification of their senses.

Theatres\n were at first built in the villages in the vicinity; the first permanent\n edifice of this kind in the city was built of stone, and calculated to\n contain forty thousand spectators.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The use of such clocks and watches as we have at present was\n unknown to the Romans. The sundial was introduced 440 years af\n ter the building of the city.

After a\n taste for the fine arts had been thus formed, large enclosed galleries\n were built around the mansions of the rich, and were adorned with\n the finest specimens of painting and sculpture.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. In the dwellings of the most affluent patricians, these galleries\n also contained splendid libraries, which were open to the inspection\n of the learned and the curious.

It was near the year 1100, that one of the popes of Rome or-\n dained that the title of pope should be given only to the bishop of\n Rome. It was about this period that the power of the pope was at\n its highest pitch. For nearly four hundred years, this potentate con-\n tinued to exercise an almost undisputed sway over the people, and\n even the kings and princes of the Christian world.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. During this age, great darkness prevailed throughout Europe,\n A.sia, and Africa ; and though Rome was the seat of the popes, now\n nore powerful than any sovereign, the people were generally in a\n late of ignorance and degradation.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. But in the year 1517, the Reformation was commenced by a\n V .an called Martin Luther. He preached against the power of the\n p* ^es, and all Europe was shaken with the convulsion which follow-\n ed The result was, that the authority of the popes was generally\n thrown off by the governments throughout Christendom, though it is\n supposed that fifty millions of people were killed in the wars that\n took place during this period of agitation.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. The pope still governs Rome and other adjacent territories in\n the centre of Italy. His dominions are bounded north by Lombardy,\n and in other directions by the Mediterranean Sea, and the Adriatic,\n and by the kingdom of Naples, Modena, and Tuscany. He is the\n spiritual head of the Catholic church throughout the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. The present pope (1848) is Pius IX, who came to the papacy\n in 1847. He has shown a desire to improve the political conddition\n of his people, and hence has acquired great credit, not only in Italy,\n but other countries.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. His efforts, however, have probably had a different effect from\n what he intended. They have awaked a spirit of liberty, which,\n being aided by the great movements in the rest of Europe, has\n caused the pope much disturbance, and threatens finally to frustrate\n the papal government, so far as it relates to temporal affairs. \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n 14.

But instead of the mighty warriors of old Rome,\n they find only a degraded people. Their spirit has been crushed by\n ages of servitude and superstition.\n</p>\n<p>\n 16. But these ruins and relics are not the only remains of ancient\n Rome. There are many works still existing, written by the old Ro-\n man authors. These are in the Latin language, which, as I have\n before said, was spoken by the Romans.

In the history of Asia, I have given you some account of the\n Saracens. These you will remember were Arabs, among whom\n Mahomet and his successors established an empire at the commence-\n ment of the seventh century.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The kings or rulers of the Saracen empire were called caliphs,\n and resided at Bagdad, a splendid city which they built near the\n river Tigris in Mesopotamia. I have told you how these caliphs ex-\n tended their empire over a considerable part of Asia and Africa, and\n some portions of Europe.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. To the north of Mesopotamia, there were several tribes of\n Tartars, among which were some called Turks. These were daring\n warriors, and such was their fame, that the caliphs induced many of\n them to come to Bagdad and serve as soldiers.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. In process of time, the Turks acquired great influence at Bag-\n dad, and finally overturned the Saracen empire, made themselves\n masters of nearly all the Saracen possessions, and adopted the Maho-\n medan religion. Thus the Turkish empire became the successor of\n the Saracen empire, and included in its dominion Asia Minor, Syria,\n Palestine, and other Asiatic countries, which the Saracens had con-\n quered from the Greek empire.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. After a while, the Turkish empire, which had been thus estab-\n lished, was overturned by another tribe of Turks, who called them-\n selves Ottomans. These came from the country east of the Caspian\n Sea, and laid the foundation of the present Ottoman empire. This\n took place in the year 1299 ; the founder of the empire being Othman\n the First.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6.

It had before this period fallen into decay, but it was now re-\n vived, and Constantine removed thither with his whole court. It\n thus became the capital of the Roman empire. When that was\n divided into the Eastern and Western empires in 395, it was the\n capital of the former, which, as you know, was often called the\n Greek empire.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. This continued with various changes, to subsist as a distinct\n sovereignty, till the period of which I am now treating. It was, as I\n have said, on the brink of ruin, when the Ottomans, who had already\n established themselves in Asia Minor, and swallowed up the countries\n formerly belonging to the Saracen dominions, began to cast longing\n eyes upon the Greek empire in Europe.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. The sultan, at this time, was Bajazet. He began to reign in\n 1389, and was so famous for his conquests, that the Turks called him\n the Thunderbolt.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. He was preparing to attack Constantinople, when a greater\n warrior than he came from Tartary, and subdued him. This was\n Tamerlane, otherwise called Timour the Tartar, and sometimes\n Timour the lame man. He defeated Bajazet in a great battle, in\n which three hundred thousand men were slain.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. It is said that when Timour the lame man had got Bajazet the\n Thunderbolt into his power, he put him into an iron cage, and carried\n him about for a show, like a wild beast. Most conquerors have a\n resemblance to wild beasts, and it would be well if they could always\n be kept in iron cages.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. The misfortunes of Bajazet prevented the Turks from conquer-\n ing the Eastern empire of the Romans, for a considerable time. But\n in 1453, when Mahomet the Great was sultan, they took Constantino-\n ple. The emperor, whose name was Constantine, was killed. From\n this time forward, the Turks were securely established in Europe,\n and the country which they inhabited was called Turkey.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER XCVIII.\u2014 EUROPE CONTINUED.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sequel of the Turkish History .\n</p>\n<p>\n 1.

Afterwards, the\n Carthaginians acquired possession of the country ; but it was taken\n by the Romans in 134 B. C., who kept it till the year 406 after the\n Christian era.

Their faces were invisible ; but they looked at the pris-\n oners through two holes in their sackcloth hoods.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. If the accused persons would not plead guilty, they were tor-\n tured in various ways.

The rope was then suddenly tightened again, and the prisoner\u2019s\n limbs were put out of joint by the shock.

Such were the horrors of the Inquisition ; yet it had been intro-\n duced into Italy before it was adopted in Spain, and in after times it\n spread into other Catholic countries, and continued in operation for\n nearly three hundred years.

Curious Death of a Spanish\n King. Recent Affairs of Spam.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. One of the most powerful monarchs of Spain was Philip the\n Second. He was not only king of Spain, but he obtained the crown\n of Portugal also, in 1580 ; but Portugal afterwards became a separate\n kingdom again. It had first been declared independent of Spain at the\n beginning of the twelfth century.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Philip intended to conquer England, and prepared a fleet of eighty\n ships for that purpose. This fleet was called the Invincible Armada.\n Put it was conquered even without a battle, for a storm scattered it,\n and drove many of the ships on the British coast.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The son of Philip was a weak minded man. The manner of\n his death was very singular. He was sitting, one day, in the coun-\n cil chamber, which was warmed by a large stove. The heat and\n vapor of the stove affected his head.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. He ordered the attendants to quench the fire. But the person\n whose duty it was to do this happened not to be in the chamber, and\n the rules of the Spanish court were so strict, that it would have been\n unlawful for any other person to touch the fire.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Moreover, it would have been beneath the king\u2019s dignity to\n leave the chamber, or even to move his chair back from the stove.\n So the fire continued to grow hotter, and the poor king grew sicker\n and sicker, till at last it was impossible to cure him. And thus he\n died, by a kind of death that could have befallen nobody but a Span-\n ish king.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. In the year 1700, Charles the Second of Spain died without\n children. He was succeeded by a young French prince, named Phil-\n ip, duke of Anjou, the grandson of Louis the Fourteenth. The kings\n of this family are called the Spanish Bourbons.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. This event caused a long war in Europe. Charles, archduke of\n Austria, claimed the crown of Spain, and he and Philip of Anjou al-\n ternately drove each other out of Madrid. But Philip finally kept his\n seat on the throne.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. Spain has often been at war with England. She united with\n France against that country during .the American Revolution ; but\n peace was concluded in 1783. Another war, however, began between\n England and France in about ten years afterwards.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. In 1808, when the emperor Napoleon was at the height of his\n power, he compelled the Spanish king to abdicate his throne. The\n name of this king was Ferdinand the Seventh.

Portugal lies to the west of Spain, and is bounded on the west\n by the Atlantic Ocean. The population of the country is nearly four\n millions. The capital is Lisbon.. This is a large city, and many of\n our vessels visit it for the purpose of getting wines, grapes, oranges,\n and lemons.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The climate of Portugal is similar to that of Spain. The people\n also resemble the Spaniards, but speak a language somewhat differ-\n ent. The Portuguese are very ignorant, and as they seldom read,\n they have plenty of time for dancing.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Portugal was originally considered a part of Spain, and shared\n in the events of that country. In the twelfth century, it became in-\n dependent. Since that time it has been considered a separate king-\n dom, though it has been subject to Spain for a portion of this period.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The history of Portugal is of little interest, till about the year\n 1400, when the Portuguese took the lead in navigating the Atlantic\n Ocean. At this time, this great sea was little known, and nobody\n had gone across it to America, nor had any one dared to sail around\n Africa.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5 . But the little Portuguese vessels ventured out farther and far-\n ther, and finally one of them reached the Cape of Good Hope.

I need not tell you of what happened in Portugal from this time\n till the year 1755. At that date, an earthquake took place, which\n shook down nearly the whole city of Lisbon. Houses, churches, and\n palaces were suddenly tumbled into heaps of ruins. Large chasms\n were opened in the earth, and hundreds of houses were plunged into\n them. The sea at first rolled back from the land, and then returned,\n sweeping every thing before it. In this awful calamity, ten thousand\n persons lost their lives.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The Portuguese founded a good many colonies in different parts\n of the world. One of these was in Brazil, in South America. To\n this place the king of Portugal retired with his family in 1807, and\n established his court at Rio Janeiro, the capital of the country. This\n was done because Portugal had been invaded by the French.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. The French being driven out in 1808, the king returned in a few\n years. After his death there was a struggle for the crown, but it\n was finally settled upon Donna Maria, the present queen.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER CIV. -EUROPE CONTINUED.\n</p>\n<p>\n Description of France.

Paris, the capital, is a very large\n city, surrounded with a wall of stone. It is full of fine houses, beau-\n tiful public gardens, pleasant walks, handsome streets, and interesting\n places of amusement. To a stranger, it is the most agreeable city\n in the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Besides Paris, there are a great many other large and handsome\n cities in France. Among these are Rouen, where the people manu-\n facture a great deal of handsome jewelry ; Lyons, where they make\n beautiful silks; Marseilles, where the people deal in wines; and\n Bordeaux, in the midst of a country which produces fine grapes, and\n other delicious fruits.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

In the course of this history, I have had frequent occasion to\n mention various northern tribes of Europe, called barbarians, and\n perhaps I shall not find a better opportunity than the present to give\n you some account of them. You remember that Greece was settled\n before any other part of Europe. The first inhabitants were the\n descendents of Japheth. The descendents of these spread themselves\n over Greece, and probably other parts of Europe.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. As the people increased along the shores of Asia and Africa,\n they sent colonies to different places along the shores of the Mediter-\n ranean. Some settled in Greece, some in Italy, some in Spain.\n These countries being warm, pleasant, and fruitful, were soon filled\n with inhabitants. Living upon , the coast, they had a great many\n ships, and carried on commerce with different countries.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. In this way, after many years, they grew rich, and built large\n cities, with fine houses, temples, and palaces. Such was the course\n of events in regard to all southern Europe, of which I have been\n telling you the story. But, while these things were going on, various\n tribes were emigrating into the more northern portions of Europe.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Here the climate was colder, and the soil less fruitful. Still the\n woods were full of elks, rein-deer, fallow-deer, and the roe-buck, wild\n bulls, wild boars, and many other animals.

On account of the pious reverence entertained for what they\n called the Holy City, many Christian pilgrims went on foot to visit\n it.

There was soon such a state of excitement, that\n the princes assembled, and armies were speedily gathered for the\n enterprise. Thus in the year 1096, Peter set out with two hundred\n thousand men at his heels. He carried a ponderous cross upon his\n shoulders, and his followers wore crosses of red cloth sewed upon\n their clothes.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. But scarcely had his army landed in Asia, when sultan Solyman\n attacked them, and made a terrible slaughter.

This consisted of eighty thousand\n men, and was led by a French prince called Godfrey of Bologne. He\n proceeded through Asia Minor, took several cities, and captured\n Jerusalem in 1099.

It is true, that the soldiers had often hard\n fare and hard knocks; occasionally they were wounded, and many of\n them were slain. But when the battle was over, those who survived\n celebrated their victory with feasting and drinking, and other amuse-\n ments suited to the tastes of barbarous men.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. Between the intervals of fighting, they had mimic battles among\n themselves, or two stout fellows would fight with swords in the pre-\n sence of the whole people. At other times, during a wet day, or a\n dull night, they would prolong their festivities by telling stories of the\n great deeds they had done, or seen, or heard of, or by singing ballads\n of bloodshed and battle.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. It frequently happened that some person in the camp had a\n great talent for singing and story-telling ; he therefore would be often\n called upon to exercise his gift. So he would amuse the company\n with wild legends of the chase, in which a king or prince had a terri-\n ble battle with a fierce boar or a rough bear.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. Or he would tell of some chief who had performed wonderful\n deeds, or perhaps he would weave some superstitious tale of ghosts\n that walked abroad by moonlight, or of some murdered prince whose\n spirit often came at night to haunt the castle where he once dwelt.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. Such were some of the amusements which repaid these barba-\n rians for the toils of war. But these were by no means all. The\n real object of most of the wars among these people was plunder.\n War took the place of trade and commerce among them, and the prin-\n cipal inducement to carry it on was to obtain the lands and the goods\n of other nations. It was, in short, a system of plunder, and the sev-\n eral tribes might be considered as so many bands of robbers.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. When a country was conquered, the spoils were distributed\n among the victors according to their rank. The king, or chief, had a\n large share, the inferior chiefs had a smaller share, and the common\n soldiers had still less. The lands were divided in this way ; but it\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.

The lands were not held in those times as they are now among\n as ; each individual did not own a piece of land and build upon it, or\n cultivate it as he liked. But a large tract might belong to the king,\n and a smaller tract might belong to the inferior chiefs or barons.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. The king or baron built upon his land an immense strong castle\n of stone ; around it, the people, who were called his vassals or slaves,\n built their little huts.

Now what is meant by the Feudal System is this; that the\n vassals of a baron who lived upon his land were bound to do military\n service whenever the baron required it. So also the barons, under\n the Feudal System, were required to do military service, bringing into\n the field all the men they could muster, whenever their king re-\n quired it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 16. In return for these services, the lord of the manor, or owner of\n the land, was expected to protect his people in time of war ; and as\n the castle was usually large and strong the people fled to it, when-\n ever an enemy appeared in sight.\n</p>\n<p>\n 17. Here in the castle they would make the best defence in their\n power.

Sometimes a powerful baron would come\n suddenly upon a weaker one, seize his castle, and either murder him\n or shut him up in a dungeon.

When knight-errantry, or chivalry, had become thus established\n those who belonged to the profession were considered as under a re-\n ligious vow to devote themselves to the cause of justice and humani-\n ty.

In 1350, John the Good, son of Philip of Valois, succeeded to the\n throne of France. The country was invaded by an English army\n under the eldest son of Edward the Third. He was called the Black\n Prince, on account of the color of his armor.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. King John of France, with sixty thousand men, encountered the\n Black Prince of England, near Poictiers. The Black Prince had only\n eight thousand soldiers. But the English archers and cross-bow men,\n let fly their arrows at the French, and made a dreadful havoc among\n them. King John was taken and kept prisoner four years in London.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. John the Good, was succeeded by his son, Charles the Wise.\n King Edward of England had now grown old, and his son, the brave\n Black Prince, was dead. The French therefore got back all the\n territories which the English had won of them, except the town ol\n Calais.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. But when Charles the Well-beloved was king of France, the\n English renewed the war. Henry the Fifth, now king of England,\n invaded France. At the battle of Agincourt, he had but fifteen thou-\n sand men, while the French had nearly a hundred thousand.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 1. Yet the English gained a glorious victory, with the loss of only\n forty men. On the side of the French, there were seven princes, the\n high constable of France, and ten thousand gentlemen killed, besides\n many prisoners. In 1420, the English king entered Paris in triumph.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. But Henry, king of England, died soon afterwards ; and then\n the French began to beat the English. The chief leader of the\n French at this time, was a girl of eighteen, named Joan of Arc, or\n the Maid of Orleans. She was very beautiful. The French believed\n that Heaven had sent her to rescue their country from the English in-\n vaders. The English believed her to be a witch, and that the evil\n one assisted her in fighting against them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. For a considerable time, it was found impossible to withstand\n holy Joan, the Maid of Orleans. She was clad in bright steel armor,\n and rode in front of the French army, on a snow-white horse. In her\n hand, she carried a consecrated banner, on which was painted the\n image of our Saviour. But, at last, she was wounded and taken\n prisoner. The English condemned her to be burnt alive for witch-\n craft.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. She was accordingly bound to a stake, in the marketplace of\n Rouen. The English army looked on, rejoicing, while the flames\n roared and whirled around her.

Until the little king should become of age to take the sceptr6\n into his own hands, the duke of Orleans was declared regent of\n France. He was a profligate man. Instead of teaching the young\n king how to make his subjects prosperous and happy, he set him an\n example of all sorts of wickedness.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. And Louis the Fifteenth turned out just such a king as might\n have been expected. In his whole reign, of fifty-nine years, he seems\n to have thought of nothing but his own selfish pleasures.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. His kingdom was almost ruined and his subjects were starv-\n ing. Put if an earthquake had swallowed France and all its inhabit-\n ants, the king would hardly have cared. The reign of this odious\n monarch prepared the French to hate the very name of monarchy.\n He died in 1774, and was succeeded by his grandson, Louis the Six-\n teenth, who was then a young man of twenty.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. Thus by the extravagance of Louis the Fourteenth and the\n profligacy of Louis the Fifteenth, a foundation was laid for what is\n called the French Revolution, of which I shall tell you in the next\n chapter.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. I should be very glad to pass by the story of that awful period,\n for I know it can give my reader no pleasure to read of violence and\n bloodshed. But it is necessary to read the dark as well as the bright\n pages of history.\n</p>\n<p>\n lo. We may learn from the French revolution how much evil may\n be brought upon a country by bad rulers, and as some of my young\n pupils will hereafter be men, and be called upon to assist in choosing\n rulers, they may be made to feel the duty of choosing good ones.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER CXVII.\u2014 EUROPE CONTINUED.\n</p>\n<p>\n The French Revolution.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. Louis the Sixteenth had no talents which could render him fit\n to govern a nation. But he was a man of good heart, kind disposi-\n tion, and upright intentions. With all his defects, there has seldom\n been a better king ; for, if he was unable to do good, he was unwill-\n ing to do harm.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The king was married to an Austrian archduchess, named Ma-\n rie Antoinette. She had great beauty and accomplishments; but she\n was never a favorite of the French people.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Not long after this king and queen were crowned, the American\n revolution broke out. The United States declared themselves a free\n and independent republic. The people of France took a great inter-\n est in the affairs of America; and they began to think that a repub-\n lic was a better kind of government than a monarchy.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10.

In a little while longer, there were so many heads to be cutoff,\n \u201ehat the work could not be done fast enough in the ordinary way. It\n was therefore necessary to do it by machinery ; and a horrible instru-\n ment, called the guillotine, was invented for the purpose.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11.

When many of the loftiest heads in the kingdom had been cut\n off, the people fixed their eyes on the head that wore a crown. \u201c Off\n with the king\u2019s head too !\u201d cried they. So they dragged the poor,\n harmless king before the national convention, and he was forthwith\n sentenced to the guillotine.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. As the poor king mounted the steps of the scaffold, he gazed\n around at the fierce and cruel multitude.

He could not yet believe but that his royal blood was precious\n to his people. He lingered, \u2014 he was loth to lay down his head, \u2014 he\n shivered with the agony of his spirit. There stood a holy priest be-\n side him on the scaffold. Other priests, in those dreadful times, had\n abjured their God ; but here was one who held fast his faith. Other\n subjects had betrayed their king; but here was one who revered him\n most upon the scaffold.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15. He whispered consolation to the unhappy king, and pointed\n heavenward.

In a few days, Napoleon\u2019s banner again\n waved triumphant all over France.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The nations of Europe now mustered their armies once more.\n They were led by the English Duke of Wellington. Napoleon\n marched into Flanders, or Belgium, to meet them. He was followed\n by almost every young Frenchman that could shoulder a musket.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. The emperor Napoleon\u2019s last battle was fought at Waterloo, on\n the 18th of June, 1815. There he was utterly overthrown, and\n France was overthrown with him. The warlike emperor was sent\n to die on the Island of St. Helena, and the Bourbon king was again\n established on the throne of Louis the Sixteenth.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. But a strange and interesting scene has lately been witnessed\n in France relating to Napoleon. The French people did not like to\n think that the remains of Napoleon were far away upon the rock of\n St. Helena. So in 1840, Louis Philippe, king of the French, sent his\n son in a national ship, and he brought the body of the late emperor\n back to France.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. The people received the body with military honors, and many\n of Napoleon\u2019s old soldiers and officers, rushed to the side of the coffin,\n and wept over it as if he had been their father. With vast ceremony\n the body was taken to Paris, and there it is now interred, in the\n famous edifice called the Hotel of Invalids.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. What happened in 1812?

Louis the Eighteenth, the new king of France, was a fat, quiet,\n respectable sort of old gentleman, and seems to have been chiefly\n distinguished for his love of oysters. He died in 1824, and was suc-\n ceeded by his brother, Charles the Tenth.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. It was said of all the Bourbon family, that they had learnt\n nothing during their exile from France, nor forgotten anything. And\n Charles soon proved that he had not forgotten that his ancestors had\n exercised absolute power, nor learnt that such power is very danger-\n ous to possess or exercise.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. In 1830, when Charles the Tenth had sat on the throne about\n six years, he forbade the printing of any newspapers, except such as\n praised his conduct and government.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The mob of Paris immediately rose, and began a war against\n the royal troops. They beat out the brains of the king\u2019s soldiers with\n paving stones, and shot them from the windows of the houses. The\n old king, who had not forgotten the days of the revolution, began to\n tremble for his head.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. In order to keep it on his shoulders, he took off his golden\n crown, and put it on the head of his grandson. But the French\n would not acknowledge the little fellow for their king. They raised\n large armies, and drove Charles the Tenth and his family out of the\n kingdom.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. They then asked the good and glorious La Fayette, (the man\n who came and fought with our countrymen in the time of the Revo-\n lution,) what sort of a government they should have. He would\n have chosen a republic, like our own ; but he knew that his country-\n men were not like us.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. He therefore told them, ' hat the government must be a limited\n monarchy, and that Louis Philippe, the Duke of Orleans, must be\n their king. Louis Phillippe was accordingly raised to the throne.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. He went on prosperously for a time, and was considered the\n most successful sovereign oi the age. But in February 1848, a\n revolution broke out in Paris, which extended over France.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. In December 1848, Louis Napoleon Bonaparte (a nephew of\n the emperor Napoleon) was elected President.

Germany lies to the east of France, and contains no less than\n thirty-six different kingdoms and states, beside Austria and Prussia,\n which are sometimes considered as making a part of Germany, and\n of which I shall tell you by and by. These thirty-six states and king-\n doms contain about twelve millions of inhabitants.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Some of the principal kingdoms of Germany are Bavaria, Wur-\n temburg, Hanover, and Saxony. They are nearly all governed by a\n king, or grand duke, or prince of some kind ; yet they are leagued to-\n gether under a sort of congress, called a diet, which meets at Frank-\n fort. To this diet the states send deputies.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. There are a great many large towns and cities in Germany.\n Among these, the principal are Hamburgh, which carries on a good\n deal of commerce with this country ; Munich, which is a very splen-\n did city ; Carlesruhe, which has its streets arranged like the sticks of\n an open fan ; Dresden, which is famous for the beautiful country\n arpund it, and Frankfort, which is encircled by a belt of fine gardens\n and public walks.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. I could easily write a book about Germany, for it is full of curi-\n ous and interesting things. In the cities there are a great many\n churches, in the Gothic style, which excite the wonder and admira-\n tion of a traveller, on account of their grandeur, and the skill with\n which many parts of them are carved.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. In many of the towns there are very curious manufactures, par-\n ticularly of musical boxes, toys for children, and clocks of all kinds.\n The Germans are very ingenious in these matters, and sometimes\n they make clocks so cunningly contrived, that at every hour a little\n bird will come out, flutter his wings, and sing a song, or perhaps tell\n you the time of day.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. If you ever travel in Germany, you will find that the people are\n very fond of music. All the boys and girls are taught music as a part\n of their education. Most of them can play upon some instrument.\n The flute is a great favorite, and is called the German flute, either\n because it was invented in Germany, or because it is more in use\n amongst the Germans than elsewhere.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. In passing through Germany, you will often notice the ruins of\n castles, some of which were built a thousand or twelve hundred years\n ago.

In ancient days, Germany, as I have told you, was inhabited br\n uumerous tribes of barbarians. Among these were the Goths, Visi\n goths, Vandals, Suevi, Cimbri, Teutones, Heruli, Alemanni, and many\n others. As there was no Peter Parley among them to write their his*\n tory in early times, we know little or nothing of them till two or three\n hundred years before Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. At this time they were numerous, but they were mere savages.\n They were clothed in the skins of wild beasts, and seemed to delight\n only in war and plunder. In the time of Caesar, they were very pow-\n erful, but that famous conqueror marched against them, and, after\n many bloody battles, they were reduced to submission.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. I have already told you that wherever the Romans extended\n their arms, they carried their arts. Thus the rude tribes of Germany\n became partially civilized ; many of the people exchanged their skins\n of beasts for the Roman toga or gown. They also learnt how to\n make better weapons of war, how to build better houses, and how to\n live more comfortably.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. But you remember, that four or five hundred years after Caesar,\n poor old Rome was tottering to decay. It was therefore unable to\n keep these restless tribes of the north in subjection ; nay, Rome was\n now incapable even of defending herself.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The Germans soon discovered how matters stood. They saw\n that in Spain, Italy, and Greece, there were a great many rich cities,\n and pleasant towns, and fruitful valleys. They saw that in these\n countries the Romans had collected the wealth of the whole world,\n and these shrewd barbarians thought it would be a good speculation\n to go to these countries and live there.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. They thought it would be much better to go and live in palaces\n and fine houses, and have a plenty of wine, and plenty of gold, silver,\n and jewels, than to live in their own less fruitful country, and earn\n their bread by toil, or by plundering each other.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Accordingly, some of them set out under their daring leaders,\n and marched into Italy. Others soon followed ; and in the course of\n a few years, these hordes had settled like swarms of bees in all the\n southern countries of Europe.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. But still many remained behind in Germany, and thus increased,\n so that in the time of Charlemagne they were numerous and power-\n ful. But he conquered them, as I have said in the history of France.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ch. CXXII. \u2014 1. How was Germany anciently inhabited? Mention some of the barba\n rian tribes. 2.

In the year 912, it became the custom for these rulers to make\n choice of one of their number, and declare him emperor. He then pre-\n sided over the whole of Germany.

Another emperor, also named Henry, who reigned about a\n hundred years afterwards, quarrelled with pope Celestinus. In order\n to make peace, he was persuaded to kneel down and kiss the pope\u2019s\n toe. Put no sooner had his lips touched the toe, than pope Celestinus\n drew back his foot, and hit the emperor\u2019s crown a kick, which sent\n it half way across the room.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14.

But I must now proceed with my brief account of the history of\n Switzerland. When Albert the First h ?came Emperor, in 1298, he\n acted like a tyrant towards Switzerland. He appointed governors,\n who were worse tyrants than himself. One of them, named Gesler,\n set his cap upon a pole, and ordered all the people to bow down to it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The famous peasant, William Tell, would not bow down to\n Gesler\u2019s cap. My readers have heard the story, how Gesler com-\n manded Tell to shoot at an apple on his own son\u2019s head, and how\n Tell hit the apple without hurting his son.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. When the Swiss rebelled against the emperor of Germany, Teil\n was their principal leader. After sixty pitched battles with the em-\n peror\u2019s troops, the liberty of Switzerland was established, and it be-\n came a free and independent republic.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2.

He dressed very plainly, and busied himself in\n saying his prayers and working in a garden.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

The reader must not suppose\n that the emperor meant to be buried alive. He merely wished to re-\n mind himself that his life must soon close.

Ferdinand the Second, who began to reign in 1619, was called\n by the Catholics the Apostolic emperor, because he was a bitter per-\n secutor of the Protestant inhabitants of Germany. His cruelties\n forced them to ask the aid of the Swedish king, Gustavus Adolphus,\n who accordingly invaded Germany, and gained many victories.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The subsequent history of Germany does not abound with the\n sort of events which my young readers would be desirous of knowing.\n Few or none of the later emperors performed any remarkable actions.\n But they appear to have been better than most sovereigns, for they\n cannot be accused of great crimes.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6.

The kingdom of Austria\n was enlarged by the successive emperors, and finally became great\n and powerful.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.

In 1792, Francis the Second became emperor of Germany. He\n undertook a war against Napoleon Bonaparte, but his armies were\n routed, and, in 1S06, he was compelled to resign the title of emperor\n of Germany. He was afterwards called emperor of Austria.

It has since been engaged in many wars, particularly with Swe-\n den, Turkey, and France. In 1688, the Turks pushed their arms in\n to the heart of the empire, and laid siege to Vienna, but were finally\n driven back.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. In 1809, Austria was involved in a war with Bonaparte.

It is a curious fact, that the emperors of Austria have had\n a great many beautiful daughters.

There are five great powers in Europe. Great Britain, France,\n Russia, Austria, and Prussia.

Yet it is still an extensive\n country, and has about as many inhabitants as the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The kingdom of Prussia censists of two seperate tracts of terri-\n tory. The larger of the two is bounded north by the Baltic, east by\n Russia, south by Austria, and west by Germany. The smaller por-\n tion is a part of Germany, and is bounded on the north and east by the\n Netherlands and Belgium.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The capital of Prussia is Berlin, situated on the river Spree, a\n river, by the way, with a very merry name. It is, however, a sober\n stream. The city is twelve miles in circumference, and is surrounded\n by a wall. It has a splendid palace, where the king resides, a fine\n university, where a great many young men are educated, and several\n places of public amusement. It is, on the whole, one of most splen-\n did cities in Europe.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Beside Berlin, there are many other fine cities in Prussia. Among\n these are Potsdam, where there is a royal palace, and Dantzic, a\n wealthy town and the chief seaport of Prussia. At this place, there\n is a powerful fortress, with immense stone walls and a multitude of\n cannon. It is defended by a large number of soldiers, who always\n remain in it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.

Frederic William the First, who ascended the throne in 1713,\n was a very odd sort of a king. He used to wear an old blue coat,\n which was ornamented with rows of copper buttons, reaching from\n his chin half-way down his legs. Whenever he got a new coat, he\n made the tailor sew on these same old copper buttons.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. He prided himself greatly on a regiment of his guards, which\n consisted of very tall men, many of whom were seven feet high.\n These gigantic fellows came from all parts of Europe ; and if they\n would not come of their own accord, the king hired people to bring\n them by force.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Frederic William was in the habbit of walking about the streets\n of Berlin, with a big cane in his hand, and if he happened to see any\n idle people, he would give them a sound threshing. He beat his own\n son oftener than anybody else. The princess, his daughter, got like-\n wise a good many hard knocks.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. When this ill-tempered old king was dead, his son Frederic\n came into possession of an enormous quantity of treasure, as well as\n an army of sixty thousand men. He soon found uses enough for his\n money and soldiers, in a war with Austria, Russia, and France.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. The war between Prussia and these three kingdoms began in\n 1756, and was called the Seven Years\u2019 War. Saxony and Sweden\n joined the enemies of Frederic. At one time, he seemed on the point\n of losing all his dominions. But he finally brought the war to an\n honorable close. He was then the most celebrated sovereign of his\n time, and is known in history by the title of Frederic the Great.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.

But in 1812, a great part of it was\n burnt, in order to drive out Napoleon and his soldiers, pretty much as\n people in our country sometimes set fire to a heap of brush in order\n to drive out a rabbit or a woodchuck. In this way, Moscow was\n nearly destroyed, but it has since been rebuilt.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2.

If she had succeeded in doing so,\n she would have governed the whole of the vast region between the\n Mediterranean Sea and ' the Arctic Ocean.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. But death hurried the great empress away, to answer for the\n murder of her husband, and many other crimes. She was succeeded\n by her son Paul, who was then forty-three years old.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. The czar Paul possessed none of his mother\u2019s talents, and was\n of a very stern and unamiable disposition. People suspected him of\n being insane.

The most famous sovereign that Sweden ever had, and one of\n the most famous in the world, was Charles the Twelfth. But my\n readers will long ago have become tired of hearing about conquerors;\n so that I shall speak very briefly of Charles.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. He began to reign in 1697, at fifteen years of age. From his\n youth upward, he thought of nothing but being a soldier. When he\n was only about seventeen years old, the czar of Russia, and the kings\n of Poland and Denmark, made war upon him.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Charles beat them all in the first campaign. When he heard\n the bullets whistling by his ears, he showed great delight, and ex-\n claimed, \u2014 \u201c That shall be my music!\u201d And, as long as he lived, he\n never wished for any other music.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. But it is a sad thing for a people when their king loves the\n whistling of bullets. Charles the Twelfth was a scourge to all Eu-\n rope, and to his own kingdom more than to any other. He delighted\n in war for its own sake, and not for any good which he expected to\n gain by it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. During the first few years of his reign, Charles was constantly\n successful ; but in 1709, the czar of Russia gained a great victory over\n him, at Pultowa. Charles made his escape into Turkey.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. He continued in that country five years, although he might safe-\n ly have returned home. He seemed to care nothing about his own\n dominions. When the Swedes sent to inquire what they should do\n in his absence, Charles answered, that he would send one of bis old\n boots to govern them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. At last, in 1714, he left Turkey and returned to Sweden. His\n first business was to make war again. But his warfare was now\n drawing to a close.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. One night, while besieging a fortress in Norway, he advanced\n m front of his troops to see how the siege was going on. A cannon-\n shot struck him on the head, and killed him. He was found gras-\n ping his sword, which was half drawn from the scabbard. Historians\n seem hardly decided whether to call Charles the Twelfih a hero or a\n madman.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9.

Norway was early inhabited by rough tribes, who were adven-\n turous seamen. There seems to have been now and then a pirate\n among them, for in 8(30, a pirate, named Nadody, discovered Iceland,\n which was afterwards settled by the Norwegians.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Norway was conquered by Canute, king of Denmark, in 1030;\n but six years after, it became independent, and for many years it was\n governed by its own king.

The\n people have light complexions, and the skin of the ladies is said to be\n exceedingly white. The people have a great many cattle, and they\n seem very fond of tilling the soil.

The Danish language is spoken both\n in Denmark and Norway.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The three kingdoms of Denmark, Sweden, and Norway, were\n anciently called Scandinavia. In very early times these were occu-\n pied by tribes of Fins and Germans ; afterwards, the Goths conquered\n these countries.

If I had time, 1 could make a long story about Holland, a coun-\n try once covered by the sea, but which is now walled out by a vast\n dyke. The people of Holland are called Dutch, and are known ail\n the world over as great smokers.

The Netherlands, or Holland and Belgium, were formerly one\n country. The whole territory is bounded on the north by the North\n Sea, east by Germany, south by France, and west by the British\n Channel and the North Sea, These territories belonged at one time\n to Rome, afterwards to Germany, and finally to Spain.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. In 1581, the seven northern provinces revolted against Philip of\n Spain, and formed themselves into a republic, which was then called\n Holland. During the seventeenth century, it was a very powerful\n nation, especially by sea. At this time, her ships often disputed, and\n sometimes successfully, with the British fleets.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. The remaining provinces of the Netherlands were long under\n the government of Austria.

The republic\n of Venice, as you will recollect, was founded in the fifth century. It\n at first comprehended only some marshy islands, at the head of the\n Gulf of Venice. Afterwards, a considerable tract of territory on the\n mainland was annexed to its government.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. Venice carried on an extensive commerce ; and, in the thirteenth\n century, the republic was very powerful. It was customary for the\n Doge of Venice, who was the chief ruler, to espouse the sea as a wife,\n with pompous ceremonies. Venice has long been going to decay, and\n is now under the government of Austria. The city of Venice is, how-\n ever, the admiration of all travellers.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. Genoa, on the northwestern coast of Italy, formerly resembled\n Venice in its government, although it never was so powerful. In\n 1815, it was annexed to the territories of Sardinia. Sardinia is an\n island in the Mediterranean Sea, and has been a kingdom since the\n year 1720. Besides Genoa, it has the territories of Piedmont and\n Savoy in Italy.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. The kingdom of Naples is generally called the kingdom of the\n two Sicilies. Its territories comprise all the south of Italy, besides\n the islands of Sicily, and some small islands in the neighborhood.\n The former sovereigns of Naples came from Spain.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. In 1808, the emperor Napoleon gave the kingdom of Naples to\n one of his most distinguished generals, named Joachim Murat, who\n was the son of a pastry-cook. King Joachim was shot in 1816, and\n the- two Sicilies were restored to the former king.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER CXXXVIL\u2014 EUROPE CONTINUED.\n</p>\n<p>\n Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1.

The three first countries are upon\n the island of Great Britain. This island is on the western coast of\n Europe, and is separated by the British Channel from France. At\n the narrowest part, this channel is twenty-five miles wide. Ireland\n lies west of Great Britain, at the distance of about sixty miles.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. These two islands are small in extent, but they contain nearly\n twenty-five millions of inhabitants. Besides this, the kingdom has\n colonies in various parts of America, Africa, and Asia, so that the\n King rules over nearly one hundred and fifty millions of people. Great\n Britain may be considered the richest and most powerful kingdom on\n the face of the globe.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. I suppose you know that the first settlers of our country came\n from England. They brought with them the manners and customs\n of the country where they lived. Thus the United States became\n very much like England ; the houses, the churches, the dress of the\n people in the two countries, are nearly the same. Besides this, the\n people speak the same language.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. But you must remember that England is an older and richer\n country than ours. It has larger cities, more splendid churches, more\n beautiful roads, finer gardens, and many other things superior to what\n can be found in this country.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Beside all this, England has a king, who has several magnificent\n palaces. England, too, has a great many noblemen, who live in costly\n country-seats. ,These ride about in coaches, some of which cost ten\n thousand dollars. Thus there is a great deal more splendor in Eng-\n land than we find here.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. But, as an offset to this, there is more poverty there than in our\n happier country. Beggars throng the streets, even in London, and\n they are to be found in all parts of the kingdom. Thousands of people,\n too, who are not beggars, labor very hard, and yet are scarcely able\n to live. Sometimes a great many people die for want of foo*j. Thus\n England is a country which is wonderful for its magnificence and\n power, yet, with all its wealth, a large portion of the people suffer\n the pangs of poverty.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER CXXXVIIL\u2014 EUROPE CONTINUED.\n</p>\n<p>\n About London and other Cities of England, Wales,\n Scotland, and Ireland.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1.

They sometimes overran the whole country.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Alfred, who ascended the throne in 872, fought fifty-six battles\n with them, by sea and land. On one occasion, he went into the camp\n of the Danes in the disguise of a harper. He took notice of every\n thing, and planned an attack upon the camp. Returning to his own\n men, he led them against the Danes, whom he completely routed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. This king was called Afred the Great ; and he had a better\n right to the epithet of Great than most other kings who have borne\n it. He made wise laws, and instituted the custom of trial by jury.\n He likewise founded the university of Oxford. Nearly a hundred\n years after his death, the Danes again broke into England. There\n was now no Alfred to oppose them. They were accordingly victo-\n rious, and three Danish kings governed the country in succession.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Canute the Great was one of them. He appears to have been\n an old pirate, or, as they were called in those days, a sea-king. One\n day, when he and his courtiers were walking on the shore, they called\n him king of the sea, and told him that he had but to command, and\n the waves would obey him.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Canute desired a chair of state to be brought and placed on the\n hard, smooth sand. Then, seating himself in the chair, he stretched\n out his sceptre over the waves, with a very commanding aspect.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. \u201cRoll back thy waves, thou sea!\u201d cried Canute. \u201cI am thy\n king and master ! How darest thou foam and thunder in my pre-\n sence ?\u201d But the sea, nowise abashed, came roaring and whitening\n onward, and threw a sheet of spray over Canute and all the courtiers.\n The giant waves rolled upward on the beach, far beyond the mon-\n arch\u2019s chair.

In order to pacify his holiness, the king set out on a pilgrimage\n to the tomb of Becket. When he entered the abbey where the tomb\n was situated, the whole community of monks assaulted him with\n rods.

The Duke of Lancaster\n began to reign in the year 1400, and was called Henry the Fourth.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2 . There were two rebellions against this king. One was headed\n by the Earl of Northumberland, and the other by the Archbishop of\n York; for, in those times, bishops often put on armor and turned\n soldiers. Henry conquered the rebels and reigned several years in\n peace.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. As long as his father lived, the king\u2019s eldest son was a wild ana\n dissipated young man. But no sooner was the old king dead, than\n nis character underwent a complete change. He now threw off his\n dissipation and devoted himself carefully to the business of governing\n his kingdom. He was crowned, as Henrv the Fifth,, in 1413. Two\n years afterwards he invaded France.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. I have already told, in the history of France, how Henry van-\n quished the French in the famous battle of Agincourt, and how he\n afterwards became master of the whole kingdom of France. His\n death took place in 1422, in the midst of his triumphs, at the age ol\n thirty-four.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The new king of England, Henry the Sixth, was a baby, only\n nine months old. At that tender age, while he was still in his nurse\u2019s\n arms, the heavy crowns of England and France were put upon his\n head. The ceremony of this poor child\u2019s coronation was performed\n in the city of Paris. He soon lost the crown of France. But the\n crown of England continued a torment to him as long as he lived, and\n it caused his death at last.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. When he grew up, he turned out to be a mild, quiet, simple\n sort of man, with barely sense enough to get along respectably as a\n private person. As a king, he was an object of contempt. His wife\n had far more manhood than himself, and she governed him like a\n child.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. During this king\u2019s reign began the war of the Roses. The\n reader will recollect, that the Duke of Lancaster had unlawfully\n taken the crown from Richard the Second. But he and his son\n reigned without much opposition, because they were warlike men,\n and could have defended the crown with their swords.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. Henry the Sixth, on the contrary, was soft, meek, and peaceable,\n without spirit enough to fight for the crown which his father left him.\n The heirs of Richard the Second therefore thought this a proper\n time to get back their lawful inheritance. The Duke of York was\n the nearest heir.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. He began a war in 1445. If there had been nobody but Henry\n the Sixth to resist him, he might have got the crown at once.

She was\n blinded by the errors of the age, and being a Roman Catholic, she\n caused persons to be burnt alive who denied the authority of the\n pope.

Elizabeth, however, in all that related to the power of England\n was truly a great queen, and the nation was never more respected\n than while this mighty woman held the sceptre in her hand. But\n she possessed hardly any of the kindly virtues that a woman ought\n to have. Yet she prided herself greatly on her beauty.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Many princes and great men desired to marry Elizabeth ; but she\n chose to remain sole mistress of her person and her kingdom.

He had a good deal of learning, and wrote several books.\n He delighted to talk Hebrew, and Greek, and Latin ; and his courtiers\n were often puzzled to understand him.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. James thought himself as wise as Solomon ; and it must be own-\n ed that he possessed a sort of cunning, which greatly resembled wis-\n dom. This was seen in his discovery of the Gunpowder Plot. Some\n misguided Catholics had laid a plan to blow up the parliament house,\n at a time when the king, the lords, and all the members of parlia-\n ment, would be assembled there. If it had succeeded, the whole\n government of England would have been destroyed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. But king James smelled out the plot. He set people on the\n watch, and they caught a man by the name of Guy Fawkes, in a cel-\n lar, where thirty-six barrels of gunpowder were concealed. Fawkes\n told the king the names of eighty of his accomplices. He and they\n were all put to death.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. James had one good quality which Kings have not very often\n possessed. He hated war. His reign was therefore peaceable. He\n died in 1625, and was succeeded by Charles the First, his son.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. It was easy to foresee that this king would have a more trouble-\n some reign than his father. There were now many Puritans in Eng-\n land. These people were opposed to the Church of England, to the\n bishops, and to all the ceremonies which had not been cast off when\n the Roman Catholic faith was abolished.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. They likewise thought that the kings of England had too much\n power. They were determined that, thenceforward, the king should\n not reign merely for his own pleasure and glory, but for the good of\n the people. ' Charles, on the other hand, seemed to think that the\n common people were created only that kings might have subjects to\n rule over.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. In the early part of his reign, the king persecuted the Puritans.\n He would not allow the Puritan ministers to preach, nor the people\n to attend their meetings. Their sufferings were great, although the\n king dared not burn them, as the bloody queen Mary would have\n done.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. Many of them crossed the ocean, and sought religious freedom\n in New England. John Hampden, John Pyne, and Oliver Cromwell\n were once on the point of coming to this country.

The civil war between the cavaliers and roundheads began m\n 1642. Many battles were fought, and rivers of English blood were\n shed on both sides.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. It was not long before Oliver Cromwell began to be a famous\n leader, on the side of the parliament. He pretended to fight only for\n religion and the good of the people. But he was an ambitious man,\n and meant to place himself in the king\u2019s empty seat.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Cromwell gained one battle after another, and rose from step to\n step, till there was no man so powerful and renowned as he. Final-\n l y, in 1645, he defeated the king\u2019s army at the bloody battle of Nase-\n by. King Charles afterwards surrendered himself to the Scots, and\n they delivered him to the parliament.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The parliament brought the king to trial as a traitor. The court\n that tried him consisted of a hundred and thirty-three persons. They\n declared him guilty, and sentenced him to lose his head. When the\n people of England heard the sentence, they trembled.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. For it was a great and terrible thing, that their anointed sover-\n eign should die the death of a traitor. Many kings, it is true, had\n died by the hands of their enemies, but it had always been in dark-\n ness and secrecy. But king Charles was tried and condemned in the\n face of all the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. On the thirtieth of January, 1649, they brought the king from\n his palace to the scaffold. It was covered with black cloth. In the\n centre of the scaffold stood a block, and by the block stood an execu-\n tioner, with an axe in his hand, and a black mask over his face.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. The steel-clad soldiers of Cromwell surrounded the scaffold.\n But the king walked to his death with as firm a step as when he\n went to his coronation. \u201c They have taken away my corruptible\n crown,\u201d said he, \u201c but I go to receive an incorruptible one.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. When king Charles had knelt down and prayed, he cast a\n pitying glance upon the people round the scaffold; for he feared that\n direful judgments would come upon the land which was now to be\n stained with its monarch\u2019s blood.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. Bui, as he saw that his enemies were resolved to slay him, he\n calmly laid his head upon the block. The executioner raised his axe,\n and smote off the king\u2019s head at a single blow. Then lifting it in\n his hand, he cried aloud, \u2014 \u201c This is the head of a traitor !\u201d But the\n people shuddered ; for they doubted whether it was the head of a\n traitor, and they knew that it was the head of a king.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6.

The principal man in it\n was called Praise-God Barebone. This name sounded so well, that\n it was bestowed on the whole parliament.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. But Praise-God Barebone\u2019s parliament did not keep together a\n great while. At the end of five months they besought Cromwell to\n send them about their business, and take the government into his\n own hands. This was just what Cromwell wanted.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. In 1654, he was proclaimed Lord Protector of the Common-\n wealth of England- He held this high office four years.

Death released him from this miserable condition, in\n the eighty-second year of his age.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11.

When the\n Romans came to Britain, the Welsh mountains were inhabited by a\n rough set of people, who gave terrible blows with their clubs. They\n defended their mountains so fiercely, that the Romans never got pos-\n session of the country.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. When the Saxons came, they subdued all England, and a small\n portion of Wales ; but the greater part held out against them to the\n last. Thus the Welsh princes maintained their independence, as\n well against the Roman as the Saxon invaders. These princes ap-\n pear to have lived in strong stone castles, which, in time of war, were\n defended by the people around them. The ruins of some of these\n castles are still to be seen.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. In these ancient times there was a strange set of men in Wales,\n called bards. These sung songs and told stories about the brave\n deeds of the Welsh princes and heroes. The people loved to listen to\n these men, for their tales related to fierce war and bloody battles, of\n which such rude nations are ever fond.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Some of these bards had a wonderful gift for singing and story-\n telling. These were often taken into the castles of the princes, and\n here they led a merry life, between singing and feasting. In order to\n keep up their influence they pretended to be prophets, and both the\n people and the princes believed they could foretell future events.\n Perhaps, too, the bards believed it themselves, for nothing is more\n easy than self-deception. At all events, the people paid them the\n greatest reverence.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. There is nothing so troublesome to a king as a tribe of people\n maintaining their independence in his neighborhood.

So it was with the kings of England with regard to Wales.\n With a view therefore to subdue these Welsh wolves and foxes ol\n the mountains, they sent a great many armies against them. But\n the mountaineers were too cunning to be caught, until about the\n year 1285. Edward the first was then king of England, and Llewellyn\n prince of Wales.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. The bards were always great lovers of hard fighting, and there\n fore they incited the Welsh princes to the boldest deeds. Llewellyn\n had been told by one of these bards, that he should become master ol\n the whole island of Britain.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. Accordingly ' , when the army of Edward the First came against\n him, he rashly led his little army against the English, and was de-\n feated and slain. He was succeeded by his brother David, but he\n too was taken and hung on a gibbet, for the crime of bravely defend-\n ing his country.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11 King Edward was very angry at the bards for stirring up the\n people to resist his arms. He therefore caused them all to be as-\n sembled and put to death. These acts did not make the king a\n favorite, but the next king was born in Wales, and received the title\n of Prince of Wales. They appear to have liked him a little better.\n From this time, the eldest son of the king of England has been called\n Prince of Wales.\n</p>\n<p>\n 16. Thus, with the death of David, ended the line of Welsh\n princes, and thus ended the independence of Wales. Since that time,\n the Welsh have been a part of the British nation, and they now\n weave stockings and dig coal and iron, instead of fighting, as their\n fathers did in the times of Llewellyn.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER CLIIL\u2014 EUROPE CONTINUED.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Story of Scotland .\n</p>\n<p>\n 1.

Among the curious notions still entertained by the Irish with\n regard to St. Patrick, is this. In Ireland there are no serpents or\n venemous reptiles, and the people firmly believe that St. Patrick put\n an end to them, and freed the island from them all for ever !\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. In the time of Henry the Second of England, Ireland was con-\n quered, and since that period has been under the English kings, it\n has, however, been very ill governed. King James the First did\n something towards improving the condition of the people, but neither\n he nor any subsequent king has been able to get St. Patrick out of\n their heads.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The saint was a Roman Catholic, and the greater part of the\n people are Catholics to this day. They are dissatisfied with the Eng-\n lish government ; and well they may be, for its conduct has been sel-\n fish, cruel, and unwise. The people have often been in a state of re-\n bellion, and though the leaders are ever crushed by the power of the\n government, still others rise up to head the people.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. Thus Ireland has been for years in an almost constant state of\n agitation Thousands of lives have been lost in attempts to obtain\n the freedom of the country, but in vain. The people are thus kept in\n subjection, and generation follows generation, living in wretchedness\n and dying in poverty.

He will then go home and laugh at you.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. The Irish are much the same, wherever they may be; cheer-\n ful, witty, and generous. They live for to-day, and think little of to-\n morrow. They are generally without education, but if ignorant, they\n are better than most other ignorant people. Let us ever treat them\n kindly.

Since that time, society has advanced in civilization, till it has\n reached a higher state of improvement than was ever known before.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The history of the church of Christ is a subject at which I have\n been able only to take an occasional glance. After our Saviour\u2019s\n death, in the year 33, his apostles proceeded to spread the Gospel\n throughout different countries. Paul was the most active and suc-\n cessful of these missionaries. He went several times through Asia\n Minor, travelled to Greece, and finally to Rome ; everywhere preach-\n ing the truths of the Christian religion. He died at Rome A. D. 61.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. At first, the Christians were persecuted by the Roman emperors,\n but the Gospel continued to flourish, until it pervaded most parts of\n the Roman empire. It was introduced into Britain in the year 60,\n and into most other parts of Europe at an early period. But it was\n not till the year 306, when Constantine adopted it, that it found favor\n with any king or prince in Europe.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. From this period it advanced rapidly. The mythology of\n Greece and Rome gave way before it. The horrid sacrifices and\n gloomy superstitions of the druids yielded to the gentle worship of\n one God, and the mysterious rites of Odin were forsaken for the reli-\n gion of the Cross.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The popes of Rome succeeded in placing themselves at the head\n of the Christian religion, thereby obtaining a controlling influence over\n mankind. They gradually acquired an immense power, which, mis-\n led by the spirit of the time, they often used improperly.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. In process of time, their authority was lessened, and a large part\n of the people of Christendom protested against their authority, and\n were thence called Protestants. At the present day, the pope of\n Rome has but little power, and the catholic church, which, like other\n religious communities in the dark ages, was addicted to persecution,\n has ceased thus to exercise its authority. The popes of modern times\n have been distinguished for their piety.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. I have mentioned the Inquisition, in the history of Spain. This\n was a secret court, whose business it was to arrest and bring to trial\n those who were suspected of not being true followers of the Catholic\n religion, which was believed to be the only sound faith.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. It appears that this institution was sanctioned by pope Inno-\n cent III., in the year 1215. From that time, it was gradually ex-\n tended, and at length was established in Spain, 1481 . Here it acquired\n great power, and became the most cruel and bloody tribunal on earth.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. It was for many years a favorite instrument by which the pope\n of Rome carried on his schemes of tyranny. It was introduced into\n most countries of Europe where the Catholic religion prevailed, but\n n no country did it exercise its terrible power with such cruel despot '\n ism as in Spain. It was not finally abolished till the year 1820.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. What period was called the Dark Ages ? How long is it since learning began to re-\n vive ? 5. When did Christ die ?

I have not had an opportunity to mention the abbeys and mon-\n asteries of Europe. These curious institutions, however, deserve no-\n tice. It appears that in most countries there have ever been some\n people who retire from the active business of life, and shut themselves\n up for religious contemplation. Such has been the case in Asia; and\n among the worshippers of Brama, Fo, Lama, and Mahomet, they are\n still found. Such was also the case among the idolaters of ancient\n Egypt, Greece, and Rome. Such was the case among the ancient\n Jews and such has been the pase among the believers of Christy from\n very early ages.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. The first monastery was founded by St. Anthony, in Upper\n Egypt, A. D. 305. This consisted of a number of huts, in which sev-\n eral hermits dwelt, devoting themselves to penance and prayer.\n Another monastery was established in France, in the year 300, by St.\n Martin. From this time, these institutions were multiplied, and be-\n came established in all Catholic countries. From the eighth to the\n fifteenth century, they received great encouragement, and many splen-\n did edifices were erected for their use.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15. Some were called abbeys, and some monasteries. Many of\n them were filled with monks and friars, and others with females,\n called nuns. The splendid remains of many of these edifices are still\n to be found in England, France, Germany, and other parts of Europe.\n At first, the inhabitants of monasteries lived in a simple manner, and\n devoted themselves to religious contemplations. But in after times\n the abbeys and monasteries became seats of voluptuousness. None\n were permitted to enter them but the monks and nuns ; these, there-\n fore, while they pretended to be engaged in religious duties, screened\n from the eyes of the world, often gave themselves up to luxurious\n pleasures.\n</p>\n<p>\n 16. These institutions were, however, greatly encouraged by the\n popes; and it was not until the corruptions of the Catholic religion\n brought on the Reformation, in the sixteenth century, that monastic\n institutions began to decline. They were abolished in England in\n 1539, and in France in 1790. In several other countries of Europe\n they have ceased, but still continue in Italy and Spain.\n</p>\n<p>\n 17. In me early ages, war was carried on without guns and cannon.\n The Creeks and ftomans were armed with swords, spears, and bat-\n de-axps, and they carried shields for defence. The troops of Egypt,\n Canhage, and Persia, were armed in a similar manner. In the year\n 1 339, gunpowder was invented, and cannon began to be used about\n he same time. They were first employed by the English at the bat-\n le of Cressy in 1346. On that occasion, king Edward had four pieces\n T cannon, which greatly aided in gaining the victory.\n</p>\n<p>\n 18.

They consisted of many\n tribes, living seperately, and speaking different languages. And\n second, the descendants of the Europeans who have come to this\n country at various times, and settled here. To these we might add\n several. millions of negroes, who have been brought from Africa as\n slaves, or their descendants.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12.

The largest lake is Lake Superior, the longest\n river is the Mississippi, the longest chain of mountains is that which\n extends nearly the whole length of the contineni, being called the\n Andes in South America, the Cordilleras in Guatemala and Mexico,\n and the Rocky Mountains in the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER CLIX. -AMERICA CONTINUED.\n</p>\n<p>\n c\n</p>\n<p>\n The first Inhabitants of America .\n</p>\n<p>\n 1.

Such, however, was the fact. The country was indeed inhab-\n ited by many tribes of Indians, but these people had no books, and\n knew nothing of the rest of the world. Where they came from or\n when they first settled in America, no one can tell.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. It appears that the northern portions of North America are in-\n habited by a race of people called Esquimaux.

As\n he grew up, he paid great attention to the study of geography. The\n idea entered his mind, that there must be vast tracts of undiscovered\n country, somewhere on the face of the broad ocean.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Columbus was poor, and had not the means of sailing in search\n of these unknown lands. He applied for assistance to the rulers of\n his native country ; but they refused it. He next went to Portugal ;\n but there he met with no better success.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. At last, he came to the court of Spain. Ferdinand and Isabella\n were king and queen of that country. The king, like almost every-\n body else, treated Columbus with neglect and scorn.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. But the queen thought so favorably of his project, that she sold\n her jewels to defray the expenses of the voyage.

Before speaking of the United States as one whole country, I\n must give a brief account of the settlements of the several colonies.\n I shall begin with New England, because that section of the Union\n is the most northerly, though not first settled.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. New England, as I have said, contains the states of Maine, New\n Hampshire, Vermont, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut.\n It is bounded north by Lower Canada, east by New Brunswick and\n the Atlantic Ocean, south by the Atlantic anil Long Island Sound,\n and west by New York.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. In the year 1620, a ship called the Mayflower arrived on the\n coast of New England. On board of this vessel were a number of\n ministers, and pious men and women. They had brought their chil-\n dren with them, for they never expected to return to their native land.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. They had been driven from England by persecution, and they\n nad come to this dreary wilderness, in order to worship God accor-\n ding to their own consciences. It was in the cold wintry month of\n December, when the Mayflower anchored in the harbour of Plymouth.\n The people went on shore, and the rock on which they landed has\n ever since been considered sacred.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. They went to work and built themselves some poor huts. At\n first, they met with great difficulties and hardships. Many of them\n fell sick and died. The survivors were often in want of food, and\n were forced to dig for shellfish on the sea-shore.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. In addition to their other troubles, the wild Indians sometimes\n threatened to attack them. But the Pilgrims were as brave and pa-\n tient as they were pious. They put their trust in God, and steadily\n pursued their design of making a permanent settlement in the country.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Soon after this settlement at Plymouth, other companies of reli-\n gious persons came to different parts of New England. Some settled\n at Salem, and others at Boston. Thus a good many English people\n were established in the country. In the year 1 635, sixty men, women,\n and children, journeyed from Massachusetts to Connecticut, to make\n a settlement there.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. They went through the woods on foot, and drove their cattle\n before them. At night, they lay down to sleep, with no shelter but\n the boughs of the trees. When they reached the Connecticut river,\n they began to build Windsor, Hartford, and other towns. These\n were the first settlements in Connecticut.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. In 1636, a pious minister, named Roger Williams, was banished\n from Massachusetts. He went to Rhode Island, and settled at Provi-\n dence. This good man was a great friend of the Indians, and they\n had a strong affection for him.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ch. (LXIV. \u2014 2. What of New England ? Boundaries? 3.

By degrees, villages were built all along the sea-coast of New\n England, and settlements began to be formed on the inland rivers.\n But a thick and dreary forest still overshadowed the greater part of\n the country, and bears and wolves often prowled around the cottages.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER CLXV.\u2014 AMERICA CONTINUED.\n</p>\n<p>\n Affairs of New England continued.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. The settlers of New England were good and pious people; but\n many of them seemed to have pretty much the same feelings towards\n the Indians that they had towards the bears and woives. They con-\n sidered them a sort of wild animal, or if men, very wicked ones.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The best friend that ever the red men had, was John Eliot. He\n considered them his fellow-beings, and went about preaching to them;\n and so he was called the Apostle of the Indians. He spent a great\n many years in translating the Bible into their language, and in teach-\n ing the Indians to read it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. There were, however, very few white men that loved the In-\n dians; and the latter looked upon the settlers as their enemies. They\n were afraid that, in time, they would cut down all the trees of the\n forest, and change their hunting grounds into cultivated fields.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The settlers had, therefore, many wars with the Indians ; but\n the most terrible one broke out in the year 1675, and was called king\n Philip\u2019s war. King Philip, though an Indian, was a man of great\n sagacity, and it was his design to destroy all the settlers, and make\n New England a wilderness again.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. King Philip first made an attack on the people of Swanzey, in\n Massachusetts, as they were coming out of the meetinghouse, on Fast\n day. Eight or nine persons were shot. Many others were killed and\n scalped in different parts of the country, and many houses were set\n on fire.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Almost every man in New England now shouldered his musket,\n and went out to fight king Philip. Even the ministers, instead of\n teaching the Indians to read the Bible, as John Eliot did, now took\n their guns and sent bullets at them, whenever they had a chance.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. In the course of the next winter, the settlers formed themselves\n into an army of nearly two thousand men, and drove king Philip and\n the other Indians into a strong fort, in Rhode Island. It stood in the\n midst of a swamp, and contained six hundred wigwams. All the\n Indian women and children had taken refuge there.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. Four thousand Indian warriors were in the fort. But the settlers\n boldly attacked them, broke into the fort, and set the wigwams on\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. What was done by degrees? What of the greater part of New England?\n Ch. CLXV. \u2014 1.

But, for many years\n afterwards, they would sometimes steal out of the woods by night,\n set the villages on fire, and slaughter the inhabitants. The New\n England colonies, however, increased rapidly, and in time, the country\n had many pleasant towns and villages.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER CLXVI.\u2014 AMERICA CONTINUED.\n</p>\n<p>\n Early History of Virginia .\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. The colony of Virginia was settled some years before New Eng-\n land. Jamestown, on James river, was founded by captain Christo-\n pher Newport, in 1607. The first settlers of Virginia were not such\n pious people as those of New England. They had not come to\n America for the sake of worshipping God, but were influenced by\n more worldly motives.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Many of them were wild young men, and it was difficult to\n keep them in order. Owing to this and other causes, the colony was\n sometimes on the brink of ruin. The Indians gave the settlers great\n trouble, and would probably have destroyed them, if it had not been\n for Captain John Smith.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Captain Smith was a gallant man, and had been a warrior all\n his lifetime. Before he came to Virginia, he had fought against the\n Turks, and had cut off the heads of three Turkish lords, in single\n combat. He showed himself equally valiant in his engagements\n with the Indians.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. But one day, when captain Smith was retreating from a large\n</p>\n<p>\n K of savages, lie sunk almost up to his neck in a swamp, so that\n uld neither fight nor flee.

Powhatan was rejoiced to have captain Smith in his power, for\n he had been more afraid of him than of all the other Englishmen\n together. In order to prevent any further trouble, he determined im-\n mediately to put him to death. Accordingly, captain Smith ' s hands\n were tied, and he was stretched on the ground, with his head on a\n large stone.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6.

He lifted\n the club on high for this purpose ; but just as the blow was falling,\n his daughter Pocahontas rushed forward.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.

Not long\n after war was declared, the British general Braddock marched with\n an army to attack the French at Fort < Ju Quesne. This fort stood at\n the head of the Ohio river, where Pittsburgh is now situated.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Many Virginians and other colonists were in Braddock\u2019s army.\n Colonel George Washington, then a very young man. was one of his\n aids. Washington had already acquired much warlike skill; and if\n general Braddock had taken his advice, it would have saved his own\n life, and the lives of hundreds besides.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Braddock and his army marched onward, till they were within\n about seven miles of Fort du Quesne. Thick woods were all around\n them, and the settlements of Virginia were hundreds of miles behind.\n Suddenly, a terrible volley of musketry was fired at them from be-\n hind the trees.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. General Braddock now knew that he had fallen into an ambus*\n cade of French and Indians. He galloped about, endeavoring to en\n courage his men ; but the bullets came so thick, that the bravest of\n them were appaled.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.

I shall now proceed to speak of the other colonies. The first\n settlement in New York was made in 1613, on the shores of the\n Hudson river, where Albany now stands.

Pennsylvania was settled in 1681. Its founder was William\n Penn, a Quaker, and all the earliest settlers likewise belonged to the\n sect of Quakers. When William Penn arrived in the country, he\n bought lands of the Indians, and made a treaty with them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. This treaty was always held sacred. The Indians saw that\n the Quakers were men of peace, and therefore they were careful\n never to do them any injury. There are no stories of Indian warfare\n with the Quakers of Pennsylvania.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. The province of Maryland was given by Charles the First to\n Lord Baltimore. He was a Roman Catholic, and in 1634, he brought\n over two hundred people of the same religion, and made the first\n settlement in Maryland.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. Carolina first began to be permanently settled in 1680. In\n 1729, it was divided into North and South Carolina. The first set-\n tlement in Georgia was made in 1733.

When the king of Great Britain and his ministers beheld the\n prosperous condition of the colonies, they determined to derive some\n profit from them. For this purpose, in 1765, the British parliament\n possed what was called the Stamp Act.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Their object was, to take money out of the pockets of the Ameri-\n cans for the use of the king and ministry. But the Americans were\n resolved that no king on earth should take their property, without\n their own consent.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. They made so strong an opposition to the Stamp Act, that par-\n liament was forced to repeal it. But a tax was soon afterwards laid\n on tea ; so that no American lady could give a tea-party, without\n paying a tax to England. Soldiers were sent out to America to\n compel the people to obey these unjust laws.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. In the year 1770, a quarrel took place between some of these\n soldiers and the inhabitants of Boston. A company of the British\n red-coats assembled in State street, and fired upon a crowd of un-\n armed people. Three of them fell dead in the street, and five more\n were wounded. This affair was called the Boston Massacre.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. But instead of being affrighted by this bloodshed, the people\n grew more determined in their resistance to the tyranny of England.\n In the year 1773, some ships were sent from London to the colonies,\n laden with cargoes of tea.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Three of the ships arrived in the harbor of Boston. One night,\n a number of persons went on board, in the disguise of Indians, and\n threw all the tea overboard. These Indian figures were never seen\n again; and, to this day, nobody can tell who they were.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. When tidings of this event were carried to England, the king\n and ministry saw that they could never make slaves of the Ameri-\n cans, unless by force of arms.

After the enemy evacuated Boston, general Washington marchea\n from that town to New York. Some important battles were fought\n between our troops and the British ; but Washington was finally com-\n pelled to retreat, by superior force. When winter came on, the\n American soldiers were almost naked. Wherever they marched,\n their bare feet left bloody tracks upon the frozen ground.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. But, on a dark, December night, Washington crossed the Dela-\n ware river with his troops, and marched to Trenton, in New Jersey.\n A large body of Hessian soldiers were encamped at this place.

In one of these battles, colonel Cilley, an American officer, took\n a brass cannon from the enemy with his own hands.

General Arnold, who had shown himself a very brave\n officer,, became discontented, and resolved to desert the cause of his\n country.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Pretending that his wounds rendered him unfit for active ser-\n vice, he requested that the command of West Point might be given\n him. Ttiis strong fortress was situated among the highlands, on the\n shore of < /ie Hudson river. Its loss would have been a severe mis-\n fortune to the Americans.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. No sooner had Arnold got possession of West Point, than he\n sent to Henry Clinton, the British general at New York, offering to\n surrender the fortress. Sir Henry Clinton sent a young officer, named\n Andre, to meet Arnold, and contrive the means of completing this\n treacherous business.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Major Andre had a meeting with Arnold, and they arranged the\n manner in which the fortress was to be given up to the British. Andre\n then wished to get on board the ship Vulture, which had brought\n him up the river from New York.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. But the Vulture had now sailed further down the stream, and\n it was necessary for major Andre to return by land. He therefore\n took off his uniform and put on a common coat, in order that the\n Americans might not know that he was a British officer.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Then mounting a horse, he set out on the road to New York.\n He had to pass through a part of the country that was guarded by\n the American troops ; but he travelled most of the way without any\n trouble or hindrance.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. But when major Andre reached a place called Tarry town, he\n saw three young militia men by the road-side. They came up tr\n him and seized his horse by the bridle.

But instead of that,\n he asked them where they came from.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. \u201c From down the river,\u201d they replied.

In the latter part of the war, many important events were trans-\n acted in the Southern states. In 1780, general Gates, the conqueror\n of Burgoyne, was defeated by lord Cornwallis at Camden, in South\n Carolina. Congress then sent general Green to command the army\n of the South.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. General Green had been a Quaker in his youth; but when the\n revolution broke out, he became the best officer in the American\n army, except general Washington. This was proved by his good\n conduct in the Southern states.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. He fought several battles with the British, and though he was\n sometimes compelled to retreat by the enemy\u2019s superior force, yet\n they never gained any real advantage over him. By his skill and\n valor the British troops were finally driven into the city of Charles-\n ton. After this event, there was no more trouble with the enemy in\n the South.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Lord Cornwallis, with a large army, was now in Virginia. The\n American and French troops proceeded thither to attack him. Gen-\n eral Washington had command of the whole; and, under Washing\n ton, the count de Rochambeau was commander of the French.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5 . They besieged the British at Yorktown ; for lord Cornwallis did\n not feel strong enough to meet them in the open field. The Ameri-\n cans built breastworks round about the intrenchments of the British,\n and cannonaded them night and day.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Finally, on the nineteenth of October, 1781, lord Cornwallis\n agreed to surrender his army.

Affairs of the United States since the Revolution.\n</p>\n<p>\n \\\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. When the revolutionary war was over, the people of the United\n States found it necessary to adopt a constitution of government. The\n present Federal Constitution was prepared by some of the wisest\n men in the country. It went into operation in 1789.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The good and illustrious Washington was our first president.\n He came into office in 1789, and was re-elected at the end of four\n years. In 1797, John Adams was chosen to succeed him, and be-\n came the second president of the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The most mournful event that had ever befallen America, was\n the death of Washington. It took place in 1799, when he was sixty-\n eight years old. The whole country was overwhelmed with sorrow.\n But Washington had done his work on earth, and it was fit that he\n should ascend to heaven.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The next president, after John Adams, was Thomas Jefferson.\n He served during two lerms of office, and was succeeded by James\n Madison, in 1809. The most remarkable event of Jefferson\u2019s adminis-\n tration, was the purchase of Louisiana from France, in the vear 1S03.\n This immense territory included the country between the Mississippi\n and the Rocky mountains. It was bought for fifteen millions of\n dollars. During the administration of Madison, the United States\n were on ill terms with Great Britain, and there was great reason to\n fear that hostilities would ensue.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Accordingly, on the eighteenth of June, 1812, congress made a\n delaration of war. Troops were sent to invade Canada. There\n were several gallant conflicts on the Canadian frontier; but the\n Americans did not succeed in conquering the province.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. When was peace declared ?

Other parts of the country were soon settled, chiefly by people\n from England ; but colonies were established also by Swedes, Ger-\n mans, and French. Thus the whole country along the Atlantic\n border became inhabited.

If the people become indolent, or if they be-\n come wicked, ruin and desolation will visit this land. Government\n may be compared to a house ; those who live in it must take good\n care of it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15. They must keep their doors and windows shut, to prevent\n storms from driving in. If any part decays, or is injured by a tempest,\n it must be repaired. The fires must be watched at night.

If the house is intrusted to careless, ignorant, or faithless people,\n it may take fire, and the inhabitants be burned up. Or it may decay\n and fall down upon the heads of those who dwell in it.

If careless, ignorant, or faithless ru-\n lers are chosen to take care of the country, wars and commotions may\n follow; poverty and vice may spread over the land ; ignorance and\n misery may take the place of knowledge and prosperity. Thus the\n government, which, like a house, is designed to protect us, when ill\n managed, like a house on fire, or borne down by the tempest, may be\n the cause of our ruin.\n</p>\n<p>\n 18.

The empire of Mexico contained immense riches\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. This country is in the southern part of North America. It ex\n tends across from the Gulf of Mexico to the Pacific Ocean. Its capi\n tal city, which is likewise called Mexico, is one of the most magnifi-\n cent in the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. When America was first discovered, the city of Mexico was\n even more splendid than it is now. It had stately temples and houses,\n which were profusely ornamented with gold. Its inhabitants were\n more civilized than any other natives of America.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. In the year 1519, Fernando Cortez, a Spaniard, invaded Mexico,\n with only about six hundred men. But, as his followers wore iron\n armor, and had muskets and cannon, they were able to fight whole\n armies of the Mexicans.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The emperor of Mexico was named Montezuma. He received\n Cortez and his men with great civility, for he was afraid to quarrel\n with them. But, after a short time, Cortez threw Montezuma into\n prison, and loaded him with chains.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Finding himself in so unhappy a situation, Montezuma consented\n to become a vassal of the king of Spain. But the Mexicans raised an\n insurrection, and when Montezuma endeavored to quiet them, they\n uttered shouts of scorn and anger.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. So offended were they, that they discharged arrows and stones\n at him. One arrow struck poor Montezuma in the breast, and stretched\n him on the ground. He would not suffer the wound to be dressed,\n and, in a few days, this ill-fated emperor died.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The Mexicans elected Guatimozin, son-in-law of Montezuma, to\n succeed him.

Not many years after the discovery of the West India islands,\n the Largest and finest of them were taken possession of by the Spanish\n government. The Indians were a gentle race, and were easily subju-\n gated. The Spaniards did seem to regard them as human beings,\n but rather as wild animals, who were to be exterminated. They\n shot them down by thousands, and even trained bloodhounds to pur-\n sue them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. In this way, the numerous islanders who once swarmed like\n bees upon every hill-side and in every valley of these beautiful regions,\n were reduced to a very small number. Most of these were treated\n like slaves, and many of them were compelled to work in mines, where\n they soon perished from hard labor, to which they were unaccustom-\n ed, and for want of that free air which Heaven had sent them before\n the Europeans came to deprive them of it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Thus, by degrees, the native West Indians vanished, and their\n fair lands came into the possession of various European governments.\n Spain held Cuba and Porto Rico in her firm grasp.

This fine\n island was discovered by Columbus on his first voyage, and here he\n left a part of his men, who made the first European settlement on this\n side of the Atlantic. The island was called Hayti by the natives, and\n Hispaniola by the Spaniards. The settlement increased rapidly, and\n soon the whole island became subject to Spain.

But the negro slaves had become much more numerous than\n the white inhabitants, and, in 1791, they rose against their masters.\n France, at this time, was in a state of revolution, and could afford no\n aid to put down the insurrection. The negroes therefore slaughtered\n the white people by thousands, pillaging their houses^ and then set-\n ting them on fire. A few escaped, but a large proportion were\n killed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4.

Before I leave the West Indies, I must say a few words about\n the buccaneers, a famous set of sea-robbers, who infested these\n islands during the seventeenth century. These at first consisted of\n men from England and France, who settled on the western coast of\n St. Domingo and the neighboring island of Tortuga, about the year\n 1630\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. For a while, they lived by hunting wild animals, but when they\n became numerous, they procured vessels, and went forth upon the\n sea to rob and plunder whomsoever they might meet. This business\n succeeded so well, that a great many desperate adventurers from all\n parts of Europe united themselves to the buccaneers. They therefore\n procured larger vessels, which were equipped in the best manner for\n attack. These were filled with daring seamen, and commanded by\n bold leaders.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. In this manner the buccaneers became very formidable. Their\n vessels hovered in the track of the merchant ships, ready, like hawks\n in the neighborhood of a barnyard, to pounce down upon whatever\n might come in their way. They often captured ships laden with rich\n merchandise, and sometimes with gold and silver.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. In this way, they amassed great wealth ; and such was their\n power at one time, that they made successful attacks upon large\n cities, sometimes pillaging the inhabitants, and sometimes laying\n them under contribution. But, at length, the European governments\n were roused, by the violence and cruelty of these robbers, to measures\n of retaliation. They sent large vessels to cruise in the neighborhood\n of the West Indies, and after many struggles, the buccaneers were\n finally exterminated.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9.

There are three divisions of Oceania. Those Islands which lie\n in the Indian Ocean, near the continent of Asia, are called Malaysia.\n The largest of them are Borneo, Sumatra, and Java. Scarcely any-\n thing has been written about the history of Malaysia, for the islands\n are chiefly inhabited by the natives, who keep no record of passing\n events, and have no desire to know the deeds of their forelathers.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4.

They contracted so many diseases, that their\n numbers were reduced from four hundred thousand to less than a\n hundred and fifty thousand. There was reason to fear that the\n islands would be depopulated.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. Some American missionaries crossed the ocean, in hopes to\n save these poor islanders from destruction. They preached the Gos-\n pel to them, and established schools, in which the natives were\n taught to read the Bible.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. Kaahumana, the queen-regent of the Sandwich islands, adopted\n the Christian religion. By her assistance, the missionaries met with\n great success. A number of schools were established.

But Kaahumana died a few years since, and her death was a\n great misfortune to the Sandwich islands. Many of the natives re-\n lapsed into their former vices.

The brig Bounty, belonging to the British navy, was\n sent to the Society islands in order to carry bread-fruit trees from\n thence to the West Indies. Her commander was lieutenant William\n Bligh.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. He arrived at Otaheite in 1788. His crew were delighted with\n tne island. The air was balmy and full of sunshine. Fruits grew\n abundantly on every tree. There was no need of toiling for bread,\n since there were trees enough which produced it ready made, and\n almost as good as if it had been baked.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The natives of Otaheite received the Englishmen with kindness.\n The women behaved with great affection towards the poor storm-\n beaten sailors. In short, the crew spent their time so pleasantly,\n that they were very reluctant to depart.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. They desired to spend their whole lives in these sunny islands,\n instead of wandering any more over the wide and dreary sea. When\n the Bounty sailed, they cast many a sad glance at the pleasant shores\n which they were leaving. They had not sailed many days, before\n they formed a resolution to return.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. A young man by the name of Christian was an officer on board\n the Bounty. He was not on good terms with lieutenant Bligh, and\n he incited the crew to mutiny against their commander, and take\n possession of the vessel.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. One morning, before sunrise, Christian and his associates entered\n lieutenant Bligh\u2019s cabin, while he was asleep. They bound his\n hands behind his back, threatening him with death if he made the\n least resistance. He was then put into a leaky boat, with eighteen\n other persons, who refused to join in the mutiny.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9.

In the\n year 1813, a British ship of war was sailing from the Marquesas\n islands to the port of Valparaiso, in South America. The captain of\n the vessel was Sir Thomas Staines. In the course of his voyage, he\n happened to cast anchor off Pitcairn\u2019s island.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. This small island lies many leagues to the southwest of Ota-\n heite. It was first discovered by captain Carteret, in 1767 ; but very\n few people h-ad since visited it, for it produced no valuable commodi-\n ties, and it was supposed to be uninhabited.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. But, as Sir Thomas Staines looked from the deck of his vessel\n to the shore, he was amazed to perceive that the island was culti-\n vated, and that there were small houses on it. These houses were\n better built than those of the savages generally are, and they looked\n somethin \" like the dwellings of poor people in England.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. While Sir Thomas Staines and his sailors were wondering at\n these circumstances, a small boat put off from the shore. The\n waves rolled very high, but the boat skimmed like a sea-bird over\n the tops of them, and soon came along side of the vessel.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The boat was rowed by two young men.

Sir Thomas Staines asked them who\n they were, and how they came to be living on that lonely island.\n The mystery was soon explained.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. When Christian and his companions left Otaheite, they had\n steered for Pitcairn\u2019s island, and had run the Bounty on the rocks and\n set her on fire.

I will now give you some account of the origin of government,\n architecture, and other things. At the present day, some nations aie\n governed in one way and some in another. In this country, the\n people are governed by rulers of their own choice, and according to a\n constitution of their own formation. This nation is therefore called\n a Republic.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Some nations are governed by kings or emperors, who rule ac-\n cording to their own will. These are called despotic monarchies.\n Other nations are ruled by kings or emperors, whose power is re-\n strained by legislative assemblies, who make laws for the country.\n These are called limited monarchies.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. In very early ages, there were no kings or emperors. A father\n would rule over his family, or a grandfather would rule over all his\n descendants. This kind of government was called patriarchal. It\n existed before the flood, and continued in some parts of Asia long after\n that event.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. But when the people became divided into nations, they went to\n war with each other. The boldest and strongest man would become\n the leader. Having the soldiers at his command he would acquire\n great power, and become a king or chief. As the people became\n rich, he would build palaces and live in great pomp.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. When a king conquered several nations he would be styled em-\n peror. Thus you perceive that the rulers went on acquiring power,\n until they made slaves of the people. In Europe and Asia, nearly all\n the nations are governed by kings or emperors.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. At various times, the people have become tired of being gov-\n erned by selfish monarchs, and have established governments for\n themselves. In ancient G-reece and Rome, the people threw off the\n yoke of their tyrant kings, and for a time enjoyed freedom. But it\n always happened that ambitious men have led the people astray and\n enslaved them. It is to be hoped that the Americans will not thus\n part with their liberty.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. In looking round upon the world, and observing the multitude\n of cities filled with beautiful buildings, you would hardly imagine\n that mankind once dwelt in huts, grottos, caverns, and tents; yet\n 6uch was the case in early ages.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. But as people grew more civilized, they made themselves more\n comfortable houses. At first they were of stone or wood, rudely put\n together ; but after a time they learned to make them more neatly.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. Having pretty good houses for themselves, they began to erect\n temples for their gods. Thus architecture was improved and became\n a great art. The ancient Egyptians, Babylonians, Assyrians, Persians,\n and Phoenicians filled their cities with splendid edifices. But of all\n the ancients, the Greeks built the most pleasing and elegant struc\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0311/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 254, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 440}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0311/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 508, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 880}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0311/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1017, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1761}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0311/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2034, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3522}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0311/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/pe/te/rp/ar/le/ys/co/mm/00/go/od/_0/peterparleyscomm00good_0/peterparleyscomm00good_0_0311.jp2", "height": 3522, "width": 2034, "levels": 6, "size": 401063}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"311\">\n<p>\n T\n</p>\n<p>\n GENERAL VIEWS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 309\n</p>\n<p>\n tures. The Romans carrying 1 their conquests over the civilized\n world, copied and combined the architecture of different countries.\n Many of their edifices were exceedingly splendid, but not so chaste\n and beautiful as those of the Greeks.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. Agriculture was one of the first arts of man. The Bible tells\n us, that Cain was a tiller of the ground, and that Noah was a hus-\n bandman, and planted a vineyard. For many ages, agriculture was\n almost the only art practised by mankind.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. The Chinese, Japanese, Chaldeans, Egyptians, and Phoenicians,\n held husbandry in high estimation, in the earliest ages. The Greeks\n had but few farming tools; but the Romans used a great variety.\n They particularly venerated the plough.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. The first mention made of nations trading together appears in\n the book of Genesis, chapter 38: 25, when Joseph\u2019s brethren sold him\n to a band of Ishmaelites, who were conveying spices, balm, and myrrh\n into Egypt. The balm was from Gilead, and the myrrh was the pro-\n duce of Arabia. They were going through the land of Canaan into\n Egypt, which was then a highly cultivated kingdom.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. The central situation of Egypt made it the ancient emporium\n of commerce. By caravans, the treasures of Asia and Africa were\n brought thither. Trade was always held in esteem, because of the\n wealth it brought. Tyre and Sidon, cities of Phoenicia, were early\n devoted to commerce ; and Solomon carried on an extensive trade\n with them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. The Greeks had great commerce along the borders of the\n Mediterranean Sea. The Carthaginians were also a highly commer-\n cial people. The Romans preferred acquiring wealth by conquest\n and plunder, rather than by trade. Of all modern nations, Great\n Britain is the most commercial.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15. I have not space to tell you the history of music, painting and\n sculpture. Egypt was the birth-place of the arts and sciences, but\n most of the great nations of antiquity made some progress in them.\n The most beautiful specimens of sculpture in existence are those pro\n duced by Greek artists, at least two thousand years ago. In painting\n the modem Italians have excelled all other nations.\n</p>\n<p>\n the am\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0312/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 254, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 440}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0312/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 508, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 880}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0312/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1017, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1761}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0312/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2034, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3522}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0312/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/pe/te/rp/ar/le/ys/co/mm/00/go/od/_0/peterparleyscomm00good_0/peterparleyscomm00good_0_0312.jp2", "height": 3522, "width": 2034, "levels": 6, "size": 165026}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"312\">\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0313/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 254, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 440}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0313/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 508, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 880}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0313/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1017, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1761}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0313/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2034, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3522}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:te:rp:ar:le:ys:co:mm:00:go:od:_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0:peterparleyscomm00good_0_0313/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/pe/te/rp/ar/le/ys/co/mm/00/go/od/_0/peterparleyscomm00good_0/peterparleyscomm00good_0_0313.jp2", "height": 3522, "width": 2034, "levels": 6, "size": 453672}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"313\">\n<p>\n RICHARDSON ' S ENGLISH DICTIONARY.,\n</p>\n<p>\n A New Dictionary of the English Language, by CHARLES RICHARDSON\n</p>\n<p>\n 2 volumes quarto, 2295 pages. Price, $12.\n</p>\n<p>\n Richardson\u2019s English Dictionary is acknowledged to be the great The-*\n taurus of English Philology and Lexicography. Its character as a work of\n standard authority is so well established, that few scholars or professional men\n will deem their libraries complete without it. Whatever other dictionaries a\n gentleman may have, he needs that of Richardson, for its ample chronological\n quotations from the older authors. These quotations give to any one who will\n consult them, the key by which he may learn for himself the true meaning and\n history of words, without relying implicitly upon the dictum of a lexicogra-\n pher. To Authors, Teachers, Professors in Colleges, Divines, Jurists, Physi-\n cians ; to gentlemen, in short, of every description, who wish to form or defend\n their opinions on original rather than second-hand authority, this work seems to\n be one of indispensable necessity. There is no profession in which important\n questions do not arise, depending for their solution upon the precise meaning of\n some particular word. This meaning can be settled only by usage, and usage is\n to be ascertained not by the opinions of Johnson, or Walker, or Webster, but\n by copious quotations from the old standard authors. The work of Richardson,\n consisting of over two thousand closely printed and compact pages, filled with\n pertinent extracts from the very fountain-heads of English literature, furnishes\n to the thoughtful student an immense storehouse of materials for the formation\n of original and independent opinions.\n</p>\n<p>\n In addition to this, which is perhaps the most striking feature of the book, the\n New English Dictionary is believed to be the most complete work extant on\n English Etymologies. The elaborate preface, setting forth the general princi-\n ples of comparative philology, shows in the strongest light the learning and\n \u201cconsiderate diligence\u201d of the author; while, under eac-h word, the careful\n array of its various forms in the different cognate dialects, gives to the student\n not only an inspiring confidence in the abilities of his guide, but the means of\n original research, hitherto requiring numerous and expensive works of refer-\n ence. In fact, the etymologies and the quotations combined, put it in the power\n of a mere English scholar to investigate for himself many important points, the\n truth of which he has been obliged hitherto to take entirely upon trust.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00ab A Dictionary such as perhaps no other language could ever boast.\u201d \u2014 London\n Quarterly Review.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c A valuable contribution to the accessible stores of English philology.\u201d\u2014\n North American Review.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c It embraces every desideratum in an English Dictionary.\u201d \u2014 Southern Literary\n Messenger.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00bb / t , *\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00ab Le plus savant, le plus consciencteux, le plus complet des dictionnaires do\n la langue Anglaise qui aient paru jusqu\u2019ici.\u201d \u2014 Courier des Etats Unis.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThis Dictionary is a mine of wealth m English literature, and shows oo\n every page the immense erudition of its author.\u201d \u2014 National Gazette.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00ab The most important work which has ever issued from the American press '\n \u2014 .

Its claims upon the\n confidence of the public are threefold :\n 1st. The admirable Greek and Ger-\n man Lexicon of Schneider, has been\n used as a basis by Dr Donnegan.\n Those who are acquainted with the\n unrivalled excellence of Schneider,\n will consider this fact no small recom-\n mendation. 2d. The English compiler\n is evidently a thorough scholar ; and\n even in his first edition, produced a\n work far superior to any before pub-\n lished in England. 3d. The American\n editor has long stood among the most\n distinguished men of letters in our\n country; and is well known, in par-\n ticular, for his masterly knowledge of\n Greek. He here gives the work a\n thorough revision; and, in many re-\n spects, renders it a more useful and\n</p>\n<p>\n practical lexicon than it was before.\n It has evidently been prepared with\n scrupulous and laborious fidelity.\n</p>\n<p>\n As far as my examination has gone,\n the typographical execution is very\n correct. I doubt not it will speedily\n and generally be adopted ; not only by\n tyros, but by those in mature life,\n who are desirous of renewing or re-\n viving the classical studies of youth.\n</p>\n<p>\n With great respect, your obedient\n servant, C.

For this purpose, the\n existing editions, English and American, have been collated, and their mistakes\n carefully corrected. The errors that have been found, in the course of tnis\n collation, are such as almost to stagger belief. These errors appear to have\n been creeping in for the last half century, each edition repeating the mistakes\n of its predecessors, and no general recension of the text being made, until much\n of the value of the work, as a standard of the language, was lost.

HART, A. M., Principal of the Philadelphia High School. 109\n pages 12mo. Price 38 cents.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the preparation of this work no special attempt has been made at\n novelty. The author\u2019s aim has been chiefly to make a careful and accurate\n digest of those principles of the language which have been remarked by\n previous writers, and to state those principles with precision and perspicuity.\n At the same time, the work is believed to contain many observations that are\n new, and a satisfactory solution of many difficulties not solved in other works\n on the subject. Unusual pains have been taken in preparing the parts intended\n to be committed to memory ; viz., the Rules and the Definitions. In respect to\n these, it is believed, the qualities of clearness, brevity, and accuracy, have\n been attained in a higher degree than in any work on the subject heretofore\n offered to the public. Special care has been used also to distinguish by the\n typography the parts which are elementary from those which are not. By this\n means a large amount of matter is brought within a small compass, and the\n character and relative importance of the various parts of the text are indicated\n clearly to the eye. At the bottom of each page are questions and exercises on\n all the matter contained in that page. This gives great facility in hearing large\n classes, as it prevents the necessity of referring back and forth from the\n question to the answer. The questions are so prepared as to facilitate the des-\n patch of lessons to those teachers who have large and numerous classes, and at\n the same time they are of a suggestive character, suited to the wants of those\n who wish to vary the exercises from time to time. No pains, in short, have\n been spared to make the work, both in regard to the matter and the mechanical\n arrangements, such as seems to be required by the wants of the learner and the\n present advanced state of grammatical knowledge.\n</p>\n<p>\n The work has been adopted as a text book by the Controllers of the Public\n Schools of Philadelphia, by the Ward School Teachers\u2019 Association of New\n York, and by a large number of other Schools, public and private. It it\n recommended in strong terms by great numbers of superintendents of public\n schools, and professors and teachers of the highest standing in every part ot\n the United States.

No\n term is given until the student is impressed with the want of a word, to express\n an idea already received; so that the memory ia not fatigued, at the very com-\n mencement of the study, with a long list of words, and abstract definitions,\n which he has no means of fixing in his mind by association.\n</p>\n<p>\n A text-book on Physiology has been anxiously sought for by the leading\n teachers and professors of our country ; but it has been supposed that, desirable\n as such knowledge must be for those who are charged with the care of the\n young, there is something in the nature of the study, rendering it unfit for intro\n duction into seminaries for young ladies. The error of this opinion is most\n clearly shown in the work now offered to the public. It contains not a word\n that can be regarded as objectionable by the most fastidious delicacy.\n</p>\n<p>\n COATES ' S NATURAL PHILOSOPHY.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n First Lines of Natural Philosophy, divested of mathematical formulae : being a\n practical and lucid Introduction to the study of the Science; designed for the\n use of Schools and Academies, and for readers generally, who have not been\n trained to the study of the exact sciences, and for those who wish to enter\n understandingly upon the study of the mixed sciences. By REYNELL\n COATES, M. D., Author of Physiology for Schools. Illustrated by 204 cuts.\n 402 pages I2mo. Price, 75 cents.\n</p>\n<p>\n Unlike most works designed for a similar purpose, this volume is not a cora\n pilation merely. The author has evidently considered the Capacities and taste*)\n of his audience, matured his plan, and mastered all the necessary relations of\n his theme before putting pen to paper ; then, with the whole subject before\n him, and considering his pupil as utterly ignorant of the first principles of\n nature, he begins as though addressing the extremely young; and, throughout\n the entire work, he nowhere oversteps the ability of the pupil. Not a technical\n term is used unless fully and clearly explained, and no previous mathematical\n knowledge is demanded of the student ; although the reader is drawn, by light\n and easy, but logical and orderly stages, from the consideration of the simplest\n accidents of every-day life, to the comprehension of some of the grandest phe-\n nomena connected with astronomy.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is one of the peculiarities of this writer, that whatever he attempts te.\n tench, he teaches thoroughly; and while the appendix of well-digested ques-\n tions and references, greatly increases the value of the work to the practical\n preceptor of children acquiring the rudiments of education, its text will -ender\n it scarcely less valuable to the youth about commencing the study of the exacr\n \u2022ctences, the man of liberal information, and even the professional teacher.\n</p>\n<p>\n PUBLISHED BY E.

By E. OTIS KEN-\n DALL, Professor of Mathematics and Astronomy in the Central High School\n of Philadelphia, and Member of the American Philosophical Society. The\n Uranography contains 365 pages 12mo., with nine fine Engravings. The\n Atlas is in 4to., and contains eighteen large Maps. Price of the Uranography\n and Atlas, $1.25.\n</p>\n<p>\n A great obstacle to the study of Uranography heretofore has been the diffi-\n culty of transferring to the heavens themselves, the ideas acquired in studying\n the maps. There was so much in the map that was not in the heavens, that it\n was extremely difficult for a beginner to conceive the one to be in any respect\n the representative of the other. A celestial map or globe, crowded with highly-\n colored pictures of birds, and beasts, and four-footed animals, and creeping\n things, might well look, to the eye of the uninitiated, more like the show-bill of\n a menagerie than a picture of the starry heavens. In the present work, how-\n ever, while a faint outline of the old constellations is preserved for the sake of\n their historical associations, prominence is given in the maps to that which is\n prominent in the heavens, viz., to the stars themselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n This feature of the work is made yet more striking by the introduction of\n another, of a character altogether novel. Not only are the objects which are\n not seen in the heavens, excluded from the maps, but the heavens themselves\n are represented more nearly in their true color. Instead of making, as hereto-\n fore, the stars black and the sky white, the groundwork of the map is here the\n deep blue of heavenly space, while the stars are a brilliant, spotless white. Such\n a representation of the subject seems to be the one least likely to confuse the\n mind of the student, when, from a contemplation of his Celestial Atlas, he turns\n to contemplate the august scene which it represents.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c This work, with its eighteen maps, is abundant, in the hands of a competent\n teacher, to create pure pleasures which shall be renewed and deepened through\n .ife.\u201d \u2014 Rev.
