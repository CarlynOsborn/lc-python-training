And now it has come to\n pass that even in France, evangelical Christians\n may not only enjoy their own religion without the\n danger of oppression from the government, but\n may go abroad through the whole length and\n breadth of the land, circulating in open daylight\n the Word of Life, and calling upon sinners with-\n out distinction to be reconciled to God.\n</p>\n<p>\n And what is true of France, in this respect, is\n true, in a greater or less degree, of most or all\n the other countries which this work contemplates.\n But a little while since, each of these countries\n had an iron door that was locked and barred\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:de:li:ve:re:di:00:sp:ra:_0:sermondeliveredi00spra_0:sermondeliveredi00spra_0_0033/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 289, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 498}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:de:li:ve:re:di:00:sp:ra:_0:sermondeliveredi00spra_0:sermondeliveredi00spra_0_0033/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 579, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 997}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:de:li:ve:re:di:00:sp:ra:_0:sermondeliveredi00spra_0:sermondeliveredi00spra_0_0033/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1994}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:de:li:ve:re:di:00:sp:ra:_0:sermondeliveredi00spra_0:sermondeliveredi00spra_0_0033/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2319, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3989}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:de:li:ve:re:di:00:sp:ra:_0:sermondeliveredi00spra_0:sermondeliveredi00spra_0_0033/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/se/rm/on/de/li/ve/re/di/00/sp/ra/_0/sermondeliveredi00spra_0/sermondeliveredi00spra_0_0033.jp2", "height": 3989, "width": 2319, "levels": 6, "size": 477156}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"33\">\n<p>\n 33\n</p>\n<p>\n against all evangelical influence from without;\n and if any Christian assayed to do the work of\n the Lord on this forbidden ground, he knew well\n that he did it at the hazard of a martyr\u2019s death.\n There were dungeons there forming the very\n anti-chamber of hell, into which such persons\n were liable to be thrown ; there were engines of\n torture there, befitting only the prison of despair,\n to which they were liable to be brought; and\n human wisdom could not discover by what means\n a different economy was to be introduced.
