It is not such a mixed currency as the country\n had in the crises of 1837 and 1857, \u2014 had it been, the con-\n sequences to the public would have been similar, \u2014 but a\n paper currency, redeemable not in specie, but the irre-\n deemable notes of the government ; a circulation whose\n final payment, in that manner, is guaranteed by the national\n treasury. But the striking fact in regard to the present\n system is, that, while the notes of these banks are thus\n made secure, their deposits, often twice as large in amount,\n are left without any guarantee whatever, and consequently\n certain to be called for in case of any serious alarm. This\n was the vulnerable point ; yet the banks had acquired a\n large amount of public confidence, from the fact that they\n had existed some ten years, and yet no general panic or\n revulsion had occurred. It was argued, therefore, with\n much plausibility, that the existing currency, composed of\n legal-tender and bank notes, was, in fact, the best, safest,\n and most convenient the nation had ever known, and it\n had come to be regarded with general complacency. The\n developments of the last few months have greatly changed\n all this ; for the public mind has been brought to realize\n that the present circulating medium is equally unreliable,\n and more disastrous in its perturbations than the mixed\n currency of former times ; since, under the previous system,\n when a general suspension took place, the banks could and\n did at once increase their loans, extend their issues, relieve\n the pressure, and reduce the rate of interest ; but in the\n present instance the national banks* not only stopped\n making loans, but refused even to pay their deposits in\n their own notes or any other!\n</p>\n<p>\n This state of things gave rise to the issue by the banks\n of certified checks, certificates of deposit, clearing-house\n certificates, and other similar instruments, as substitutes\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0013/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 303, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0013/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 607, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0013/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1215, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0013/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2430, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0013/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0013.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2430, "levels": 6, "size": 525675}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"13\">\n<p>\n PREFACE.\n</p>\n<p>\n V\n</p>\n<p>\n Jbr the ordinary circulation, to the amount, it is estimated,\n of one hundred million dollars.

This has placed the home manufact-\n urer at a great disadvantage as compared with his foreign\n competitor. To reduce tariff duties therefore, under such\n circumstances, must manifestly prove highly injurious to\n American industry, and be very unjust on the part of the\n government, since it compels the manufacturer to use an\n incorrect measure of value, by which the cost of his products\n is greatly increased.

High duties are an obvious necessity\n at present to counterbalance the effects of a defective cur-\n rency. In consequence of this, the government is placed\n in the dilemma, that, if it does not revise the tariff and\n make it consistent with the interests of the commerce and\n industry of the country, the nation must suffer ; while if it\n attempts to do this, the currency remaining in excess as at\n present, competition with foreign countries will be rendered\n impossible.\n</p>\n<p>\n The conclusion from these facts would seem to be, that,\n since both objects are in themselves desirable, a contraction\n of the currency should be made to take place simultaneously\n with the reduction of the tariff ; so that as the duties decline,\n the cost of production may be reduced, and the manufacturer\n enabled to carry on his operations to advantage.\n</p>\n<p>\n The two measures being thus effected contemporaneously,\n both would be secured with the least possible disturbance to\n the business of the country.

the wealth which the debt represents\n has been spent in war, 354. \u2014 If debt is wealth, repudiation would\n destroy wealth; not so; again, \u201c debt is active capital;\u201d govern-\n ment debt, like individual, can be hypothecated to obtain capital, 355.\n \u2014 Again, it \u201c gives stability to government;

But they arise from his nature. They are\n a certain and constantly operating force. They commence\n with man\u2019s existence, and terminate only with his life:\n and, when all the desires of the individual are satisfied in\n the grave, and his labor paralyzed, the wealth he lays down\n in deaths becomes the possession of other men, with full\n strength and fresh desires ; and so the creation of wealth\n goes on in ever-increasing circles, expanded by the central\n force, \u2014 the wants of man. While the individual awakens\n but slowly to the consciousness of his needs, gradually\n exhausts his activity in supplying them, and finally resigns\n all as he passes from life, we find that the sum of such\n wants and energies experiences no diminution by an atom,\n no suspension for an instant. Differing as these do in the\n individual, they are, in the world, as well ascertained and\n determinate as the facts on which any other science rests.\n</p>\n<p>\n While the one element of wants or desires is secured in\n the constitution of man\u2019s being, the other element \u2014 viz.,\n the relation of effort or labor to them \u2014 is fixed in the con-\n stancy of nature, and the permanence we attribute to the\n created world, \u2014 a foundation sure enough to build upon.\n</p>\n<p>\n If, on the one hand, man\u2019s being were so constituted that\n his wants should cease, or be intermitted without any reason\n at the time, and without any assurance of return, or prove\n too weak to move the activities towards their satisfaction ;\n or, on the other, nature were so disposed that labor had no\n guaranty of reward, resulting indifferently in good to the\n laborer, or in nothingness, or in positive injury to him\n who performs it, \u2014 we could have no science (f political\n economy.\n</p>\n<p>\n But, as man\u2019s being and nature\u2019s laws are found in expe-\n rience, political economy is to be regarded as a positive sci-\n ence.

It is adduced as an illustra-\n tion of the laws of value, or of the supposed disturbance of\n those laws; and, as he gives a more full and satisfactory\n explanation of the cause of value in a diamond than any\n other writer, we shall quote his words : \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI take a walk along the sea-beach, and I find by chance a\n magnificent diamond. I am thus put in possession of great value.\n Why ? Am I about to confer a great benefit on the human race ?\n Have I devoted myself to a long and laborious work? Neither the\n one or the other. But, undoubtedly, because the person to whom I\n transfer it considers that I have rendered him a great service, \u2014 all\n the greater that many rich men desire it, and I alone can render it.\n The grounds of his judgment may be controverted. Be it so. It\n may be founded in pride or vanity. Granted again. But this\n judgment has nevertheless been formed by a man who is disposed\n to act upon it, and that is sufficient for my argument. Far from\n the judgment being based on a reasonable appreciation of utility,\n we may allow that the very reverse is the case. Ostentation makes\n great sacrifices for what is utterly useless. In this case, the value,\n far from bearing a necessary proportion to the labor performed by\n the person who renders the service, may be said rather to bear\n proportion to the labor saved to the person who receives it. This\n general law, which has not, so far as I know, been observed by\n theoretical writers, nevertheless prevails universally in practice.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018\u2018The transaction relative to the diamond may be supposed to\n give rise to the following dialogue : \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018 Give me your diamond, sir.*\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018 With all my heart.

Utility remains fast-anchored\n in the wants of man and the properties of matter. This\n is the primary fact. But value moves again, \u2014 not to in-\n crease, but to multiply. Values are no greater, but there\n are more of them. The factor that multiplies is the ever-\n growing wants of man. Now, utility begins to move, ex-\n panding with the enlargement of man\u2019s activities, and the\n increase of the fruits of labor. Here we have the promise\n that the human race is destined tor a constant augmentation\n of utilities, bringing in a great amelioration of its condition.\n Man is relieved from part of his labor only to feel new\n wants, and so, through fresh efforts, to find greater satis-\n factions in life.\n</p>\n<p>\n Political economy makes no inquiry whether the increase\n of material objects of desire is, in truth and on the whole,\n a good. It assumes this. It leaves to others the discussion\n whether the highest interests of society are attained by\n repelling the kindness of Nature, and by denying the in-\n stincts of man. This kindness, and those instincts, politi-\n cal economy accepts, and goes forward from them. It can\n never become stoic. It is not a science, unless wealth is a\n good.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is a science ; and it has no doubt that the healthful,\n honest increase of physical necessaries, comforts, luxuries,\n and refinements, with the opportunities which they bring for\n mental improvement and moral culture, with the safeguards\n they place upon social order and personal rights, and with\n the manifold strong and subtile motives which they contri-\n bute to the exertion of all the human faculties, and the full,\n friendly intercourse of all communities and peoples, \u2014 it\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0064/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 298, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 510}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0064/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 596, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1021}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0064/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1193, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2043}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0064/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2387, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4086}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0064/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0064.jp2", "height": 4086, "width": 2387, "levels": 6, "size": 563903}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"64\">\n<p>\n 1C\n</p>\n<p>\n DEFINITIONS.\n</p>\n<p>\n [book I.\n</p>\n<p>\n has no doubt that this is desirable.

It takes without inquiry the uni-\n versal inclination to the accumulation of wealth, under the\n restraints of mutual duties and common rights.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have said that Nature adds value to nothing. Though\n unceasingly at work for man, she receives no compensation.\n She creates utilities beyond computation, but does all gra-\n tuitously. Wind, water, and steam are most efficiently\n engaged in producing commodities necessary to the welfare\n of mankind ; and the earth is unceasingly active to bring\n forth man\u2019s food in its many forms. Yet all is done with-\n out adding to the wealth of the world. The forces \u201c work\n for nothing,\u201d and hence confer no value. The power of\n ffie wind, for example, in propelling vessels, adds no value\n to the articles transported. But, it may be objected, would\n it not cost a great deal more to transport that merchandise,\n if it had to be done by human hands working at the oar ?\n Certainly ; and, from the very illustration, it appears that\n the power of the wind has not increased the value, but\n rather diminished it. It has taken the slaves from the\n bench, and does the merchant\u2019s rowing for him. It is Na-\n ture\u2019s work, not man\u2019s labor ; and hence value goes down,\n while utility stands fast.\n</p>\n<p>\n Transportation does, indeed, add to the value, but only\n because man\u2019s vessels and man\u2019s labor are employed in\n effecting it. All the natural forces that come in take off\n from value. If a merchant were to make a charge for the\n use of his vessel, the payment of his hands, and the ordi-\n nary rate of profit on his voyage, and, besides these, for the\n use of the wind, it would not be allowed. Competition\n would correct his philosophy ; and the eloquence of unsold\n merchandise would be his teacher in the theory of value.\n Take steam for an example in point.

Without plun-\n ging into the deep questions of ethnical differences, or\n compensations in the whole of character, it is yet evident\n beyond discussion, that the active powers of every people\n have something of their own which they do not fully share\n with others. Were all the nations of the earth possessed\n of mental, moral, and physical qualities which could be\n positively estimated to be, in the sum of them, equal, it is\n quite certain that they would be far from similar: their\n energies would develop in different lines towards different\n objects. Patience and a kind of business faith distinguish\n some peoples, mark their features, and are impressed dis-\n tinctly in the results of industry. Activity and daring spec-\n ulation no less characterize others.

He works by the side\n of the agriculturist, helping how best to direct the labor of\n the farm. Here the chemist produces value. He works by\n the side of the manufacturer, with lubricants and solvents,\n removing obstacles which no muscular strength could shake ;\n and here, again, he produces values. He may, also, labor\n by the side of the merchant, making much cunning use of\n Nature ; and here, again, he produces values, in the form\n of transportation.

The juggler is not\n more remarkable for the nice use of his muscles, than is an\n accomplished mechanic at his bench. The powers of his\n body are in perfect discipline.

This is to the mental powers what the first is to\n the bodily. It gives intellectual dexterity. The man has a\n mastery of his special operation. He knows more about it\n than if he had two things to think of and care for. He\n becomes shrewd in every motion. He adapts his labor to\n the material; he discriminates between the qualities of\n that material. He meets the little difficulties of his work\n with more skill and less waste.

And, even where we suppose a\n laborer to be engaged in two operations only, there is still\n a loss inflicted, just as often as he has occasion to leave one\n for another. It is not a loss alone of the time physically\n necessary in effecting the transition, but each operation will\n leave something to harass the mind in the otlier.

The shadow is cast both\n ways upon the mind. '\n</p>\n<p>\n 4th, It facilitates the invention of tools and machines. If\n a treasure of gold or iron or oil is hid under the ground, the\n discoverer is more apt, other things being equal, to be the\n man who owns the land, and resides and works on it, than\n a casual visitor. So, if there is a possibility of adapting\n foreign forces to the production of values, the inventor will,\n on the same condition, more probably be the workman than\n any one else ; he is constantly engaged upon the operation ;\n he desires, of course, to simplify it, since it is a law of mind\n to do as little work as possible for a certain result; he\n knows the wants of the subject ; he knows all the capabili-\n ties of his material ; he thinks about it all the time, and can\n try an experiment without changing his place. Therefore,\n by the logic of Nature, he invents. And, in fact, few of the\n great aids to industry have been discovered by disinter-\n ested science. They came from the laboring brain of the\n mechanic. Where the work was almost too delicate for\n human eyes, a thousand iron fingers go around to do it,\n never losing their nimbleness, nor ever getting weary ;\n where the work was too great for human strength, monster\n arms swing^ the hammer, or toss the load in air.\n</p>\n<p>\n The liistory of American manufactures expounds the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0084/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 298, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 510}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0084/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 596, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1021}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0084/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1193, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2043}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0084/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2387, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4086}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0084/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0084.jp2", "height": 4086, "width": 2387, "levels": 6, "size": 524181}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"84\">\n<p>\n PRODUCTION.\n</p>\n<p>\n [book II.\n</p>\n<p>\n phrase, \u201c Necessity is the mother of invention.\u2019\u2019 Even tlie\n slaves of the South have been directed to important mechan-\n ical discoveries, in the way we have described.

All capi-\n tal is wealth, but all wealth is not capital. The very use\n of the term reproduction \u201d testifies to the feeling of man\n that the object of any thing is not ftilfilled in its own creation\n or perfection, but that there is an endless series of propa-\n gations, with a constant view, and with increasing force, to\n some ulterior end. And we find that production does go\n forward, not by the increase alone of the laboring class, not\n by mere annual savings and gross accumulation, but by the\n employment of that which before was an object of desire in\n itself, as now a means to the gratification of new desires.\n Since it is recognized that human wants create others of\n their kind, and hence go on increasing in number and ur-\n gency, it is necessary that human efforts should find some\n force having a corresponding rate of increase, by which to\n assist themselves in supplying the growing demand. Such\n an agent is found in capital, which is taken out of wealth.\n</p>\n<p>\n A man may have much wealth, and use little capital.\n Wealth is as it is had; capital, as it is used. For example, a\n man may live in a house worth thirty thousand dollars, and\n have ten thousand dollars invested in a ship, from which he\n derives all his support, and which forms his capital. It\n may be asked. Is not the house itself capital ? It is so far\n as necessary to production, in sheltering the producer and\n his family, even with the style and comfort usual to such a\n degree of society. Beyond this, it ceases to be capital. It\n is devoted, not to the creation of values, but to personal\n enjoyment and culture ; noble and worthy ends for wealth,\n but not for capital.\n</p>\n<p>\n We may change the supposition. The man may have a\n house worth ten thousand dollars, and ships to the value of\n thirty thousand dollars. The difference to production will\n be apparent, inasmuch as his active capital now consists of\n three-fourths of his wealth, while before it was only one-\n fourth.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0104/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 298, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 510}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0104/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 596, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1021}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0104/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1193, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2043}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0104/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2387, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4086}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0104/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0104.jp2", "height": 4086, "width": 2387, "levels": 6, "size": 507343}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"104\">\n<p>\n 56\n</p>\n<p>\n PRODUCTION.\n</p>\n<p>\n [book II.\n</p>\n<p>\n It will follow from this illustration, that there is much of\n the wealth of the world which it is difficult to classify\n whether as capital or not, much in which the two ends\n unite, much in which the share devoted to reproduction is\n doubtful. Still, this casts no discredit on the distinction\n itself, which stands manifest to all. There are many such\n principles in political economy, the general direction and\n character of which cannot be intelligently doubted, yet in\n whose particular applications we find difficulties and appar-\n ent contradictions ; just as the mountain-ranges stretch\n across the continent, unmistakable in their great course,\n shedding the waters of one slope to the east and of the other\n to the west, making clear separation between the Flora and\n Fauna of the adjacent countries, and forming impassable\n boundaries of empire, yet are occasionally interrupted by\n one cause or twisted away by another, so that we find peaks\n here and there, which a little critic can take his stand upon,\n and deny the geography of the hemisphere.\n</p>\n<p>\n How does capital arise ?\n</p>\n<p>\n From the net savings of labor. A person who earns five\n hundred dollars a year, and places one hundred dollars of\n it in a savings-bank, or invests it in land or machinery or\n railroad stock, or anywhere at work, has increased his own\n capital and the capital of the country by so much. It is\n not what he lays aside for use in his own occupation merely,\n but for use anywhere.\n</p>\n<p>\n All capital comes in this way. A country increases in\n capital just in proportion to the increase of capital accumu-\n lated by its members. If the individuals of a nation apply\n none of their net income to reproduction, there is no\n increase of the national capital. If they withdraw any of\n their capital to meet personal consumption, the country\n becomes poorer.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many of the considerations which pertain to the accumu-\n lation of capital, and the ultimate use of it, belong to the\n discussions of economic culture, or gc further on, to the gene-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0105/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 298, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 510}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0105/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 596, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1021}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0105/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1193, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2043}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0105/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2387, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4086}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0105/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0105.jp2", "height": 4086, "width": 2387, "levels": 6, "size": 494283}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"105\">\n<p>\n CKAP.

The land, buildings, and\n tools of tlie farmer, the ships and warehouses of the\n merchant, tlie machines and implements of the manufac-\n turer, belong to this class. They must be used for the\n purposes to which they are particularly adapted, or they\n have little value. They are fixed. The ship cannot be\n used as a wagon, or the spinning-jenny as a locomotive.\n</p>\n<p>\n Circulating capital, on the other hand, consists of those\n articles or commodities which can be readily changed from\n one purpose of production to another. Of this class are the\n stock and produce of the farmer, the money and wares of\n the merchant, the raw materials of the mechanic. These\n are easily transferred from one business to another, and\n indeed from one place to another, and may be used in a\n great variety of forms. Of all these, money is the most\n mobile, as it can be changed without delay or loss to any\n occupation or locality.\n</p>\n<p>\n Fixed is, in its nature, more permanent than circulating\n capital, not merely in its adaptations, for its name implies\n that, but in its existence. The greater part of circulating\n capital \u2014 stock and materials, for example \u2014 is held only in\n the immediate view of transmuting or transferring or trans-\n porting it, so that it shall pass into fixed capital.

In pure theory, production\n and consumption complete the economic good, which is\n reproduction. The harvest which is gained in production\n is sown or wasted, as the case may be, in consumption, to\n re-appear in a more abounding- harvest, or in barrenness,\n in reproduction.

While it takes\n nothing from the individual excellence, each contributes\n with a greater generosity to the completeness of the whole.\n</p>\n<p>\n From these general considerations of trade, we deduce\n the following principles: \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n 1st, That individuals must produce a surplus of their own\n commodities to have an opportunity to trade, and must\n trade to make it an object to produce a surplus. Wants\n create wealth, and wealth creates wants.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2d, That every nation is interested in the production of\n every other nation. Any thing which impedes the produc-\n tion of any individual or community injures the trade of\n the world. Such causes, for example, are pestilence, as the\n cholera, yellow-fever, and plague ; the convulsions of na-\n ture, as earthquakes and inundations ; war, as in the case\n of the late war in India, which sensibly affected the trade of\n the world, and, still more striking and recent, in the case\n of the great Eebellion in the United States, which was felt,\n it may almost be said, by every human being on the globe.\n Not a consumer of cotton, high or low, civilized or savage,\n but suffered in consequence.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3d, That this mutual interest exists between any two\n nations, whether they have direct commercial intercourse\n or not. For example : there may be a German principality\n that purchases nothing of the United States, yet it may pur-\n chase largely of the cotton yarn of England. That causes\n a demand for American cotton ; that benefits the Southern\n States ; that, in turn, helps the trade of the North ; and\n that, again, the producers of the West, on whom the North\n depends for agricultural supplies.\n</p>\n<p>\n By such ramifications, exchange extends itself through\n the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4th, Since, by the laws of trade, those countries which lie\n most remote from each other, and are most unlike in soil,\n climate, civilization, and ethnical characteristics, are most\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0132/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 298, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 510}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0132/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 596, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1021}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0132/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1193, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2043}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0132/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2387, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4086}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0132/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0132.jp2", "height": 4086, "width": 2387, "levels": 6, "size": 510777}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"132\">\n<p>\n 84\n</p>\n<p>\n EXCHANGE.\n</p>\n<p>\n [book III.\n</p>\n<p>\n neai ly united by commerce, it is shown, that, by this terri-\n torial division of labor, the most extended production and\n the most beneficent distribution of all the commodities\n of the earth are secured ; and that, if any nation creates an\n article of peculiar desirableness, it is placed within the\n reach of all.

Deriving all value from\n labor, we have here an adamantine basis, which no sophistry\n can move. Laws may be supposed to stimulate desires, or\n to repress them ; but they cannot lay hand on man\u2019s labor,\n except to hinder it. It is a power given by the Creator, to\n work upon the constant properties of matter. It has no\n fellow in its work ; its only tools are capital, its own crea-\n ture, and nature, whose forces are fixed by God. Labor has\n its commission and its reward in itself. Just as surely as\n man cannot add one cubit to his stature, so is law impotent\n to help man\u2019s labor, except through man\u2019s desires.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is another reason, more abstract, for reducing these\n two propositions to one. It is, that the efforts men will\n make are included in their desires. Those efforts are those\n desires going out after their objects. Man\u2019s work is man\u2019s\n want active.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have thus to consider only the first proposition in the\n theory of protection ; namely, that the desires of man, in\n the economic sense, need government by law.

If good enterprises,\n why not bad, since the test of bad or good has been with-\n drawn ? In such a rankness of unnatural growth, it is far\n more likely that weeds will be produced than useful plants.\n Thus the whole industry of a country may become perverted\n and falsified by removing the principle of competition.

It is not our province to argue\n a point of Constitutional Law ; but if Congress has the power\n \u201c to regulate commerce ivith foreign nations and among\n the several states f it would seem quite clear that it has the\n right to legislate upon a matter so essential to the very exist-\n ence of commerce, and the welfare of the different sections\n</p>\n<p>\n 9\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0178/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 510}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0178/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1021}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0178/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2043}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0178/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4086}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0178/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0178.jp2", "height": 4086, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 525180}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"178\">\n<p>\n 111m\n</p>\n<p>\n EXCHANGE.\n</p>\n<p>\n [book III.\n</p>\n<p>\n of the Union, as that of internal transportation.

This degree\n was called the standard. The metal thus assayed was then\n divided into pieces, and the weight carefully ascertained,\n and stamped upon each. These pieces were called coins ;\n the process, coinage.\n</p>\n<p>\n As this coinage involved great responsibility, it very\n properly became the duty and prerogative of the govern-\n ment. Each government established an institution for the\n purpose, called a mint.

The creditor may accept the promises of the govern-\n ment in place of that of an individual, but he receives no\n value. So far as issued by the government and accepted\n for taxes and other public dues, such notes are mere coun-\n ters^ used for cancelling reciprocal obligations. If such\n notes are issued beyond the natural volume of the currency,\n they can never be kept at par with specie, or circulate at\n their nominal value.

Governors might as\n well prescribe the height to which the tides of ocean shall\n rise, as to restrict or reduce the premium on gold.\n</p>\n<p>\n Such legislation is not only futile, but injurious, pro-\n ducing an effect just opposite to that intended. It disturbs\n the market price of gold, destroys confidence in its actual\n price, and, by exciting distrust, drives the premium far up\n beyond its natural limit.\n</p>\n<p>\n The experiment made by the Congress of the United\n States in 1864 showed most conclusively the utter folly of\n attempting to interfere with the laws of value. After the\n gold bill,\u2019\u2019 so called, became a law, the premium rose at\n once some fifty per cent above its previous rate.

But there\n is one exception in the practical operation of this principle.\n If the income received were to be expended entirely for\n food, clothing, and other ordinary articles of merchandise,\n the full depreciation of the currency would be felt. But\n if, as would usually be the case, a portion of it were used\n for the payment of rent, the depreciation, in so far, would\n be less operative. Neither the fee nor the use of real\n estate rises in proportion to other things.\n</p>\n<p>\n The price of real estate, and its use, would, however,\n unquestionably advance to nearly the same extent as com-\n modities in general, provided a credit currency were contin-\n ued as the currency of the country for a long period, say\n from one generation to another. . This, however, never has,\n and, in the nature of the case, is not likely to take place ;\n credit currency being, necessarily, of limited duration.\n</p>\n<p>\n Doubtless, investments have been made, especially in\n large cities, that would not have been made but for the\n great inflation in the currency of the United States during\n the Rebellion ; but the price of such property has advanced\n slowly, as compared with flour, clothing, & c.*\n</p>\n<p>\n * That real estate in some large cities has much advanced, we are well\n aware ; but, take the whole country through, it is doubtful if there has been\n an advance of ten per cent.

We have no occasion to make such an inquiry in\n regard to money, for that was value in itself, and needs no\n conversion ; nor in relation to a purely credit currency, for\n that does not profess convertibility : but a mixed currency,\n to be reliable and beneficial to the public, must be what it\n proclaims itself to be ; viz., convertible on demand into coin;\n and therefore a sufficiency of coin should be held to secure\n that object.\n</p>\n<p>\n And here it is necessary to distinguish carefully between\n the convertibility and the redeemableness of a currency.\n The first may be uncertain or impossible, while the last\n may be sure. A bank may be perfectly solvent, while its\n currency is almost entirely inconvertible. By convertibility,\n then, we understand the power of the bank to exchange\n its promises for specie on demand ; by redeemableness, its\n power to liquidate or discharge its obligations some time or\n other, by the resources it may possess for ultimate payment.\n</p>\n<p>\n For example, a bank has promised to pay one hundred\n thousand dollars in specie, while it has only ten thousand\n dollars in specie to pay with. The same bank has demands\n against individuals, for their notes discounted, to the\n amount of two hundred thousand dollars. Now, it is cer-\n tain that this bank can convert only ten thousand dollars of\n its bills ; but it can, if sufficient time is allowed, redeem the\n whole amount, by taking in its own notes in exchange for\n those of its debtors. The power of the bank ultimately to\n redeem or cancel its notes is amply sufficient ; though, for\n the conversion of them into specie, it has the ability only\n to the extent of one-tenth. This point needs to be well\n understood and remembered, because, as we shall have\n occasion to show, the difference between the redemption and\n conversion of a currency is a matter of the utmost impor-\n tance to the business world, and the former cannot be made\n a sufficient substitute for the latter.

Consequently, there is no occasion\n for this indirect mode of obtaining extra interest, so com-\n mon in some, if not all, the commercial cities of the Ameri-\n can Union.\n</p>\n<p>\n Compulsory deposits mean, simply, extra interest; but\n that interest is paid in a manner most burdensome to the\n depositors, and most dangerous to the banks.

It would then\n be only of scientific interest, to show what was the compara-\n tive wealth of different communities and ages, and what the\n fairness of their several systems of distributing the result\n of industry among the producing classes. If every act of\n labor received its own reward, in a distinct form, at the\n time, to be consumed then and there, a standard of value\n would be of less practical importance.\n</p>\n<p>\n But whenever there is the slightest exchange of com-\n modities or association of laborers ; whenever one man\n trusts another for recompense of service, or applies wealth\n and toil to an enterprise in the faith of receiving a reward at\n a future time, \u2014 a standard of value must be had, so that all\n can be done safely, expeditiously, and justly. Unless some\n thing possessed the property of being a standard of value,\n all exchange would inevitably be confined to the gross and\n clumsy form of barter.

The government does not insist\n that length or breadth shall be determined in all bargains\n by the yardstick. Men can and do take arms and fingers\n for the purpose, or any thing else they please : it is nothing\n to government, which only says what a yard shall be.\n</p>\n<p>\n So, by universal consent, mankind have agreed to measure\n every thing by the precious metals. The laws of the United\n States, for example, enact that a certain coin, or planchet,\n of gold, nine-tenths fine, and weighing 25^-^ grains, shall\n be called a dollar.

This, be-\n cause prices were measured not by gold, but by credit, or\n the promises of government and the banks ; but the value\n of all these commodities in the commerce of the world, and\n among themselves, was no greater than two years before.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0240/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 289, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 510}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0240/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 578, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1021}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0240/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1156, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2043}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0240/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2312, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4086}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0240/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0240.jp2", "height": 4086, "width": 2312, "levels": 6, "size": 396045}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"240\">\n<p>\n EXCHANGE.\n</p>\n<p>\n [book hi.\n</p>\n<p>\n 176\n</p>\n<p>\n f\n</p>\n<p>\n The difference between price and value was also strikingly\n exhibited in the history of the Confederate States during\n the Eebellion.

The laborer ?

Suppose that, during an expansion,\n a farmer, encouraged by the high price of wheat, purchases\n land to the amount of nine hundred dollars, in the expecta-\n tion that he can pay for it with one thousand bushels of\n wheat, at ninety cents per bushel. A contraction takes\n place, the price of wheat goes down to sixty cents, and, to\n pay his note of nine hundred dollars, he must sell fifteen\n hundred bushels of wheat. He has lost five hundred bush-\n els, just what the debtor, in the other case supposed, gained,\n less fifty dollars which he will now save in the labor cost of\n his wheat.\n</p>\n<p>\n We here see that the effect of raising prices without\n increasing values is to vitiate all existing contracts to pay\n money. If the farmer, in the case supposed, had promised\n to pay so many bushels of wheat, all would have been well ;\n but he promised to pay dollars ; and, when the price of\n wheat was measured by dollars under a contraction, it made\n the difference stated.\n</p>\n<p>\n Much misapprehension arises from confounding special\n and general prices, or the price of an individual article, as\n distinguished from that of the great mass of commodities.\n We are told that a variety of considerations enter into and\n affect prices ; viz., demand and supply, cost of production,\n & c., & c. All this is perfectly true of an individual article,\n whose price may and does vary from time to time, as com-\n pared with other commodities, under the operation of these\n causes. One article may be very high, while all others are\n low, or the reverse ; but this does not tend to disprove the\n principle, that general prices are determined by the quantity\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0250/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 289, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 510}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0250/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 578, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1021}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0250/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1156, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2043}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0250/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2312, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4086}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0250/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0250.jp2", "height": 4086, "width": 2312, "levels": 6, "size": 452154}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"250\">\n<p>\n 184\n</p>\n<p>\n EXCHANGE.\n</p>\n<p>\n [book III.\n</p>\n<p>\n of the currency.

These can only\n meet their engagements by drawing on the banks. But, if\n these have all their resources strained to meet the ordinary\n wants of the business community, how can the drafts of the\n saving banks be met ? How can currency be supplied for\n this extraordinary demand ? This question can only be\n intelligently answered by reference to the condition of both\n these kinds of institutions.\n</p>\n<p>\n We will, for this purpose, take the currency of Massachu-\n setts as it stood in 1860 : \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n The savings banks had on deposit $45,000,000\n</p>\n<p>\n The currency banks had | 30,000,000\n</p>\n<p>\n ( circulation 25,000,000\n</p>\n<p>\n Total $100,000,000\n</p>\n<p>\n The currency banks had specie 6,500,000\n</p>\n<p>\n Difference $93,500,000\n</p>\n<p>\n This is exhibited in Currency Diagram No. 3.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here, then, are legal immediate demands, upon the cur-\n rency banks, of fifty-five millions ; and, upon the savings\n banks, of forty-five millions.

Suppose that the institu-\n tions for savings are called on for only one-fourth of their,\n deposits. They must look to the banks for eleven millions\n of currency at once. The banks begin to pay out their bills ;\n but the specie is at once demanded, and of that they have\n but SIX and one-half millions against their own immediate\n liabilities of fifty-five millions.

Under these circumstances, he cannot\n make the cloth so as to afford a profit ; and it will not be surprising\n if he should clamor for more protection. But it may be said, that\n the same causes that have advanced the expenses of living, and,\n consequently, of labor, will equally have advanced the price of\n broadcloth. Not so. The price of the broadcloth will be deter\n mined by the rate at which it can be afforded by the foreign manu\n facturer ; and if he can pay the duty of fifty cents per yard, ani\n yet obtain a fair profit, he will send all the market demands.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0260/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 289, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 510}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0260/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 578, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1021}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0260/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1156, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2043}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0260/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2312, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4086}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0260/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0260.jp2", "height": 4086, "width": 2312, "levels": 6, "size": 529065}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"260\">\n<p>\n 192\n</p>\n<p>\n EXCHANGE.\n</p>\n<p>\n [book III.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c There is another view of the matter.

It is true that the rate\n of wages is lower in England than in this country ; but, in addition\n to this, England has the very great advantage of a currency nearer\n the currency of international exchange, which is always strictly\n value money.

The variation in prices was larger even\n than the percentage of protective duties.\n</p>\n<p>\n So the tariff of 1842, which began to take effect in 1848,\n when the currency was $6.18 per capita, was more than\n counterbalanced by the expansion of the currency to $9.94\n in 1846. But the manufacturer suffered as much from the\n periodical contractions as from the expansions that pre-\n ceded them ; for while, by the latter, the duties were ren-\n dered nugatory, all business men met great losses from the\n failures and the general derangement and stagnation which\n the former produced.

Each of the tariffs imposed different\n rates per centum on different items ; and some of the tariffs\n have a large proportion of specific duties, or so much per\n yard, gallon, or pound ; so that the exact per centum cannot\n be ascertained, nor is this necessary to our purpose. We\n are able to determine, with sufficient accuracy, the general\n percentage of each tariff, to enable us to judge whether the\n consumption rises and falls in correspondence.\n</p>\n<p>\n The tariff of 1816 was the first ever laid for protection,\n and is estimated at twenty-four per cent. Four years after-\n wards, viz. in 1820, the tariff was increased. Eight years\n afterwards (1828), a very great advance was made, which is\n placed in our estimate at forty-eight per cent ; but it may\n have been much higher than that, as many articles were\n charged with high specific duties, amounting to from one\n hundred to two hundred per cent. It was almost prohibi-\n tory, and gave such umbrage to South Carolina and other\n cotton-growing States, that the celebrated compromise tariff\n of 1832 was enacted, which reduced the duties at the rate\n of ten per centum, on all over twenty per cent, for ten years ;\n so that, at the end of that time, there would only remain the\n twenty-per-cent duty.\n</p>\n<p>\n This tariff came down to its minimum in 1842, a time of\n great depression of prices and trade, growing out of the\n monetary revulsion through which the country had just\n passed. A strong and successful appeal was made for an\n increase of duties ; and the tariff known as that of 1842\n was established, giving high protection. This occasioned\n so much dissatisfaction, that, after four years, the rates were\n again reduced by the tariff of 1846. This remained in op-\n eration for the unprecedented period of eleven years, when\n another reduction was effected by the tariff of 1857. This\n lasted for four years, when the necessities of the treasury,\n in consequence of war, required the imposition of higher\n duties in 1861 ; since which they have been still further\n advanced.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":

In 1841, there was\n again an export of specie, and also in 1842 ; and the rate of\n interest went up to nine and twelve per cent. But, in 1843,\n the lowest point was reached, more than twenty millions of\n gold were imported, and money was a drug. Interest was,\n for a while, almost nominal. Large amounts were nego-\n tiated as low as three and a half per cent.\n</p>\n<p>\n From this time forward, we have only the natural results\n of a mixed currency in its fluctuations. In 1847, the rate of\n interest was high, \u2014 eighteen per cent, \u2014 though the cur-\n rency was not redundant. This was the year of the Irish\n famine ; and we imported twenty-two millions of gold above\n the exports. From 1849 to 1857, the currency was con-\n stantly increasing. Severe fluctuations in the money market\n took place, but no grand revulsion until 1857, when so great\n was the inflation of the currency, and consequently the\n general credit of the country, that an explosion took place ;\n interest going up to thirty-six per cent. All these faets are\n significant, and form an essential part of the history of\n mixed-currency banking.\n</p>\n<p>\n The comparative fluctuations in the United States and\n England is shown by the following table of rates of interest\n from 1844, when Sir Robert Peeks act was passed, up to\n 1858, inclusive, \u2014 fifteen years.

XI.] EFFECTS OF A MIXED CURRENCY. 205\n</p>\n<p>\n Observe the correspondence between Diagrams No. 6\n and 7. The rate of interest in both countries is evidently\n affected by the same disturbing force, though in different\n degrees.\n</p>\n<p>\n EFFECTS OF MIXED CURRENCY UPON AMERICAN AGRICULTURE.\n</p>\n<p>\n Unfavorable as the influence of mixed currency is upon\n all branches of industry, the agriculture of the United\n States is especially injured by it, because, as a people, we\n have a large surplus of agricultural products, that must find\n sale in foreign markets. Whatever such surplus is worth\n for export, determines the price of the whole crop ; and\n the value or price is determined by its value or price in\n gold. Such products are virtually sold for gold. It is\n always a matter of choice with the merchant whether to\n send wheat,* for example, or gold, as a remittance. The\n produce of the farmer, then, must be sold at a gold stand-\n ard ; but all he purchases for himself and family is bought\n at currency prices. How much difference this may make\n is seen at the present time, when commodities in general\n are one hundred and twenty per cent above par, while gold\n is but forty.\n</p>\n<p>\n The currency is now (1865) a credit, or inconvertible\n one ; but we are to inquire whether the principle does not\n hold good at all times, under a mixed or partially converti-\n ble currency.

Flour, for example, in 1846, with a currency of\n 9.94, was at $5.06 ; while in 1851, when the currency had\n risen to 11.86, an advance of twenty per cent, flour was at\n $4.50, a decline of ten per cent. Cotton was at 12 cents,\n under a currency of 10.39, in 1850, and but 9 cents, under\n a currency of 14.95, in 1854. But we need not point to\n these facts ; they are quite apparent throughout the whole\n table, and show beyond cavil that the prices of agri-\n cultural products in the United States are not governed\n by its mixed currency, as other products are which the ag-\n riculturist must purchase for consumption. Hence he is\n always a sufferer, as compared with the manufacturer and\n all other classes whose productions are not exported ; for the\n commodities of the latter, while they are advanced in cost\n by currency inflation, are also, unless they come especially\n into competition with foreign products, correspondingly\n enhanced in price in the home market.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ordinarily, this operation of a mixed currency is not ap-\n parent to superficial observers ; but the effects are, never-\n theless, always as certain as at the present time, when they\n are seen by every one.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0283/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 285, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 510}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0283/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 570, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1021}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0283/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1140, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2043}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0283/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4086}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0283/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0283.jp2", "height": 4086, "width": 2280, "levels": 6, "size": 424361}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"283\">\n<p>\n CHAP.

A mercantile currency, based wholly on specie, would\n equally avoid loss from this cause, and yet secure all the\n advantages of a value currency.\n</p>\n<p>\n But, in fact, the abrasion of paper currency is far greater\n than that of gold ; that is, it costs more to keep out one\n hundred dollars of currency than it does to keep out\n one hundred dollars in coin. Gold and silver circulate\n themselves ; but it requires a formidable machinery to circu-\n late paper promises, \u2014 a machinery far more costly than the\n slow wear of the precious metals. No banker would venture\n to say that a paper currency can be maintained for one-\n twentieth of one per cent per annum.\n</p>\n<p>\n It may be said that the banks gain a considerable sum by\n the accidental destruction of their notes. Doubtless ; but\n what they gain somebody loses. The amount estimated to\n have disappeared in this manner up to 1841, as we have\n seen in the table just cited, was put at seven millions of\n dollars. A very large proportion of this fell jOn the poorer\n classes, as also do the losses by counterfeiting.\n</p>\n<p>\n But, if we would comprehend the question of economy,\n we must appreciate the expense of maintaining all the offi-\n cers, managers, and subordinates of fifteen hundred banks,\n with all the incidental charges of their operations.

Even\n then the danger was apparent, though the system had not\n been developed to its proper character and consequences.\n Had the writer witnessed the great convulsions from 1797\n to 1857, he would have dismissed, as wholly an idle fancy,\n the scheme of substituting the \u201c D^dalian wings\u2019 \" (say,\n rather, the Icarian wings) of credit for the \u2018\u2018 solid ground \u201d\n of value.

Now, does the credit money of a mixed cur-\n rency diminish the risk of general credits ? Far from it.\n Common-sense teaches, and statistics prove, that the haz-\n ards of credit must be just in proportion to the credit money\n of any country. Instead, therefore, of being favorable, it is\n adverse to all persons wanting the use of capital. The haz-\n ards of credit in the United States are at least four times as\n great as they would be under a value money currency.\n</p>\n<p>\n The more credits are extended, the more difficult it is for\n persons of limited means to do any thing on their own ac-\n count.

We have therefore\n come to regard the two things as inseparable. But this is\n an entirely erroneous view. Banking and currency-making\n are two perfectly distinct functions, though here uniformly\n united.\n</p>\n<p>\n Banking may be carried on to any degree, and in the\n most profitable manner, without the issue of a single bank-\n note. This is done in Great Britain, to a wonderful extent,\n by joint-stock and private banks.

And yet they manufacture not a\n dollar of currency.

By the change in the standard or\n measure from a value to a mixed currency, prices no longer\n accurately determine values. Prices are increased. Those\n who hold commodities while prices are advancing, gain by\n such an advance. Debtors may discharge their obligations\n with less value. Speculators may make favorable opera-\n tions. The value of every commodity has been interfered\n with ; the integrity of every contract to pay value has been\n impaired. Some are constantly gaining ; others, losing :\n both parties, it may be, unconscious of the cause of such\n prosperity or adversity. \u201c Times \u201d are said to be good or\n bad, as men gain without earning, or lose without a fault.\n Here we have the answers of the questions ' , \u2014 What is\n gained by a mixed currency ?

But, in addition,\n the bank performed all such services as were required by the\n existing wants of trade, at a period when Genoa was com-\n mercially the centre of Europe. Of course, its operations\n were on a gigantic scale. Its affairs were conducted with\n the greatest skill and fidelity, and were continued from its\n foundation up to the time Genoa was united to the French\n Empire, \u201cwhen the bank was abolished, and the rentes,\n 3,400,000 Genoese lire, which they owed their creditors,\n were transferred to the account-books of France.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This bank, like the Bank of England, had its stock in-\n vested in the public debt ; but it received deposits of gold\n and silver, for which it gave credit to the depositor. These\n deposits, being easily transferable, were employed largely in\n commercial transactions.\n</p>\n<p>\n The bank also issued bills extensively; but \u201c these hills and\n deposits represented coins of full weight and value^ and were\n vayahle on demand in such coins.^^ The common currency\n of Genoa, for retail business and minor transactions^ was\n coin.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus the Genoese were furnished with a currency per-\n fectly adapted to their wants. It had all the reliability\n of specie, with the convenience of a paper circulation, and\n conferred immense advantages upon the trade of the city for\n more than five hundred years.*\n</p>\n<p>\n The Bank of Amsterdam was established in 1609 as a\n bank of deposit, receiving gold and silver coins of all denom\n inations and all nationalities, ascertaining their exact value,\n and passing the amount to the credit of the depositor, or\n</p>\n<p>\n * For an interesting account of this bank, see \u201c The Ways and Means of\n Payment\u201d (p. 311 et seq.), by Stephen Colwell, of Philadelphia\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0302/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 509}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0302/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1018}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0302/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1123, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0302/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2247, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4075}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0302/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0302.jp2", "height": 4075, "width": 2247, "levels": 6, "size": 504373}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"302\">\n<p>\n 226\n</p>\n<p>\n EXCHANGE.\n</p>\n<p>\n [book III.\n</p>\n<p>\n giving him a receipt (recipisse) for the same.

The\n object of requiring any specie, or lawful money, is, that the\n currency may be made more reliable ; but, if so, does not\n this provision, to a large extent, frustrate that object ? So\n far from giving strength, every banker knows that these\n balances are a cause of weakness and peril in time of panic.\n</p>\n<p>\n It can easily be seen that a very large proportion of the\n nominal amount of specie or lawful money required may be\n held in these \u201c balances.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Lastly, the national differ from the old State banks in\n this, that the latter had almost their entire capital to loan\n to the business community, while the new banks will have\n little or none at all, having loaned their capital at the outset\n to the government, by the purchase of its bonds.

In view of these facts, it can be no matter of sur-\n prise that the metropolitan banks suspended as soon as the\n country banks began to call for their balances. The result\n showed that so much of the \u201c reserves \u201d of the latter as\n consisted of bank balances, instead of being additional secu-\n rity, became the direct and certain cause of the general\n suspension.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this connection it may be proper to notice two promi-\n nent sophisms which the present monetary system seems to\n have generated. First, that the paper currency of a coun-\n try should be increased in proportion to the increase of\n population and trade. History sustains no such conclusion.\n In Great Britain, for example, the entire paper circulation\n of all the banks is no larger now than in 1825 ; yet the\n population has nearly doubled, and the exports and imports\n have increased fivefold, or from 100 to ove\u00bb 500 millions\n sterling. The paper circulation of the United Kingdom in\n 1847 was forty millions, and it has ranged from thirty-six to\n forty-two millions from that period to the present. The\n explanation of this is, that the power or force of money\n being determined by two factors, \u2014 its quantity and the\n rapidity with which it circulates, \u2014 it becomes obvious that\n 100 dollars made use of ten times a day effects as many ex-\n changes as 1000 employed but once in the same time. A\n little reflection will lead to the conclusion that the rapidity\n of transportation by sea and land has increased as fast at\n least as production for the last fifty years. Space has been\n almost annihilated by steam, and quite by electricity.\n Besides, by means of clearing-houses and checks, immense\n payments are made without the use of coin or notes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Secondly, \u201c elasticity \u2019\u2019 is of late strongly insisted upon\n as indispensable. By this is meant that the issues of paper\n should be increased by the banks or the government, or\n both, at certain seasons of the year, especially when \u2018\u2018 it\n becomes necessary to move the crops,\u201d and, when no longer\n needed, should be withdrawn.\n</p>\n<p>\n By this popular definition of the term elasticity,\u201d it will\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0316/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 509}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0316/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1018}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0316/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1123, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0316/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2247, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4075}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0316/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0316.jp2", "height": 4075, "width": 2247, "levels": 6, "size": 461855}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"316\">\n<p>\n 240\n</p>\n<p>\n EXCHANGE.\n</p>\n<p>\n [book III.\n</p>\n<p>\n be seen that flexibility is what is actually intended, \u2014 a\n currency that can be enlarged or diminished at the pleasure\n or discretion of those who control the issue of it.

But on these bills there will be a pre-\n mium or discount, as the case may be. If New York has\n purchased more largely in the mutual trade, there will be\n an excess of demand in that city for bills on Cincinnati.\n Reverse the supposition, and there will be an excess of de-\n mand in Cincinnati for bills on New York. The consequence,\n in either case, will be a rate of exchange equal to the trans-\n portation of specie, as above indicated. The rate of ex-\n change will fluctuate from time to time (other things equal)\n precisely according to the transactions between the two\n cities. It becomes, then, in point of fact, the barometer of\n trade ; indicating, with perfect accuracy, the state of trade\n between any two points, at home or abroad.

For nearly all products there is both an actual and\n speculative, or a present and prospective, demand : for\n labor there is only an actual, present demand. When busi-\n ness begins to be particularly prosperous, there is a general\n demand for all kinds of merchandise, and prices gradually\n begin to improve. This at once occasions a speculative\n demand ; for to buy will be to realize an advance : the larger\n the purchases, the greater the amount of profits. Every ope-\n ration pays. The rise continues until every article bought\n and sold as merchandise goes up to the highest point.\n</p>\n<p>\n But no one speculates in wages. No one can, if he\n would, buy a hundred thousand dollars\u2019 worth of labor, and\n hold it for an advance, as he can of flour, sugar, or tea.\n Of course, labor has no advantage from this kind of demand,\n but must rely entirely on that which is immediate and\n actual. Therefore it is that a general rise of prices, so far\n as occasioned by speculation, must always operate against\n the laborer, or the person employed on salary or wages.\n</p>\n<p>\n But wages not only never rise so much as commodities,\n but do not rise so soon. The reason is, that the rise of\n commodities is greatly accelerated by speculation; while\n labor, as before stated, is not affected by that kind of de-\n mand. Hence it does not begin to rise until speculation\n has engendered a spirit of extravagance and increased con-\n sumption ; then wages make an advance about half as\n great, on an average, as that of merchandise in general.\n</p>\n<p>\n And, again, wages fall sooner than merchandise, because\n the latter may be held for high prices, if need be. The fall\n of merchandise is broken by the disposition and ability of\n the owner to hold on, and, as far as possible, prevent loss ;\n but the laborer cannot do this, \u2014 he must sell his com-\n modity at once for the most it will bring.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is for those obvious reasons that wages, in times of\n depression, must fall, not only sooner, but lower, than prop-\n erty in general.

Fluctuations, since the introduction\n of mixed currency, have been frequent and violent, not in\n the rate of wages only, but of those commodities upon\n which the laborer subsists, and in which his real wages must\n be estimated. To determine whether actual value wages\n have advanced or not since the commencement of the\n present century, for example, we must have the nominal\n rates, say, in 1810, also in 1860. We must then take the\n prices of commodities at the two periods ; and, by compari-\n son, we may arrive at a general conclusion. We should\n undoubtedly be satisfied that there has been a decided\n increase in the average value of wages. In our investiga-\n tion, we should find that some articles were higher and some\n lower in price in 1860 than fifty years before. For example,\n while one dollar per day for labor was probably as high\n wages in 1810 as one dollar and a half in 1860, corn was\n worth the same at each end of the half-century ; but cotton\n cloth, which was worth forty cents a yard in 1810, could be\n bought in 1860 for ten cents. In all manufactured articles,\n the difference is against the earlier labor ; so that it is true\n the laborer of to-day enjoys many comforts to which his pre-\n decessors could not aspire. The wants of the laborer have\n immensely increased. It would be impossible to give an\n inventory of them ; but, could we compare the consumption\n of those classes in 1810 with their consumption in 1860, we\n should find the advance surprising. The amount expended\n for pleasure-travel, for example, by this class is immense,\n while fifty years ago it was hardly appreciable. So of\n the luxury of newspapers, magazines, Ac. Some part\n of the expenditures of the poorer classes are for articles\n (like photographs) which were absolutely unknown a gen-\n eration since.\n</p>\n<p>\n Workmen may be less satisfied with their compensation\n now than fifty years ago ; but it is really far greater.

The introduction of machinery is doing much\n to equalize the wages of the two sexes.

Women are\n also employed extensively in public offices and trading es-\n tablishments.\n</p>\n<p>\n All this is the natural result of our civilization, and\n especially of a free common-school education. In a great\n part of the United States, the same advantages are furnished\n to both sexes.

Such power is more rare than physical\n force. It will therefore command a higher price, especially\n in a progressive state of society. To this class may be\n referred all persons of natural ingenuity, inventors, authors,\n and men of genius. Such often receive great rewards.

He asks no favor,\n and grants none. He demands the same justice, the same\n freedom, accorded to others. He should be able, so far as\n law is concerned, to work when and for whom he chooses,\n and for such consideration as he can get in the great com-\n petition of industry. The law cannot say how much he\n shall accept for wages, how many hours shall constitute a\n day\u2019s work, nor how much the employer shall give him.\n Each is left perfectly free, and the competition is simply\n between labor and capital.\n</p>\n<p>\n But the laborer is not under obligation to act as an in-\n sulated individual, any more than the capitalist. If the\n latter is permitted, and even authorized and encouraged,\n to combine with his fellows in order to enhance the power\n and profits of capital, it is equally the right of the laborer\n to do the same, and equally the duty of the legislator to\n give him any facilities for doing this he may justly demand.\n</p>\n<p>\n If capital is incorporated, labor should have the same\n privilege. If favors in any case are awarded to one party,\n they should certainly be furnished to the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n Laborers, then, may combine, if they deem it best to act\n in concert in regard to their interests.\n</p>\n<p>\n As a matter of fact, they do form associations for mutual\n benefit.

The principal object\n of these, generally, is the increase of wages. The differ-\n ent trades often combine for this purpose, and endeavor\n to fix the rate at which they will work. This, it would\n seem, they have an undoubted right to do : whether it be\n good policy is another question.\n</p>\n<p>\n Men may mutually agree, for example, that they will work\n only ten hours per day, and will have two dollars per day\n as wages.

If\n such persons prefer to work at a less rate of wages than that\n established in the tariff of the union rather than not work\n at all, they have the most unquestionable right to do so ;\n and any attempt to prevent them by brute force is an in-\n fringement of personal rights which government is bound to\n resist to the utmost.

These are already somewhat extensively\n introduced into the United States ; and, so far as are known,\n have been attended with a good degree of success. Mr.\n Fawcett (now M.P.), in his \u201c Manual of Political Econo-\n my,\u201d has given a very full and interesting account of the\n operation of certain co-operative societies in Europe, from\n which we extract the following : \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c The co-operative movement in England was first commenced\n at Rochdale.* About 1844, a few working-men in that town sus-\n pected, and no doubt justly so, that they were paying a high price\n for tea, sugar, and other such articles, when they, at the same time,\n believed they were not free from adulteration. They therefore said,\n \u2018 Why should we not club together sufficient amongst ourselves to\n purchase a chest of tea and a hogshead of sugar from some whole-\n sale shop in Manchester ? \u2019 This they did ; and each one of their\n number was supplied with tea and sugar from this common stock,\n paying ready money for it, and giving the same price for it they had\n been charged at the shops. When all the tea and sugar had thus\n been sold, they agreed to divide the money thus realized amongst\n themselves, in proportion to the capital each had subscribed. They\n found, to their surprise, that a large profit had been realized.

The business was not long\n restricted to articles of grocery : bread, meat, and clothing were all\n sold on the same plan. Their capital so rapidly increased, that they\n were soon enabled to erect expensive flour-mills ; and a supply of\n pure bread, as well as unadulterated tea, was thus insured. Dur-\n ing the last few years, this Pioneers\u2019 society has attracted frequent\n public attention ; for it has gradually grown into a vast commercial\n institution, embracing a great variety of trades. At the present\n time (1863), its capital is \u00a332,000, the amount of business done is\n \u00a3170,000, and the profits realized twenty per cent. The general\n management of this society, and the mode in which the profits are\n distributed, are both excellently arranged. A ready-money system\n is so scrupulously adhered to, that even a large shareholder cannot\n make the smallest purchase on credit. The managers of the busi-\n ness are chosen by the general body of shareholders ; and, in almost\n every case, an excellent selection has been made. The accounts are\n made up quarterly, and placed before the general meeting. Lon-\n don accountants have audited these accounts ; and they express a\n unanimous opinion that no business in the country is better con-\n ducted. With regard to distribution of the profits, a sufficient sum\n is at first allotted to pay a dividend of five per cent on the capital ;\n the remaining profits are divided on the following plan: Every\n person, when he purchases goods, receives one or more tin tickets^\n on which is recorded the amount of his purchases. At the end of\n every quarter, each person brings these tin tickets, which form the\n record of his aggregate purchases ; and the remaining profits are\n distributed in proportion to the aggregate amount which each indi-\n vidual has expended at the store. Thirteen pence in the pound\n (equal to about five and a half per cent on the amount purchased)\n is the average amount which, in this manner, is received as a draw-\n back.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Professor Fawcett then proceeds to give the causes of\n this remarkable financial success : \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c The ready-money system, invariably adopted by these societies,\n has probably promoted their prosperity more than any other cir-\n cumstance. All bad debts are thus avoided ; and, where credit is not\n given, a certain amount of business can be transacted with much\n less capital than would be required if large sums were locked up in\n</p>\n<p>\n 19\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0352/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 509}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0352/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1018}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0352/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1123, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0352/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2247, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4075}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0352/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0352.jp2", "height": 4075, "width": 2247, "levels": 6, "size": 521436}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"352\">\n<p>\n 2T6\n</p>\n<p>\n DISTRIBUTION.\n</p>\n<p>\n [book IV.\n</p>\n<p>\n book-debts. Under a ready-money system, the same capital may be\n turned over perhaps twenty times a year ; and, if one per cent only\n is realized upon such transaction, the capital will sum an aggregate\n profit of twenty per cent in the course of the year. Wlien goods\n are sold for ready money, they can be bought for ready money ft\u2019om\n wholesale dealers. This is always a guaranty that the purchases\n will be made on the most favorable terms. Again : the sharehold-\n ers of the society form a nucleus of customers ; and therefore, di-\n rectly business is commenced, a certain amount of trade is insured.\n If an individual commences business, he must attract customers\n either by advertising or costly shop-fronts ; he is compelled to con-\n duct his business in crowded thoroughfares, where rents are ex-\n tremely high : but a co-operative society is saved all these expenses.\n Its shareholders are its customers ; it therefore need not advertise ;\n it does not require a showy building ; for its position is rather in the\n centre of the homes of the laboring population. These and other\n advantages sufficiently account for the large profits which have\n been realized, not only by the Rochdale co-operative store, but by a\n great number of similar societies, situated in almost every other part\n of the country.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The author here enumerates a long list of different places\n in which these stores are established, as Manchester, Hud-\n dersfield, Dover, Blackburn, & c.

There can be no doubt that these societies promote a\n most healthy social intercourse between workmen ; for, at frequent\n meetings, the shareholders consult each other upon matters of busi-\n ness.

This society was reproached for holding certain political\n opinions, and the government attempted to discourage it by refus-\n ing to loan any capital. This intended hostility secured its future\n success ; for the societies which were assisted by the government,\n in almost every instance, proved to be failures. The co-operative\n masons endured many vicissitudes ; and, in the year 1852, they de-\n termined to re-organize their society. It then consisted of only sev-\n enteen members, and borrowed no capital. They resolved to create\n a capital, by depositing in a common chest one-tenth of their daily\n earnings. At the end of the first year, a capital of fourteen pounds\n and ten shillings was in this manner created. At the end of 1854,\n the capital had increased to six hundred and eighty pounds ; and,\n in 1860, consisted of one hundred and seven members, and the cap-\n ital possessed by them was fourteen thousand and five hundred\n pounds. The Hotel Fould, the Hotel Rouher, the Hotel Fres-\n cati, & c., & c., were erected by this industrial association. At\n the present time, these co-operative masons are building an hotel\n for M.

Another most important effect seems\n likely to result from these associations ; for they appear to hold out\n a fair prospect of correcting a very disadvantageous tendency, which\n is associated with the present rapid accumulation of wealth. For\n we have previously remarked that each year the production of\n wealth is conducted on a greater scale : manufactories are enlarged,\n farms are extended in area, and in every branch of industry there\n are those that seem, from the very vastness of their capital, to mo-\n nopolize the additional profit, and thus compel the smaller producer\n to succumb. Hence, each year it becomes more difficult for the\n laborer to engage in any industry on his own account. . . . Hence,\n the industry of the country must be conducted by two distinct class-\n es ; namely, employers who supply the capital, and workmen who\n provide labor ; unless those who labor agree to form themselves\n into associations, and subscribe amongst themselves sufficient capi-\n tal to carry on production upon a large scale. It must be quite\n evident, that co-operative trading establishments, when successful,\n as it were intensify many advantages which laborers derive from\n co-operative stores. But we have separately described these two\n classes of institutions, because we think that the success of the for-\n mer may be imperilled by many circumstances which do not affect\n the latter. In fact, we have already stated, that, in the case of a\n co-operative store, success may almost be guaranteed. . . .

The man who owns the capital,\n and receives his compensation for its use in the shape of\n rent, or interest ; the laborer, who applies muscular or men-\n tal power to the production of value ; and the man who, as\n employer or manager, relieves the first from the anxiety and\n risks of trade, and furnishes the second with the means by\n which alone he can work to advantage, \u2014 are separate per-\n sons, with distinct interests.\n</p>\n<p>\n The capitalist, as such, has no share in the profits of busi-\n ness. He does nothing but loan his wealth, which, by the\n value of its services, brings him an income, in the shape of\n rent for real, or interest for personal estate.* If he is care-\n ful in regard to the securities he takes or the credit he\n gives, it is of no immediate consequence to him whether\n trade is dull or brisk, whether profits are high or low ; but,\n of course, it is true that the capitalist has a general interest\n in the profits of business, to this extent, \u2014 that unless prof-\n its, in the long-run and on the average, are such that the\n business man can afford to pay the usual rate of interest,\n the compensation of the capitalist, or his share in the general\n distribution, must be reduced. He must rent or loan his\n capital on such terms as those who employ it can afford,\n</p>\n<p>\n * The terra \u201c personal estate,\u201d in distinction from real estate (land, build-\n ings, and the like), is generally used in the United States to describe every\n kind of movable property, and all evidences of debt.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0357/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 285, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 510}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0357/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 570, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1021}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0357/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1140, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2043}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0357/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4086}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0357/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0357.jp2", "height": 4086, "width": 2280, "levels": 6, "size": 489827}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"357\">\n<p>\n \u25a0CHAP.

This\n is known to be the case over a large part of our Western\n States. The people can afford to pay large profits, if by so\n doing they can get the use of capital, because capital pro-\n duces so large a return ; as, for example, one thousand dol-\n lars invested in the spring in ploughing the prairie, and\n getting in a crop of wheat, will, not unlikely, give a net profit,\n within six months, of one hundred per cent. But when\n such communities accumulate capital, and are able to pay\n as they purchase, they come to buy at greatly reduced rates, \u2018\n and profits fall to the minimum. This is the general law in\n all countries, though most clearly seen in new settlements.\n The average rate of profits in a country is determined by\n the same law as wages. Profits are merely wage^ received\n hy the employer. This idea should be kept constantly in\n mind. The wages of the laborer depend upon supply and\n demand : why not the wages of those who employ, him ?\n The employer is as truly a laborer as the man who toils with\n the spade, only on a higher plane.\n</p>\n<p>\n If there are more laborers than are wanted, wages fall ;\n if fewer, they advance : just so with employers, or business\n undertakers.

The United States of America afford a\n most striking example in point. There is a vast amount of\n uncultivated but fertile land, while the amount of capital\n with which to cultivate it is comparatively small. So of its\n manufacturing capacities. Hence there is a high general\n rate of interest. This is governed by the supply and demand,\n i.e. by the laws of value alone, and should never be inter-\n fered with by legal enactments.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is a lesson mankind have been slow to learn ; yet the\n most commercial nation in the world (Great Britain) has\n abolished all usury laws. The experiment was at first made\n with great caution, limiting the exemption to a particular\n kind of paper, and the time ' in which it should operate to a\n few months ; but it was found so perfectly satisfactory to\n the community, that, after a fair trial, the abolition of the\n usury laws was made final and complete.\n</p>\n<p>\n But, upon a question so much in dispute, it may be desira-\n ble to give the principal reasons why the matter of interest\n should not be interfered with by law.\n</p>\n<p>\n (a) When it is made a penal offence to take over a cer-\n tain per cent interest (say six), if money is worth more, as\n it often will be, it must be obtained by some indirect pro-\n cess.

Facts of this sort are observed ' everywhere. Farms\n may, as a general rule, be bought, especially in all the older\n States, .at much less than their cost, after making all due\n allowances for depreciation of buildings, < fec. We observe,\n first, that buildings are not generally put upon farms for the\n purpose of selling or letting them. They are almost inva-\n riably erected by the owners of the land, in order to create\n for themselves a home. To make that home pleasant and\n desirable, a dwelling is erected according to the tastes of\n the owner and his family, rather than the direct profit of the\n farm. There is a natural and becoming competition among\n agriculturists to have pleasant, and, as far as may be, elegant\n residences. Hence, they build upon a more expensive scale\n than the business of agriculture will fully justify ; and though\n they may be able to keep on, and even thrive, with their\n establishments, these are, nevertheless, a heavy charge upon\n their industry. Whenever, therefore, such farming proper-\n ties must be sold, the purchaser will rarely, if ever, give\n more than a fraction of the original cost of the buildings.\n If, as is generally the case, he must make the money off his\n land to pay for the estate, he cannot afford the cost of build-\n ings erected to gratify the taste of somebody else. He gets\n the extra improvements gratis, really paying only for the\n useful and necessary.\n</p>\n<p>\n And, in the competition of cultivation in a community\n like the United States, it is to be remembered that its agri-\n culture is a unit; that the products of the accessible and\n fertile prairies of the West are brought into the same mar-\n kets as those of the hard and sterile hills of New England.\n And it is also to be taken into account, that a farm in Illi-\n nois, for example, with a productive power of five thousand\n bushels of corn, will probably not have upon it buildings\n worth more than one thousand dollars ; while on many\n Eastern farms, of a productive power of but two thousand\n bushels, the buildings may have cost three thousand dollars.\n Now, as these farms are, in fact, competing in the same gem\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0377/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 285, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 510}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0377/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 570, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1021}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0377/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1140, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2043}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0377/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4086}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0377/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0377.jp2", "height": 4086, "width": 2280, "levels": 6, "size": 481328}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"377\">\n<p>\n CHAP.

If specific duties\n are laid, they operate with great inequality. For example,\n suppose a duty of twenty-five cents per pound upon tea.\n This would be equal to a taxation of one hundred per cent\n on that which cost, originally, twenty-five cents, which the\n poor > man must pay ; while the rich \u2018 who would purchase\n tea that cost seventy-five cents, would pay but thirty-three\n per cent, or one-third as much per cent as the former.\n</p>\n<p>\n This was the character, to a large extent, of Britisli taxar\n tion. The tax on tea was, for a long time, two shillings and\n sixpence per pound (over sixty cents), paid alike by the\n hand-loom weaver and the wealthy nobleman.\n</p>\n<p>\n When laid upon cloth, for example, a specific duty fre-\n quently operates in a most oppressive manner. By the\n American tariff of 1828, a duty of so many cents was laid\n upon the square yard of coarse woollens. In applying the\n principle, it was found that negro cloths, as tliey were\n called, paid more than two hundred and fifty per cent.\n This gave rise to great dissatisfaction, and was the ostensi-\n ble cause of the nullification movement.\n</p>\n<p>\n In regard to ad-valorem duties, the practical difficulty has\n been, when the rates were very high, to prevent fraudulent\n invoices. For example, the importer must present his\n original invoice at the custom-house, and make oath to its\n correctness. If dishonest, he. may, by connivance with the\n shipper, furnish false papers, showing the cost to be much\n less than it really was.\n</p>\n<p>\n Precautionary measures have been adopted.

Deduct this last from\n $25,000,000, we have $4,838,709 as the difference, which\n is the sum the people had to pay on the home product.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then it stands thus : \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Duties paid, as above $5,520,000\n</p>\n<p>\n Enhanced cost of home sugar 4,838,709\n</p>\n<p>\n Total $10,358,709\n</p>\n<p>\n To this we must add twenty-five per cent, as the\n</p>\n<p>\n profits of the wholesale and retail dealers . . . 2,589,677\n</p>\n<p>\n Whole amount paid $12,948,386\n</p>\n<p>\n Of this government gets 5,520,000\n</p>\n<p>\n Loss to consumers $7,428,386\n</p>\n<p>\n Hence it appears, that the government gets in the present\n case but about forty-three per cent of what the people have\n paid. We have estimated that the merchant charges a profit\n upon wlmt he pays as duties, just as much as upon any\n other part of the cost of his commodities. We have put the\n profits of the merchants at twenty-five per cent. This, we are\n aware, is a low estimate ; but we are governed by the con-\n sideration, that there would be no importer ' s profit on the\n amount produced at home, and also that sugar is a \u2018\u2018 lead-\n ing article,\u2019\u2019 in the language of trade, upon which less aggre-\n gate profits are made.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is apparent, from this illustration, that the real taxation\n of a people will depend very much upon the proportion of\n duties which, designedly or not, are positively protective.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0392/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 509}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0392/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1018}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0392/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1123, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0392/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2247, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4075}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0392/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0392.jp2", "height": 4075, "width": 2247, "levels": 6, "size": 405958}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"392\">\n<p>\n 316\n</p>\n<p>\n DISTRIBUTION.\n</p>\n<p>\n [book IV.\n</p>\n<p>\n If, in the case presented, instead of a duty upon sugar, the\n same impost had been laid upon tea and coffee, which arti-\n cles were free in 1858, and of which together we imported\n in 1858 about the same amount as of sugar, while we pro-\n duced no tea and coffee ourselves, the case would stand as\n follows : \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Tea and coffee imported $23,000,000\n</p>\n<p>\n Duties, twenty-four per cent $5,520,000\n</p>\n<p>\n Importers\u2019 profits, fifteen per cent 828,000\n</p>\n<p>\n $6,348,000\n</p>\n<p>\n Jobbers\u2019 profits, ten per cent 634,800\n</p>\n<p>\n $6,982,800\n</p>\n<p>\n Retailers\u2019 profits, twenty per cent 1,396,560\n</p>\n<p>\n Total, paid by the people\n</p>\n<p>\n Of this amount, the government received $5,520,000\n Merchants\u2019 profits, paid by the people . 2,859,360\n</p>\n<p>\n $8,379,360\n</p>\n<p>\n $8,379,360\n</p>\n<p>\n The saving to the people in this case would stand thus : \u2014\n Paid by the sugar taxation, as shown before . . . $12,948,386\n</p>\n<p>\n Paid by tax on tea and sugar 8,379,360\n</p>\n<p>\n Saved to the people, in one year $4,569,026\n</p>\n<p>\n Such is the wide difference between duties imposed for\n revenue and those laid for the advantage of home produc-\n tions.

The evident\n injustice of giving to one class of men a premium upon their\n productions, in order that they may be encouraged in a\n branch of industry that cannot live without contributions\n from the public treasury, is so apparent, and evidently unrea-\n sonable and unwise, that the people of no country would\n long tolerate it.

Excise is unequal, because\n it falls on rich and poor alike ; not in proportion to their\n wealth, but what they consume. The merchants\u2019 profits are\n not quite so large on these as on custom duties, because\n home products do not ordinarily pass through as many hands\n as foreign merchandise. The expense of collection, though\n only perhaps about one-!burth part as great, is still a heavy\n charge upon the revenue ; but the most popular objection to\n excise is the espionage which it necessarily requires.

One is, that, if it should cause a fall\n ing-off in the consumption of the articles so taxed, no detri-\n ment would come to individuals or the public ; but, on the\n other hand, their moral and social condition would be pro-\n moted, and the power of production increased.\n</p>\n<p>\n The other consideration is, that all those who choose to\n abstain, as they can do without injury, from the specially\n taxed articles, will avoid the payment of the tax altogether :\n such taxes are voluntarily assumed by those who pay them.\n</p>\n<p>\n This kind of taxation is found to be far more productive,\n in proportion, than any other ; and consumption is less\n affected by heavy imposts.

About 1842, however, the\n government, finding its revenues fall short of the expendi-\n tures, restored the tax ; and it has been continued to the\n present time.\n</p>\n<p>\n This tax was unknown, we believe, in the United States,\n until the civil war, wheh it was laid by Congress, and has\n been continued thus far. Total amount collected for the\n year ending June 30, 1865, was 120,740,451.33 ; while the\n whole internal revenue, for the same time, was $211,129,-\n 529.17 ; so that the income tax produced nearly ten per\n cent of the amount.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of all modes of taxation, this is the most just and equita-\n ble. Every man can afford to pay according to his income,\n and ought to do so. There is no other perfect standard of\n taxation ; none other which does not inflict more or less\n hardship and injustice.\n</p>\n<p>\n The tax comes upon the annual private revenue of each\n year, out of which the government should receive its share\n for the annual revenue of the state.

Were it to supersede all other forms\n of taxation, perfect equality would be establislied ; proper!} '\n and labor would bear each its just share of the public bur-\n dens. To do this, it would be necessary to ascertain the\n income of every man ; of every laborer, whether his wages\n amounted to one hundred or one thousand dollars a year ;\n of every professional man ; of every operative, male or female ;\n every capitalist, banker, merchant, and mechanic. Upon the\n gross income, thus ascertained, the general tax should be\n levied, pro rata. In this way, it is clear, equality, as far as\n that is practicable, would be established ; and each member\n of the community would be made to bear his just proportion,\n and, of course, would be obliged to save, in his expenditures,\n to that amount.\n</p>\n<p>\n The objection to this form of taxation is the difficulty of\n ascertaining what a person\u2019s income actually is. In the\n first place, it is said that many do not know their affairs\n so as to be able to state their true income. There is doubt-\n less much of truth in this ; but the very fact that such a tax\n is certain to be enforced every year will, in a short time,\n remove this difficulty to a considerable extent, because men\n will be compelled so to keep their accounts as to know what\n they gain or lose. The operation of the law in this respect,\n therefore, is favorable to private interest ; since the more\n intelligent every man is in regard to his affairs, the better\n for him. Such, we believe, has been the operation of the\n income tax in England.\n</p>\n<p>\n Secondly, It is said that some men will be dishonest in\n their disclosures and statements, and therefore a correct\n result cannot be reached.\n</p>\n<p>\n That many men are dishonest there can be no doubt ; but,\n when the law taxing incomes is regularly enforced from\n year to year, the difficulty of concealment, on the part of the\n tax-payer, is constantly increasing.

The culture of the article began prior to the\n Revolution ; but it did not become an article of foreign export till\n 1784, when eight bales were shipped to Liverpool.

No matter whether a proposal to expend money is\n wise and necessary, or frivolous and wasteful, the poll-tax\n payer can vote for it with entire impunity. It is nothing to\n him whether the sum be one thousand or ten thousand dol-\n lars. Indeed, the influence of poll-tax payers is often in\n favor of the most lavish expenditures. A new road, for\n example, is proposed in town meeting. It may be quite\n unnecessary, and ought not to be made ; but the poll-tax\n payers, a large share of whom are laborers, will be immedi-\n ately benefited by the demand that will be made for labor,\n and will be very likely to go in favor of it.

The expense of collection would\n be almost nominal, probably not exceeding one-tenth of the\n sum now required ; and an army of office-holders might be\n left free to engage in productive employments. But such\n has been the state of society in some of the States in times\n past, that reliance could not be placed upon their promptly\n assessing and collecting a national tax ; nor can it be ex-\n pected that the time will soon come when such a measure\n would be practicable.\n</p>\n<p>\n TAXATION OF CREDITS.\n</p>\n<p>\n It has sometimes been maintained that credits ought not\n to be taxed, but all assessments be made upon values, or\n juoperty, personal and real. Taxes, it has been argued,\n ought not to be laid upon persons, but upon that out of\n which they can alone be paid; viz., property.\n</p>\n<p>\n But credits are taxed as well as values. A holds a farm\n worth $10,000, mortgaged to B for $5,000. A pays taxes\n upon the whole valuation, and B upon $5,000, as money at\n interest. A, it is said, is doubly taxed.

Suppose one hun-\n vlred millions sent to England, and returned in railroad\n iron, which, put into use, pays a net income of ten per cent,\n besides facilitating the transport of cotton and wheat, and\n thus adding to the national wealth. As these stocks pay\n the American holders but six per cent, and by selling them\n and investing the amount in railroads they get ten, there is\n a clear gain in income of 66|- per cent.

How long will his\n interest require that the coupons be paid ? Clearly, the\n sooner they are worthless, and the taxation they impose\n removed, the better.

The great\n struggle through which the United States has just passed,\n is one of the strongest cases that has ever been presented ;\n and yet, had the currency been sound at the commencement,\n and had a sufficiently effective system of taxation been\n adopted, there is little doubt that the war expenditures\n might have been met as incurred. It is certain that almost\n all the service and material was furnished by the country ;\n and therefore, had the taxation been so laid as to apportion\n the amount judiciously and fairly, the whole cost might\n have been provided for, and we to-day be essentially free\n from debt.

This lasted for nine years, and increased\n the debt to ^6 526,000,000. Then, in consequence of the\n Treaty of Amiens, a period of one year\u2019s peace intervened ;\n but it was only an armed truce : military preparations were\n continued, and the public debt was increased \u00a33,000,000.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1803 commenced the final struggle with Napoleon,\n which terminated in 1815, leaving the British debt at\n \u00a3865,000,000 sterling. During the twenty years following,\n \u00a387,000,000 were paid off. This was from necessity, rather\n than choice ; a measure of policy adopted to secure the\n credit of the government. In 1835, the debt was but \u00a3778,-\n 000,000 ; but the emancipation of eight hundred thousand\n slaves in the West Indies added to the debt \u00a320,000,000.\n It has stood at \u00a3800,000,000, very nearly, ever since.

But we have shown only a part of the\n system. The history of the national bank is interwoven\n with that of the national debt. It was incorporated in 1697,\n with a capital, as we have said, of \u00a31,200,000. As the\n public debt was enlarged, the capital of the bank was in-\n creased ; that is, more and mo e of the debt was incorpo-\n rated into the hank organization, until it amounts, at the\n present time, to \u00a314,475,000. This bank, as before stated,\n lias never had a shilling of capital to lend to the people ;\n it has simply held a certain amount of the national stocks,\n and, upon the credit of these, has issued its own promises\n to pay ; and these promises, having been made a legal tender\n by Parliament, have circulated as money.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0446/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 509}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0446/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1018}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0446/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1123, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0446/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2247, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4075}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0446/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0446.jp2", "height": 4075, "width": 2247, "levels": 6, "size": 526558}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"446\">\n<p>\n 868\n</p>\n<p>\n DISTRIBUTION.\n</p>\n<p>\n [book 17.\n</p>\n<p>\n The government has no interest whatever in the bank, so\n far as its profits are concerned ; but it has always stood by\n it, sustained it by its influence and legislation, besides allow-\n ing a large annual sum for its services, in paying the divi-\n dends on the public debt. When the bank was obliged to\n suspend payment, in 1797, the government came to its\n rescue, by legalizing the act ; and the bank went on issuing\n its notes during the twenty-three years that followed, and\n sometimes to an amount so excessive, that gold was carried\n up to a premium of twenty-five to forty per cent : generally,\n however, during this period, the difference was small, \u2014 some\n ten to fifteen per cent. The last feature to be noticed in\n this connection is that system of indirect taxation which\n became so general and efficient under the new financial\n policy. Duties, as we have said, were laid upon every\n description of foreign merchandise, and excise upon all\n articles of home production. This measure was indispensa-\n ble to the full development of the system. When the\n masses of the people can be taxed in such a manner that\n they are almost unconscious at the moment that they are\n taxed at all ; when the amount taken is in very small sums,\n so that, if the fact were understood, it would hardly be\n appreciated ; when the aggregate amount for a month or a\n year cannot be ascertained, except approximately, and then\n only by long and intricate calculation, \u2014 taxation may be\n carried to its utmost possible limit, so far as to leave to the\n poorer classes only the bare necessaries of life. Such a\n people may feel that they are very poor, but they will regard\n this as the consequence of their low wages ; they may feel\n that they are oppressed, but will naturally attribute it to\n the want of justice or generosity on the part of their\n employers. The true cause of their poverty and suffering\n they do not perceive.

This\n should be a fundamental principle in civil polity ; and, if law\n may interfere in this matter at all, it may do so to any\n extent the public interest shall demand.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. McCulloch,* in his \u2018\u2018 Principles of Political Econ-\n omy\u201d (page 267), says: \u201cEvery man should have such a\n reasonable power over the disposal of his property as may\n be necessary to excite his industry, and to inspire him with\n a desire of accumulating. But if, in order to carry this\n principle to the furthest extent, individuals are allowed to\n chalk out an endless series of heirs, and to prescribe the\n conditions under which they shall successively hold the\n property, it would be taken entirely out of the market ; it\n might be prevented from ever coming into the hands of\n those who would turn it to the best account ; and it could\n neither be farmed nor managed in any way, however advan-\n tageous, that happened to be inconsistent with the will.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. McCulloch here recognizes the correct principle ; viz.,\n that the interests of those who are laboring and suffering\n now, are paramount to the whims and caprices of those who\n have passed from the stage of action ; in other words, that\n the earth belongs to the living, and not to the dead.

G-ibbon describes the towers, citadels,\n and palaces of Rome as built on the foundations of the\n ancient temples, theatres, and arches. We can draw a\n figure thence to our modern industry. The fortunes of one\n generation often rise from the failures of that which went\n before. If we trace the history of many of the most\n flourishing establishments, we shall find them resting at\n last on some great outlay of capital, or expenditure of labor,\n that ruined some man or corporation, and finally went to\n pay taxes or office rent. Such has been the fate of many\n of the railroads of the United States ; so much so, that it\n has passed into a proverb that such stock must be sunk once\n to pay at all. A railroad is established, starts with brilliant\n prospects, and, after a descending course for a few years,\n arrives at bankruptcy. Even so, when the stock can be had\n for nothing, it may not pay for running, and lies idle, or\n half run. But perhaps the industry of the country takes\n a sudden start, or pushes up gradually, finds the old track\n there, and demands that its goods be carried to market.\n The experiment is made ; and soon the road is worked to its\n utmost capacity, enriching holders, who had forgotten the\n existence of their stock.\n</p>\n<p>\n The same thing occurs frequently in the course of indi-\n vidual enterprises.

There are cases where industry, instead\n of coming back to re-animate the lifeless body by sudden\n movements, forsakes even the habitations it has delighted\n in ; and the machinery of to-day becomes old-fashioned\n and useless under the surprising inventions of to-morrow.\n Every locality has its \u2018\u2018 folly,\u201d named from some hapless\n adventurer, who undertook more than he could carry, and\n which has reached a death from which there is no resurrec-\n tion. Long lines of railroad stretch across the country,\n forsaken, apparently for ever, of passengers or freight.\n Mills and factories stand tenantless till they crumble.\n These only enumerate the gigantic failures of industry ;\n while the amount of labor and capital misapplied in ordi-\n nary ways is beyond computation. The three causes for\n these industrial misadventures are as follows : \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n 1st, Capital is fallible in its calculations.

Men, in originating enterprises, sanguine in\n feeling, and exhilarated by the possession of large capital,\n almost invariably indulge in a scale of outlay which the\n return does not justify. They find it unpleasant or undig-\n nified to omit any thing from the completeness of preparation\n out of considerations of economy. The result is, that the\n expense of starting drags on them through the wliole course,\n and perhaps ruins them. They are kept down all the time\n by the original outlay, and often have to vacate their\n magnificent establishments for the entrance of parties who,\n getting them at half price, can afibrd to keep and work\n them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3d, Another reason is found in those accidents or great\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0464/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 509}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0464/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1018}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0464/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1123, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0464/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2247, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4075}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0464/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0464.jp2", "height": 4075, "width": 2247, "levels": 6, "size": 477498}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"464\">\n<p>\n 386\n</p>\n<p>\n CONSUMPTION.\n</p>\n<p>\n [book V.\n</p>\n<p>\n developments which transfer business from one seat to\n another, just as wells give out with no apparent cause.\n The axis of commerce shifts its place, and leaves tropical\n bones and tropical fruit high on the northern hills.\n</p>\n<p>\n What shall we do in our discussion with such invest-\n ments of labor and capital ?

A fine house is certainly as much a\n luxury as fine clothes or costly wines ; so are statuary and\n paintings ; so are a vast number of articles of common con-\n sumption in every condition of life. It is quite clear, too,\n that what would be esteemed a great extravagance in the\n royal establishment of Dahomey would be far otherwise in\n the humblest dwelling of Europe. The wigwam and the cot-\n tage exhibit very different phases of luxury. The loathsome\n poisons of \u201c Gin Lane \u201d are as truly luxuries, perhaps in the\n sense of Webster more so, than the \u2018\u2018rich wines\u201d and \u201cdeli-\n cious liquors \u201d of the palace.

Luxury in the commu-\n nity is indulgence in those expenditures which are beyond\n the reacli of the great mass of the people : luxury in the\n individual is indulgence in those expenditures which are\n beyond the strict necessities of maintenance, according to\n the customs of the social or economic class to which he\n belongs. It is not luxury for the ambassador of a nation\n to pay thousands of dollars for a great disagreeable state\n carriage, if the etiquette of court prescribes it : it is lux-\n ury for a laborer to pay five cents for a ride to his work, if\n he could as well walk.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of course, this standard will vary in different countries,\n the inhabitants of one being able to command many indul-\n gences which are denied to others. The luxuries of\n Europe are daily fare in Asia, while articles of common de-\n cency in an Irish hovel are unknown in the court of Delhi.\n Nor only this : the scale of luxury changes with every year.\n</p>\n<p>\n 26\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0466/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 509}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0466/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1018}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0466/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1123, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0466/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2247, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4075}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0466/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0466.jp2", "height": 4075, "width": 2247, "levels": 6, "size": 514183}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"466\">\n<p>\n 388\n</p>\n<p>\n CONSUMPTION.\n</p>\n<p>\n [book V.\n</p>\n<p>\n Those articles which in one generation indicate wealth,\n become common property in the next.

It is not the gifts\n of nature, nor the constraints of law, that heap up the\n stores of value. It is the force with which man moves to\n production, wholly determined, as that is, by his economic\n desires. The luxury of European courts has no elevating\n influence upon the masses : quite otherwise. Robbed to fur-\n nish the means of others, they are hopeless of ever attain-\n ing to such fortune themselves. But where the grades of\n society are fixed only by differences of natural endowment,\n and so are moderate and regular, rising by easy steps, the\n entire population becomes inspired with the purpose of\n reaching a higher position. In such a state, the imagina-\n tion can hardly run ahead of wealth.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have, then, attained the principle, that luxurious con-\n sumption, while it directly gives no help to industry, but\n rather spends in one hour\u2019s enjoyment the provision of\n months or years, may yet, by its influence on man\u2019s desires,\n create a productive force which shall make its extravagance\n seem economy, its waste appear frugality itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n But this is only true of harmonious, temperate, and well-\n proportioned luxury.

Many as are the unfortunate\n possibilities which attend upon production and distribution,\n they are all inferior in interest to the momentous decisions\n of consumption ; and here in luxury, as we find the spring\n of all beneficent activity, we also find the root of all eco-\n nomic evils. So vast and so important are the issues here\n involved, that many of them are taken away from the politi-\n cal economist by the statesman or the moralist.

Some men remain eagerly devoted to gain, when\n their wealth is counted in millions : others retire, satisfied\n with the most moderate competency. The force of either\n motive will be greatly influenced, both by the security and\n the profitableness of investments. Every thing that renders\n business unsafe, makes withdrawal more desirable.

But such reasons should\n appear clearly. Nothing should be taken arbitrarily, or for\n contingent use. Man is the direct producer, and the product\n remains in his hands. If government, as indirectly engaged\n with him, enters with a claim to share the profits, it must\n show cause distinctly for whatever it takes. It is the part\n of the statesman, not of the economist, to judge of occasions\n like these.\n</p>\n<p>\n Having defined the right of government economically to\n participate in wealth, two considerations naturally precede\n the discussion of methods : \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n 1st, Government should undertake nothing that can be\n left to individual enterprise.\n</p>\n<p>\n If we admit that the difficulties which surround industry\n are imposed for our good, and form a part of our discipline\n and culture, political society palpably acts on a false idea\n when it relieves the citizen of his own proper responsibil-\n ity, care, or labor, and assumes his natural duties. This,\n however, is not the only reason against such interference.\n Government never does the work of individuals as well as\n it can be done by individuals.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is related of Herodes Atticus, that, having come upon a\n great treasure concealed in the ground, he took it to Nerva,\n and pressed it on his acceptance, saying, \u2018\u2018 it was too con-\n siderable for a subject to use.\u201d \u2014 \u201cAbuse it, then,\u201d replied\n the emperor. The anecdote has great significance as to the\n employment of wealth. Its abuse by the citizen is almost\n preferable to its use by the state. If government were\n conceived to be always wise, it would still be better, on the\n whole, that citizens should direct their own industrial mat-\n ters, wisely or unwisely, as might happen. ^ But, when the\n liability of government to err is confessed, we have a double\n argument against taking the fee or use of wealth out of\n</p>\n<p>\n 27\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0482/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 509}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0482/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1018}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0482/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1123, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0482/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2247, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4075}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0482/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0482.jp2", "height": 4075, "width": 2247, "levels": 6, "size": 517209}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"482\">\n<p>\n 404\n</p>\n<p>\n CONSUMPTION.\n</p>\n<p>\n [book V.\n</p>\n<p>\n private hands.

There is no broken piece of humanity in the\n mire of poverty and crime on which the proudest of earth\n can place his foot, and not crush God\u2019s image.

Especially should the public sense discourage\n and banish that shameless and obtrusive mendicancy by\n which the bold and bad snatch away the portion of the\n weak, the honest, the retiring poor.

THE FINANCE OF WAR.\n</p>\n<p>\n The finance of war is greatly perplexed to the popular mind\n by one fallacy, which is, that a vastly greater amount of\n money is needed in time of war than of peace. Bewildered\n by this notion, than which none can be more absurd, the\n public are easily induced to sanction a whole class of\n measures that would be generally recognized as injurious in\n ordinary times, but are imagined to have some virtue to\n bring out a greater amount of money to meet the supposed\n emergencies of war. The truth of it is, if we suppose no\n extra importation of foreign material for consumption (and\n nineteen-twentieths of the expenditures of all wars are for\n domestic labor and material), there is no larger production,\n no more commodities to be exchanged, no more services to\n be rewarded, and consequently no more occasion for the use\n of money.\n</p>\n<p>\n But government now becomes the great operator, employs\n perhaps ten times its usual number of agents, expends ten\n times its usual resources. It then has need of more\n money : but as it only takes the place of former employers,\n of former consumers, so it only needs to take their place in\n the receipt of money ; and that may be effected by prompt,\n equal, and thorough taxation, \u2014 taxation, too, conducted by\n the established methods, and in accordance with such prin-\n ciples as we have laid down. A state of war, therefore,\n instead of being, as it is usually made, a reason for depart-\n ing from the ordinary rules of public economy, is an\n additional reason for adhering closely to them in every\n particular.\n</p>\n<p>\n War is a business as much as agriculture.

This is all that is needed in either; nor is\n there the least difference in the two, considered as modes of\n production : their principles and methods are the same. It\n is only when considered as modes of consumption that they\n have separate relations to the science of wealth. Raising\n money \u2019\u2019 has been generally accepted as the great business\n of a nation in war ; but it is no more so than in ordinary\n times.

In the advance of\n civilization, it has been found more expedient, as it is more\n just, that government should purchase all it consumes in\n war, obtaining the means in money by taxation.

In November, 1861, the British Government\n had, in process of building^ fifty-four steamships of war,\n with a tonnage 95,855, with 10,930-horse power, and 1,254\n guns. On the 8th of March following, the Confederate\n ram \u201c Merrimack\u2019\u2019 appeared in Hampton Roads, and in a few\n minutes, with its formidable prow, sent to the bottom the\n \u2018\u2018 Congress\u201d and the \u201c Cumberland,\u201d two of the finest vessels\n in the navy of the United States, and demonstrated that, in\n the future, no reliance could be made upon wooden vessels\n in naval warfare. This great fact disposed of wooden\n walls On the next day, the Monitor,\u201d with her turret, en-\n tered the Roads, engaged the \u201c Merrimack,\u201d and she, in her\n turn, fell before a\u2019 new and still more powerful enginery.\n Iron sides were no sufficient protection against the turret.\n This was the second important fact; and, together, they\n turned the whole current of preparation for naval warfare\n in a new, ay and much more costly, direction.\n</p>\n<p>\n These considerations have most important economic bear-\n ings ; but their political significance is still greater. In the\n first place, they destroyed the vast supremacy which Eng\n land had held up to that time.

Hence, if it is known or suspected that\n France is making an addition to her navy, England at once\n makes as large or larger one to hers. And, having done\n this, is either any safer than before ? Are not both as rela-\n tively defenceless as ever f But France lays down still other\n keels, and the dockyards of England are again in motion,\n until the fleets of both are yet further enlarged ; but has\n the relative condition of either, as to security, been im-\n proved ? Has not each increased its means of aggression as\n well as defence?\n</p>\n<p>\n That which is true of France and England is true of all\n the nations of Christendom. Russia does her utmost to\n create a vast navy. Austria, Prussia, Turkey, Sweden, do\n all in their power to prepare for war^ however great the bur\n den and sacrifice. And yet does this general system of\n mutual armaments make them any more safe, respectively,\n than if no such preparations were made by either ?

That portion is called \u201c capi-\n tal : \u201d that application is reproductive consumption.\n</p>\n<p>\n It has been shown that mankind are continually wearing\n out their wealth ; indeed, that it wears out by natural\n causes, independently of use ; and that therefore, if men\n would not become destitute, they must make constant, un\n ceasing efforts after fresh production.\n</p>\n<p>\n But it is a principle of our nature to do what we have to\n , do with as little labor as possible ; that is, with as much\n help as possible. Now, it is found true, that, by employing\n present wealth, production is easier and larger, even after\n the amount so used has been replaced. For this reason,\n men take freely of what they have, and destroy it to-day\n that they may get a greater good to-morrow. This is the\n only reason why capital is used. The first capital was\n created without capital. Why should not all succeeding\n creations be brought about likewise ? Because it is found\n to save human labor and multiply human enjoyments to\n devote the present to the future.\n</p>\n<p>\n But this application of capital presupposes the constancy\n of nature. Men would not put grain into the ground unless\n they had the assurance of a return. Every act of this kind\n requires faith, \u2014 is an act of faith.\n</p>\n<p>\n But even yet we have not secured reproductive consump-\n tion.

A positive force operates on the pos-\n sessor to consume it at once ; and he will do so as surely as\n a hungry lion will tear his prey, unless something more than\n brutal instinct of immediate self-gratification is found in the\n man. What is that which can stand up against the craving\n of immediate wants, and keep them away from wealth, that\n it may be devoted to other uses ? It is not necessarily a\n high moral quality. It may be purely selfish. It may look\n on to the gratification of personal desires only. It may\n entertain no benevolent designs, nor \u2018be capable of any sacri-\n fice for others. All its denial may be in its own interest.\n Yet we say that it is wise and brave and commendable. It\n is the principle of frugality.

It is needless to say that\n the latter is the cheapest and best, under any condition, for\n capital. And this may be continued until the limits of cap-\n ital are filled.

The ad-\n vance of industrial power, in commerce and manufactures,\n not only furnishes direct assistance in agriculture, but re-\n leases, if required, a great amount of labor for the latter\n pursuit. As is the amount of labor applied to land, so is\n the yield, the world over. The England of to-day is vastly\n more fertile than that of the Heptarchy, the Norman con-\n quests, or the civil wars. Nor are all its capacities of pro-\n duction exhausted. It has now millions of acres unre-\n claimed, which are susceptible of cultivation. It is no an-\n swer to this to say that they will not pay for reclaiming.\n That merely .shows that English labor has now a more prof-\n itable employment. We are discussing only the absolute\n capabilities of the soil. With the known laws of agricul-\n ture, prudently followed, the produce of any country should\n advance in a certain and considerable ratio. Besides, we\n know not what new agents of fertilization may be discov-\n ered, or what shorter methods may be devised for applying\n power.

So long as the\n increase of capital, i.e food, clothes, and shelter, for the\n laboring class, is possible, the natural advance in the wants\n of the community, coming out of growing numbers, will\n determine a still larger share to reproductive consumption ;\n will call off more and more from play to work.

Such has been the case with the\n North- American Indians, who, as we are told by Dr. Robert-\n son and others, rear seldom more than two children to a\n family, and often none.

These serve to retard the\n progress of population, though not necessarily to throw it\n backward. France under the old regime, England through\n her most sanguinary civil conflicts, still held on their way in\n wealth and numbers ; but Campania by excessive taxation,\n Belgium by religious persecution, Germany in the Thirty\n Years\u2019 War, Prussia under the great struggles of Frederick,\n fell off widely in both respects. It really seems too bad to\n quote, but many writers have ventured to suppose that war\n was God\u2019s own method of restraining population! The\n money spent in any war would, ten times over, support all\n the men killed in it ; if, indeed, the destruction of the able-\n bodied could be supposed to take any thing from the difficulty\n of subsistence, especially when their helpless dependants\n remain. How the war-system affects population may be\n shown in an instance. Nearly half a million of young men\n in France are required to serve in the army from the ages\n of eighteen to twenty-five. This embraces the period at\n which the occupations of life are usually chosen, marriage\n contracted, and domestic habits formed. At the end of their\n service, they are thrown out on society with the vices of the\n camp and the restlessness of military life, with no position\n in life secured, and no occupation learned. The results have\n been plainly visible in diminishing from year to year the\n ratio of increase in population.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5th, The fifth cause which we shall notice is altogether\n different in its origin and character. The others have all\n been on the brutal side of^man, operating by misery and\n want. This works in alliance with the nobler part of his\n being, and is of a kind with reason. It is self-restraint.\n In a degree, indeed, a great part of the world exeicises\n this.

It is\n difficult to appreciate even that which we know might be.\n There is no economical reason why every people on the face\n of the earth should not be rich, prosperous, and independ-\n ent ; every person free, comfortable, ambitious, with plenty\n at hand, and every thing to hope for.

If the grand result\n seems hopelessly distant, every step towards it does yet re-\n ceive its reward ; every effort brings something of fruition.\n No government or individual conforms, for a single act, to\n right principles of consumption ; but the community gains\n palpably by it : perhaps the \u201c last straw \u201d of taxation is re-\n moved, or a capitalist offers employment to a starving work-\n man.\n</p>\n<p>\n There have been efforts to restrict political economy, so\n that it should have no occasion to ask these questions ; to\n cut off all that view which looks out on the field of repro-\n duction ; to shut up our inquiries to the immediate, present\n creation of wealth, its exchange, distribution, and consump-\n tion, without regard to ultimate effects, and considering\n one article of value as equally commendable with any for\n which it will exchange.

Each has its proper place\n in the economy of the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n Gold has no price, because it is price itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the constitutional currency of the United States, gold of standard\n fineness always has one price. It can have no other ; Congress having or-\n dained, that 25 grains of gold, nine-tenths fine, shall be a coin called\n a dollar, and the people having accepted that as the unit of value.

A few\n persons, who. bestowed careful attention upon the subject, discovered\n very clearly the unfavorable influence of a mixed currency upon the\n pecuniary interests of California ; but the masses were unconscious of\n the extent of the injuries they suffered.\n</p>\n<p>\n The war, however, brought the whole matter out in bold relief, after\n the suspension of specie payments by the government and banks, and\n the simultaneous act of Congress, by which treasury-notes were made a\n legal tender.\n</p>\n<p>\n California, in accordance with a provision in her Constitution, had an\n exclusively metallic currency.

The\n aggregate loss to this gold-producing State is undoubtedly very great.\n If the State has produced, up to this time (October, 1867), one thousand\n millions in gold, as is nearly the fact, and has lost upon the whole, in\n consequence of the use of mixed currency in the Union with which she is\n connected, but fifteen per cent, the aggregate would be one hundred\n and fifty millions ; a heavy loss for a young State encountering all the ex-\n pense and hardships incident to the first settlement of a country. This\n loss has been estimated at a much greater sum by one of her own citi-\n zens, John Alexander Ferris, Esq., in his \u201c Financial Economy of the\n United States Illustrated,\u201d published in San Francisco and New York,\n 1867 ; to which able work we would refer our readers for a full view of\n the subject in its various bearings.\n</p>\n<p>\n From the foregoing statement, it will be seen, that an antagonistic\n interest has been created between the gold-producing and non-gold-pro-\n ducing States which will be likely to terminate in a struggle between the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0554/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 509}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0554/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1018}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0554/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1123, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0554/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2247, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4075}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0554/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0554.jp2", "height": 4075, "width": 2247, "levels": 6, "size": 502437}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"554\">\n<p>\n 476\n</p>\n<p>\n APPENDIX.\n</p>\n<p>\n parties.

It was slight at first, \u2014 the highest point for some\n months but about five per cent. After the 1st of July following, it began\n to rise rapidly, until, before the close of the year, it had advanced to 37^\n per cent. From that time forward, the fluctuations were rapid, and often\n violent.

It is always pre-\n cisely at par. Premium, as a term applied to gold, simply expresses the\n depreciation of the standard by which it is measured, and is more prop-\n erly a discount on the latter than a premium on the former. It is\n customary, however, to speak of the premium on gold, without reference\n to the standard by which it is measured.\n</p>\n<p>\n The gold premium, as it has existed in the United States since 1862,\n may be said to have been influenced by six different causes : \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. The Inconvertibility and Redundancy of the Currency, \u2014 The moment\n a currency becomes inconvertible on demand, gold will command a pre-\n mium. The banks and national treasury having suspended on the 31st\n December, 1861, for the first four months of 1862 the premium on gold\n averaged only about three per cent ; and, had there actually been at that\n time no larger amount of currency than would have existed if the cur-\n rency were a wholly metallic or certified one, the premium would not\n have gone beyond three to five per cent : but the currency was at this\n time somewhat redundant, and was rapidly augmented, until 200 per\n cent above its natural volume.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. A second cause^ or element^ was the discredit of the Government. \u2014\n From the first, there was some fear that the Rebellion might succeed. In\n that case, the Union would be broken up ; and whether the loyal States\n would go on together, or separate into several different confederacies or\n nationalities, was a matter of great uncertainty. Therefore a large\n degree of suspicion attached to the promises of the government, and the\n public credit fluctuated with the fortunes of the war.\n</p>\n<p>\n At times the national credit was exceedingly depressed : as, for ex-\n ample, during the first three months of 1863, subsequent to the disastrous\n events around Fredericksburg; and again when Pennsylvania was\n invaded, just prior to the victories of Gettysburg and Vicksburg ; and,\n lastly, in the gloomy winter of 1864, and during General Grant\u2019s cam-\n paign against Richmond, fighting the battles of the Wilderness, Spotsyl-\n vania, Cold Harbor, & c. This discredit was at times so great as to\n cause large shipments of specie to Europe, for safe keeping, by those .\n who did not dare to trust their funds at home. This may be seen in the\n excess of exports over imports in the years of 1863 and 1864, and the large\n amount of gold exported in those years (^Financial Report, 1864, p. 273).\n That this discredit of the national securities arose from the uncertainty\n of the manner in which the war might terminate, is proved by the rapid\n and permanent decline of the gold premium as soon as the rebel armies\n had surrendered.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

The\n premium advanced with great rapidity, from 97 on the 17th of June,\n 1864, the day the bill was passed, to 180 on the 1st of the next month.\n Although Congress soon discovered its error, and made haste to retrace\n its steps, repealing the mischievous law on the 6th of July, great\n damage accrued to the national credit, and the interests of the country\n generally.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The Operations of Treasury Department . \u2014 We will first refer to\n the condition of the treasury in the second quarter of 1863. Congress\n had, during its session closing March 4 of that year, placed in the\n hands of the Secretary of the Treasury power to issue bonds, compound-\n interest notes, and greenbacks, \u2014 in all, with what he had on hand,\n $1,200,000,000. This raised the credit of the government. The 5-20\n bonds at six per cent sold with wonderful rapidity ; and the premium on\n gold, which at the adjournment of Congress, on the 4th of March,\n was 65, fell to 40. The victories of Gettysburg and Vicksburg carried\n the premium down to 23^ during the month of J uly following. The sale\n of the 5-20\u2019s having been made so successfully, the minister of finance\n changed his policy, and instead of issuing his 10-40\u2019s at six per cent, as\n he had been authorized to do, reduced the rate to five per cent.\n</p>\n<p>\n This proved a disastrous experiment. The sale of bonds fell off at\n once from two millions per day to only a tenth of that sum. But that\n was not all, or the worst : for, by reducing the rate of interest from six\n to five, the Secretary virtually depreciated his own currency by the dif-\n ference, because it required $1.20 in greenbacks to purchase an equal\n income or interest at five per cent, which $1.00 would purchase of bonds\n bearing interest at six per cent; and consequently the gold premium\n rose 20 per cent. This falling-off in the sale of the bonds necessitated\n the issue of legal-tender notes, which raising prices greatly increased\n the expenses of the government.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then, again, the Secretary had authority to issue four hundred million\n dollars in compound-interest notes at six per cent, of such denomina-\n tions as would be adapted to the wants of the government In paying off\n the troops and contractors. These, if thus issued, it was believed, and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0559/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 276, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0559/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 553, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0559/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1107, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0559/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2215, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0559/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0559.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2215, "levels": 6, "size": 520071}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"559\">\n<p>\n APPENDIX.\n</p>\n<p>\n 479\n</p>\n<p>\n as subsequent events proved, would be speedily hoarded; and thus,\n while they did not expand the currency essentially, inflate prices, or in-\n terfere with the sale of the bonds, would operate as a six per cent loan\n to the government, payable in currency. But the Secretary took a dif-\n ferent course from the one intended by Congress. He issued fifty mil-\n lion dollars at five per cent on two years, in fifty-dollar notes and\n upwards.\n</p>\n<p>\n These, all or mostly, went directly into the banks of Philadelphia,\n New York, and Boston, where they displaced and drove into circulation\n fifty million dollars of greenbacks and bank-notes. This, it will be seen,\n instead of benefiting the treasury, absolutely made matters worse, ex-\n panding the circulation and raising prices, when government was\n making purchases at the rate of one or two millions per day ; so that,\n notwithstanding the brilliant successes in war just referred to, gold be-\n fore long went up to 100. Of the six per cent compound-interest notes\n adapted to circulation, the Secretary issued none for some fifteen months\n after he was authorized to do so, and then only fifteen million dollars.\n These were paid out by the government, and were immediately hoarded.\n They disappeared at once, showing most conclusively that they answered\n precisely the object sought to be obtained by the issue of them. More\n of these compound-interest notes were subsequently issued by Secretary\n Fessenden. But they were of large denominations*, and went mostly\n into the banks, where, contrary to law, they were held as a legal-tender\n reserve ; and in so far the design of Congress in authorizing their issue\n was utterly thwarted. Had the whole amount authorized been issued\n promptly, as fast as they were wanted to pay the current expenses of\n government, the necessity of issuing greenbacks would to a great\n extent have been avoided ; and such an enormous rise of premium and\n prices as took place in 1863-4, in consequence of their excessive issue,\n would have been prevented.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Sales of Gold by the Secretary of the Treasury. \u2014 But, as another\n and very important matter, we must notice the direct operations of the\n Secretary of the Treasury in the gold market.\n</p>\n<p>\n Owing to the fact that the gold received for duties amounted to a\n much larger sum than necessary to pay current interest upon the bonds\n issued, the treasury had a large amount at its disposal; so large, that\n if the Secretary were disposed to enter the market, in technical language,\n as \u201c A BEAR,\u201d he could to a great extent determine what the price of\n gold should be at any given moment. He was authorized to sell gold,\n and has done so ; holding, as he has oftentimes done, fifty to seventy-five\n millions, he has been able to bear down the market below what it would\n be if there were no such vast accumulation at his disposal. It would\n seem, by his acts, that he has deemed it for the public interest to keep\n the ' price of gold as low as possible.

And the last we believe to be nearly its natural value, as\n measured by our superabundant currency.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Speculation . \u2014 Another cause of variations in the gold premium\n arose from the action of speculators.\n</p>\n<p>\n History probably afibrds no parallel upon so extensive a scale of op-\n erations. Millions were made or lost in a day in New York, the great\n centre, by fluctuations in the market, occasioned often by the acts of\n speculators themselves, combining to raise or depress the premium by\n starting rumors, favorable or adverse, as their particular interest might\n dictate ; yet as the premium, with various alternations, was constantly\n advancing, until it attained the well-known elevation of 185 per cent, it\n is obvious there were abundant opportunities for the realization of for-\n tunes by those shrewd enough to take advantage of passing events. But\n it should be remembered, that speculation is to be mainly regarded as\n one of the natural effects of an abnormal state of affairs, incident to a\n forced credit currency, and the hazards and uncertainties of a long and\n doubtful conflict, rather than a permanent cause of high premium.\n There is little speculation now, because there is comparatively little\n uncertainty in regard to national affairs. The contingencies of war have\n passed by.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lastly, we may remark that the price of gold, like that of any other\n article, has been influenced by demand and supply; as, for example,\n when the article was especially wanted for export, or to pay duties ; or,\n on the other hand, when large amounts were paid off for coupons, or re-\n ceived from the mines.\n</p>\n<p>\n All these various considerations must be taken into account, if we\n would form a correct opinion of the causes which have had the effect to\n raise or depress the premium on gold for the last five years.\n</p>\n<p>\n INFLUENCE OF THE GOLD PREMIUM ON PRICES.\n</p>\n<p>\n Prices, since the suspension of specie payments, have been greatly\n influenced by the existing premium on gold. In the years 1863 and 1864\n especially, gold was potential in determining the price of commodities.\n They rose and fell with it. Since the close of the war, on the other\n hand, prices in general have been little affected by the gold premium,\n except in regard to foreign imports, which of course have corresponded\n in cost to the value of gold, because premium is an element of the cost.\n Rut other commodities do not feel these fluctuations, as during the war.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0561/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 276, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0561/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 553, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0561/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1107, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0561/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2215, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0561/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0561.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2215, "levels": 6, "size": 555185}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"561\">\n<p>\n APPENDIX.\n</p>\n<p>\n 481\n</p>\n<p>\n Why not? Evidently, because domestic products, not required for\n export, are measured by the domestic currency alone. The reason why,\n during the years 1863 and 1864, all \u2018prices kept pace with the price of\n gold was, that, the currency and securities of the government being\n greatly discredited, gold was regarded as the really only safe investment\n and standard of value. Greenbacks were merely the promise of value,\n the fulfilment of which was doubtful. Gold had reliable value in itself,\n and therefore was largely hoarded, and,* as we have seen, exported, in\n the two years just mentioned, to the extent of more than one hundred\n million of dollars. Except so far as foreign products are concerned,\n gold does not now (1867) influence the value of commodities in general,\n any more than flour, or any other article of merchandise ; for it is itself,\n under present circumstances, as truly merchandise as corn or cotton.\n</p>\n<p>\n EFFECT OF GOLD DISCOVERIES ON TRADE WITH THE EAST.\n</p>\n<p>\n The economical advantages derived from the increase in gold pro-\n duction, if there be any of much account, accrues mostly to the people\n of the East, \u2014 to India, China, & c. As they use coin exclusively, the\n surplus gold production of Christendom naturally flows off to them. By\n the unwonted influx of the precious metals, their products are advanced\n in value ; and, for all their exports to Europe and the United States, they\n get greater prices. As they export more commodities than they import,\n they receive the balance in gold and silver.\n</p>\n<p>\n From information furnished by a mercantile house in Boston, engaged\n in the India trade, we construct the following table, showing the, price\n of seven of the chief exports of Calcutta, for the first five years after the\n gold discovery, viz. 1850 to 1854, inclusive ; and for the last five years,\n up to 1867.

An immense amount of labor was\n at once diverted from various departments of industry to the new busi-\n ness. Capital to an enormous amount was invested in the same en-\n terprise. The whole trade and industry of the world was laid under\n contribution by the great movement ; and production, in all the countries\n from which the miners and capital were drawn, was of course, by so\n much, diminished. Neither the men nor the capital were unemployed\n before ; and now they only changed from one employment to another.\n</p>\n<p>\n Perhaps it may be said, that the business of mining was vastly more\n profitable than the ordinary occupations in which labor and capital are\n employed, and therefore there was a greater production of value, and\n therefore an extension of commerce by so much. But that is the point\n to be proved. It is disbelieved by those who have examined the matter\n most carefully, that mining has, on the whole and in the long-run, been\n more profitable than other industry. If every thing were taken into ac-\n count, it is uncertain whether there has been any extraordinary increase\n of general production in consequence of the new discoveries of gold.\n</p>\n<p>\n The question in this case really is, Has the grand total of those utilities\n which men desire, and which contribute to their welfare and happiness,\n been increased by the gold discoveries in California? No doubt the\n wealth of the world, when reckoned in dollars^ has been increased by\n these discoveries, because more dollars have been created, both metallic\n and paper; and those dollars have raised prices. But have the utilities\n of the world been multiplied in consequence of the increase of gold ?\n</p>\n<p>\n About $1,600,000,000 have probably been added (from California and\n Australia) to the currency and bullion of the world. Of this amount,\n the United States has furnished an average of, say, about $50,000,000\n per annum from 1849 to 1867.\n</p>\n<p>\n The whole annual production of wealth, or values of every kind, in the\n United States, has been estimated as high as $4,000,000,000 per annum ;\n but, assuming it has averaged since the gold discoveries (1849) but\n $3,000,000,000, then the gold production has been just one-sixtieth of\n the whole production of the country, or exactly two per cent. We\n should presume this to be a large estimate of the proportion of gold to\n the sum total of values created in the United States annually. If so, we\n can see what the relative importance of gold-mining, as a bi*anch of in-\n dustry, in the United States is.\n</p>\n<p>\n The proportion of gold production in the British empire is still less\n than with us. If this be so, we can make an aproximate estimate as to the\n proportion which gold-mining in Australia and California, as a branch of\n production, bears to the aggregate production of the world ; and we shall\n safely conclude that it is only a fraction of one per cent.\n</p>\n<p>\n But it may be urged in reply to all this, that gold-mining has created\n a large and populous State on the Pacific, which would not have existed\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0565/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 276, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0565/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 553, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0565/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1107, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0565/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2215, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ie:nc:eo:fw:ea:lt:hm:00:wa:lk:_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0:scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0565/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ie/nc/eo/fw/ea/lt/hm/00/wa/lk/_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0/scienceofwealthm00walk_0_0565.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2215, "levels": 6, "size": 525438}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"565\">\n<p>\n APPENDIX.\n</p>\n<p>\n 485\n</p>\n<p>\n but for the gold discoveries, and caused a more rapid settlement of\n California (and the same may be said of Australia) than would have\n otherwise taken place ; but that does not prove that gold-mining enriches\n a State faster than other forms of industry.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is a pertinent fact, that the agricultural capacity of the country has\n been found so great, that cultivation rather than mining is fast becom-\n ing the most important industrial interest, and that the former may soon\n become the most extensive, because the most profitable, business in Cali-\n fornia.\n</p>\n<p>\n But it maybe further urged, that \u201c there has been an unwonted ex-\n tension of commerce since the gold discoveries.\u201d Very true; but so\n there would have been, had no such discoveries taken place.
