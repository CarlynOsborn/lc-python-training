There have been many queries and much\n discussion as to their significance and their relative\n value.

She alone of the girls of\n the family is taught to read. When she becomes ten\n or twelve years old, her father, mother and nearest\n relatives take her to the great temple. They go with\n the priest into the inner shrine. The girl places her\n hand in the idol\u2019s hand, the priest repeats certain\n prayers and charms. He then hangs a wreath of cow\u00ac\n rie shells around the girl\u2019s neck and the poor little\n thing repeats after him her marriage vow, which vow is\n to prostitute herself to any pilgrim to the shrine who\n demands it.* The position of these religious prostitutes\n in Hindoo society is so highly respectable that no festi\u00ac\n val or wedding is celebrated without their presence.\n They are asked to tie the wifely ornaments on the neck\n of the bride. They, being married to a god, can never\n be widowed, and their touch is lucky.

The primary work of the Society for the Prop\u00ac\n agation of the Gospel was among the colonists, though\n it began to gather in the natives and to extend its bor\u00ac\n ders, while the Church Missionary Society began with\n heathen lands, each establishing clergy and schools\n wherever their emissaries went, the clergymen\u2019s wives\n doing their share according to their powers and oppor\u00ac\n tunities, and ladies joining them to assist in school\u00ac\n keeping.\n</p>\n<p>\n When George Augustus Selwyn set forth to New\n Zealand he carried with him a very effective assistant\n in his wife. Many of the Maoris were by this time\n nominal Christians, and her work was to train the\n women and girls so as to fit them to be wives to the\n native catechists and clergy and to raise them above\n being the bearers of all burdens\u2014so that a chief was\n seen riding across a river on the shoulders of his wife\n to save his new patent-leather boots! Sir William\n Martyn, the judge, was the head for many years of\n the theological college for native clergy, and his wife\n was a most useful assistant. Her letters, as well as\n Mrs. Selwyn\u2019s, give most amusing descriptions of the\n life of teaching.

JANE WHATELEY, ONE OF ITS VICE-\n PRESIDENTS.*\n</p>\n<p>\n Fifty-nine years ago, in the summer of 1834, a\n little company of ladies were assembled in a private\n drawing-room in London to listen to the exhortations\n of an American missionary, the Rev. David Abeel, just\n returned from China to recruit his broken health by a\n visit to England.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Abeel had come from the scene of his labors\n with a heart full of sorrow for the misery and degrada\u00ac\n tions of the women of the country. He felt that his\n efforts and those of his fellow-workers could not reach\n their case. The gospel, even when preached in their\n country, was virtually shut out from them.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the Christian Church first awoke from its\n long sleep of indifference to the call to \u201c teach all na\u00ac\n tions,\u201d the work of missionaries was, naturally enough\n at first, purely general.

L. Humphrey, a med\u00ac\n ical missionary of the Methodist Episcopal Church\n stationed in Nainee Tal, India. In 1867 he began\n delivering medical lectures to a class of young women\n who had received some education in the Girls\u2019 Or\u00ac\n phanage at Bareilly. A liberal minded Hindoo, familiar\n with the condition of his countrywomen, knowing\n something of the suffering that ensued from malprac\u00ac\n tice of the ignorant, superstitious native midwives and\n the hopeless agony of women stricken down by disease,\n proposed to Dr. Humphrey to furnish half the necessary\n funds, to develop what seemed to him a very necessary\n work, if some help could be obtained from the Gov\u00ac\n ernment. Application was made but finally with\u00ac\n drawn. The time had not fully come for that either:\n the Government could not see the necessity. But the\n missionary did, and so a class was formed, the first of\n its kind in the East, in Nainee Tal, May, 1869, con\u00ac\n sisting of nine women.

Let me tell you something of the work\n deaconesses do.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some little time ago, in answer to an urgent de\u00ac\n mand, one of our Chicago deaconesses was taken by an\n agent of the Humane Society to a German family where\n eight people were living in one room. The father, mo\u00ac\n ther and two oldest children were sick with typhoid\n fever, and the sick and well together were occupying\n two beds. Unless one has witnessed with his own eyes\n similar suffering and degradation it is impossible to\n get any conception of it. The deaconess, a trained\n nurse, told me that until she could procure a third\n bed she was obliged to reach over the sick mother and\n one child in order to administer medicine to the eleven-\n year-old girl, lying at the back of one of the beds in a\n raging fever.

About a year ago I was myself\n greatly interested in a poor mother who was clinging to\n a sick child, the last one of her little family of three\n children, with the hope born of despair, and yet with a\n despair that left no room for hope. It was an infidel\n family. The voice of prayer had never been heard in\n that home, yet as the mother leaned over the crib\n wherein lay her dying child, wringing her hands and\n exclaiming, \u201c What shall I do? What shall I do?\u201d the\n nurse could give but one word, \u201c You must pray. God\n can help you.\u201d \u201c I do not know how to pray,\u201d she\n answered almost fiercely. \u201c I do not even know there is\n a God.\u201d The baby died, and one March day, in the\n pouring rain, the father called on us again to help him\n make arrangements for the \u201c burial.\u201d In so many in\u00ac\n stances, in our semi-foreign cities, people have burials\n instead of funerals.

The\n teacher into whose care he was given felt some hesita\u00ac\n tion about taking him, fearing his contact with the others,\n but knowing that no religious influence had been\n brought to bear upon him she determined to make him\n a subject of prayer and do her best. It was not long\n before the sly, sulky look began to disappear from his\n face, and instead of being a hindrance, as the teacher\n had feared, he began to be a help.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c One day he came to the teacher with a friend, and\n asked her if she would allow them to come to her room\n one evening in the week to study the Bible, he felt so\n ignorant of religious truths. He also sought an oppor\u00ac\n tunity to talk with his cousin, who had been some time\n in the school, and she came to me and told me he\n wanted us all to pray for him, he found it so hard to do\n right. From the first the boy improved steadily, and\n when he went home to the reservation for the summer\n he joined the church near by, and while the missionary\n was away this boy, with his cousin, held prayer-meet\u00ac\n ings among his people.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHe has returned to us this fall with his friend, and\n the boys we were warned to watch are now assisting\n us in every department of our work. The boy is pre\u00ac\n paring to become an evangelist, that he may assist the\n missionary with whose church he united, after he has\n finished his studies.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wo:ma:ni:nm:is:si:on:sp:00:wo:ma:womaninmissionsp00woma:womaninmissionsp00woma_0213/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 265, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 433}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wo:ma:ni:nm:is:si:on:sp:00:wo:ma:womaninmissionsp00woma:womaninmissionsp00woma_0213/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 530, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 866}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wo:ma:ni:nm:is:si:on:sp:00:wo:ma:womaninmissionsp00woma:womaninmissionsp00woma_0213/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1060, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1733}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wo:ma:ni:nm:is:si:on:sp:00:wo:ma:womaninmissionsp00woma:womaninmissionsp00woma_0213/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2121, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3467}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wo:ma:ni:nm:is:si:on:sp:00:wo:ma:womaninmissionsp00woma:womaninmissionsp00woma_0213/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/wo/ma/ni/nm/is/si/on/sp/00/wo/ma/womaninmissionsp00woma/womaninmissionsp00woma_0213.jp2", "height": 3467, "width": 2121, "levels": 6, "size": 416007}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"213\">\n<p>\n SCHOOLS AND COLLEGES IN MISSIONS. 20g\n</p>\n<p>\n These schools on the Indian reservations are\n great civilizers.
