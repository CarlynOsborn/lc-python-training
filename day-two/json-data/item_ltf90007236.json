Some people are so\n overwise that where it is recorded \u201c thus saith the Lord & e., say they it\n does not mean that, it means something else. Hence the discords of the\n present religious world. But if all would take the admonition of the Apos\u00ac\n tles, all religious animosities and jealousies would cease, and every where,\n each would meet a brother and a friend ; Paul says, \u201cwhatever was written\n aforetime was written for our learning,\u201d\u2014hope, & c., and how can we learn\n of a thing we cannot understand? or how can we hope except we know\n what to hope for ? For my own part I prefer Peter\u2019s mode of interpreting\n scripture, so far preferable to all others that I here insert it. \u201c Knowing\n this first, that no ' prophecy of the scripture is of any private interpretation ;\n for the prophecy came net in the old lime by the will of man , but holy men of\n God, spake as they were moved upon by the Holy Ghost \" II Ep. Peter, i. 20,\n 21. Here is the rule of the inspired Apostle, how true and simple it is.\n The*scriptures themselves being the best interpreter, for we perceive all the\n Prophecies that have had a fulfilment, have been fulfilled to the very letter\n according to the most literal meaning of words and sentences. When the\n Lord told Noah to build an ark, he did not understand him to have refer\u00ac\n ence to a wagon, or Moses to go down into Egypt, he did not understand\n he should go to Jericho, or Lot when he was warned to flee from Sodom\n into the mountains; suppose he had been as wise as some of the commen\u00ac\n tators of the present day ; he would have answered Lord, I am safe\n enough, and secure here, for into means \u201c near by, \" \u201c close to, \" \u201c round about, \"\n and if this is the true definition I am not afraid, but Noah had not been\n inducted into this modern scheme of spiritualizing, which is so prevalent in\n the present day.\n</p>\n<p>\n Therefore we must judge the future by the past, and take the scriptures as\n they are, and apply them accordingly. In investigating the scriptures I find\n three kinds of teachings, (i. e.) \u201c Historical, Prophetical, and Metaphorical.\u201d\n When we read the Historical part, read it the same as we would any other\n history, and prophecy, where \u201c thus saith the Lord,\u201d believe it as it is writ\u00ac\n ten, for recollect Peter says, \u201c No Prophecy is of any private interpretation,\u201d\n (i. e. no spiritualizing) and when we read parables or metaphors, believe them\n as such and apply them to the things they were designed to convey, and\n never let us apply things to ourselves that do not belong to us. For in\u00ac\n stance we are very apt to apply the Epistles of the Apostles to our own\n situation, when they no more belong to us, nor apply to us, than the Mes\u00ac\n sage of the President of the United States would apply to a Russian, The\n Epistles of the Apostles were all wrote and directed to the Saints of God\n that had been brought into the church of Christ by the preachings of the\n Apostles, and been initiated into his kingdom by them, and the Elders of\n the Church, holding the authority, (the Priesthood) to administer in the ordi-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ss:er:ta:ti:on:of:ne:00:ap:pl:dissertationofne00appl:dissertationofne00appl_0004/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 255, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 463}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ss:er:ta:ti:on:of:ne:00:ap:pl:dissertationofne00appl:dissertationofne00appl_0004/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 510, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 927}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ss:er:ta:ti:on:of:ne:00:ap:pl:dissertationofne00appl:dissertationofne00appl_0004/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1021, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1855}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ss:er:ta:ti:on:of:ne:00:ap:pl:dissertationofne00appl:dissertationofne00appl_0004/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2043, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3710}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ss:er:ta:ti:on:of:ne:00:ap:pl:dissertationofne00appl:dissertationofne00appl_0004/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/di/ss/er/ta/ti/on/of/ne/00/ap/pl/dissertationofne00appl/dissertationofne00appl_0004.jp2", "height": 3710, "width": 2043, "levels": 6, "size": 564008}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"4\">\n<p>\n 4\n</p>\n<p>\n A DISSERTATION ON\n</p>\n<p>\n nances of the same.

It was laid out four square, and surrounded with\n a wall upwards of three hundred feet high, and sixty miles in circumference;\n having an hundred gates of brass, with bars of iron ; twenty-five gates on\n each side, which opened to streets, running through the city, a distance of\n fifteen miles; thus forming the whole city into exact squares of equal size. In\n the midst of these squares were beautiful gardens, adorned with trees and\n walks, diversified with flowers of varied hue; while the houses were built\n upon the borders of the squares, directly fronting on the street. In the midst\n of this great City, sat Nebuchadnezzar, the King, whom the Lord by the\n mouth of Jeremiah calls his servant, to execute his Judgments upon the\n Jews for their transgressions, Jer. xxv. 9. The Jews were reduced to sub\u00ac\n jection by him, their city, Jerusalem, was burned, together with their temple\n their princes, nobles, and people were carried to Babylon, together with all\n their holy things. All the particulars of this destruction and captivity were\n distinctly foretold by Jeremiah, and the time of its continuance, viz: seventy\n years. After the conquest of Jerusalem this mighty monarch marched his\n army against Tyre, the City of Merchants, subdued that: And finally, trace\n him executing the Lord\u2019s vengeance and anger against Egypt, viz: the\n kings of the Philistines and Askelon, Azzah, Ekron, Edom, Moab, Ammon,\n and Dedan, Tema and Buz, and the kings of Arabia, and of Zimri, and of\n Elam, and of all the kings of the Medes, and all the kings of the North.\n Having subjugated all the Kingdoms far and near, he returned to the Royal\n City of Babylon.

Consular of Military Tribunes, 5.

And this I consider the other King\u00ac\n dom, ( i . e. form of government) that makes thes eventh, which in the Apostle\u2019s\n day had not come, for Rome had never experienced this form of Government\n before. But it was to \u201c continue but a short space,\u201d which it did, for the\n city revolted from the Eastern Emperor to the Pope in the year 727, having\n existed about 159 years, which is a short space in comparison to the impe\u00ac\n rial power which preceded and lasted above 500 years, and the Papal which\n hath now continued upwards of a thousand. So we see that here are the\n seven Kings, (v. 11) \u201c And the beast that was and is not, even he is the eighth\n and is of the seven,\u201d & c. The Beast was under the heathen Emperors, was\n not under the Christian, and yet is (revived) under the Roman Pontiff. The\n beast therefore upon which the woman rideth, is the Roman government in\n its last form; and this, we must acknowledge, is the Papal, and is the eighth,\n and of the seventh, \u201cand goeth into perdition,\u201d (v. 12.) \u201cAnd the ten horns\n are ten kings, which have received no kingdom as yet,\u201d neither did they in\n John\u2019s day, for they were not in existence.\n</p>\n<p>\n I will here give a list of the ten Kingdoms, with their rise, according to\n Bishop Lloyd, \u201c 1, Huns, A.

Suffice it to\n say, that after Christ was baptised, Mat. iii. 16, he chose twelve Apostles,\n and other seventy, and sent them forth (e.x.) with power over unclean\n spiritsf^with this proclamation. \u201cThe Kingdom of God is at hand.\u201d After\n three years and a half, he was taken by wicked hands and crucified, but the\n grave could not hold him; death\u2019s icy chains could not bind him ; he rises from\n the dead, ascends to his Father, John xx. 17. Gets crowned with all power,\n in Heaven and on Earth, and returns to his disciples to give them their commis\u00ac\n sion, Mat. xxviii., 19. \u201c Go ye therefore and teach all nations, baptizing them\n in the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, (v. 20.) \u201c Teaching them to\n observe all things \u201d and on conditions of their teaching all things, that he had\n commanded them he would be with them alway,\u201d (no non-essential here).\n Again; Mark xvi. 16, \u201c He that believeth and is baptised shall be saved ;\n and he that believeth not, shall be damned,\u201d (v. 17, 18.) with the promise\n of signs following the believer. Also Luke, xxiv. 47, \u201c That repentance\n and remission of sins should be preached in his name among all nations,\n beginning at Jerusalem.\u201d Thus we have a perfect system, which is; 1.\n Faith. 2. Repentance. 3. Baptism, for the remission of sins. See Acts ii.\n 38, do xxii. 16. Together with the promise of receiving the Holy Ghost,\n with the gifts and blessings thereto attending. See I. Cor. xii., c. Mark xvi.\n 17,18.\n</p>\n<p>\n But he commands them to tarry at Jerusalem until they have received\n their endowment, (\u00a3. e. the Priesthood) attended with the second Comforter,\n the Holy Ghost, which he had promised to send unto them, to bring all things\n to their remembrance and show them things to come. God sent Christ\n with the Melchizedeck Priesthood. See Heb. v. 5, 6. And Christ sent his\n Apostles with the same Priesthood. See John xvii. 18. Accordingly the\n Apostles retire to Jerusalem into an upper room, Acts i. 13. There in\n devout prayer, waiting for the Holy Ghost, which, according to promise came\n upon them like a mighty rushing wind, that caused them to rejoice, and speak\n in other tongues, which when the people saw, and heard, were amazed, and\n said they were drunk , & c.

But we find\n wherever the Apostles preached, the first thing after the people believed was\n to baptise them ; and not take them on months ' probations as they do now.\n Look at the Jailor, Acts xvi. 33, who was baptised the same hour of the\n night he believed.

What were they given for? Ans. (v. 12.) For the per\u00ac\n fecting of the Saints, for the work of the ministry, for the edifying of the\n body (Church) of Christ.\u201d How long were they to continue ? Ans. (v. 13.)\n \u201c Till we all come in the unity of the faith and of the knowledge of the Son\n of God, unto a perfect man, unto the measure of the stature of the fulness of\n Christ, (v. 14.) \u201c That we henceforth be no more children, tossed to and\n</p>\n<p>\n fro, and carried about by every wind of doctrine, by the sleight of men and\n cunning craftiness, whereby they lie in wait to deceive .\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Again, I.

D. 325, the celebrated Council of Nice was held, consisting of 318\n Bishops, Presbyteries, and Deacons, amounting in all to 2,048. Here was\n where the famous Nicene Creed,was first concocted and adopted, that caused\n many (no doubt) to mourn, especially if they did not embrace it, and by the\n year 570, says Mosheim, all the spiritual gifts had fled. All this time the\n Roman Church was endeavouring to augment the power, and have the\u201c Holy\n See \" (Popery) finally established, which she soon attained, for in the year A.\n D. 606, the title of Pope was conferred upon Boniface the 3d, and in 608\n Mahomet came forth from a cave near Mecca, and began to propagate his re\u00ac\n ligion, and from this time up to the days of Martin Luther, all kinds of licen\u00ac\n tiousness crept into the Church, (for the Church of Christ was overcome by\n the Latin or Romish Church) such as, the worshiping of images, relics, said to\n be of some saint, and in fact nearly all manner of absurdities, were practised.\n The faggot, the fire, and rack, were the general means employed to make\n adherents to their faith.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the ninth Century the Greek Church separated from the Latin, and es\u00ac\n tablished its seat at New Rome or Constantinople. Thus with the Latin or\n Romish Church on the one hand, and the Greek on the other, there was no\n toleration for those who desired to worship, in the name of the Son of the\n Virgin, and not believe in the infallibility of the Pope.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus they continued hand in hand (for the Greek Church was merely a\n branch of the Latin) to persecute and put down all others.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the 12th Century a Merchant near Lyons, by the name of Peter Waldo,\n commenced a reformation, and gathered a few followers around him, called\n the Waldenses. And in the same Century, the Albigenes arose from one\n Arnold, a citizen of Albi near Toulouse. But they were of short duration, for\n Pope Pius III. sent a crusade against them, and murdered them in the most\n cruel manner. Who can read the history of the cruelties inflicted upon them\n in the Vallies of Piedmont, without shuddering at the wickedness and de\u00ac\n pravity of the Romish Church ?\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus I have (briefly) traced up the Church for the space of 1200 years :\n and we find that the Historians agree with the Prophets, viz : that the King\u00ac\n dom of God set up in the days of Christ, and his Apostles, was overcome,\n and Antichrist erected upon its ruins. Now I shall trace the reformation,\n commencing with Martin Luther, and take a passing notice of the origin\n and faith of the most notable orthodox societies, down to the present day,\n deducing my information from the same Ecclesiastical Historians before\n quoted. Also from \u201c Buck\u2019s Theological Dictionary,\u201d \u201c Cobbett\u2019s Legacy to\n Parsons,\u201d and from their own Disciplines. And let us see if any of those\n societies that arose at the beginning of the reformation, or down to the 18th\n Century, will apply to the \u201c Kingdom \u201d Daniel speaks of, (for recollect wc arc\n in search of that Kingdom.)

Their doctrine varying somewhat\n from Luther\u2019s, and Calvin\u2019s in particular, who was a real predestinarian, and a\n zealous bigot, or else he would not have had poorServetus burnt at the stake.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the mean time Luther was gathering around him his followers. King\n Henry VIII, who belonged to the Roman Church, was busily employed in\n writing a Book against Luther and his doctrine, and advocating the creeds\n and doctrines of the Church of Rome, and he so ably defended the same,\n that the Pope conferred upon him the title of the \u201c Defender of the Faith.\u201d\n But the scene soon changes, Henry being married to Catharine, his deceased\n Brother\u2019s wife, yet falls in love with Anne Boylen, one of the Queen\u2019s maids\n of honor, and makes application to Pope Clement, for a divorce, (That he\n might marry Anne.) But his Holiness would not grant Henry his request,\n and for this reason he protested against the Church of Rome,^took the affairs\n into his own hand, and proclaimed himself head of the Church. Here we\n may date the rise of the Church of England, for it was soon after organized,\n and established by law , and Thomas Cranmer, (formerly a Romish Priest,\n and carrying a woman about in a clandestine manner, when fee was sworn\n to the vows of the celibacy) was appointed Archbishop of the Church.\n Soon after he divorced Henry from his wife, and he obtained the object he\n was seeking after, viz : Anne Boylen. It now became necessary to compose a\n form of Prayer, accordingly a day was appointed by Bishop Cranmer for the\n officers of the Church, to assemble together, and compose the same. Accord-\n ingly says the account (which I extract from \u201c Cohbett ' s Legacy to Parsons ,\u201d\n and he has taken it, from the records of Parliament,) they assembled to\u00ac\n gether by the laws of the land, assisted by the \u201c Holy Ghost\u201d and composed\n a form of Prayers, & .c., which was soon after published in a Book called the\n Prayer Book \u201d for the use of the Church. And the fire, branding of the\n cheeks, cropping of the ears, & .C., were the general means employed to make\n the people submit to it. \u201c No wonder (says Cobbett) it affected men\u2019s con\u00ac\n sciences so it took such an affect upon their ears.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n After Henry\u2019s death his son Edward VI at twelve years old became the\n head of the Church. During his reign a special Act of Parliament w r as\n passed to regulate the Church; hence it was established by the laws of the\n land ; and not by the law of God, and the Kings and Queens of England to\n the present day, at their coronation, are sworn to protect the Church, \u201c as by\n law established .\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n After Edward\u2019s decease a new aspect of things presented themselves.\n Mary, a bigoted Papist, ascended the Throne: she overthrew the Church,\n and pronounced all its followers heretics. They signed recantations, asked\n forgiveness of the Pope, and pronounced the \u201c Prayer Book \u201d a heresy. Thus\n the Church was silenced through her reign.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the death of Mary, Elizabeth, (an illegitimate Daughter of Henry by\n Anne Boylen) ascended the Throne. The Church of England was again\n revived. The u Prayer Book\u201d underwent a revision, and so the Church has\n flourished till the present day.\n</p>\n<p>\n In A. D. 1536, the Baptists arose and were organized under Simon Menno\n a native of Friesland, who had formerly been a Roman Priest. Although\n the Waldenses, and Albigenes baptised, and the Baptists claim their origin\n from them, yet they cannot with any propriety trace their origin further back\n than Menno. At first they were called Mennoites, but since changed their name\n to Baptist, yet there are some thatretain the original, see Bucks\u2019 T.

They teach faith and repentance toward Cod, and in\n the atonement of Jesus Christ, and peace, meekness, candour, and universal\n love to all men; that the wicked will receive a punishment in this life accord\u00ac\n ing to their crimes, the punishment itself is a mediatorial work, and founded\n upon mercy, that it is the means of humbling, subduing, and finally reconciling\n the sinner to God.\n</p>\n<p>\n They do not believe that any of the outward forms (except a few for church\n membership) has any thing to do towards our salvation, neither in a literal\n hell hereafter, that Christ came at the destruction of Jerusalem, and that he\n is never going to corne personal again, and deny the Gifts of the Holy Spirit,\n the imposition of hands, the literal Gathering of the Jews, the Milennial reign\n of the Saints on earth, and a literal resurrection of the body from the-Tomb, foe.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ss:er:ta:ti:on:of:ne:00:ap:pl:dissertationofne00appl:dissertationofne00appl_0019/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 250, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 462}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ss:er:ta:ti:on:of:ne:00:ap:pl:dissertationofne00appl:dissertationofne00appl_0019/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 500, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 924}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ss:er:ta:ti:on:of:ne:00:ap:pl:dissertationofne00appl:dissertationofne00appl_0019/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1000, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1849}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ss:er:ta:ti:on:of:ne:00:ap:pl:dissertationofne00appl:dissertationofne00appl_0019/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2000, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3699}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ss:er:ta:ti:on:of:ne:00:ap:pl:dissertationofne00appl:dissertationofne00appl_0019/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/di/ss/er/ta/ti/on/of/ne/00/ap/pl/dissertationofne00appl/dissertationofne00appl_0019.jp2", "height": 3699, "width": 2000, "levels": 6, "size": 672568}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"19\">\n<p>\n 19\n</p>\n<p>\n Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s dream.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus we have before us a Synopsis of the faith of the Orthodox sects\n (Catholics omitted, for they are not considered Orthodox, but that the Pope is\n the man of Sin). And if either one is the Kingdom Daniel spoke of, which one\n is it, and is either one the Church *of Christ. And here let me inquire can\u00ac\n didly, is God the Author of all these conflicting opinions, divisions and con\u00ac\n fusions, certainly not, for we read; he is not the \u201cAuthor of confusion but of\n peace in all churches of the Saints,\u201d 1. Cor. xiv. 33.\n</p>\n<p>\n We here see that they are worshipping a God that they have no just con\u00ac\n ception of, one without body, parts, or passions, a nonentity, a phantom. But-\n gays one, is he not a Spirit, certainly he is a personage of Spirit, power and\n Glory. Paul says there is a spiritual body, I. Cor. xv. 44, and if a body there\n must be parts, for we all know that the whole is composed of parts. Man\n was made in the \u201c image of God, \" Gen. i. 27. Christ, was the express\n image of his person , Heb. i. 3. Moses talked with him face to face, Ex.\n xxxiii. 11. The seventy Elders of \u201cIsrael saw him \" Exd. xxiv 10. Jacob\n saw God face to face and his life was preserved, Gen. xxxii. 30. \u2022\u2022 And he\n</p>\n<p>\n left off talking with him, and God went up from Abraham,\u201d Gen. xvii. 22.\n But says one is he not every where present? Yes, his power and influence\n is every where present, and we behold it manifest wherever we look ; but his\n dwelling place is in heaven. Hear David, \u201c The Lord is in his holy Temple.\n The Lord\u2019s Throne is in heaven,\u201d Pis. xi. 4. And Stephen when he was\n about to be martyred, saw \u201c Heaven opened, and Jesus standing on the right\n hand of God, \" Acts vii. 55.\n</p>\n<p>\n We see also three kinds of Baptism, when the Scripture teaches but one,\n (that is to be administered by man,) see Eph. iv. 5. Some believing ono\n thing and some another; some preaching up election, others free salvation;\n some a literal hell fire, others preaehing against it; some preaching Bap\u00ac\n tism, by immersion, others sprinkling or pouring, and some not believing in\n either one, some sprinkling infants, others condemning it, some preaching a\n literal resurrection of the body, others that it is spiritual; how do all these\n divisions, accord with the scriptures, when they say one Faith, \u201c and by ono\n Spirit are we all baptized into one body, \" I Cor. xii. 13.\n</p>\n<p>\n Yet there is one thing in which they universally agree, viz: disbelieving\n in Prophets, Apostles, Immediate Revelation from God (only inward), the\n ministering of Angels, Prophecy, Gift of Tongues, & c., and in fact they\n reject nearly all the ancient order of the Church, in the days of the Apostles;\n therefore they have a \u201c Form of Godliness but deny the power \"\n</p>\n<p>\n They also deny the literal gathering of the Jews, God\u2019s covenant peoplo\n to Jerusalem, in fulfilment of the Prophecies, see Jer. xxx and xxxi.

They have all sprung directly, or\n indirectly (with few exceptions) from that Impure fountain, viz: the Church\n of Rome, and had their origin in man, built up and conducted by the tenets\n of men without the aid of Revelation, or the Holy Priesthood, the authority\n from God; because, if they were in possession of that, they would certainly\n preach the same doctrine that the Apostles preached, and contend for the\n same blessings ; for it is not reasonable to suppose that God would send men\n 1800 years ago, to preach one doctrine, and now send men (without revela\u00ac\n tion) to preach another, yet he and his law unchangeable, and Paul has pro\u00ac\n nounced a curse on an Angel from Heaven, if he should preach any doctrine,\n different from what he taught, see Gal, i. 8. 9.\n</p>\n<p>\n Who gave those reformers authority to build up Churches, or to adminis\u00ac\n ter in the ordinance of the Gospel ? Do you suppose, men called of God,\n would ever have his fellow man burnt, because he differed from him in sen\u00ac\n timent, like Calvin had Servetus; and King Henry VIII. (the originator\n of the Church of England,) who had Tyndall, the first translator of the New\n Testament, burnt at the stake; and was divorced and married three different\n wives, during his life.\n</p>\n<p>\n But do not understand me, that I wish, or have a desire to undervalue the\n good that has arisen from the effects of the reformation. I believe there are\n hundreds and thousands, meek humble hearted souls in all the societies I\n have named, who are living up to the best light and knowledge they have.\n John Wesley in his day sought after truth. Speaking of the spiritual\n gifts set in the Church he says, \u201c they fled not because they were not wanted\n in the church, but the whole world had turned to heathenism, and had nothing\n but a dead form left. \" Of the Priesthood he says, \u201c There cannot be shown\n an unbroken chain of Priesthood from the Apostles down to his day ;\u201d but\n he nor any of the rest ever said that God had given them a special revela\u00ac\n tion, to build up a church. They have a part of the Gospel, but not the\n fullness of it. But as I said before they have been the means of doing much\n good, and they will be rewarded for it. It has paved the way for the\n establishing of the Kingdom Daniel had reference to, that was to be set up\n in the \u201c latter days \u201d by the God of heaven, and not by man, and to stand\n forever.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have traced the Kingdom set up in the Days of Christ, until we found\n it, in fulfilment of the Prophets, disorganised, its officers martyred, over\u00ac\n thrown, and Popery erected in its stead ; and we have traced down through\n the reformation and we have not found any yet, that has scarcely a resem\u00ac\n blance to the one overcome, or the one spoken of by Daniel, which wrn are\n in search after; and if we do find it we shall know it, for it will be organized\n after the ancient order, with all its officers, gifts, blessings, beauty and glory,\n built upon the rock revelation, and to stand forever.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now let us investigate some of Prophecies, and see if the Prophets have\n not spoken concerning the Church fleeing into the wilderness, how long she\n was to stay there, and by what means she was to be brought forth. John\n the Revelator, who was banished to the Isle of Patmos by Domitian, about\n A. D. 96.

While wrapt in the visions of God, various\n scenes of. futurity passes before him. In chap. xii. 1, he gives a description\n of the church, represented by a woman, \u201c Clothed with the sun, the moon\n under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars,\u201d representing\n perhaps the twelve apostles , the moon the changeable things of the world;\n and the sun, the glory of Christ, which adorned her, (v. 6.) He sees her\n flee into the wilderness (t. e. overcome by Antichrist and persecution) where\n a place is prepared of God; where she is nourished for a thousand two\n hundred and three score days, (v. 14) or time, times and half a time.\u201d And\n her child (alluding to the Priesthood perhaps) was caught up to God and hia\n throne; (v. 5.)\n</p>\n<p>\n Now if we can find dht when she fled, and how long those days and times\n are, we can know something of the time w\u2019hen she will come out, or be\n reorganized.\n</p>\n<p>\n We will all admit, as long as the Priesthood was upon earth, the gifts\n and blessings Christ promised, see Mark, xvi. 17, 18, and I. Cor. xii. 8 to\n 10, were in the Church, and when these ceased site fled.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Mosheim tells us, that they began to decline in the days of Constan\u00ac\n tine, and about the year A. D. 570, they were all fled.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now by referring to Nutn. xiv. 34, and Eze. iv. 6, the Lord gives a day\n in each instance for a year. Therefore, at that rate, a thousand two hundred\n and three score days, are 1260 years. And a time is 360, times 720, half a\n time 180, making the 1260 years. Thus by adding the 570, to the 1260,\n we have 1830, which is the year she must be organized, according to this.\n</p>\n<p>\n John yet continues, while wrapt in his heavenly vision, and contemplating\n things transpiring down through the vista of future ages, sees the time\n and the manner when the Church should be again organized, by the God of\n Heaven, and says Rev. xiv. 6, 7. \u201c And I saw another Angel Jly in the midst\n of heaven, having the everlasting Gospel to preach unto them that dwell on ths\n earth and. to every mtion and kindred, and tongue, and people, \" (v. 7.) \u201c Say\u00ac\n ing with a loud voice, fear God and give glory to him, for the hour of his\n Judgment is come: and worship him that made heaven, and earth, the sea ,\n and the fountains of waters .\u201d As I before observed, John received his\n Revelation about 62 years after the Kingdom was set up in the days of\n Christ, therefore he could not have had reference to that; because it would be\n supeifluous, for an Angel to commit the Gospel unto man, when they had\n it already, which they had in John\u2019s day.\n</p>\n<p>\n And has ever one of the sects that has arose from the days of Christ or\n down through the reformation, had the order that was established in the\n Church of Christ in the days of the Apostles?

Y.; cultivating the earth was his employment while young.\n Two of the family belonged to the Methodist Church, I believe, his brother\n Hiram, and another, to the Presbyterian. About the year 1822, a great\n revival took place in the Churches in that neighbourhood ; accordingly, Mr.\n Smith\u2019s mind, (who was now in his seventeenth year) was considerably\n wrought upon; he attended their meetings, Methodist in particular. One said\n join our Church; we are right, the others are wrong: another, they are wrong\n and we are right. In this situation, (not knowing which was right, and to\n risk his soul\u2019s salvation on \u201c hope so, or guess so,\u201d was more than he could\n endure). He commenced reading his Bible, (but his education was very\n limited ; he could just read; and scarce write his name) believing what he\n read ; until he came to the following passage, \u201c If any lack wisdom let him\n ask of God and it shall he given him , James i. 5.\n</p>\n<p>\n This was joy to his soul, it was peace to his troubled spirit; he saw that\n it was his privilege to ask God, and according to his faith to receive; accord\u00ac\n ingly he retired to a secret grove, not far from his father\u2019s house ; and there,\n day after day, did this youth pour out his soul to God, to know which of the\n sects was right and had the true doctrine, that he might obey the same, and\n become a member of the Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n One day while praying, a glorious light er eirled him, his mind was caught\n away from the things of the world, and he was immediately wrapt in a\n heavenly vision. He saw two angelic beings, whose countenances were\n glorious beyond expression, stand before him; they declared themselves to\n be Angels, sent from the Courts of Glory to communicate*to him, that his\n sins were forgiven ; that his prayers were heard; and he was told not to go\n after any of the cccts, tor the whole world , said they, are believing in incorrect\n doctrines; that the authority of the Priesthood had long since been taken\n from the Earth, and they informed him if he was faithful, the true plan of\n salvation should be revealed to him hereafter,\u201d after which they disappeared,\n leaving his mind in peace and tranquility 7 . He reported what he had received,\n and Priests and people, with few exceptions, said he was deluded, that there\n was no such thing as the ministering of Angels, in these days, and not to\n believe a word of it; but he was not to be overcome, he trusted in the\n promises of God. Or.e night while-laying on his bed praying to God for\n some kind messenger to inform him of the right and true way, suddenly a\n light above the brightness of day burst into his room, and immediately he\n was wrapt in a heavenly vision, he saw a personage about the ordinary size\n of man in the middle of the room before him. He was dressed in a white\n flowing robe made fast at the wrists and ancles, and appeared to be without\n seam. He declared himself to be an Angel of God, sent forth to inform him\n that the time had nearly arrived, for the Gospel to be preached in power in\n all the world, as a witness of the coming of Christ, which was near at hand ;\n also that this continent had been inhabited by two distinct races of people;\n the first was called Jaredites, and came directly from the Tower of Babel.\n The second was called Nephites, the descendants of Joseph, who came to\n this land in the days of Zcdikiah, King of Judah, about six hundred years\n before Christ; that they brought with them the Scriptures of the Old Testa\u00ac\n ment engraved upon Brass Plates down to the days of Jeremiah; that they\n prospered in Arts and Agriculture, had their Prophets among them, who kept\n a History of their proceedings engraved on plates ; that Christ after his cruci\u00ac\n fixion visited them, chose twelve Apostles, ordained them and gave unto them\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ss:er:ta:ti:on:of:ne:00:ap:pl:dissertationofne00appl:dissertationofne00appl_0023/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 250, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 462}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ss:er:ta:ti:on:of:ne:00:ap:pl:dissertationofne00appl:dissertationofne00appl_0023/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 500, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 924}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ss:er:ta:ti:on:of:ne:00:ap:pl:dissertationofne00appl:dissertationofne00appl_0023/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1000, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1849}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ss:er:ta:ti:on:of:ne:00:ap:pl:dissertationofne00appl:dissertationofne00appl_0023/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2000, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3699}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ss:er:ta:ti:on:of:ne:00:ap:pl:dissertationofne00appl:dissertationofne00appl_0023/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/di/ss/er/ta/ti/on/of/ne/00/ap/pl/dissertationofne00appl/dissertationofne00appl_0023.jp2", "height": 3699, "width": 2000, "levels": 6, "size": 613264}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"23\">\n<p>\n Nebuchadnezzar\u2019s dream.\n</p>\n<p>\n 23\n</p>\n<p>\n his law, and that the Church of Christ was established here, with Prophets,\n Apostles, and the Spiritual Gifts, & ,c.; that in the fourth century after Christ,\n they were nearly all destroyed on account of their wickedness, and what\n remained fell into Idolatry; the last Prophet, Moroni, was commanded by\n the Lord to make an abridgement of all their records which he did on Gold\n Plates, and sealed it up by the prayer of faith, with a promise from God that\n it should be preserved, and in the last days be brought forth and go to the\n remnant of their seed; the Indians, said he, of whom are a remnant : and that\n this record was deposited in a hill called by the Nephites Cumorah, not far\n from this place; that the Record was wrote in the reformed Egyptian, and\n that they could not be translated by the wisdom of this generation, but if ho\n was faithful he should be the honored instrument in bringing it forth, and\n translating the same by the \u201c Urim and Thummim \u201d that was deposited with\n the Records, and that this Record contained the fulness of the Gospel of\n Jesus Christ in its purity; that the knowledge it contained should go to\n every nation, kindred, tongue, and peopie, and that the Indian and the\n Jew should be brought to a knowledge of Christ by believing and obeying\n the same, and when it comes forth persecution shall rage; your life shall\n be sought after, & c., after which the messenger left him.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Smith having been shown in the Vision the place where the Record\n was deposited; accordingly the next morning, 23d day of September, A. D.\n 1823, visited the place, and from that time he received more and more in\u00ac\n formation concerning what he had to do until the year 1827, when he obtained\n the Recods. A hole of sufficient depth had been dug, and a flat stone laid in the\n bottom; then there were four set erect at the outer edges of the bottom stone,\n joined together with some kind of cement, so as to form a Box. On the bottom\n stone was laid a Shield or Breastplate, from that arose three pillars made of\n cement. On the top of these pillars laid the Record, together with the \u201c Urim\n and Thummim,\u201d the whole not to extend quite even with the top of the side\n stones. Over the whole was placed a crowning stone, a small part of which\n was visible, when he first visited the spot. Each plate was about six by\n eight inches, and as thick as common tin, and on each side beautifully en\u00ac\n graved, and filled with black cement, the whole being about six inches in\n thickness, and put together with three rings, running through the whole, a\n part of which was sealed. The ynsealed part has been translated ; and con\u00ac\n tains the Book of Mormon; and living witnesses, who saw the plates and hefted\n them have borne testimony to the same. In the year 1830, after the Book\n was translated and published, the Angel of God according to promise con\u00ac\n ferred the Holy Priesthood upon Mr. Smith, and gave unto him command\u00ac\n ments to Baptize with w^ater in the name of Jesus, and build up the Church\n of Christ; which accordingly was organized April 6th, A.

I think we have, for it\n has been set up by the God of Heaven; and organized in the year 1830,\n according to computation heretofore made. And John says when he saw\n the Angel having the Gospel, the proclamation was, that the \u201chour of\n God\u2019s Judgment was come.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Says one how long is that. Let ns investigate,Peter says \u201cone day with\n the Lord is as a thousand years, and a thousand years, as one day.\u201d And\n there are 24 hours in a day, and 24 divided into 1000 makes about 41\n years to the hour, and 14 years has passed since the Gospel was committed ;\n take 14 from 41 leaves 27 years for the winding up scene.\n</p>\n<p>\n And for these glorious truths which we firmly believe, yea, verily know, havt\n many sealed their testimony with their blood, which has crimsoned the Ame\u00ac\n rican soil, and many a widow been left to mourn and many a helpless orphan\n shed a tear; many has been the mother that has had to flee from a burning\n house, and a savage mob, through the snow, over the burnt Praries, leaving\n their footsteps marked with the blood of their lacerated feet, and when nearly\n exhausted, sat down, and gazed upon the livid lips of her Fatherless infant,\n pressing it to her bosom, trying to warm its freezing limbs, as it w.as sinking\n under the cold hand of death; while her crystal tears ran freely, and freezing\n perhaps as they fell. These are some of the scenes this Church has waded\n through in noted Missouri and Illinois, for the testimony of Jesus.\n</p>\n<p>\n But all the combined powers of earth and hell will never be able to over\u00ac\n come it. It is never to be left to other people, but to stand forever. In the\n short space of fourteen years, with everything to contend against, has it\n gathered in its train about two hundred thousand souls.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Elders have been over the United States, and Canada; in England,\n Ireland, Scotland, Wales, Germany, Turkey, Jerusalem, Egypt, East Indies,\n Australasia, Sandwich Islands; and Prince Albert, and Queen Victoria,\n together with the poor Indian in the forest, have heard the sound, and its\n course is still onward, and it will continue to roll, until the kingdoms of this\n world become the Kingdoms of our God and his Christ.
