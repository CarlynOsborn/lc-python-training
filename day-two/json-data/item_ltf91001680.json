By a little thought you will see the virtue of this\n maxim. To begin with, there isn\u2019t anything superhuman about modern magic,\n and as the intelligent portion of your spectators know this, they will be unceas-\n ingly on the lookout for the modus operandi , and if they do not know what to\n expect, they are less likely to discover the means by which you accomplish a\n mysterious result.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another maxim, which is only an addendum to the above, is to avoid perform-\n ing at the same exhibition , a certain trick twice. It may be easily noticed that\n if a feat has already been performed, and you propose to do it again the same\n way, the observers, knowing what result you intended to accomplish, are very\n likely to \u201cput two and two together\u201d and discover at least a portion of your\n tecret.\n</p>\n<p>\n The artistic effect as well as the surprise, are not half as great upon repetition.\n</p>\n<p>\n The \u201cpatter\u201d or talk which accompanies the performance of a trick should\n be carefully rehearsed until it flows from the lips without hardly a thought on\n the part of the conjurer. In order to aid the amateur, various speeches are\n given in following chapters, accompanying a few of the leading tricks. Profes-\n sionals generally construct their own speeches, preferring not to imitate others\n in this respect.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many tricks can be performed with simple objects, such as coins, cards or\n handkerchiefs, which are manouvered in a deceptive way by the dexterity\n of the operator. Other tricks require considerable apparatus. The outfit of a\n prominent magician usually costs from two to ten thousand dollars. Wealthy\n amateurs, specially in England, sometimes procure paraphernalia costing\n several hundred dollars. While this volume is not written in the interest of any\n manufacturers of magical supplies, it is nevertheless true, that only in rare in-\n stances can a novice make apparatus for himself. Even if he succeeds, the ex-\n pense will be greater than he could have purchased the same thing for, had he\n gone to a regular dealer in such goods. However, great care should be exercised\n in selecting the dealer as there are numerous alleged magic supply firms who\n are nothing more nor less than imposters. The first article that comes under\n our consideration is\n</p>\n<p>\n THE MYSTIC WAND.\n</p>\n<p>\n The wand is usually mad\u00a9 of wood, and is twelve to fifteen inches in\n length. It should be made as light as possible and although the color is sub-\n ject to the fancy of the owner, it is usually black. Some of the greatest of\n modern wonder workers have recently adopted an all nickel plated outfit, and\n the wand is included. There are glass wands sometimes used, but I do not\n recommend them because even the best of performers occasionally drops his\n emblem of mystic power, and under such circumstances, a glass wand doesn\u2019t\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0006/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 266, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 435}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0006/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 532, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 871}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0006/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1064, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1742}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0006/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2129, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3484}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0006/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0006.jp2", "height": 3484, "width": 2129, "levels": 6, "size": 683142}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"6\">\n<p>\n GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS.\n</p>\n<p>\n d\n</p>\n<p>\n stand much of a chance of remaining intact. There are various mechanical\n wands used for certain tricks which are described later.\n</p>\n<p>\n A person having but a slight insight of the secrets of conjuring might suppose\n that the wand is a mere affectation, and so it is, in some instances, yet it is a\n necessary adjunct to a magical performance. I have known a professional con-\n jurer, (who shall be nameless,) who would no more think of going on the stage\n without his wand than he would without his coat. The wand affords a plausible\n pretext for various movements which might otherwise be regarded with suspic-\n ion. For example, if you wish to hold a coin in your hand for some time, it will\n not be noticed if you grasp the wand in the same hand. The use of the wand\n should be cultivated, by all means. In going to a table to take up or lay down\n the wand, an opportunity comes whereby one article can be substituted for\n another when your back is turned. If you were not using this mystic stick,\n there might be no excuse for turning your back to the audience, and your sub-\n stitutions would be clumsy or suspicious. We next refer to\n</p>\n<p>\n TEE MAGICIAN\u2019S CLOTHES.\n</p>\n<p>\n All professional magicians wear, upon the stage, clothes which are made for\n that purpose. The usual style of dress suit is employed, the only alteration\n being in the pockets. Instead of the small coat tail pockets, there are two large\n pockets, one on each side, with openings across the tops. These openings should\n be made at such a height that when the arm falls naturally any article which\n the hand holds may be easily dropped in one of the \u201c profondes ,\u201d so called.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another set of pockets, known as \u201c pochettes \u201d is made in the pantaloons at\n the thighs. These apertures are large enough to contain a pack of cards, hand-\n kerchief or wooden egg, and are in such a position that they are concealed by\n the tails of the coat. DeKolta and Kellar have recently produced tricks wherein\n it has been found necessary to use small \u201c pochettes \u201d on the sleeves, just at the\n crease made by the inside of the elbow. These are used only for small silk hand-\n kerchiefs or a flag. It will also be found desirable to have a band of elastic,\n about an inch wide, stitched around the lower edge of the vest inside. This will\n hold a small article such as a handkerchief and is first rate for effecting substi-\n tutions. Any tailor can make these arrangements in a dress suit.\n</p>\n<p>\n MAGIC TABLES.\n</p>\n<p>\n Almost every good trick requires the use of a \u201cWizard\u2019s Table\u201d made espec-\n ially for the purpose. I will not refer here to the elaborately constructed furni-\n ture of traps and pistons, but to a simple table which will serve most purposes.\n I describe the idea; the expense depends upon the taste of the performer. The\n _ top of the principal table should be about two by two and a half feet, actual\n ] depth about seven inches, legs of any style. The top of the table should be cov-\n ered by a cloth and around the edge should be a line of plush, or other material\n about eight inches deep, with a fringe. Instead of a drawer on the back, there\n should be a shelf, such as outlined here:\n</p>\n<p>\n This shelf is known as the \u201ceermnte\u201d and is the wherewithal of the whole\n affair. If side tables are employed, they may be built smaller, with single legs\n and a small shelf at the back, the tops being perhaps more shallow than on the\n centre table.\n</p>\n<p>\n The height of the tables should depend upon that of the performer. They\n should be made so that when he stands behind one and drops his arm naturally,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0007/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 266, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 435}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0007/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 532, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 871}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0007/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1064, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1742}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0007/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2129, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3484}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0007/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0007.jp2", "height": 3484, "width": 2129, "levels": 6, "size": 632255}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"7\">\n<p>\n SIMPLE TRICKS WITH CARRS. t\n</p>\n<p>\n hi* hand can pick up, say, an egg from the shelf without Its being necessary for\n him to stoop.\n</p>\n<p>\n While the servante usually used is merely a wooden shelf covered with cloth,\n there are variations. Sometimes they are made of wire, at other times cloth\n cups are used, the choice of these depending much upon the repertoire of the\n conjurer. Another application of the servante is to the back of a chair, where\n it is frequently used with satisfaction in such feats as the production of articled\n from a hat.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER H.\n</p>\n<p>\n SIMPLE TRICKS WITH CARDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n The magic of cards is the most popular, and usually most interesting. Playing\n cards are commonly known; in themselves are innocent, but in the hands of a\n conjurer or card sharper they seem to become * \u2018possessed of the devil. \u201d Many of\n the feats require considerable skill, and in some instances specially prepared ap-\n paratus. I will devote this chapter to such as can be performed without much\n practice and under almost any circumstances where a pack of ordinary cards\n can be produced. It is very essential that the reader study the instructions very\n carefully. Do not undertake to produce even the simplest illusion until you\n have first practiced enough to fully understand it.\n</p>\n<p>\n UNITED BY A SINGLE CUT.\n</p>\n<p>\n Take the four kings, (or four other cards,) and display them fan-wise, con-\n cealing at the same time two court cards behind the second card in your hand.\n The audience being satisfied that the cards are the four kings and none other,\n fold them together and place them on top of the pack. Ask the audience to\n notice that you place the cards in different parts of the pack.\n</p>\n<p>\n Take the top card, which being a king, you may display without apparent in-\n tention, and place it at the bottom. Take the next card, which should be one of\n those which was concealed, the spectators supposing that to be a king, place it\n in the middle of the pack and the next in a like manner, in a different place in\n the pack. Take the fourth card, which being actually a king, you may show\n and place back on top of the pack. You have now, one king at the bottom and\n three at the top, while the audience suppose them to have been distributed\n through the pack and of course surprised when the cards are cut to find the four\n kings together.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is advisable to use knaves or queens for the extra cards as they are less\n easily distinguished, should one of your audience catch a chance glimpse at\n their faces.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO DISCOVER THE VALUE OF CERTAIN CARDS ON THE TABLE.\n</p>\n<p>\n | Use a piquet pack of thirty-two cards in performing this trick. Invite one of\n your audience to select privately any four cards and to place them face down-\n ward on the table, seperately. Then counting an ace as eleven, a court card as\n ten, and any other card according to the number of its spots, to place upon each\n of these four a sufficient number of cards to make the added value of each\n amount to fifteen. (It must be remembered that value is applied only to the\n first four cards\u2014 those placed upon them counting only as one without regard\n to their spots.) Meanwhile you can retire and when the four packets are com-\n plete, return to the table and observe how many cards are left over, not being\n required to complete the four packs. To this number mentally add thirty -two!.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0008/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 432}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0008/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 865}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0008/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1731}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0008/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3462}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0008/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0008.jp2", "height": 3462, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 719433}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"8\">\n<p>\n 8\n</p>\n<p>\n SIMPLE TUTORS WITH CARPS.\n</p>\n<p>\n the total will give you the value of the four lowest cards calculated as above.\n</p>\n<p>\n You should not let your audience perceive that you count the remaining cards\n as it will give them an idea that the trick depends on some mathematical cal-\n culation.\n</p>\n<p>\n You may call attention to the fact that you do not look at the remaining cards,\n and in so doing throw them on the table carelessly.

For your own convenience sort the pack into the four suits,\n then arrange the cards as follows: Lay on the table, face upwards, the eight of\n hearts, on this place the king of spades, on this the three of diamonds, then ten\n of clubs, then two of diamonds, and so on until the whole pack is exhausted.\n</p>\n<p>\n The cards must be arranged in this way beforehand, and you must make this\n the first of a series of tricks or what is a better way, as it gives less idea of ^re-\n arrangement, have two packs of the same pattern, and at a favorable opportun-\n ity exchange the pack which you have been using for the prepared pack.\n</p>\n<p>\n Spread the cards and allow one to be drawn, at the same time glance quickly\n at the next card above the one that has been drawn, which we will suppose to\n be the five of hearts. You will remember that five is followed by ladies (queen)\n you will then know that the card drawn was the queen. You also know that\n clubs follow hearts, therefore the card drawn was the queen of clubs. Name it\n and request that it be replaced.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ask some one to cut the cards and again repeat the trick, but this time pass\n all the cards that were above the card drawn to the bottom of the pack. This is\n equivalent to cutting the pack at that particular card, and you can then r,any*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0009/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 266, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 435}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0009/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 532, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 871}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0009/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1064, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1742}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0009/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2129, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3484}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0009/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0009.jp2", "height": 3484, "width": 2129, "levels": 6, "size": 684528}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"9\">\n<p>\n SIMPLE TRICKS WITH CARDS. V\n</p>\n<p>\n tho cards that follow, taking them one by one and showing that they are named\n correctly.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO TELL WHETHER THE NUMBER IS ODD OR EVEN WHEN CARDS ARE CUT.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is another trick that is performed by the prepared pack of cards Just de-\n scribed. Notice whether the card at the bottom of the pack is red or black.\n i^Place the pack on the table and ask some one to cut the cards, explaining that\n you will tell by the weight of them whether the number is odd or even. Take\n the cut, that is the cards taken from the top of the pack, balance them carefully\n in your hand, notice the bottom card.\n</p>\n<p>\n If it is the same color as the bottom or lowest card in the other portion of the\n pack the number is even. If it is the opposite color, the number is odd. This\n trick though a good one is comparatively little known even among professionals.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO MAKE A CARD VANISH PROM THE PACK AND BE POUND IN A PERSON\u2019S POCKET.\n</p>\n<p>\n Slightly moisten the back of your left hand. Offer the pack to be shuffled.\n Place it face downward on the table, and request one of the company to look at\n the top card. Request him to place the back of his left hand upon the cards, and\n press heavily upon it with his right.\n</p>\n<p>\n In order that he may the better comprehend your meaning, place your own\n hands as described, and request him to imitate you. When you remove your\n left hand, the back being moistened, the card will stick to it. Put your hands\n carelessly behind you, and with your right hand remove the card. All wil\n crowd round to see the trick.\n</p>\n<p>\n Pretend to be very particular that the person who places his hand on the card\n shall do so in precisely the right position. This will not only give you time, but\n will draw all eyes to his hands. Meanwhile watch your opportunity and slip the\n card into the tail pocket of one of the other spectators. Now say that you are\n about to command the top card, which all have seen and which is being held so\n tightly, to fly from the pack to the pocket of Mr. A., making the choice with ap-\n parent carelessness.\n</p>\n<p>\n On investigation it will be found that your order has been fulfilled. When\n practicable it is effective to slip the card into the pocket of the person holding\n the pack.\n</p>\n<p>\n SIMULATION OF MIND READING.\n</p>\n<p>\n The following described trick is so simple that it seems ridiculous to suppose\n any intelligent person could be deceived thereby, yet by it even some of the\n most scientific spectators have been puzzled, for instead of being above their\n comprehension, it is below it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Before commencing to operate, have placed at the back of the room a mirror,\n in such a position that, by standing in front of the spectators you can see your\n face therein. This is all the preparation necessary. The audienoe, of course,\n must not know that the mirror is there for your especial use.\n</p>\n<p>\n When you are ready to perform the feat, take a pack of cards and say to the\n spectators: \u201cNow I propose to perform a feat which you may perhaps consider\n more wonderful than that of the greatest of mind readers. I will take these\n cards (here produce a pack of ordinary cards) and allow you to examine them.\n You will observe that there is no deception about them, being simply an ordi '\n nary pack of playing cards. With these cards I propose to show you how it is\n possible to see the faces of them, even though I do not see the faces. This is a\n paradox, but only one of the few that I propose to propound this evening. I\n will allow the cards to be thoroughly shuffled.

They are not difficult to per-\n form, and if ordinary shrewdness is employed in performing, detection is no\n easy matter. Do not try to show one of these mysteries, no matter how easy it\n may seem, until you are sure that you understand it.\n</p>\n<p>\n A very surprising, and, to some, apparently supernatural feat is that of telling\n beforehand what cards will be selected from a pack, by those present, although\n they do not themselves know what cards they will take. Of course, the experi-\n enced conjurer who happens to read this, will at once remark that the trick is\n performed by forcing. It is true that surprising effects are attained by forcing,\n but the one described below is not done that way and requires but little skill.\n</p>\n<p>\n PREVISION WITH CARDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n To begin with, allow the pack of cards to be thoroughly shuffled.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the pack is returned to you, adroitly notice the value (suit and denomi-\n nation) of the bottom card, which we will suppose happens to be the four of\n spades.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, with apparent carelessness, throw the cards face downward on a table\n and scatter them about with your fingers. However, you must not lose sight of\n the bottom card, and wherever your fingers may push it your eyes should follow\n also, in order that you may know exactly where it lies. The spectators, mean-\n while, are unaware of this knowledge on your part.\n</p>\n<p>\n Say to those present: \u201cI will now present to you a mystery which is appar-\n ently very simple, yet to my mind is a profound problem. It is one of those\n mental wonders that cannot be readily understood, and the deeper we study into\n them the further we seem to be from the truth. You will therefore observe\n closely and see what you see.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n You continue: \u201cI have, as you probably noticed, allowed Mr. to shuffle\n</p>\n<p>\n the cards thoroughly and they have been scattered over this table at random. I\n shall allow five cards to be selected and I shall endeavor to name each one before\n it is taken up. In order that nobody\u2019s attention may be detracted, I shall hold\n the cards taken up until the entire five have been selected. To prevent any mis-\n take, let some person write the names of cards upon a paper as they are called\n and see if I am correct.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0011/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 266, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 435}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0011/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 532, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 871}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0011/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1064, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1742}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0011/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2129, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3484}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0011/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0011.jp2", "height": 3484, "width": 2129, "levels": 6, "size": 634117}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"11\">\n<p>\n SIMPLE CARD TRICKS FOR PARLORS.\n</p>\n<p>\n IS\n</p>\n<p>\n You will then remark: \u201cI will now call for card*, one by one, and shall ask\n Mr. Brown (any person desired) to make the first selection. Mr. Brown, you will\n please find for me the four of spades, without turning the card over.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Naturally Mr. Brown smiles and says that such a thing is impossible. You ask\n him, however, to simply rest his fingers upon the back of any card his fancy\n may dictate. Having touched a card, you carefully draw it away from the\n table, making sure that its face cannot be seen. \u00b1iold it in your hands, close to\n your body, in an easy, unsuspicious manner, just as if you were confident the\n four of spades had been selected. Let us suppose, however, that the card is\n seven of hearts. You remark: \u201cI will next ask Mr. Jones to touch a card in the\n Bame manner as did Mr. Brown, but I predict beforehand that it will be the\n seven of hearts.\u201d The card is tapped, and you pick it up, as before. Let us\n j suppose this second one is the ace of diamonds. If so, you ask Mr. Smith to\n touch a card, which you expect to be the ace of diamonds. This, you notice,\n happens to be the queen of hearts. You then ask Mr. Robinson to touch a card,\n ' which you intend shall be queen of hearts, and after he does so you secretly as-\n certain that it is the eight of clubs.\n</p>\n<p>\n Up to the present moment, four cards have been chosen. For the fifth time\n you are to have a card selected \u201cby chance.\u201d You decide, however, to save\n time, that you will try your own luck and see if you can pick out the eight of\n clubs. In doing this, you allov your fingers to rest, with apparent carelessness,\n upon the real four of spades, the position of which you have known all the\n while. Having picked up the four of spades, you place it with the others in your\n hand.\n</p>\n<p>\n You are now able to produce the five cards you have named beforehand, viz:\n Four of spades, seven of hearts, ace of diamonds, queen of hearts and eight of\n clubs. The effect upon spectators is indeed surprising.\n</p>\n<p>\n Much depends upon the tact which you employ in executing this trick. You\n should first impress it in an indirect way upon the minds of those present, that\n your experiment is one of actual prevision. It is one of the rules of magic to\n lead the thoughts as well as eyes in a wrong direction. Be careful in picking up\n the cards. Do not let some \u201c smart aleck \u201d who is to touch a card, get ahead of\n you by turning it over and thus exposing your trick. In looking at a card,\n after having taken it into your hand, do so adroitly; don\u2019t stare at it. As the\n success of the feat depends upon knowing the location of one card, do not mafe & \u2019\n a mistake on that one.\n</p>\n<p>\n REPAIRING PAIRS.\n</p>\n<p>\n After allowing the cards to be shuffled, deal off twenty cards, face upwar d,\n placing them by twos. Ask any of the company to notice and remember any\n two cards. This being done, gather up the cards, being careful that no pair\n gets separated. Deal them out again in four row ' s of five each after this formula:\n Mutus Dedit Nomen Cocis. You will observe that this sentence, ten letters\n only, each one being repeated.

If he says both are in\n the last row, they are the cards representing the two C\u2019s.\n</p>\n<p>\n You may repeat this trick, naming three cards instead of two, by dealing\n twenty-four cards in threes, and using the following to give you a clue to which\n ones were selected:\n</p>\n<p>\n L\n</p>\n<p>\n I\n</p>\n<p>\n V\n</p>\n<p>\n I\n</p>\n<p>\n N\n</p>\n<p>\n I\n</p>\n<p>\n L\n</p>\n<p>\n A\n</p>\n<p>\n N\n</p>\n<p>\n A\n</p>\n<p>\n T\n</p>\n<p>\n A\n</p>\n<p>\n L\n</p>\n<p>\n E\n</p>\n<p>\n V\n</p>\n<p>\n E\n</p>\n<p>\n T\n</p>\n<p>\n E\n</p>\n<p>\n N\n</p>\n<p>\n nO\n</p>\n<p>\n V\n</p>\n<p>\n O\n</p>\n<p>\n T\n</p>\n<p>\n O\n</p>\n<p>\n Making four rows of six cards.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO TELL WHICH CARDS HAVE BEEN TURNED AROUND IN YOUR ABSENCE.\n</p>\n<p>\n If you examine your pack of cards carefully, you will find a difference in the*\n width of margin at the ends of the court cards. This difference is very slight\n and not noticeable unless attention is called to it. Take the four kings, placing\n them face up on the table with the narrow margin all at the top. Then allow\n your audience to turn one or more of the cards around during your absence\n from the room. You can of course tell on your return which card has been\n turned, by noticing the margin. While this trick is very simple and can be per-\n formed without special practise, there is little or no danger of discovery.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO NAME A CARD CHOSEN.\n</p>\n<p>\n This trick is done with the aid of an acknowledged confederate. Allow one of\n the audience to shuffle the cards, then deal sixteen of them in four rows on the\n table. They may be face up or not, as you choose. Then agree privately with\n your assistant that the numbers one, two, three, four, shall be represented by\n animal, vegetable, mineral, verb. Leave the room while a card is being chosen,\n your assistant remaining.\n</p>\n<p>\n On your return your confederate shows you a passage in any book which the\n audience may name. The sentence selected must have two words of which the\n first shall tell the row and the second the number of the card in that row. Sup-\n posing the quotation to be \u201ca pendulum twixt smile and tear.\u201d Pendulum in\n this case would be the tell-tale for mineral and smile for the verb. Thus you\n would know that the card chosen was the first card in the fourth row, or for\n another example, \u201c earth ' s noblest thing, woman perfected.\u201d Earth represent-\n ing the mineral, woman the animal, showing the card to be the first in the third\n row. Or again supposing the sentence to be \u201cfain would I clivib , yet fear to\n fall. \" In this case both words are verbs, showing the card to be the fourth one\n in the fourth row. This experiment can be repeated a number of times withoul\n fear of detection, and mystified the audience as the sentences may be of anj\n length and chosen from any book.\n</p>\n<p>\n A CARD CHOSEN BY ONE PERSON APPEARS AT NUMBER NAMED BY ANOTHER.\n</p>\n<p>\n Allow the cards to be freely cut and shuffled, then offer the pack to one of the\n audience, ask him to look them over and remember one, noting its number,\n counting from the bottom of the pack.

There are various methods of making the pass, both single and\n double handed. The latter are the easiest to execute although not simple to th?\n comprehension of the learner at first. I will in this volume describe the most\n practical pass known. It is executed with both hands.\n</p>\n<p>\n The cands which can most conveniently be used in sleight of hand practice are\n known as \u201csqueezers.\u201d They are of a thin, pliable, spring-like stock. If too\n stiff when new, they should be handled some before being used in an exhibition.\n French made cards are always the most satisfactory to the performer because\n they are smaller than the American. It is advisable, however, to acquire an\n ability to handle cards of any size or quality.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO PALM A CARD.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is essential that a magical performer be able to palm one or more cards sue*\n cessfully. The art of palming is not as difficult as may at first appear. Lay a\n card upon the palm of your hand. Bend your fingers slightly so that the card\n will be covered also. Turn your hand over, and it will remain where you have\n placed it. To retain several cards or a full pack in this manner is not as easy\n but is possible, after practice.\n</p>\n<p>\n An important feature is to hold the hand as naturally as possible, without its\n having a suspiciously stiff or cramped appearance. This seemingly unavoidable\n effect can be disguised by holding your wand or some other object in the same\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0014/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 259, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 439}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0014/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 518, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 879}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0014/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1037, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1758}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0014/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2075, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3516}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0014/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0014.jp2", "height": 3516, "width": 2075, "levels": 6, "size": 603369}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"14\">\n<p>\n )4\n</p>\n<p>\n SCIENTIFIC MANIPULATIONS WITH CARDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n hand, which gives you an opportunity of doubling your fingers.

Notice the bottom card, bring it to the middle by a pass, then force\n it. After having the cards shuffled again, repeat with another person, and then\n a third. You are now aware which card each person holds. Request these as-\n sistants to take care that you do not have the slightest opportunity to see what\n cards they hold.\n</p>\n<p>\n Next allow the three persons to replace their cards, each in turn shuffling them\n so as to preclude ' any possibility of your knowing in what position they may be\n placed. You state that you will take the cards, backs upward, and turn over\n one at a time. As you reach the cards which were selected, you announce th & v\n you are able to distinguish them by the sense of touch. Suiting the active to the\n word, you hold the pack in your left hand, turning over one at a time. As you\n know just what the cards are, you can readily sort out the three particular cards\n in question. If this little feat is cleverly done, it will cause a great wonderment.\n</p>\n<p>\n The reader will naturally remark: \u201cSuppose I do not succeed in forcing three\n cards, but that one or two of the spectators insist on taking different cards.\u201d\n For all such emergencies as this, the magician should always be prepared to\n change his tactics without the slightest delay.

To the spectators it will appear that the blindfold is a ventable\n blindfold, yet it is not, for you can see what is directly beneath your eyes. The\n cards being on floor or table, by standing close by, you can look directly down\n upon them. Of course, only yourself knows this.\n</p>\n<p>\n Holding the sword or knife in your hand, you will first scatter the cards.\n While you are doing this, get sight at each of the three and bear in mind their\n locations. While scattering the cards, do not be too precise, as a clue may thus\n be afforded to those who are watching you.

The same process is to be\n repeated in arriving at the second and third cards that were chosen.\n</p>\n<p>\n The sword trick, first performed by an English mystifier named Miller, is one\n of the best card illusions that I have ever known. The blindfolding arrangement\n is, in itself, a great deception and has frequently been the means of puzzling\n even expert card conjurors who would otherwise have been able to discover the\n modus operandi of the trick. Do not attempt to do this in public until you have\n devoted enough time to its practice to enable you to feel sure that you will\n succeed. If you can do this feat of sleight of hand successfully, I am willing to\n guarantee that you can learn anything in the line of card conjuring. Another\n trick that is usually well appreciated is\n</p>\n<p>\n TO NAIL A CERTAIN CARD TO A DOOR.\n</p>\n<p>\n This requires both sleight of hand and the assistance of a sharp tack which\n may, before beginning, be concealed either in your hand or some other conven-\n ient place where it may be readily secured when wanted.\n</p>\n<p>\n After allowing the cards to be examined and shuffled, allow any person to\n select one at random. You now tender the pack, spread fan- wise, and request\n that he insert his card. Make the pass, thus bringing the card to the bottom. If\n desired, you can make a false shuffle. In order to do this, let the pack rest\n loosely in your left hand and do the shuffling with your right, in the same man-\n ner that cards are usually shuffled in the hands, except that you grip the bottom\n card (which is the one selected) between the thumb and forefinger of your right\n hand, and while shuffling, never allow this certain card to depart from your\n finger tips. In this way, by a little practice, you apparently mix the cards\n thoroughly while, as a matter of fact, you retain the particular card at the bot-\n tom of the pack when your shuffle is concluded. Of course, the faces of the\n cards should be kept toward yourself. Having done this, you now palm off the\n bottom card into your right hand, between fingers of which is tack. By a little\n pressure, push the point of the tack through the face of the card, so that it will\n stick out at the back. While you are doing this, you can to a certain extent, de-\n tract the eyes of the audience from you by requesting them to keep their eyes\n upon a certain spot on the door, where you aver the chosen card is likely to ap-\n pear. You have laid the pack upon a table after palming off the card, and after\n sundry movements with your viand (for instance, tap the spot where the card is\n to appear) you pick up the pack.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is now necessary to get your palmed card on the top of the pack, and as it is\n palmed face inward, you will have to exercise some dexterity in placing it there.\n This can be done by carelessly shuffling the cards after you pick them up, while\n you are talking. An opportunity is thus afforded to get your card on top. In\n this part of the trick you must hold the backs of the cards toward yourself, to\n conceal the tack.\n</p>\n<p>\n To produce the result, approach the door. Suddenly lift the pack, and throw\n it against the door, face outward. Naturally, the top card will become fastened\n to the woodwork, the tack being driven in by the force of the other cards. Care\n should be taken in throwing, so that the particular card will strike flatly against\n the door. The effect will be quite startling to the spectators if this trick is well\n done.\n</p>\n<p>\n CARD IN A BOY\u2019S POCKET.\n</p>\n<p>\n Allow a card to be selected at random, then have It replaced, make the pass\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0018/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 259, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 439}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0018/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 518, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 879}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0018/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1037, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1758}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0018/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2075, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3516}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0018/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0018.jp2", "height": 3516, "width": 2075, "levels": 6, "size": 616547}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"18\">\n<p>\n 18\n</p>\n<p>\n CARD TRICKS REQUIRING APPARATUS.\n</p>\n<p>\n and bring it to the bottom.

You can\n make some of the contrivances yourself, and buy the more expensive supplies of\n a manufacturer of such articles.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE INDEPENDENT CARD.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is not usually shown as a trick by itself, but as a predecessor to some\n other feat. Have concealed about your person a small piece of tin, about halt\n an inch wide, bent like this:\n</p>\n<p>\n Upon the two outer sides of the tin adhere a little wax. While handling the\n cards it will not be a difficult matter to get the piece of tin concealed behind\n them, just before you are ready to introduce the illusion. With your thumb you\n can press the piece of metal against the lower back side of the last card. You\n can now take that card away from the pack, the piece remaining attached\n thereto, and if the face of the card is kept toward the audience, they will not be\n aware of the existence of the mechanism.\n</p>\n<p>\n Stand the card upright upon the table, at the same time pressing the lower\n side of the tin against the surface of the table. This will enable the cards to\n stand upright without support. It will be quite an easy matter to get the piece\n out of the way after you are done with it.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO CHANGE THE ACES.\n</p>\n<p>\n To perform this illusion you must have a card prepared beforehand. Carefully\n \u2022ut the ace of clubs from a card and nib the back of it with soap sufficient to\n attach it to the ace of diamonds, which it will cover entirely. Place the card ou\n your table so as to have it convenient.

There are only a few sleight of hand feats in which\n pieces of money are used, that can be very effective in large halls -on account of\n the fact that such objects, being small, are not easily seen, and at a distance of\n twenty feet it is frequently difficult to distinguish the difference between a half '\n dollar and a dollar coin. There are various methods of making \u201cpasses,\u201d palm-\n ing, etc. , a few of which I will first describe.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO PALM A COIR.\n</p>\n<p>\n Open your hand and place in the palm thereof a silver half-dollar. Now\n slightly close the hand, which will push the coin into the proper position so that\n by slightly compressing the muscles you can hold it quite tightly, and if you turn\n your hand over it will not fall out. This is the usual method of palming. It\n should be practiced so that you can swing your arm carelessly or pick up other\n objects, such as your wand, or an orange, without dropping the coin. When\n studying sleight of hand I used to carry a coin palmed in my hand for hours at\n a time, while attending to other matters. You should practice with coins of\n various sizes; the smaller the piece the less easily you can palm it unless your\n hand happens to be a small one. Another thing to be acquired is the knack of\n palming quickly.\n</p>\n<p>\n You should learn to catch a coin on the fly, yet have it immediately rest in the\n proper position. Do not imagine that it is necessary to keep your hand flat; this\n is a mistake frequently made by amateurs. The hand should retain its natural\n position at all times. Another method, not exactly \u201cpalming,\u201d is to hold a coin\n between two fingers. This way is sometimes useful. Sometimes the coin is\n held between the thumb and forefinger, where a tight pressure is possible if\n necessary. This latter method is desirable for secretly holding two or three\n coins.\n</p>\n<p>\n If it is desired to hold a number of pieces, say twenty quarters, they should be\n tied by a thread then held in the palm of the hand, but in such a case a tight and\n even pressure is needed to prevent an accident.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cle tourniquet\u201d\u2014 the pass.\n</p>\n<p>\n A very simple yet perplexing (to spectators) pass is performed as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n Hold the left hand, palm upwards, with the coin resting by the edge, horizon-\n tally between the thumb and second finger.\n</p>\n<p>\n Next move the right hand toward the left, passing the thumb to the right\n under and the fingers over the coin, closing them just as they pass it. At the\n same time let the coin drop into the palm of the left hand. It will appear to the\n spectators as if your right hand had grasped the coin. You should then carry\n the right hand (closed) upwards, at the same time letting the left arm to drop\n naturally. Follow your right hand with your eyes. If you execute this pass\n well, the audience will firmly believe that you are holding the coin in your right\n hand, when, as you of course know, it is in your left. If you wish, you can, at a\n moment of inadventure on the part of the audience, drop the coin from your\n hand into your pochette, thus enabling you to say: \u201cI will now open my right\n hand and it is gone,\u201d and if anybody challenges you to open your left hand, you\n can do that also, showing that the money has disappeared entirely.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE RING OF MONEY.\n</p>\n<p>\n This Is a parlor trick, requires no skill and is quite surprising to those who dO\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0022/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 259, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 439}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0022/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 518, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 879}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0022/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1037, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1758}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0022/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2075, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3516}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0022/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0022.jp2", "height": 3516, "width": 2075, "levels": 6, "size": 623318}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"22\">\n<p>\n SIMPLE TRICKS WITH COINS.\n</p>\n<p>\n a\n</p>\n<p>\n not know how it is done.

Take your two cents\n in one hand, with only one visible, perform the trick, then ask some one else to\n do it, giving them of course the other cent. The writer has had lots of amuse-\n ment watching the ineffectual attempts, by wetting and otherwise to make a\n perfect cent stick to the wall.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO CHANGE ONE COIN INTO ANOTHER.\n</p>\n<p>\n You may perform with an old quarter a trick which, if well executed, is very\n amusing. You exhibit the quarter in the hand; then only just shut and open\n the hand, and it changes itself into a cent. You only need to shut and open the\n hand a second time to change it back into a quarter; the third time it disap-\n pears altogether, and the fourth it reappears again. These four tricks, alto-\n gether, should occupy less than half a minute.\n</p>\n<p>\n To do this you must have a quarter dollar (old style, and precisely the same\n Size as a cent), filed down and flattened to half its thickness. The cent must be\n treated in the same way; and they are then soldered together, so as to appear\n but one piece, which is either of copper or silver, according to which side is up-\n permost. You begin by exhibiting the piece on the ends of the fingers.\n</p>\n<p>\n Closing the hand you naturally reverse the coin, and it reappears as a cent\n About the middle of the hand.\n</p>\n<p>\n If you then allow it to glide gently towards the ends of the fingers, it is clear\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0023/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 258, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 438}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0023/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 516, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 876}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0023/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1032, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1752}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0023/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2065, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3505}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0023/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0023.jp2", "height": 3505, "width": 2065, "levels": 6, "size": 633491}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"23\">\n<p>\n SIMPLE TRICKS WITH COINS. 88\n</p>\n<p>\n that you only need to shut and open the hand a second time to male* It reappear\n as a quarter.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then make the coin disappear by palming, and it is very easy to make it ap-\n pear again.

When the time arrives for the presentation of this particular feat, Prof.\n Kellar comes forward with a wand, upon the end of which he asks several per-\n sons to slip their rings. When, say half a dozen have been collected, the wizard\n drops what appear to be the same rings from the wand, upon a plate. His as-\n sistant hands him a revolver. He places one or two of the rings inside the bar-\n rel of the shooter, but finds that some of the others are too large, and in order\n that they may fit easily, he pounds them flat with a hammer, which, of course,\n causes considerable amusement.\n</p>\n<p>\n Having loaded his revolver with the rings, he calls attention to the box which\n is hanging at the other side of the stage, and asks the audience to recollect that\n all the while it has not been touched by himself or anybody else. Aiming at the\n box, he deliberately fires.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then he places the box upon a small table and unlocks it. Inside he finds a\n smaller box which he lifts out, and from this box he removes a smaller one, and\n so on until seven have been taken out, each a size smaller than the one previously\n shown.

The\n buds, with rings are handed to the owners of the latter. The audience applaud\n and imagine this brilliant trick is concluded, but not yet, for when Kellar begins\n his next trick, that of producing various kinds of liquid from the same bot-\n tle, som\u00ae anxious person calls out that his ring has not been returned. At this,\n the prestldlditateur feigns surprise, but going to the stage, cracks the myster-\n ious bottle, from which comes a live Guinea-pig. Around the neck of the pig is\n a ribbon, upon which is the missing ring. This \u201caccident\u201d adds an amusing and\n startling finale to the trick.\n</p>\n<p>\n How is it done? I will explain as well as possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n Your wand should be quite slender, so that a ring will fit upon it easily. You\n should have several dummy finger rings of brass, some containing imitations of\n precious stones. The boxes should be made of wood \u2014 black walnut for instance,\n not over three-eights of an inch thick. They are nothing more or less than solid\n wooden boxes, with covers, except the next to the smallest; this has no bottom,\n the reason for which will be understood later. At least one table is needed,\n which should have a servante. A small, neat appearing table is best. Use an\n ordinary revolver if you like, but have a horn-like barrel which fits over the real\n barrel. See diagram:\n</p>\n<p>\n The bottle is especially made of tin or glass upon the plan of the inexhaust-\n able bottle. If this additional part of the trick is used, I would advise that the\n reader buy the bottle arrangement of a dealer in magical goods. An explana-\n tion of its interior arrangement would occupy considerable space here, and a\n novice who attempted to make one would probably meet with a failure, or at\n least could not make one as cheap as he can buy it for. The boxes and other\n necessaries for the trick are also sold by dealers, at prices considerably lower\n than you could make the same things for. Prof. W. D. Le Roy, of Boston, sup-\n plies this, and all other mechanical tricks. A letter addressed to him as above\n will bring you his catalogue. Bland, Martinka, Chase and Yost are also reliable\n manufacturers.\n</p>\n<p>\n Having the required \u201cproperties,\u201d you are now ready to perform the trick.\n Before coining forward, place the six dummy rings on one end of your wand,\n and hold this end in your right hand in such a way that the rings cannot be seen.\n You will now allow persons to place the rings upon the other end of the wand.\n As you approach the stage, or even your table, with your back toward the spec-\n tators, grasp the borrowed rings in your left hand, at the same time allowing the\n bogus ones to slide down on the wand to take their places. Turning around\n naturally, you take up a plate with your left hand (which also holds the borrowed\n rings,) and allow the bogus rings to fall off the wand to the plate. Place the\n plate upon a chair and go to the \u201cwing\u201d of the stage for your revolver. This be-\n ing out of sight of the audience, gives you an opportunity to drop the real rings\n into your assistant\u2019s hand. You then come to view with the revolver. Smash\n the rings, making humorous remarks, causing as much fun as possible to kill\n time. In the meanwhile, your confederate is attaching each ring to a rosebud,\n and these are placed in the smallest of the nest of boxes which he has in his pos-\n session. Having \u201cloaded\u201d the box, he places it upon the servante of the table,\n which is also behind scenes.\n</p>\n<p>\n The box which is suspended from a hook, contains the other boxes, (except\n the smallest,) one inside the other down to the second smallest, which you wiV\n remember contains no bottom.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0028/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 256, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 436}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0028/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 513, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 873}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0028/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1027, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1747}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0028/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2054, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3495}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0028/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0028.jp2", "height": 3495, "width": 2054, "levels": 6, "size": 712376}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"28\">\n<p>\n ILLUSIONS WITH RINGS .\n</p>\n<p>\n 28\n</p>\n<p>\n When placing the broken rings in the revolver, take care that they do not enter\n the real barrel, but push them down between the outside of the real barrel and\n the inside of the extra one, or you can use a false barrel which contains a com-\n partment for holding them.

The properties of\n this trick consists of a duplicate ring, of any sort, which is attached by a four\n inch thread to the centre of a handkerchief. An orange is required, in which a\n slot has keen made previous to the opening of the trick. This slot is large enough\n to hold a ring when desired. A knife and goblet are also wanted.\n</p>\n<p>\n Borrow a ring, take it in your left hand and pretend to grasp it therefrom with\n your right, but in reality, allowing it to fall into the palm of the left. You do\n this by the pass known as le tourniquet, described in the chapter of coin tricks.\n Of course the audience must be led to believe that the ring is held in your right\n hand. With your left hand, (which contains the ring) pick up the handkerchief\n in which the duplicate ring is concealed. Pretend to place the borrowed ring\n in the centre of the handkerchief, which you apparently drop from your right\n hand, although it contains nothing. Having made this deceptive movement, you\n place the handkerchief over a goblet, in such a way that the false ring falls\n therein, making a jingling sound, which is to prove that the ring is really there.\n Having done this, request some one to hold the covered goblet tightly while you\n , go for an orange. As soon as you are out of sight, take the ring from the palm\n of your left hand and press it deeply into the aperture of the orange, which you\n bring forth. In order to prevent discovery of the fact that the fruit has been\n tampered with, have it wrapped at once in another handkerchief which some one\n may hold.\n</p>\n<p>\n Next take the goblet and place it upon a table. Lift up the handkerchief, that\n is over it, carefully, and the thread, to which the false ring is attached will bring\n that up also, under cover of the cloth, thus leaving the glass again empty. The\n handkerchief may be thrown aside or thrust in your pocket. Upon cutting the\n orange, the borrowed ring is found enclosed.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0029/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 258, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 438}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0029/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 516, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 876}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0029/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1032, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1752}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0029/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2065, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3505}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0029/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0029.jp2", "height": 3505, "width": 2065, "levels": 6, "size": 689698}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"29\">\n<p>\n ILLUSIONS WITH RINGS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here Is the way to talk when presenting a trick of this sort: \u201cLadies and gen*\n tlemen: I will now show you a very wonderful experiment in the problem of\n rapid transit. We are ail aware of the many wonders that have been effected\n by the aid of electricity, but this feat is even exceeded by the subtle powers of\n the modern magician. A wizard\u2019s control is best exerted upon precious stones\n or metals, and therefore, for the purpose of my experiment, I wish to borrow a\n gold lady\u2019s ring\u2014 no, I mean a lady\u2019s gold ring. Ah! here is one, thank you.\n yt seems to be solid, is very pretty. I will take it in my hand and place it in this\n handkerchief from which I will drop it into the glass here, which by the way,\n you all observe to be perfectly empty. There, you can hear it jingle. Will some-\n body please hold it. That\u2019s right, sir. Now hold it carefully with both hands\n around the sides and don\u2019t for the world move even a finger (the performer says\n this, so that the person will not attempt to lift the handkerchief too soon). Now\n I will get an orange.\u2019\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHere is the orange. Will some one please loan me another handkerchief. Very\n well, madam, this will be quite satisfactory; will you please hold the orange\n which is wrapped in your handkerchief.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI will now proceed to perform the feat of causing an instantaneous transit\n of the ring here (take the goblet from the man\u2019s hand and shake it) to the very\n centre of that fruit which the lady holds. \u201d It is possible that there are some people\n here who have sharp eyes, and if such persons will watch very closely, they may\n be able to detect the gold as it passes through the air in a fluid condition. Some-\n times, it goes in a narrow streak, much like the air, but more dense, like the\n milky way in the firmament, so that it is barely discemable. The ring is about\n V) go now. I will wave my wa\u00bbd. Presto Pass! It has gone from here. See, I\n lift the handkerchief carefully, to show you that the glass is entirely empty.\n Now, madam, please remove the wrapping from your orange and I will cut it\n with this knife. Ah ! my knife has struck something solid, let\u2019s break open the\n fruit. Here inside, is the identical ring.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n THE TRAVELING RING.\n</p>\n<p>\n Procure a piece of wire which has been sharpened to a point at each end and\n bend it around your finger so that it fits as a ring. When you are to perform\n the trick, have this palmed in your right hand. Ask somebody to loan you a\n plain band ring, also a handkerchief. Hold the borrowed ring visible in the\n fingers of the right hand, then with the left throw the handkerchief over it so\n that it is covered, and while thus removed from view, substitute the dummy for\n the real ring, palming the latter. With your left hand grasp the outside of the\n handkerchief in such a manner that the form of the false ring (which the au-\n dience believe to be the real one,) is apparent. In the meantime, take away\n your right hand which contains the borrowed one, which you hold naturally at\n your side. Give the handkerchief in which the \u201cring\u201d is wrapped to somebody\n to hold, and at the same time adroitly slip the genuine ring into a spectator\u2019s\n pocket.\n</p>\n<p>\n You can now pretend to manipulate the \u201cring\u201d which is in the handkerchief\n held by one of the audience. Holding it in such a way that Its form shows, you\n cover the handkerchief with your hand and assert that the ring will soon disap-\n pear from there and pass through the air to some other place. You can quite\n easily manipulate the piece through the cloth by means of the sharp point, thus\n getting it secretly into your hand when you palm & . Then say that when you\n exclaim \u201cpresto,\u201d the ring will be found in \u201cso and so\u2019s\u201d pocket.

A watch needs careful handling. The writer, who happened to have\n a trick of this sort in his repertoire, which was performed nightly for a season,!\n became exceedingly adept in tossing a borrowed watch to his assistant whilej\n reaching for a wand. On one occasion being slightly nervous, he missed aim;\n and the time-keeper went against a wall with considerable force. The quick-\n witted assistant who was to \u201cload\u201d the watch into a box, realizing the situation,\n placed a two dollar bill around it, which he deemed would pay the damages.\n When the watch was ultimately \u201crestored,\u201d I was not only able to say, \u201chere is\n the watch again,\u201d but \u201cyou observe that it comes back with a bank bill as in-\n terest.\u201d The subterfuge \u201ccaught on\u201d and as the lender of the watch was a good\n natured person, all ended well. However, I did not toss watches about as care-\n lessly after this instance.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ladies\u2019 watches, being small, are easiest to handle.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE EDUCATED TIME-KEEPER,\n</p>\n<p>\n Procure a small magnet so that it can be concealed in your hand. It should be\n quite powerful.\n</p>\n<p>\n Borrow somebody\u2019s watch and pretend to mesmerize it by blowing upon the\n glass over the dial. Then hold it up to the ear of one person and ask him to\n say whether or not it is ticking. He will answer in the affirmative. Next place\n it at the ear of another person, but on this occasion, hold it in the hand that\n contains the magnet. This will cause its interior motion to stop. The one who\n is listening will state that it is not ticking. You can make the watoh tick or not,\n as you desire, by this simple method, causing much consternation to the owner\n and amusement to the lookers on.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE SMASHED AND RESTORED WATCH.\n</p>\n<p>\n For this trick you need some specially prepared apparatus. Get a lady\u2019s\n stocking, which should be of merino or cotton. At the top, near the opening,\n sew inside a pocket large enough to contain a lady\u2019s watch. This pocket should\n be attached to one side of the stocking only, so that there will be no interference\n with the passage from top to toe. Next procure some pieces of glass, tin, etc.,\n and if possible, one or two wheels, or parts of works of an old watch. Tie these\n into a little bundle surrounded with dark cloth, about the size of a watch and as\n heavy.\n</p>\n<p>\n A revolver with funnel shaped tube therein, (similar to the one used in the\n ring trick) should be on hand, also a loaf of bread in which a slot has been cut\n with a knife. The pistol and bread should be behind the scenes. Before begin-\n ning the trick, place the dummy watch inside the top of the stocking, (but no\n in the pocket,) and hold it in place close to the upper edge with your fingers.\n You can come forward, carelessly swinging the hosiery, and ask to borrow a\n lady\u2019s watch. When this is handed you (no chain should be attached,) drop it\n into the pocket, at the same time releasing the false watch, which falls to the\n toe of the stocking, and w hich the audience believe to be the real time-piece.\n Now, while approaching the stage, remove Ihe watch from it\u2019s resting place,\n palming it, w hich you can readily do. Tell the audience that you will swing the\n flocking in a circle, and will there by caus e the w atch (which you assert to be\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0031/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 258, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 438}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0031/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 516, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 876}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0031/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1032, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1752}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0031/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2065, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3505}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0031/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0031.jp2", "height": 3505, "width": 2065, "levels": 6, "size": 680156}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"31\">\n<p>\n ILLUSIONS WITH HANDKERCHIEFS .\n</p>\n<p>\n 31\n</p>\n<p>\n therein,) to tick faster.

Finally after amusing the\n audience with your apparent fear, say that you will make an effort to repair the\n damage. Ask some little boy or girl to step forward to help you. When one\n has approached, drop the stocking containing the \u201cdamaged watch\u201d on the\n floor and request the juvenile assistant to jump on it! This will create consid-\n erable amusement, not to- mention excitement and affords you an opportunity\n to carry off the palmed watch under pretense of going for the revolver and bread.\n While out of view, push the watch into the loaf, and bring it out with the shoot-\n ing piece. By this time, your assistant will have smashed the \u201cwatch\u201d inside\n the stocking. You pick up the latter and pour therefrom, the broken pieces in-\n to the tube of the revolver. Placing the loaf of bread at a distance of several\n feet, shoot at the bread. Take a knife and cut the loaf, producing therefroni\n the watch which is completely restored.\n</p>\n<p>\n This trick is quite easily done by one who understands palming, and produces\n a surprising effect. Like all other effective tricks, however, considerable prac-\n tice is required before its production in public.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER X.\n</p>\n<p>\n ILLUSIONS WITH HANDKERCHIEFS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Usually the best material to use in a handkerchief trick is silk. It Is more pli-\n able and can more easily be crowded into a small space than if cotton or other\n material.\n</p>\n<p>\n KNOTTED HANDKERCHIEF.\n</p>\n<p>\n For this trick you will require two silk handkerchiefs. Twist them rope\n fashion and request some one to tie them, holding the two ends for them to do\n so. After this knot has been tied, take it in your hand apparently to tighten the\n knot, but in reality to pull it sharply the opposite way, which will draw the\n handkerchief in a straight line, forming a slip knot of the other. Request some\n one\u2014 a lady if possible, to breathe on the knots, when, taking the knotted part in\n your hand, you give a sleight pull to the other handkerchief and they will be\n perfectly straight and free from knots.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many performers do this trick by using six or more borrowed handkerchiefs\n ,and requesting some one to tie them all together; as each one is tied you ap-\n parently draw the knots tighter, but in reality pull them into desired position\n each time until they are all done.\n</p>\n<p>\n Borrow a tall hat and place the handkerchiefs slowly in it with the left hand,\n pulling them loose with the right hand at the same time, one by one, as they are\n placed in the hat. As the knots have been drawn into required position it is an\n easy matter to draw them one by one from the loop which holds them.\n</p>\n<p>\n This way is very effective as the audience have seen the handkerchiefs tied\n and placed in the hat. You can ask for a little music and shake the handker-\n chiefs gently one by one from the hat so that they can be seen to fall perfectly\n free. The knot used is what is called a common reef knot .\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0032/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 256, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 436}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0032/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 513, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 873}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0032/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1027, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1747}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0032/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2054, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3495}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0032/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0032.jp2", "height": 3495, "width": 2054, "levels": 6, "size": 619546}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"32\">\n<p>\n J2\n</p>\n<p>\n ILLUSIONS WITH HANDKERCHIEFS-\n</p>\n<p>\n the revolving handkerchief.\n</p>\n<p>\n Although this trick appears to be a marvelous feat of jugglery, it is very easy\n to perform and causes much admiration and praise for the performer.\n</p>\n<p>\n pring forward a large handkerchief \u2014 a new linen one is best for this purpose,\n and a wand or short stick. Throw the handkerchief into the air, catch it with\n the wand and cause it to whirl rapidly. You will occasionally toss it off the\n wand and catch it again still continuing the spinning.\n</p>\n<p>\n The whole secret of this juggler\u2019s feat lies in a needle which you have pre-\n viously inserted in the end of the wand so that it projects about half an inch.\n When the handkerchief is thrown into the air, it is caught on this point, which\n by the way should be a fine needle. This is not to be seen by the audience, and\n the performer should act accordingly. This little trick can be worked to advan-\n tage, either as an opening trick, or as a conclusion to a more elaborate feat in\n which the handkerchief has piayed a part. For example, when a handkerchief\n is borrowed from the audience, the spinning can be performed before the hand\n kerchief is exchanged for a substitute, concealed under the vest of the per*\n former. Or again, at the conclusion of some handkerchief trick, before hand-}\n mg it back to its owner.

Six multiplied by two would be\n twelve\u2014 with five added make seventeen, multiplied by five is eighty-five, with\n three added make eighty-eight; from this take twenty-five and it gives as a result\n sixty -three \u2014 six, three, being the numbers thrown. This can be worked with the\n same result if the person throwing the die multiplies the three instead of the six,\n the result in that case being thirty-six instead of sixty-three.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO CHANGE THE NUMBERS ON DICE,\n</p>\n<p>\n Take an ordinary pair of dice and hold them in such a manner between the\n thumb and finger that the numbers visible to the audience are three, one, the\n three being the upper number. Ask one of the audience to tell the numbers,\n stating plainly which is the top one. This being done you state that by rubbing\n your fingers over them you cause them to change places by simply passing your\n finger over them.\n</p>\n<p>\n In bringing your hands together you turn the dice quarter way round. This\n will bring the next side of the dice toward the audience and the numbers will read\n one, three, instead of three, one, as before. This can be varied by again rubbing\n them with your finger. You can show the third side which will read six, four,\n and repeating the motion you show the fourth side which will be four, six. These\n numbers may be varied but care must always be taken to have similar numbers\n on two adjoining sides.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO TELL THE NUMBER OF DOMINOES MOVED.\n</p>\n<p>\n Without giving the audience an idea of special arrangement place a set of dom-\n inoes face down, in a row on the table. See that the first one in the row shall\n have twelve points, the next eleven, and so on until you reach double blank. This\n should leave you seven which are not placed and their order makes no special\n difference.\n</p>\n<p>\n Request the audience to remove any number of the dominoes, not exceeding\n twelve, from the right to the left hand end of the row, in other respects retaining\n their order.\n</p>\n<p>\n On your return to the room you state that with the aid of clairvoyance you will\n tell how many dominoes have been moved during your absence, and to show that\n there is no \u201cconfederate\u201d assisting you you will also tell the number of spots on\n the dominoes moved. Tell them that you can also tell the number of points on\n each dominoe in its present position, facedown, as readily as when in the ordinary\n position; 1\n</p>\n<p>\n Count mentally the row to the thirteenth of the row from the left hand end, or\n the eighth from*the right hand end, place your wand on that dominoe and state\n that the points on that one represent the number of dominoes that have been\n moved in your absence. * Ask them before turning it the number that were moved;\n suppose the answer to be two you turn the dominoe and show that you were\n correct.

Having i\n taken up one of the whistles, which has previously been filled with flour or mag-\n nesia, dust or soot, proceed to give a few directions, particularly impressing on\n him the necessity of blowing hard, because the whistle you place in his hands is\n perforated with a number of holes. The would-be magician is, therefore, excess-\n ively mortified, on applying his mouth and blowing hard, to receive the powdei\n in his face.

Procure fifteen separate yards of different colored rib-\n bon, of the width which is sold at about three cents a yard; sew them together\n to form one length, joining the contrasting colors; then roll it up neatly around\n Itself, and it will be about the size of four half-dollars put together. Now obtain\n some white paper shavings from a book-binder; shake them up lightly, and they\n will look like a bushel. When you begin the trick, take the roll of ribbon in the\n left hand, which with a few shavings is effectually hidden, then \u201cset to\u201d and eat\n your paper; as you feed, by pretending to thrust an extra handful down the\n throat from time to time, you can easily manage to withdraw the masticated\n portions unseen and carry them down to the ground, as you lift other \u201ctidbits\u201d\n to the mouth. After this has continued long enough, that is, when your visitors\n have laughed \u201ctill their sides ache,\u201d the shavings are now and then pressed up,\n which gives the appearance of diminished quantity; finally a last effort is made\n \u201cto finish it,\u201d and you then pop the roll of ribbon in the mouth, and throwing\n the remaining shavings on the floor, you take hold of the end of the ribbon and be-\n gin to unwind it; by drawing it gradually from the mouth it will appear as though\n it came from the stomach. The teeth must be kept close enough to prevent the\n entire roll from being pulled out altogether.

To perform this trick, all that you have to do is to blow\n smartly on one side of the egg, and it will hop into the next glass; repeat this\n and it will hop back again.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE TWO COMMUNICATIVE BUSTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Having procured two busts of plaster of Paris, place them on pedestals on op-\n posite sides of the room. Let a thin tube, an inch in diameter, pass from the\n ear of one head through the pedestal, under the floor, and go up to the mouth of\n the other, taking care that the end of the tube that is next the ear of the one\n head should be considerably larger than that end which comes to the mouth of\n the other. Now, when a person speaks quite low into the ear of one bust, the\n sound is reverberated through the length of the tube, and will be distinctly\n heard by any one placing his ear to the mouth of the other. It is not necessary\n that the tube should come to the lips of the bust. If there be two tubes, one go-\n ing to the ear, and the other to the mouth of each head, two persons may con-\n verse together by whispers, without the knowledge of any other person in the\n room.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE CHEST THAT OPENS AT COMMAND.\n</p>\n<p>\n Within this chest there is a small figure of Mahomet, in the body of which is a\n spring made of brass wire, twisted in a spiral form. By this means the little\n figure, though higher than the chest, can, by the accommodation of the spring,\n be contained within when it is shut, as the spring in the body closes and\n shortens. The chest is placed on levers concealed on the table, which communi-\n cate their motion, by the assistance of the confederate, to the bolt of the lock, as\n soon as the staple is disengaged. The spring in the body of the figure, finding\n no resistance but the weight of the lid, forces it open.\n</p>\n<p>\n HOW TO EAT TOW, AND SET IT ON FIRE IN YOUR MOUTH.\n</p>\n<p>\n Take a handful of tow in your left hand, then take a part of it with your right\n hand and put it into your mouth, chew it and seem to swallow it; and when\n your mouth cannot hold more, put the bundle of tow you have in your left hand\n to your mouth, in order to eat more, then disgorge what you have in your\n mouth . All this while you must have a piece of touchwood lighted, and wrapped\n in some you have to eat.\n</p>\n<p>\n HOW TO TELL THE NUMBER THAT ANY PERSON THINKS OF.\n</p>\n<p>\n Bid the person double the number he has fixed on in his mind; which done,\n bid him multiply the sum of them both by 5 and give you the product, which\n thay \u25a0win never refuse to do (it being so far above th^ji umber thought oO\u00bb from\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0050/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 256, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 436}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0050/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 513, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 873}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0050/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1027, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1747}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0050/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2054, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3495}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0050/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0050.jp2", "height": 3495, "width": 2054, "levels": 6, "size": 703244}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"50\">\n<p>\n 99\n</p>\n<p>\n MISCELLANEOUS TRICKS.\n</p>\n<p>\n which, If you cut off the last figure of the product, will always be a cypher or a\n S\u2014 the number left will be that first thought of.

The bottom must likewise be a whole card, glued to the box\n on one side only, yielding immediately to interior pressure, and serving as a\n door by which you can convey the mouse into the box. Being thus prepared,\n and holding the bottom tight with your hand, request one of the company to\n place his open hands together, and tell him you mean to produce something\n marvelous from this pack of cards; place the cards then in his hands, and while\n you engage his attention in conversation, affect to want something out of your\n bag, and at the same moment take the pack by the middle and throw it into the\n bag, when the mouse will remain in the hands of the person who held the cards.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO TELL THE HOUR OF THE DAY OR NIGHT BY A SUSPENDED QUARTER.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sling a quarter or a dime at the end of a piece of thread by means of a loop;\n then resting your elbow upon a table, hold the other end of the thread between\n your forefinger and thumb, observing to let it pass across the ball of the thumb,\n and thus suspend the coin in an empty goblet. Observe, your hand must be per-\n fectly steady; and if you find it difficult to keep it in an immovable posture, it is\n useless to attempt the experiment. Premising that the quarter is properly sus-\n pended, you will find that, when it has recovered its equilibrium, it will for a\n moment be stationary; it will then, of its own accord and without the least\n agency from the person holding it, assume the action of a pendulum, vibrating\n from side to side of the glass, and after a few seconds will strike the hour near-\n est to the time of day ; for instance, if the time be twenty-five minutes past six,\n it will strike seven, and so on of any other hour. It is necessary to observe that\n the thread should lie over the pulse of the thumb, and this may in some measure\n . account for the vibration of the quarter, but to what cause its striking the pre-\n cise hour is to be traced remains unexplained; for it is no less astonishing than\n true, that when it has struck the proper number its vibration ceases, it acquires\n a kind of rotary motion and at last becomes stationary as before.\n</p>\n<p>\n AN AMUSING TRICK FOR THE DRAWING-ROOM, AND A GOOD SUBJECT FOR A WAGER.\n</p>\n<p>\n You begin by declaring that if any one will write something on a piece of\n paper, you will undertake to say what there is upon it.

Around the edge of\n the basin may be placed various devices; among others a swan-house, such as is\n seen upon the river, may hang over and touch the water; here the swan may\n take shelter occasionally, and in it he may be made to turn around, in order to\n increase the astonishment of the spectators. In the management of the magnetic\n bar placed within the swan, and of a magnetic wand, consists the whole of the\n experiments to be elicited from the approaching or receding of the figure, by\n presenting to the edge of the basin the north and south poles alternately.\n</p>\n<p>\n The wand is thus made : Bore a hole, three-tenths of an inch in diameter,\n through a round piece of wood, or get a hollow cane, about eight inches long\n and a half an inch thick. Provide a small steel bar, and let it be impregnated\n with a good magnet; this rod is to be put into the hole you have bored through\n the wand, and closed at both ends by two small pieces of ivory which screw on,\n different in their shapes, that you may easily distinguish the poles of the mag-\n netic bar. This contrivance is applicable to several other kinds of floating fig-\n ures, as ships, & c.\n</p>\n<p>\n A CARD NAILED TO THE WALL BY A PISTOL SHOT.\n</p>\n<p>\n A card is requested to be drawn, and the person who chooses it is desired to\n tear off a comer and keep it, that he may know the card; the card so tom is\n burnt to cinders, and a pistol is charged with gunpowder, with which the ashes\n of the card are mixed. Instead of a ball a nail is put into the barrel, which is\n marked by some of the company. The pack of cards is then thrown up in the\n air, the pistol fired, and the burnt card appears nailed against the wall; the bit\n of the comer which was tom off is then compared with it and is found exactly\n to fit, and the nail which fastens it to the wall is recognized by the persons who\n marked it.\n</p>\n<p>\n The operation is as follows : When the performer sees that a comer has been\n tom from the chosen card, he retires under some pretence and makes a similar\n tear in a like card. Returning on the stage, he asks for the chosen card, and\n passes it to the bottom of the pack, and substitutes expertly in its place the card\n he has prepared, which he bums instead of the first. When the pistol is loaded\n he takes it in his hand, under the pretext of showing how to direct it, & c. He\n avails himself of this opportunity to open a hole in the barrel near the touch-\n hole, through which the nail falls by its own weight into the hand. Having shut\n this carefully, he requests one of the company to put more powder and wadding\n into the pistol. While that is being done, he passes the nail and card to his con-\n federate, who nails the card to a piece of square wood, which stops hermetically\n a space left open in the partition and the tapestry, and by which means, when\n the nailed card is put in, it is not perceived.

Very well ! There is a little handkerchief which will serve me\n to make the experiment I have promised you.

I am only folding the handkerchief that the quarter may be\n well wrapped up m it; you can have no difficulty in recognizing its shape.\n However, you are suspicious ! I will make an improvement. There, sir; hold\n the handkerchief yourself, just above the little parcel formed by the coin. You\n may touch it, and convince yourself that it is still in its place. Now I take the\n handkerchief by the opposite corner and draw it toward me, unfolding it entire-\n ly; I then turn it over, shake it and wave it in the air, to convince you that the\n coin has disappeared. The fact is evident. But did you see it go? No!

The operator\n must take care neither to make the holes too large or too numerous. A recrea-\n tion similar to this is made with a wide-mouthed glass, filled with water, over\n which a piece of paper is placed; for if the glass be then inverted, and the paper\n drawn dexterously away, the water will remain in the glass.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE CONJUROR\u2019S JOKE.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is a complete trick, but may afford some amusement.

Put one cup then into the bag, appear to fill it, and take it out turned\n bottom upwards, when it will look as if it had been filled. Put it in that position\n under one hat; in doing so turn it over. Then take the other empty cup, put that\n under the other hat; and, in doing so, turn that over, which, of course, must be\n invisible to the audience.

This is sewed in the corner of a handkerchief in\n the same manner as the ring in the \u201cRussian Ring Trick.\u201d When the first box\n has been filled, the performer takes it, meantime pretending to place it in the\n handkerchief palms it, and gives the second one to be held. He now walks away\n to take his position at a distance, and while his back is turned to the audience he\n takes the opportuniry of opening the box and examining the contents. Having\n fully inspected and replaced the articles, he proceeds with his description, which,\n being finished, he approaches the person who has the handkerchief, and, taking\n hold of it, requests that he will let go of the box, at the same time shaking the\n handkerchief, and letting the first box, which is still concealed in the palm of the\n hand, fall to the floor. The audience will naturally suppose that the box never\n left the handkerchief, and when they see the borrowed articles taken from it\n and returned to the owners, they will be still further mystified.\n</p>\n<p>\n GO, IP YOU CAN.\n</p>\n<p>\n You tell a person that you will clasp hif hands together in such a manner that\n he shall not be able to leave the room without unclasping them, although you '\n will not confine his teet, or bind his body, or in any way oppose his exit.\n</p>\n<p>\n This trick is performed by clasping the party\u2019s hands around the pillar of a\n large circular table, or other bulky article of furniture, too large for him to drag\n through the doorway.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE CARD CHANGED BY WORD OP COMMAND.\n</p>\n<p>\n You must have two cards of the same kind in one pack, say the king of spades.\n Place one of them next to the bottom card, say the seven of hearts, and the\n other at the top.

You must also provide\n yourself with a small piece of sponge soaked in wine, and, having caused an in-\n dividual to sit down, you immediately proceed to work, by slipping the true\n knife into your pocket and producing the other in its place. Then put your left\n hand, w r ith the sponge in it, upon the person\u2019s brow, and pass the knife gently\n over his nose, so that the semi-circle which is in the knife will cause it to descend\n and to all appearance cut into his nose, while you squeeze the sponge gently, so\n that it may appear to bleed.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE DANCING EGG.\n</p>\n<p>\n Three eggs are brought out; two of them are put on a table, and the third in a\n hat; a little cane is borrowed from one of the company, and it is shown about to\n convince the spectators that there is no preparation. It is then placed across\n the hat, the hat falls to the ground, and the egg sticks to it as if glued; the or-\n chestra plays a piece of music, and the egg, as if it was sensible of the harmony,\n twists about the cane from one end to the other, and continues its motion till\n the music stops. The egg is fastened to a thread by a pin, which is put in\n lengthways, and the hole which has been made to introduce the pin is stopped\n with white wax. The other end of the thread is fastened to the breast of the '\n person who performs the trick, with a pin bent like a hook\u2014 the cane passing\n under the thread near to the egg serves for it to rest on. When the music begins,\n the performer pushes the cane from left to right, or from right to left; it then\n appears as if the egg ran along the cane, which it does not; being fastened to\n its thread, its centre of gravity remains always at the same distance from the\n hook that holds it; it is the cane which, sliding along, presents its different\n points to the surface of the egg, To produce the illusion, and persuade the com-\n pany that it is the egg which carries itself toward the different points of the\n cane, the performer turns a little on his heel; by this means the egg receives a\n motion which deceives the spectators; it remains always at the same distance\n from the point to which it is fastened.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE MAGIC BOUQUETS,\n</p>\n<p>\n Cause a number of flowers and leaves to be made, by an artificial flower maker,\n of white canvas or cotton cloth, such W violets, & c., as you may think\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0062/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 256, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 436}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0062/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 513, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 873}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0062/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1027, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1747}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0062/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2054, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3495}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0062/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0062.jp2", "height": 3495, "width": 2054, "levels": 6, "size": 685224}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"62\">\n<p>\n 69\n</p>\n<p>\n MISCELLANEOUS TRICKS.\n</p>\n<p>\n best.

Invert the jar over\n the iron, and leave the whole untouched until the sprig be covered by the sub-\n limed acid in the form of beautiful hoar frost.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO MAKE WATER RISE FROM A SAUCER INTO A GLASS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Pour water into a saucer, then light a piece of paper, which you put in a wine-\n glass, and, on clapping the glass down into the saucer, the water will be seen to\n rise into it.\n</p>\n<p>\n FIRESIDE MESMERISM.\n</p>\n<p>\n Take a gold ring\u2014 the more massive the better, but your wife\u2019s wedding ring\n will do, if you are so lucky as to have one. Attach the ring to a silk thread\n about twelve inches long; fasten the other end of the thread around the nail-\n joint of your right forefinger, and let the ring hang about half an |nch above the\n surface of the table, on which you rest your elbow to steady your hand. Hold\n your finger horizontally, with the thumb thrown back as far as possible from\n the rest of the hand.\n</p>\n<p>\n If there be nothing on the table, the ring will soon become stationary. Then\n place some silver (say three half-dollars) immediately below it, when the ring\n will begin to oscillate backwards and forwards, to you and from you. Now bring\n your thumb in contact with your forefinger Cor else suspend the ring from your\n thumb), and the oscillations will become transverse to their former swing. Or\n this may be effected by making a lady take hold of your disengaged hand.\n When the transverse motion is fairly established, let a gentleman take hold of\n the lady\u2019s disengaged hand, and the ring will change back to its former course.\n These effects are produced by the aid of animal magnetic currents given forth\n by the hands of the experimenters. Instead of silver, you can suspend the ring\n over your left forefinger, with similar results.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE MAGIC KNIFK.\n</p>\n<p>\n This trick, which is at once simple an d ' clever, has not before been published.\n Ask one of your audience for a pocket-knife, and stick two small square pieces\n of white paper on each side. Give the knife to your audience to be examined,\n and then take it in your left hand, palm upwards. Let the handle of the knife\n be clasped between the thumb and forefinger, and the blade extended outwards\n from you; the handle will then lie on the palm of the hand towards you. With\n practice you will be able, by a rapid turn of the wrist, to pass the knife from\n one side of the hand to the other, always keeping the same side of the blade up\n wards, while to your audience it will appear that you reverse it at every turn.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0063/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 258, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 438}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0063/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 516, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 876}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0063/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1032, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1752}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0063/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2065, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3505}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0063/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0063.jp2", "height": 3505, "width": 2065, "levels": 6, "size": 662846}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"63\">\n<p>\n MISCELLANEOUS TRICES.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6a\n</p>\n<p>\n Wipe the bits of paper off of one side, turn the knife as directed, pass your\n fingers again across the blade, leading your audience to believe that you have\n wiped them off of the second side also.

Be-\n hind the glass picture is a strong light, and before it two magnifying glasses or\n lenses in a telescopic slide, so that they can be adjusted in focus, and so send\n the rays of light from behind the glass diverging to the wall, where they will\n form a larger image. If the light is from the sun, the effects are akin to those\n \u00a9f the solar microscope ; if by a candle or lamp of any sort, a reflector is set so\n as to save all the rays that would not otherwise have illuminated the picture-\n glass.\n</p>\n<p>\n To give movements to the figures in the picture, two pieces of glass are used,\n one set in a frame and painted with part of the figure, while the other, bearing\n the moving portion (as a leg, an arm, or machinery), is worked by a string or\n rod, sliding in through a slit in the frame; thus can a wind or water-mill be seen\n in action; a cobbler sew at a boot; a comic man drink; a Chesterfield take off\n and put on his hat; Mr, Punch flourish his staff of office, & c.\n</p>\n<p>\n To make this optical apparatus more amusing and wondrous, prepare the fig-\n ures so as to be able to give them natural movements, done by using two glass\n slides, on which different parts of the same object are painted, and moving one\n to and fro behind the other. Thus, Jack can be made to thrust his sword at a\n giant; Jack, Jill and the pail fall down hill; a grotesque head put out its tongue;\n a smith hammer on an anvil; a rope-dancer waltz from one end of a cord to the\n other; a trapezist perform, & c.\n</p>\n<p>\n A dissolving view is managed by two lanterns of the same powers, lighted\n equally. The light from one must fall on the same point of the screen where\n the other casts its picture, so that when one slide is gradually shut off and the\n other proportionately discovered, one scene seems to fade into another. The\n best effects are a landscape in winter becoming a view in summer; a desert\n changing into a populous market-place; a ghost into a jolly laughing man,\n</p>\n<p>\n For -phantasmagoria, the figures are surrounded by an opaque tint, so that\n the rays of light pass only through the figures themselves, and while the magic\n lantern views are cast upon a wall with a halo or circle of li^ht all around them,\n the phantasmagorial lantern throws them on a transparent screen, such as a\n sheet of wetted or waxed muslin, oiled or tissue paper, strained smoothly on a\n frame.\n</p>\n<p>\n To prevent the friction of moving slides injuring the painting, interpose a\n thick band of paper around the edges, to keep the surfaces of the two glasses\n from contact.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE TURN WONDER.\n</p>\n<p>\n This amusing toy causes an illusion of vision, and is made and exhibited m fol-\n lows ' Cut out a small circular piece of card, to which fasten four strings.\n Oraw on one side of it a Bacchus aud on the other a butt.

Ha\n had a long gown and a large pocket in front, would squat down, not in a very\n elegant position, and produce from nothing, apparently, a globe brimful of\n water and gold-fish swimming about. It would not suit most people to carry\n about a large dressing gown, or glass globe to carry the fish in, but you may\n perform the experiment without either. Purchase a few gaudily -colored fish at\n a toy-shop, such as you place in a glass of water and they follow a magnet\n about. Then, at an india-rubber store procure a large india-rubber jar cover,\n such as they sell to cover pickle jars or other preserves. In any house you may\n procure a basin that will fit your cover, which will tightly stretch over it; and it\n may happen you can obtain a glass bowl. Place your artificial fish in the globe\n or basin, then fill it with water and stretch on your india-rubber cover; this will\n prevent the water from falling out, whatever position you place it in. Leave the\n room, or retire to a chair in the corner, upon which you have little preparations\n and arrangements, hang a cloth over the back of it, and let no person be allowed\n to go near or to examine it. Have your bowl all ready, and place it under your\n arm or inside your coat. Borrow a large handkerchief or lady\u2019s shawl, or pro-\n vide yourself with a square of black cloth; hold it up to the audience in your two\n bands, showing both sides, then place one corner of the cloth in your mouth and\n your right hand underneath, with which you take the bowl from under your\n arm; place it on the palm of your left hand, the handkerchief or cloth over it.\n You must hold the cloth in your hand and in your mouth so as to conceal the\n doings of the hand under the cloth. The bowl being now in the left hand and\n the cloth over it, with the right hand remove the cloth from off the bowl, and in\n doing so also take off the india-rubber cover. This is very easily done, although\n it requires some strength to stretch it on in the first place.

One professional magician is so expert that he can pro-\n duce this result in fifteen seconds. An amateur should acquire the knack of\n doing it in half a minute.\n</p>\n<p>\n Select your subject \u2014 not a person of the dude make-up, with a skin-tight suit,\n but some good-natured, every-day sort of a fellow, whose clothing fits him easily.\n Tell him to keep cool. Then, begin your operations in earnest by quickly pull-\n ing off his collar and necktie and unbuttoning his shirt behind. Pull his shirt\n from his trousers, up his back, and with a strong exertion, get it right over his\n head. This is by no means hard. You now have it across his stomach. Loosen\n his sleeves, and, grasping the end of one nearest his hand, pull it off his arm.\n You can do this successfully if he limbers his arms and does not resist some\n rather stretching work on your part. After one arm is freed of the shirt, it is\n easy to remove it from the other. The shirt will then come off, to the astonish-\n ment of all.\n</p>\n<p>\n As previously stated, the effect of this trick depends entirely upon your adroit\n ness. It is well to throw a shawl or sheet over the subject\u2019s body when you are\n anout to present this exhibition, that those present may not discover your\n method of operating.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE SHOWER OF MONEY.\n</p>\n<p>\n The magical phenomenon known under this name surpasses the philosopher\u2019s\n stone, in the pursuit of which so many of the wise men of old expended their\n lives and fortunes. The alchemist\u2019s secret aimed only by producing the raw\n material, but the magician\u2019s quick eye and ready hand gather from space money\n ready coined. Unfortunately, the experiment is subject to the same drawback\n as the more ancient process\u2014 ^iz., that each twenty shillings produced cost pre-\n cisely twenty shillings, leaving hardly sufficient profit to make this form of\n money-making renumerative as a commercial undertaking.\n</p>\n<p>\n The effect of the trick is as follows: The performer borrows a hat, which he\n holds in his left hand. Turning up his sleeves, he announces that he requires a\n certain number, say ten, dimes or half-dollars. The spectators put their hands\n in their pockets with the idea of contributing to the supposed loan; but the pro-\n fessor, anticipating their intentions, says, \u201cNo, thank you; I won\u2019t trouble you\n this time. There seems to be a good deal of money about to-night; I think I will\n help myself. See, here is a half-dollar hanging to the gaselier. Here is another\n climbing up the wall. Here is another just settling on this lady\u2019s hair. Excuse\n me, sir, but you have a half-dollar in your whiskers. Permit me madam; you\n have just placed your foot on another,\u201d arid so on. At each supposed new dis- \u2018\n covery the performer takes with his right hand from some place where there\n clearly was nothing an instant before, a half-dollar, which he drops into the hat\n held in his left hand, finally turning over the hat, and pouring the coins from it,\n to show that there has been \u201cno deception.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The explanation is very simple, the trick being merely a practical application\n of \u201cpalming,\u201d though its effect depends on the manner and address of the oper-\n ator even more than on his skill in sleight-of hand.

This first coin he really does drop into the hat, taking\n care that all shall see clearly that he does so. He then goes through a similar\n process with the second; but when the time comes to drop it into the hat, he\n merely pretends to do so, palming the coin quickly in the right hand, and at the\n same moment letting fall into the hat one of the coins concealed in his left hand.\n The audience, hearing the sound, naturally believe it to be occasioned by the\n fall of the coin they have just seen. The process is repeated until the coins in\n the left hand are exhausted. Once more the performer appears to clutch a coin\n from space, and showing for the last time that which has all along been in his\n right hand, tosses into the air, and catches it visibly in the hat. Pouring out the\n coins on a tray, or into the lap of one of the company, he requests that they may\n be counted, when they are found to correspond with the number which he has\n apparently collected from the surrounding atmosphere.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE VANISHING GLOVES.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is a capital trick with which to commence an entertainment; when com-\n ing, as it should do, unannounced, and before the performance proper has com,\n menced, it has an air of improvisation which greatly enhances its effect, and at\n once awakens the attention of the audience.\n</p>\n<p>\n The performer comes forward in full evening dress. While saying a few\n words by way of introduction to his entertainment, he begins to take off his\n gloves, commencing with that on his right hand. As soon as it is fairly off, he\n takes it in the right hand, waves the hand with a careless gesture, and the glove\n is gone. He begins to take off the other, walking as he does so behind his table,\n wherein his wand is laid. The left hand glove being removed, is rolled up into a\n ball, and transferred from the right hand to the left, which is immediately\n closed. The right hand picks up the wand, and with it touches the left, which\n being slowly opened, the second glo^e is found to have also disappeared.\n</p>\n<p>\n The disappearance of the first glove is affected by means of a piece of cord\n elastic, attached to the back of the waistcoat, and thence passing down Hie\n sleeve. This should be of such a length as to allow the glove to be drawn down\n and put on the hand, and yet to pull it smartly up the sleeve and out of sight\n when released. It is desirable to have a hem round the wrist of the glove, and\n to pass the elastic through this like the cord of a bag, as it thereby draws the\n wrist portion of the glove together, and causes it to offer less hindrance to its\n passage up the sleeve. Upon taking off the glove, the performer retains it in\n his hand, and lets it go when he pleases. He must, however, take care to\n straighten his arm before letting it slip, as otherwise the elastic will remain\n comparatively slack, and the glove will, instead of disappearing with a flash,\n dangle ignominiously from the coat-cuff.\n</p>\n<p>\n The left hand glove is got rid of by palming. The performer, standing behind\n his tables as already mentioned, rolling the glove between his hands, and quick-\n ly twisting the fingers inside, so as to bring it into more manageable form, pre-\n tends to place it in his left hand, but really palms it in his right. He now lowers\n the right hand to pick up his wand, and as the hand reaches the table, drops\n the glove on the servante. He now touches the left hand with the wand, in due\n course opening the hand and showing that the glove has departed.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE MIRACULOUS CASKET.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is a neat leather or velvet covered box, about three inches by two,\n two and a half high.

The performer then states that he is about to order the four coins now\n in the casket to pass one by one into the glass upon the table. \u201cOne! 1 \u2019 he ex*\n claims.

The operation is\n repeated till all have vanished, and the operator pours forth from the glass\n four coins, which, on examination, are found to be the same which were origin-\n ally borrowed, and which the audience believe that they saw placed in the\n casket.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE FLYING GLASS OF WATER.\n</p>\n<p>\n This capital trick was, we believe, first introduced to the public by Colonel\n Stodare, to whom the profession is indebted for many first-class illusions. The\n necessary apparatus consists of a couple of ordinary glass tumblers, exactly\n alike, with an india-rubber cover just fitting the mouth of one of them, and a\n colored handkerchief of silk or cotton made double (i. e., consisting of two simi-\n lar handkerchiefs sewn together at the edges), with a wire ring (of the size of\n the rim of one of the tumblers, or a fraction larger) stitched loosely between\n them, in such a manner that when the handkerchief is spread out the ring shall\n be in the middle.\n</p>\n<p>\n The performer, beforehand, nearly fills one of the tumblers with water, and\n then puts on the india-rubber cover, which, fitting closely all round the edge, ef-\n fectually prevents the water escaping. The glass, thus prepared, he places in the\n profonde on his right side. He then brings forward the other glass and a decan-\n ter of water, and the prepared handkerchief, and in full view of the audience fills\n the glass with water up to the same height as he has already filled the one in his\n pocket, and hands round glass and water for inspection. When they are re-\n turned, he places the glass upon the table, a few inches from its hinder edge, and\n standing behind it, covers it with the handkerchief, first spreading out and show-\n ing both sides of the latter, proving, to all appearance, that there is no prepara-\n tion about it. In placing the handkerchief over the glass, he draws it across in\n such a maimer as to bring the hidden ring as exactly as possible over the top of\n the glass. Then placing the left hand over the handkerchief, he raises appar-\n ently, the glass within the handkerchief, but really the empty handkerchief only,\n which is kept distended by the ring, and, at the same time, under cover of the\n ' handkerchief, gently lowers the glass of water with the other hand on to the\n servante. This is by no means difficult, as the pretended carefulness of the op-\n erator not to spill the water allows him to make the upward movement of the\n left hand as deliberate as he pleases. All that is really necessary is to take care\n to follow with his eyes the movement of the left hand , which will infallibly draw\n the eyes and minds of the audience in the same direction. Having raised the\n supposed tumbler a height of about two feet from the table, the performer\n brings forward to the audience, and requests that some gentleman with a steady\n hand will favor him with his assistance. A volunteer having been found, and\n having given satisfactory replies as to the steadiness of his nerves, and the\n strength of his constitution generally, is requested to place his hand under the\n handkerchief aud take the glass. As he proceeds to obey, the performer lets go\n of the handkerchief with the left hand, still retaining one corner with the right,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0072/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 256, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 436}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0072/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 513, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 873}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0072/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1027, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1747}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0072/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2054, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3495}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0072/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0072.jp2", "height": 3495, "width": 2054, "levels": 6, "size": 736934}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"72\">\n<p>\n MISCELLANEOUS TRICES.\n</p>\n<p>\n KZ\n</p>\n<p>\n and lets the right arm with the handkerchief drop to his side. Pretending to be.\n lieve that the gentleman has taken the glass, and not to notice its disappearance^\n he turns carelessly aside, and brings forward a small table or chair, saying,\n \u201cPut it here, please.\u201d Locking, generally, somewhat foolish, the victim replies\n that he has not got it.

At last he says, \u201cWell, if you won\u2019t give it to me, I\n must find it for myself,\u201d and he proceeds to tap with his wand the sleeves and\n pockets of the individual, but without success, till, on touching him between the\n shoulders, he pretends to tell by the sound that the glass is there. \u201cYes, here it\n is,\u201d he remarks, \u201cI am sorry to be obliged to ask you to turn your back on the\n company, but to show them that there is no deception on my part, I am com-\n pelled to do so.

Again he taps with his\n wand, which, striking the ring through the handkerchief, causes an unmistake-\n able hard sound to be heard; and then grasping the ring as before through the\n handkerchief, he deliberately raises it up in a horizontal position, the effect be-\n ing as if the glass had again returned to the handkerchief. He then says, \u201cI\n don\u2019t think I will trouble this gentleman again; he is too much a conjuror him-\n self;\u201d then turning rapidly to audience, he says, \u201cCatch, ladies and gentlemen,\u201d\n and \u201cflicks\u201d the handkerchief quickly towards the spectators, who duck heads\n in expectation of a shower. \u201cPardon me, ladies, I fear I alarm you; but you\n need not have been afraid; I never miss my aim. That gentleman has the glass,\u201d\n (designating any one he pleases). \u201cMay I trouble you to step forward one\n moment, sir?\u201d On the person indicated doing so, the performer places him fac-\n ing the audience, and under cover of his body takes the second glass out of the\n profonde, and throws the handkerchief over it, remarking, \u201cYes, ladies and\n gentlemen, here it is, in this gentleman\u2019s tail pocket.\u201d Then taking hold of the\n glass with the left hand beneath the handkerchief, he clips with the first finger\n and thumb, through the handkerchief, the edge of the india-rubber cover, and\n thus drawing off the cover inside the handkerchief, hands around the glass and\n water for inspection.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE RABBIT TRICK.\n</p>\n<p>\n The performer comes forward to the audience, and borrows a hac. He asks\n whether it is empty, and is answered that it is; but he, notwithstanding, finds\n something in it, which the owner is requested to take out. The article in ques-\n tion proves to be an egg. No sooner has this been removed, than the performer\n discovers that there is something in the hat, and immediately produces there-\n from a live rabbit, quickly followed by a second. Not knowing what other use\n to make of these, he proposes to pass one of them into the other. The audience;\n decide which is to be the victim, and the performer, placing them side by side on\n the table, proceeds to roll them together, when one is found to have vanished,\n nobody knows when or how; but the theory is that it has been swallowed by the\n remaining rabbit, to the (imaginary) increased fatness of wnich the performer\n draws special attention.\n</p>\n<p>\n Having thus passed one rabbit into the other, the next step is to get it out\n again. To do this the performer calls for some bran, and his assistant immedi-\n ately brings forward, and places on a table or chair, a huge glass goblet, twelve\n inches or thereabouts in height, filled to the brim with the commodity. The\n performer takes the borrowed hat, and (after showing that it is empty,) places\n it mouth upwards upon another table, so as to be at some considerable distance\n from the goblet of bran. He then places a brass cover over the glass, first, how-\n ever, taking up and scattering a handful of the bran to prove its genuineness*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0073/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 258, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 438}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0073/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 516, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 876}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0073/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1032, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1752}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0073/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2065, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3505}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0073/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0073.jp2", "height": 3505, "width": 2065, "levels": 6, "size": 700408}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"73\">\n<p>\n MISCELLANEOUS TRICKS.\n</p>\n<p>\n n\n</p>\n<p>\n Taking tke surviving rabbit, and bolding it by the ears above the covered goblet,\n he orders the one swallowed to pass from it into the glass, at the same time\n stroking it down with the disengaged hand, as though to facilitate the process.\n He remarks, \u201cYou must excuse the comparative slowness of the operation,\n ladies and gentlemen, but the fact is, the second rabbit passes downwards in an\n impalpable powder, and, if I were not to take sufflcf mt time, we might find that\n a leg or an ear had been omitted in the process, and the restored rabbit would bo\n a cripple for life.

The\n performer first comes forward with an egg palmed in one hand, and with a\n gmall rabbit in an inner breast-pocket on each side of his coat. The first step is\n the pretended finding of something ut is not stated what) in the hat. The\n owner is requested to take it out, and while all eyes are naturally turned to see\n what the article may prove to be, the performer, without apparent intention,\n presses the mouth of the hat with both hands to his breast, and tilts one of the\n rabbits into It. This is next produced, and in placing it on the ground at his\n feet, the performer brings the second rabbit in the same manner into the hat.\n \u25a0When he undertakes to pass the one rabbit into the other, he places both upon\n the table which contains the rabbit-trap, and, standing sideways to the audience,\n pushes the hindmost, under cover of the other, through the trap. This partic-\n ular rabbit is not again produced, the rabbit in the \u201cbran glass,\u201d being another\n as much like it as possible. It only remains to explain how the bran comes into\n the borrowed hat. This is effected by having a black alapaca bag filled with\n bran in one of the profondes or under the waistcoat of the performer. Then a\n bag is introduced into the hat after the manner of the goblet and the bran hav-\n ing been allowed to run out, the bag is rolled up in the palm, and so removed,\n the bran remaining, to be produced in due course.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE CHINESE RINGS.\n</p>\n<p>\n These are rings of brass or steel, in diameter from five to nine inches, and in\n thickness varying from a quarter to three-eights of an inch. The effect of the\n trick to the spectator is as follows: The rings are given for examination, and\n found to be solid and separate; but at the will of the operator they are linked\n together in chains of two, three, or more, becoming connected and disconnected\n in a moment, and being continually offered for examination. Finally, after the\n rings have become involved in an apparent inextricable mass, a slight shake\n suffices to disentangle them, and to cause them to fall singly upon the stage.\n</p>\n<p>\n The sets of rings sold at the conjuring depots vary in number, varying from\n six to twelve. The set of eight, which is perhaps the most usual number, con-\n sists of one \u201ckey\u201d ring, two single rings, and a set of two linked together, and a\n *et of three linked together. The \u201ckey\u201d ring, in which lies the secret of the\n ^ick, is simply a ring -?ut or opening in it.

You have only to do as I do.\n See?\u201d Laying down the rest of the rings, he holds two and makes a gentle\n rubbing motion with the thumb upon the rings, and then lets fall one of them,\n which naturally drops on the other. He now hands these two rings for exam-\n ination. The spectators seek for some joint or opening, but none is found; and,\n meanwhile the performer transfers the next ring (the \u201ckey\u201d to his right hand,\n keeping the opening under the thumb.

Again he separates and again joins the two\n rings. The second single rte\u00bb s now made to pass in like manner.\n</p>\n<p>\n The performer remarks, \u201cWe now have three joined together. Here are three\n more, as you see (shaking those in the left hand), all solid and separate, and yet at\n my will they will join like the others.\u201d Making a rubbing motion with the\n thumb as before, he drops two of the three, one by one from the hand, when\n they will appear as a chain of three. These he hands for examination, taking\n back the set of two, and linking them one after the other into the key ring, to\n which now four rings are attached. Again taking back the set of three, he links\n these also one by one into the key ring, which thus has seven rings inserted in\n it. Using both hands, but always keeping the opening of the key ring under\n one or the other thumb, he now takes off these seven rings, commencing with\n the two single ones and offering them for examination; then taking off the set\n of two. Last of all, he unlinks the set of three, and then holding them at length in\n his left hand, joins the upper one to the key ring, thus making a chain of four,\n of which the key ring is the uppermost. He next takes the lowermost ring \u00a9f\n the four, and links that into the key ring, bringing the four rings into a diamond\n shape. Again unlinking the lower ring, he takes up the set of tw r o, and connects\n them with the key ring, holding them up above it, thus making a chain of six,\n the key ring being third from the top. Taking the upper ring between his\n teeth, he links the two singl. rings into the key ring on either side, making the\n figure of a cross. As the hands are now occupied in holding the single rings\n forming the arms of the cross, he can no longer keep the opening of the key\n ring concealed by the thumb, but it is extremely unlikely that among so many\n rings, so slight a mark in one of them wdll attract notice. Regaining possession\n of the key ring, he links one by one into it.

Some are made to fit one with-\n in the other, and are lifted out by the solid and not the loose ends, which fall\n down of their own accord. Those in most general use, however, are about six\n inches in height, by five in breadth and depth. The bottom is made to slide up-\n wards on the upright wires which form the sides. When it is desired to prepare\n the cage for use, a canary is first placed therein, and the bottom is then pushed\n up as far as it will go, the slides, which work on hinges being folded one by one\n upon the bottom, the cage finally assuming a flat shape. It is in this condition\n that the cages, generally three in number, are introduced into the hat, either from\n the servante or from inside the vest of the performer; and in the act of lifting out\n (which is done by the wire loop at top), the sides and bottom falling down, the\n cage becomes full size. Such articles can best be obtained of a regular manu-\n facturer of magical goods. A well-known dealer in magicians\u2019 supplies is Mr.\n C. Milton Chase, who, for many years has been established at 45 Cambridge\n street, Boston.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE MAGIC DRUM.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is in appearance an ordinary side-drum, but being hung up by cords from\n the ceiling, it will forthwith, without any visible drumsticks, give either a single\n rap or a roll, or keep time to any piece of music. It will further answer questions\n and tell fortunes, indicate chosen cards, etc., after the manner of the magic bell.\n</p>\n<p>\n These mysterious effects are produced by two hammers or drumsticks, fixed\n against one end of the drum on the inside. Each of these is attached to the\n keeper of an electro-magnet, but there is a difference in the mode of their work-\n ing. One works after the manner of the bell, giving a single tap whenever con-\n tact is made, but thenceforth remaining silent until the circuit is again broken\n and again completed. In other words, each pressure of the connecting stud pro-\n duces one rap, and no more. The second hammer is differently arranged. By\n means of what is called a \u201ccontact-breaker,\u201d the movement of the keeper, when\n attracted by the magnet, of itself breaks the circuit. The circuit being broken,\n the iron is no longer magnetic, and the keeper flies back to its old position, there-\n by once more completing the circuit. As long as the pressure on the stud con-\n tinues, therefore, the circuit is alternately made and broken in rapid succession,\n involving a corresponding movement of the keeper and hammer, and producing\n a \u201croll\u201d of the drum. The use of the two hammers involves the necessity of the\n two electoral circuits and two connecting studs, and of three cords to suspend\n the drum (one being common to both circuits). With a little practice in the\n management of the two studs, the single rapper may be made to beat time to a\n tune, while the other stud brings in the roll at appropriate intervals.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are some drums (of an inferior character) made with one hammer only;\n ^ich hammer being arrange/! for the r & lL Where it is desired to give a single\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0076/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 256, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 436}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0076/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 513, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 873}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0076/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1027, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1747}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0076/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2054, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3495}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0076/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0076.jp2", "height": 3495, "width": 2054, "levels": 6, "size": 742003}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"76\">\n<p>\n T6\n</p>\n<p>\n MISCELLANEOUS TRICKS.\n</p>\n<p>\n rap, this may be effected by pressing and instantly releasing the stud with a\n light, quick touch: but some little dexterity is required.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the case of all these appliances for magically answering questions, it is nec-\n essary that the assistant who has the control of the apparatus should be in such\n a position as to distinctly hear the questions asked. In fortune-telling matters\n the answer may generally be left to his own discretion; but for indicating what\n card is chosen, etc., it is necessary either that an agreed card be forced, or that\n a carefully arranged code of verbal signals should be employed, whereby the\n form of the question may itself indicate the proper answer. Considerable fun\n may be caused by the magician selecting an evidently \u201cengaged\u201d couple, and\n after asking how many months it will be before they are married, etc., inquiring,\n in a stage whisper, how many children they are destined to be blest with. The\n drum raps steadily up to (say) five, and this is accepted as the answer, when,\n after a moment\u2019s pause, two more raps are heard in quick succession. This\n alarming omen is received with general laughter, amid which the drum gives\n another rap, and then another, continuing until the performer, scandalized at its\n behavior, unhooks it from the cords, and carries it, still rapping, off the stage.\n The last effect is wholly independent of electricity, being produced by the per-\n former tapping with his fingers that one end of the drum which for the time be-\n ing is farthest from the audience.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are some few other tricks performed by the aid of electricity, but any\n one who understands the principle of those above described may make a very\n shrewd guess at the working of the remainder. All tricks of this class, though\n ingenious and effective, are open to one or two serious objections. In the first\n place, the apparatus is very costly, and secondly, they are unpleasantly liable\n from the nicety of their mechanism and the absolute necessity of perfect electri-\n cal connection in all their parts, to hang fire at the critical moment, and leave the\n operator in a very embarrassing position. Imagine the feelings of a performer\n who, having just introduced his wonderful drum, which is to display unheard-of\n oracular powers, finds that the instrument remains as mute as the celebrated\n harp of Tara\u2019s hall, and refuses to bear out in the smallest degree, his grandilo-\n quent assertions. Y et this unpleasant result may occur at any time from the sim-\n ple breaking of a wire, or some even slighter cause. This, it appears to us, is a seri-\n ous drawback to the electrical tricks, though where they are exhibited at their\n best illusions are more beautiful, or have more of genuine magic about them.\n</p>\n<p>\n We should mention, before quitting the subject of these tricks, that in order to\n avoid the trouble and expense of fixing the necessary conducting wires in a\n building not especially appropriated to magical performances, an upright brass\n rod (which may be detached at pleasure,) is sometimes fitted on each side of the\n performer ' s table, and the apparatus in use (drum, bell, cash-box, etc.) is sus-\n pended by appropriate cords between these rods. The conducting wires are con-\n nected within the table with the lower ends of the brass uprights, and thence pass\n down its hinder legs to the battery behind the scenes. There are many consider-\n ations of convenience in favor of this arrangement, but the tricks performed are\n less effective than where the apparatus is hung fairly from the ceiling, and ap-\n parently out of all possible reach of mechanical influence.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHINESE MARBLE TRICK.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some years ago, there came over to America a few Chinese conjurers, who\n were seen by the public but very little, but who favored me on several occasions\n with private views.

Of the four marbles (little ivory balls are what I invari-\n ably use), one is concealed in the fingers, as in the cup and ball trick, unknown,\n of course, to the audience, who are supposed to know of the existence of three\n only. These three the performer puts into his mouth \u2014 one at a time, slowly, is\n the beet way \u2014 to show that there is \u201cno deception.\u201d He now forms his left hand\n into a fist, and holds it steadily in front of him, thumb upwards, as though hold-\n ing a sword at rest. With the right hand he pretends to take a marble from the\n mouth, the concealed one being exhibited. The action of taking a marble from\n the mouth must be imitated exactly; and this is best done by rolling it along the\n lips until it travels from the roots of the fingers to their tips. The sleight must\n be quickly done, for the eyes of the audience are full upon the hand. Place the\n marble on the top of the left hand, i. e., on the doubled-up first finger, which,\n after a few seconds, open slightly, so as to allow the marble to disappear in the\n hand. With the right hand actually take a marble from the mouth, which will\n now contain two. Pretend to place this marble on the left hand, as you did the\n first one, but in reality conceal it. When the left hand is momentarily covered\n with the right, as it feigns to place a marble upon it, open the first finger, and,\n with the least possible jerk, bring the first marble again to the top. The audi-\n ence will think that marble No. 1 is in the hand and marble No. 2 atop. After\n another short pause, allow the marble to again sink in the hand, thereby causing\n the idea that two marbles are concealed in it, and, with the right hand, affect to\n take another marble from the mouth, the concealed one being, of course, shown.\n Ostensibly, place this one on the left hand (deception as before), and allow it to\n disappear like its two supposed predecessors. At this stage, the state of affairs\n will be thus:\u2014 The right hand, presumably empty, contains one marble; the left\n hand contains presumably three, but in reality only one marble; the mouth, pre-\n sumably empty, contains two marbles. The performer then proceeds as follows:\n Allow the marble in the left hand to sink until it is in the position for concealing\n at the roots of the fingers. If with the tips of the second or third fingers it can\n be pressed firmly home, so much the better, for the command to vanish can at\n once be given, and the hand opened\u2014 palm downw r ards, of course. If the marble\n cannot be secured in this way, the thumb must be brought into use in the usual\n way; but the hand must be waved about a little so as to cover the movement.\n The three marbles are now supposed to be non est. The performer can proceed\n to find the first of them in whatever manner he pleases. He may pretend to pick\n it from the table cloth, break it from the end of his wand, or find it in the pos-\n session of one of the audience; how, is quite immaterial. As each hand conceals\n a marble, it is also immaterial which one is used. This first marble is placed on\n the table, and another one found. This second one, instead of placing on the\n table, the performer affects to pass into his ear, concealing it as before, and after\n a few seconds, it appears at his lips, the one thence protruding being, of course,\n one of the two concealed in the mouth. Allow it to fall from the mouth, and\n then proceed to find the third marble, which pass, say, through the top of thej\n head. The remaining marble in the mouth is then exhibited, and the three wan-\n derers are recovered. If the marbles or ivory balls are not small, their presence\n In the mouth, when they are not supposed to be there, will be discovered. I al-\n ways conceal one on each side of the mouth, between the lower gums and the\n cheek. Ivory balls are in every way preferable, as they do not strike eold to the\n teeth, and do not, rattle much, both of which disagreeable properties are pos-\n sessed by marbles.

The knack of concealing the ball held tn ft wn\n observed requires some little address.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE AERIAL SUSPENSION.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is a famous trick known as the \u201caerial suspension,\u201d said to have been In-\n vented by the noted M. Robert Houdin. It consists of producing the effect of a\n person apparently lying horizontally in the air, from an upright pole, without\n any other means of support. The trick has been performed most artistically by\n Hermann. The secret consists of a harness like arrangement which fits tightly\n to the body of the person who is to be thus placed, which connects with appara-\n tus in the pole (which is of iron) ; connections being formed, by a mechanical ar-\n rangement the body is lifted from a standing to horizontal position. The\n machinery and appliances cost from forty dollars upwards and can be procured\n of manufacturers of such wares.\n</p>\n<p>\n FIRE-EATING.\n</p>\n<p>\n This was another trick performed remarkably well by my Chinese. It is, I\n should think, one of the best-known in England, for every country fair has\n itslflre-eater; but it is not everyone who knows how it is performed. In the first\n place prepare some thick, soft string, by either boiling or soaking it in a solu-\n tion of nitre (saltpetre). Take a piece, from one inch to two inches in length,\n and, after lighting it, wrap it in a piece of tow as large as an ordinary walnut.\n Conceal this piece under a heap of loose tow, the whole of which is put on a\n plate, and so exhibited to the audience. The string will burn very slowly in-\n deed, and the very little smoke issuing from it will be quite smothered by the\n tow. Show the mouth empty, and then put a little tow into it. Commence\n chewing this, and, after a little time, put in some more. Repeat this three or\n four times, taking the chewed portion secretly away each time you put any\n fresh tow into the mouth, and in one of the bunches include the piece containing\n the burning string. Do not chew this about at all, in reality, although you will\n make great gestures as if so doing. Take a fan, and fan the ears, and presently\n take in a good breath at the nostrils, blowing it out at the mouth. This will\n cause some smoke to be ejected, the volume of which will increase as the breath-\n ings are kept up. Always be careful to draw in at the nostrils, and eject at the\n mouth; otherwise you will be choked. Renew the fannings (merely for effect),\n and, by continued breathings, the tow in the mdrth will be brought into a glow\n and one or two sparks will issue from the mouth. When this has continued\n sufficiently long, take in more tow, and so smother the burning string again, ex-\n tracting the piece containing it undercover of a loose bunch. There need be no\n fear of burning the mouth, as, directly it is closed, the light becomes a mere\n spark. The trick causes great effect, not to say alarm on many occasions.\n</p>\n<p>\n A very pretty and laughable termination to the above trick is to pass, unper-\n ceived, into the mouth (under cover of a piece of tow, as usual) a little ball com-\n posed of a long band of colored paper, about half an inch or so wide. Take this\n by the end, and draw it out through the teeth. Tightly rolled up, a ball may\n contain several yards of paper. It should be composed of three or four different\n colors, in lengths, each pasted to the other, for there must be no break. The\n end should have a piece of cotton attached to it, or it will be next to impossible\n to find it in the mouth. The cotton will adhere to some portion of the mouth,\n and so be easily found. These balls of paper are supplied at all conjuring shops, '\n as is also an article known as the barber\u2019s pole. This consists of a spiral of\n paper, which shirts up into a very small compass, but assumes a great length on\n being merely twisted. A long pole appears to come out of the performer*\n mouth.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE BUTTERFLY TRICK.\n</p>\n<p>\n Invisible at a short distance, verj fine silk and hair are invaluable adjuncts to\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0079/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 258, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 438}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0079/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 516, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 876}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0079/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1032, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1752}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0079/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2065, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3505}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0079/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0079.jp2", "height": 3505, "width": 2065, "levels": 6, "size": 663763}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"79\">\n<p>\n MISCELLANEOUS TRICKS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 79\n</p>\n<p>\n the conjurer\u2019s repertory, both in the drawing-room and on the stage. The cele-\n brated and fascinating Japanese butterfly trick is performed with the aid of a\n piece of fine black silk or horsehair. The former is, in my opinion, immeasur-\n ably the superior of the two. Hair is most difficult to manipulate, from its springy\n nature, and requires a great deal of coaxing before it will condescend to be tied\n in a knot. In the butterfly trick, the performer sustains one or more butterflies,\n made from rice (or tissue) paper, in the air, by means of the current caused by\n the motions of a fan. When this trick was first brought out, \u201call the world\n wondered,\u201d for no one, even after long practice, could keep the paper butterfly\n hovering in a given space for a single moment. I tremble to think of the num-1\n ber of fans I destroyed in my early days over this trick, before I knew the secret\u2019\n of it. The fan used should be a very strong and large one, of the old shape \u2014 not:\n the circular\u2014 and be composed of paper and wood only, so as to be free from\u00ab\n superfluous weight. Affixed to the top waistcoat button, or any other conve-f\n nient spot, have from three feet to four feet of the finest black silk floss or hair,\n with a knot at the free end. Have, also, a piece of crisp tissue (or rice) paper, \\\n and a pair of scissors. Let the audience examine the paper, and then proceed\n to cut out the rough form of a butterfly, explaining your action as you go on,\n giving the center a twist or two, for the double purpose of forming a body to\n the insect, and concealing the knotted end of the silk or hair, which it is as well\n to have between the fingers before commencing operations, as it is not allow-\n able to grope about for it in view of the audience. When finished, the butterfly ' s\n wings should have the appearance of being three parts extended, and should be\n slightly concave from beneath. A little care bestowed on its formation will be\n repaid by an increased steadiness when in the air. When all is ready, hold the\n butterfly in the air at the full stretch of the connecting medium, and fan pretty\n briskly with the other hand, not immediately underneath the paper, but from\n the body, and along the silk or hair, which must always be kept at a stretch, or\n nearly so, or control over the butterfly will be lost.\n</p>\n<p>\n Notwithstanding the aid of a connecting medium, there is more skill required\n to perform this trick really neatly than is generally supposed. After a time,\n practice will enable the performer to cause the butterfly to settle on a flower or\n on the edge of another fan, and also to sustain two in the air at one time, which\n has a very pretty effect indeed. When two butterflies are used, it will be found\n almost necessary to have two fans, one in each hand, and each insect must, of\n course, have a separate thread. Some use wax at the end of the connecting\n medium, but this is a bad plan, as it deters the performer from giving round the\n butterfly to be examined after performing the trick. Whilst cutting out and\n twisting up the paper, it is as well to call attention to the fact that the trick is\n performed by some people with the aid of a thread \u2014 an assistance which you\n will say you utterly despise, as will be perceived. This will totally disarm thosa\n people who may have bought the trick (it is sold universally), and are yet only\n tyros at performing it.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is a second method, in which two butterflies are joined by a thread or\n hair a few inches long. These do not require to be attached to the performer\u2019s\n person, the partnership being sufficient to enable him to keep them in mid-air.\n</p>\n<p>\n Speaking of the Chinese, it is a most noticeable thing that their methods of\n vanishing and concealing articles are the same as those practised by ourselves,\n which fully demonstrates the fact that there is only one proper way; for there is\n only one thing more highly improbable than that we learnt the minutiae of the\n art of conjuring, practised by us for centuries, from the Chinese, and that is that\n the Chinese learnt from us. It is only during the present century that we have\n been sufficiently familiar with the Chinese to borrow their ideas on magic, did\n i re wish to do so.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0080/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 256, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 436}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0080/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 513, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 873}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0080/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1027, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1747}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0080/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2054, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3495}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0080/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0080.jp2", "height": 3495, "width": 2054, "levels": 6, "size": 724171}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"80\">\n<p>\n HAT TRICKS\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER XV.\n</p>\n<p>\n TRICKS WITH HATS.\n</p>\n<p>\n ON SKILL.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of the most taking of all the tricks performed by the many public exhibi-\n tors is that in which a hat is borrowed from the audience, and at once from ite in-\n terior are produced a quantity of heterogeneous articles, the nature and number\n of which cause, not only the greatest merriment, but also the most unbounded\n ' astonishment that they should ever have found lodgment in so unsuitable a re-\n .ceptacle as an ordinary \u2018 ' chimney-pot\u201d hat. The reader will hardly require to be\n told that every article which is produced from the hat has first to be introduced\n into it by the performer, and on the skill with which this is done will the success\n of the trick depend. It must be understood that there is no middle degree of\n perfection allowed in performing this trick. No one must be able to say, \u201cYes;\n he got them in pretty well that time \u2014 I hardly noticed him.\u201d The motion which\n accompanies the introduction of any article or articles into a hat must be abso-\n lutely unobserved by any one of the audience. No extraordinary degree of\n speed is required, for success will depend more upon the completeness of the ar-\n rangements made by the performer for the accomplishment of his designs than\n upon mere rapidity of movement, which, as I have often explained, is by itself\n of no use whatever, it being impossible for the human hand to make any move-\n ment openly so rapidly that it cannot be followed by the human eye. The ob-\n ject of the performer being to introduce certain articles into a hat without de-\n tection, anything falling below this accomplishment is imperfect; but, at the\n same time, anything which goes beyond this in a striving to obtain an ideal per-\n fection is useless, and results in a mere waste of energy.\n</p>\n<p>\n The essence of the trick being that it is (apparently, at least) performed for\n the most part whilst surrounded by the audience, the articles to be produced\n must be chiefly such as can be concealed about the performer\u2019s person. Of such\n a nature, the reader will doubtless be astonished to find, are, when properly con-\n structed, birdcages containing live birds, quantities of ladies\u2019 reticules, lighted\n Chinese lanterns, and many other articles entirely at variance with any possibly\n preconceived notions of what might ordinarily be contained in a hat. The be-\n ginner, however, will have to commence with less startling productions than\n birdcages, & c., and graduate in the art, as it were.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE CANNON-BALL.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of the commonest articles which it is still the fashion to^iroduce from a\n hat is a cannon-ball, or, rather, the wooden semblance of one. This is in-\n troduced from the shelf, which is provided with little hollows for the reception\n of such unstable articles. It has a deep hole, just large enough to admit the mid-\n dle finger, and is so disposed that a hand placing a hat momentarily, brim down-\n wards, on the back edge of the table would be able to introduce the finger with-\n out difficulty. The finger firmly inserted, the hat is drawn off, and, naturally\n falling backwards, covers the ball, which is furthermore curled into the hat by\n means of the finger. If the ball were solid and made of any heavier material\n than wood, this would not be possible of accomplishment. The usual method is\n to have two cannon-balls, one a hollow one of zinc, blackened, with a hole about\n two inches across made in it. This hole is covered by means of a sliding lid,\n which lid has a smaller hole in it for the introduction of the middle finger. The\n Dali is filled with articles, almost invariably purchases made at a baby linen\n warehouse, which are produced, with all possible effect, one by one, before the\n Vail itself. Sometimes the ball is packed as tightly as possible with feathers, in\n which ca*e a veay larg\u00bb Woduced, a small pinch from the bal\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0081/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 258, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 438}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0081/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 516, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 876}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0081/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1032, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1752}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0081/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2065, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3505}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0081/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0081.jp2", "height": 3505, "width": 2065, "levels": 6, "size": 706580}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"81\">\n<p>\n ft AT TRTCKS .\n</p>\n<p>\n to\n</p>\n<p>\n aiitficing to apparently fill the hat, which should be exhibited, ostensibly full, to\n the audience every now and then. If feathers are used, a large cloth should be\n spread upon the floor, or there will be a sad litter.\n</p>\n<p>\n The introduction of the cannon-ball must not, however, form the commence-\n ment of the trick, but follow on something else in which a hat has been required.\n It would never do to borrow a hat and straightway march with it to the table,\n there to execute divers entirely unnecessary movements. Under such circum-\n stances, the audience would be surprised if something were not produced from\n \u25a0the hat. There are many tricks mentioned in which a hat is used. Whilst the\n result of one of such tricks is being exhibited with one hand, the other can easily\n introduce the cannon-ball, without fear of detection, if the performer\u2019s manner\n leads the attention elsewhere. The ball safely in the hat, the performer steps\n briskly forward to return the borrowed article, and, just as he is about to put it\n into the owner\u2019s hand, he makes a slight start, saying, \u201cI did not notice it before,\n sir, but there is a little something just at the bottom of your hat. What is it?\n Something belonging to your little girl, I presume\u2014 a pair of socks,\u201d & c. The\n articles are then deposited on a chair or side table, and a motion made of return-\n ing the hat when, \u201ca little something else\u201d is noticed. The ball being by this\n time worked round in the hat so that the opening is concealed from view, the\n hat can be exhibited with the ball sticking inside. After remarking that it is a\n very extraordinary thing to carry in a hat, and surmising therefrom that the in-\n fant to whom the clothes just discovered belong must be a \u201cWoolwich infant,\u201d\n great, but unvailing, efforts are made to extract the ball. In order to make it\n appear to stick in the hat (which sticking makes its presence there at all seem\n all the more inexplicable), invert the hat, and introduce a forefinger from each\n hand beneath the ball. The whole can be then well jerked two or three times.\n It is at length got out by the assistance of your attendant, who is directed to\n give it to the gentleman to put in his waistcoat pocket. For the sake of effect\n he staggers towards the audience, but the performer recalls him, saying that he\n will send on the articles by parcel delivery. Whilst this is being done, the\n wooden ball is got inside the hat, which is once more carried down towards the\n owner. The discovery of more contents is made, as before, and the performer\n remarks that had he known that the owner of the hat carried a complete arsenal\n about with him he would have borrowed someone else\u2019s hat. The hat is jerked\n as before, and at the third or fourth attempt the ball is allowed to drop on the\n stage. This will confirm the idea in the audience that the first ball was solid,\n should there, by chance, be any wavering on the point.\n</p>\n<p>\n The only objection to this really very effective phase of the trick is, that it has\n been done so often; the consequence is that so many, anticipating correctly\n that which is about to come, are better able to divine the means by which\n it is accomplished. The best way to guard against this is to introduce the\n features at unusual moments, taking advantage of any favorable circumstancB\n ar opportunity that may casually transpire.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE DISTRIBUTION.\n</p>\n<p>\n ' The gratuitous distribution of bonbons, flowers, & c., from a bat is, owing to\n fbe expense entailed, hardly such a favorite variation of this trick with profes-\n sionals as with amateurs\u2014 that is, with those very few amateurs who are able to\n execute it with any degree of success. It requires an unusual amount of san\u00a7\n froid and boldness, combined with a perfect dexterity.

Three or four little parcels should be made up and\n stowed away inside the vest and in the breast pockets of the coat, where they\n can be reached without difficulty. The performer then advances, with an orange\n or similar article concealed in the hand, and borrows a hat. The hat is quickly\n taken in the hand containing the orange, and shaken, with the remark, \u201cWhy,\n you have left something inside, sir.\u201d The shaking to prevent the article falling\n on the crown of the hat with a thud, which would too plainly reveal the moment\n of its introduction into the hat, which is then inverted, thereby causing whatever\n may be inside to fall out upon the floor. All eyes, including more particularly\n your own, will be turned towards it, and you seize the opportunity to introduce one\n of your packages into the hat. The action of stooping to see what it is that has\n fallen will naturally cause the hat in the hand to come against the breast.\n The other hand is then introduced beneath it, and the bundle slipped noiselessly\n in. The instant this is done, obtain possession of the orange, and be as funny as\n you can about it with the owner of the hat. You then discover other things in\n the hat, and just before one bundle is exhausted introduce another. The most\n extraordinary expedients will at times have to be resorted to for accomplishing\n this, vary according to the position in which the performer is placed. One\n movement that should always be tried is a rapid three-quarter turn on the heel,\n during which a bag is whipped in. Another ruse is to allow the wand or some\n of the contents of the hat to fall, and so obtain a momentary diversion whilst\n stooping for them. Any approach to hesitation will be fatal. When a fresh\n supply has been obtained, turn the hat upside down, supporting the contents\n with the fingers, and, shake it, thus appearing to show it empty. A splendid\n ruse to adopt at such a moment, in order to intimate that the hat is still empty,\n is to apparently read out the name of the maker (which you have previously\n noted), and say that you will go to him in future for your hats. Should there be\n no name, say you are sorry, as you wanted to know where such curious hats are\n to be bought.\n</p>\n<p>\n The introduction of flowers from the performer\u2019s person is not advisable, it be-\n ing impossible to keep them from being crushed. They are best introduced from\n the shelf, and for this purpose the following little arrangement will be found\n useful: Procure a tin or zinc cylinder, about two inches in diameter, and two\n inches long. Around the outside of this have affixed a number of small\n cylinders, each capable of admitting the stalk of a flower. Such an article will\n hold some thirty flowers at least, or even tiny \u2018 \u2019button holes\u201d can be employed.\n Round the cylinder pass some wire, a portion of which form into a loop. The\n whole arrangement can then be suspended at the back edge of the table, or be-\n hind a suitable chair. By having some packs of cards introduced into the hat\n in the first instance, an excuse for going to the table or chair is obtained. Packs\n of cards make a great show when the hat is tossed vigorously about, so that\n some of the contents fly in the air and out on the floor. The last few can be\n taken out by the hand and thrown in the air in such a manner as to flutter as\n much as possible between the audience and the hat, which is, at the same time,\n brought into the position favorable for gett\u00bbg the flowers into it. The wire loop\n is easily found by the fingers, and, on the hat being brought backwards, when\n the table is used (forwards, with the chair), the bouquet is easily introduced, '\n The cylinder arrangement is often made much larger than two inches each way,\n but no very increased effect is thereby obtained\u2014 certainly not sufficient to com-\n pensate for the augmented difficulty in getting rid of the article after it is done\n with. When made of the size I have given, it is simply concealed in the hand, a &\n are the bags or pieces of silk in which the cards, & c., have been wrapped.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE SHOWER OF CUPS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Amongst other things, a favorite production from hats is ah enormous quantity\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0083/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 258, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 438}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0083/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 516, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 876}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0083/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1032, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1752}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0083/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2065, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3505}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:sw:iz:ar:ds:ma:00:sk:in:wehmanswizardsma00skin:wehmanswizardsma00skin_0083/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/sw/iz/ar/ds/ma/00/sk/in/wehmanswizardsma00skin/wehmanswizardsma00skin_0083.jp2", "height": 3505, "width": 2065, "levels": 6, "size": 690901}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"83\">\n<p>\n J ftA?TKfCK8.\n</p>\n<p>\n et tin cups, very similar to those used in the cup and waft trick described ia\n \u2018\u2018Drawing-room Magic,\u201d but much larger.

They should be wrapped in silk, and the inside cup\n filled tightly with ribbons or cut paper, or anything else that will make a great\n show when distributed.

They consist of an ordinary cloth ball covering, with an\n extraordinary interior, consisting, as it does, of a tapering spiral spring. Al-\n though I have succeeded in producing springs of the required shape by twisting\n wire round a peg top; I cannot conscientiously recommend anyone else to adopt\n a similar method of proceeding. A professed wire- worker would do the thing\n much more satisfactorily in every way. The covering is a very easy matter,\n and any one of the weaker sex may be confidently entrusted with it. Six of\n these balls, when pressed tightly together and tied with cotton, take up only a\n very little more than the space that would be occupied by a single ordinary ball.\n Eighteen, or more, in batches of six, can be introduced at one time if tied up in\n silk. The cotton of one batch being broken, the hat will be entirely filled, and\n the process can be repeated, the hat being each time shown to the audience in a\n replete condition. A tray should be at hand on which to place the balls, great\n care being necessary to prevent any of them falling to the floor, which would at\n once reveal their unreal nature. When the balls are used, as is not unusual, in\n conjunction with the cups\u2014 that is to say, either immediately preceding or fol-\n lowing them\u2014 it is advisable to have an ordinary stuffed cloth ball, exactly re >\n sembling the multipliers, inside the inner cup. This ball is allowed to fall an4,\n roll towards the audience (accidentally, of course!), -who will require no admoni-\n tion to examine it. The balls can also be made to multiply in the hands. For\n this purpose, take one bundle and spin it high in the air (be sure to spin it well),\n and, catching it as it descends, give it a sharp twist, to break the cotton. As the\n balls will all suddenly expand, the hands must be held very hollow and kept close\n to the breast, against which they should be sustained. Another method is to\n break the cotton, but prevent their bursting out, and, holding up the hand con-\n taining them, with the back towards the audience, roll the balls into view,\n one by one, by means of the other hand. These effects are both good, butenust\n ^ be done with dash.\n</p>\n<p>\n Both the cups and balls are best got into the hat from the shelf. The safest\n way to get them is, in the first instance, to introduce the cards into the hat.\n which, after shaking about, empty on the table with a bang. A favorable op-\n portunity for introducing anything is thus made. Some conjurers have an arm\n protruding at the back of the table, on which bundles of cups, balls, < \u00a3c., are sue\n pended, and got into the hat by means of a sweep of that article.

As, subsequent to the extraction of\n the balls, the performer has not even retreated to the stage, the company cannot\n but be at an utter loss to account for the presence of so ponderous a body.\n The bundle of wood is, however, far from being what it seems. That portion of it, j\n the exterior, which is visible to the company, is genuine enough, being firewood, 1\n but this is only an outer layer glued upon a cylindrical shape of thick pasteboard, '\n bound round, so as to look real, with a piece of string taken from a genuine\n bundle of wood. The bundle has only one end, made, of course, of pasteboard\n also, and covered with half -inch lengths of wood, which will present a perfectly\n real appearance. Into the open end are crammed the cups, balls, or other\n articles, which, being produced, enable the performer to subsequently extract\n the supposed bundle of wood without having refilled the hat. Some bundles are\n made with both ends covered, one end having a trap opening in it. This is to\n prevent the possibility of the unreal nature of the article becoming known; but\n I really do not see why both ends should ever be exposed; and, with the end per-\n fectly open, the extraction of articles is very much facilitated. The bundle\n must, of course, be introduced into the hat from the shelf, it being too decidedly\n bulky to carry about the person.\n</p>\n<p>\n RETICULES.\n</p>\n<p>\n A quantity of these articles are sometimes produced from a hat. They are, as\n may be imagined, far from being the substantial objects they represent. The\n ends fall inwards and lie flat on the bottom, to which they are hinged by means\n of calico, and the tops, sides, and bottom are hinged together also by means of\n calico, and -so double up. A piece of cord, tape, or thin leather strap runs\n through two holes, about an inch apart, in the top, the ends being affixed to the\n ends of the reticule, inside. A pull at the center of this cord, & c., raises the ends,\n which force the other portions into position. The outside is covered with cloth,\n ind otherwise decorated to represent a small reticule. I have seen them made\n i)f playing cards without any outer covering whatever. The result was, that the\n ' tudience saw through the whole thing at once, as was but natural. A dozen or\n more of these reticules can be introduced at once, and they make a good show.\n They can be easily made from playing cards, and afterwards covered.\n</p>\n<p>\n DOLLS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Calico dolls, with spiral springs inside, can also be effectively employed. A\n tolerably large one, introduced into the cannon-ball with the baby\u2019s clothes, is\n 6ff active when produced last of all. In any case they should not be less than six\n Inches in height.

It may sound like exaggeration to assert that two\n substantial cages, six inches high, each containing two live canaries or other\n birds, can be produced from a hat from one \u201cload,\u201d but such can be done, never-\n theless. The cages are of wire at the top and on the sides, the bottom being\n solid and heavy. The sides are hinged to the top, under which they fold, when\n the bottom, which slides up and down the sides, is pushed up. The top being\n domed, the birds are safe therein, not as comfortable, perhaps, as they might be,\n but still unhurt. The bottom pushed up and the sides doubled under, the whole\n is scarcely two inches in depth; and two cages, placed bottom to bottom, and\n kept together by means of an elastic band or by a thread, can be got into the\n hat from the coat breast-pocket in the prescribed manner. To produce them, it,\n is only necessary to raise the upper portion, by means of the ring there affixed, 1\n and the bottom will run down into its place, causing the sides to go into their\n positions. These cages are also produced from handkerchiefs, in which case it\n is usual to have them of very large dimensions. Herrmann produced one at\n times which had to be concealed up his back, so large was it. This was pro-\n duced, without detection, in the very centre of the audience.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHINESE-LANTERNS.\n</p>\n<p>\n The production of six or more of these articles, all ablaze, from a borrowed\n hat, causes an effect not far from astonishing. The well-known collapsible\n nature of the articles would render the production of a number of them from a\n hat a matter of no great marvel were they unprovided with a light. What can-\n not be readily explained is the feature of so many lanterns being alight in the\n hat at one time without burning either the hat or one another, or indeed, how\n the} 7 can all be alight at one time at all. The secret lies in the constructon of the\n bottoms of these lanterns, and the positions of the candle or wick holders. The\n bottoms are made of tin, and on one only of each series of lanterns is the candle\n holder placed in the center. This lantern I will call No. 1. No. 2 has the holder\n a little on one side, and a hole through its center to admit of the candle or wick\n of No. 1 passing through it. No. 3 has two holes, corresponding exactly with the\n candle holders of Nos. 1 and 2, which pass through its bottom, and its holder is\n at the side of the hole through which the holder of No. 2 passes. No. 4 has three\n holes. No. 5 four holes, and so on all through the series, which generally consists\n of seven or eight, that number being about as many as can well be managed\n at one time. As the holder of No. 1 has to pass through the bottoms of the re-\n maining seven lanterns, it must, of course, be very long. The holder of No. 2\n will be a little shorter, and the next shorter still, that of No. 8 being of the or-\n dinary length. By this means all the wicks will be on the same level when the\n lanterns are packed together. The tin bottoms do away with any danger of a\n flare up, and also, from their weight, cause the lamps to open easily, which is of\n great assistance towards the success of the trick. The upper rims are also of\n tin, for strength and security. A few sulphur matches, which strike noiselessly,\n should be affixed to the upper rims of the topmost lantern, whereon should also\n be some sandpaper, on which to strike the matches. The whole should be tied\n together with string, and concealed in the breast pocket, from whence they can\n be introduced into a hat in the midst of the audience.
