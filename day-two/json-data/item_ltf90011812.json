J. Gurney, and being desirous of satisfying my\n own mind on the subject,-1 procured all his authorized works,\n from which extracts in the Appeal are made\u2014being particular to\n obtain the same edition, where such was mentioned\u2014and carefully\n examined the context. The result has been, an entire conviction,\n on my part, that by passing by paragraphs wherein J. J. Gurney\n expressed himself fully and clearly on the doctrine in question in\n the Appeal, and selecting those in which the subject has not been\n the one under criticism, and where his views in that direction\n are less fully given ; and by quoting parts of paragraphs which did\n not always convey the whole meaning of the author, and italici\u00ac\n sing certain words and phrases, which were not originally in\u00ac\n tended to assume such importance; and then comparing the whole,\n with extracts from the writings of early Friends, and the sermons\n of George Fox, together with comments of their own; the writers\n of the Appeal appear to endeavor to fasten upon J. J.
