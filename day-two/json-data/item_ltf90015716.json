No matter what your country\u2019s\n cause of quarrel. It is enough for the patriot to know she is in\n war. Be her cause right or wrong, it is your duty to espouse\n it, and if she calls upon you to command her armies, to lead\n them to victory or to death. If she calls upon you to shoulder\n the musket, and in the ranks to march to the cannon\u2019s mouth,\n there, with your life\u2019s blood, to seal your devotion to your coun-\n try, the past history of our people, proves that you would be\n ready for the sacrifice. The noble daring and self-sacrificing\n patriotism of our people, who rush, as volunteers, to their\n country\u2019s standard, and support it amidst the din ofhattle^ excite\n the wonder and admiration of the world. The chivalrous love\n of country, which incites the American soldier to deeds of\n heroic valor, is illustrated in every battle field in the Kepublic.\n It is the noblest characteristic of our people, and it should be\n inscribed on a monument greater than those of Egypt, to last\n while time rolls on, in honor and glory of the American soldier.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pu:rp:os:eo:fl:if:ei:ts:00:pi:ll:purposeoflifeits00pill:purposeoflifeits00pill_0021/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 156, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 264}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pu:rp:os:eo:fl:if:ei:ts:00:pi:ll:purposeoflifeits00pill:purposeoflifeits00pill_0021/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 312, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 529}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pu:rp:os:eo:fl:if:ei:ts:00:pi:ll:purposeoflifeits00pill:purposeoflifeits00pill_0021/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 625, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1058}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pu:rp:os:eo:fl:if:ei:ts:00:pi:ll:purposeoflifeits00pill:purposeoflifeits00pill_0021/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1251, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2116}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pu:rp:os:eo:fl:if:ei:ts:00:pi:ll:purposeoflifeits00pill:purposeoflifeits00pill_0021/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2503, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4232}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pu:rp:os:eo:fl:if:ei:ts:00:pi:ll:purposeoflifeits00pill:purposeoflifeits00pill_0021/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/pu/rp/os/eo/fl/if/ei/ts/00/pi/ll/purposeoflifeits00pill/purposeoflifeits00pill_0021.jp2", "height": 4232, "width": 2503, "levels": 6, "size": 600565}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"21\">\n<p>\n Al > DRB:feS.\n</p>\n<p>\n If our people are but true to themselves and the great mis-\n sion of their country \u2014 if they but preserve the Union of the\n States, m ike spirit in which it was formed \u2014 in less than the life-\n time of your University \u2014 whose semi-centennial anniversary\n you now celebrate \u2014 our government will be the great power of\n the earth, overshadowing all others with its colossal strength\n and giant proportions, and by the influence which our free in-\n stitutions are destined to exercise, revolutionizing the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n I utter this not as a prediction, but I announce it as the ne-\n cessary effect of our system of free government, and more per-\n ! feet humanity.
