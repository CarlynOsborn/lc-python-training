And as Al-\n exandria, the old capital of the Ptolemies, and a radiant\n point for philosophy, literature and the arts, was then the\n second city of the Roman Empire, the Bishop of Alexan-\n dria became the second Patriarch of ancient Christendom.\n A Patriarch was also wanted for Asia, as well as for\n Africa and the West, and he was fixed at Antioch, on\n the Orontes, the old capital of the Syrian monarchs, once\n so eminent and towering in Oriental history. The Rom-\n anists will have it, that Antioch was primarily the see\n of Peter, and thus the first of Christian Patriarchates.\n If it were, it seems profoundly singular, that \u201c the shad-\n ow of Peter passing by \u201d should not have consecrated it\n to a higher destiny. It soon became the lowest of the\n Patriarchates; while the exaltation of a Patriarchate,\n altogether new, and having no ecclesiastical recom-\n mendation, put it a grade lower in the grand list final.\n There could not be a clearer demonstration, that these\n Patriarchates (all of them \u2014 Rome\u2019s as well as all the\n rest), grew out of reasons of expediency, and not out of\n provisions in the New Testament, or the logic of dog-\n matic theology.\n</p>\n<p>\n With the three Patriarchates, of Rome, Alexandria,\n and Antioch, the subject of Patriarchates had a long and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ct:ur:eo:ne:cu:me:ni:00:co:it:lectureonecumeni00coit:lectureonecumeni00coit_0019/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 220, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 353}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ct:ur:eo:ne:cu:me:ni:00:co:it:lectureonecumeni00coit:lectureonecumeni00coit_0019/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 441, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 707}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ct:ur:eo:ne:cu:me:ni:00:co:it:lectureonecumeni00coit:lectureonecumeni00coit_0019/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 882, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1414}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ct:ur:eo:ne:cu:me:ni:00:co:it:lectureonecumeni00coit:lectureonecumeni00coit_0019/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1765, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2829}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ct:ur:eo:ne:cu:me:ni:00:co:it:lectureonecumeni00coit:lectureonecumeni00coit_0019/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/le/ct/ur/eo/ne/cu/me/ni/00/co/it/lectureonecumeni00coit/lectureonecumeni00coit_0019.jp2", "height": 2829, "width": 1765, "levels": 6, "size": 322811}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"19\">\n<p>\n 17\n</p>\n<p>\n uninterrupted rest.
