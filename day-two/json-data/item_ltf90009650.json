Perhaps you have read about her in the\n \u201cMissionary Herald,\u201d the \u201cJournal of Missions,\u201d the \u201cYouth\u2019s Day\u00ac\n spring,\u201d the \u201c Friend,\u201d or in a book written by Mrs. Warren. Well,\n the little craft has been sold. She was almost worn out; and it was\n thought better to build a new vessel than to repair the old one.\n</p>\n<p>\n As I was the first missionary that went to sea in her, and have\n known her ever since, the Secretaries of the American Board a few\n weeks ago requested me to write a short story about her, in order that\n you may see how much good she has done, and so be all the more glad\n to aid in building another Morning Star to take her place.\n</p>\n<p>\n From the shortness of the time allowed me, to say nothing of my\n imperfect health, I should have been unequal to the task, had I not\n received much assistance from others. A great deal of this I have\n had from one who has known the Morning Star as long as 1 have,\n and has been my companion in nearly all my voyagings in her; and I\n take pleasure also in saying that kind friends at the Missionary House\n have, by their valued suggestions and criticisms, and in other ways,\n added not a little to the interest which this \u201c Story of the Morning\n Star \u201d may be thought to possess. Such as it is I offer it to you.\n And my prayer is that it may lead you to pity the heathen more\n deeply than ever. May I not hope that you will think more of that\n love, so great, so free, which has made it possible for them, as well as\n for you and me, to see the Lord Jesus in his Heavenly kingdom!\n</p>\n<p>\n H.

You would also find trees\n that yield figs, limes, oranges, bread-fruit, bananas, and\n guavas.

They went first to the Sandwich\n Islands.

It\n seemed best, therefore, to buy a small schooner, which\n might take them there, and carry supplies to them after\u00ac\n wards.

He has been for many years, and is now, a\n missionary to the Marquesas Islands. Just before he\n sailed in the Caroline , he made a public address, which\n will give you some idea of the man. \u201c I am a native\n of these islands,\u201d he said. \u201c My parents were idolaters,\n and I was born in times of darkness. A short time ago\n all our people were heathen ; they worshipped a great\n variety of gods; they were engaged in war; they\n were addicted to stealing and robbery. Man and wife\n did not live together and eat together, as now; they\n took no care of their children. . . . But a great light\n has arisen over us. . . . The Bible has driven away our\n darkness, overturned our heathenish customs, and caused\n a great improvement in our condition. Because the Word\n of God has been given us in our own language, we have\n learned to read ; and all the people have learned to read\n it, old and young. It has been scattered all over the land,\n and taught all the people to do right. Therefore the\n people live peaceably; parents take some care of their\n children; the Sabbath is observed; the laws are regarded,\n and all dwell securely. . . .

Hawaiian\n missionaries might easily be found who could live on\n these coral rims; and we have seen that there were\n American missionaries who would be glad to labor there.\n What should be done ?

(See the cover.) With deep interest we watched\n the forms of loved ones, as they stood on the wharves,\n sending after us their best wishes. When should we see\n their faces again ? Though it was a tender hour, it was\n a happy one. We thought it a great privilege to be per\u00ac\n mitted to go to the heathen in such a vessel. Oh, how\n many prayers were offered by Jesus\u2019 little lambs for her\n preservation!\n</p>\n<p>\n We sailed beautifully out of Boston harbor ; but, not\n long after, a dreadful storm came upon us. The Morn\u00ac\n ing Star was forced to anchor under the lee of Cape\n Cod, off Provincetown; and so were two other vessels,\n one on each side of her.

You will learn from the scene,\n however, how the Gilbert Islanders dishonor God\u2019s holy\n day. How much they need the Gospel!\n</p>\n<p>\n But let me proceed with my explanation. The woman\n whom you see is a heathen, carrying her husband\u2019s skull\n as she goes on a visit to some other village. A party of\n the natives are pressing scraped cocoa-nuts in an oil-press,\n to get the oil to buy tobacco with. The dog is one of\n the many, as heathenish as their masters, which greatly\n annoy us.\n</p>\n<p>\n Three men are climbing cocoa-nut trees in as many\n different ways. The one at the right has notches cut in\n his tree, large enough to hold the second joint of the\n great toe. He is going after his toddy, which he will\n give his child instead of milk, as they have no cows or\n goats. The man in the middle walks up the tree in a\n wonderful way. If one of his hands should slip, he would\n fall, and perhaps break his neck. The man at the left\n has his feet tied together, a few inches apart; and while\n he holds himself away from the tree by pushing off with\n one arm, and clasping the other round the trunk, he\n draws up his feet, which easily cling to the tree by the\n help of the cord which binds them together ; and then he\n straightens himself up again. The second way of climb\u00ac\n ing is the most difficult. On the right you will see a\n pandanus-tree. How strange its roots, which grow out of\n the trunk, and run off into the ground ! How large the\n great bunches of fruit ! They sometimes weigh forty or\n fifty pounds. When they are ripe, you can pull them to\n pieces, each piece being a separate conical seed some\n three inches long, the small end of which is fibrous, and\n contains a sweet juice, is chewed, and the juice is sucked\n out. See the great papai leaves, back of the chapel,\n coming up out of a pit! You would call them giant\n calla leaves.

One of\n these was a nice surf-boat, which we called the Star of\n Peace. It was mainly purchased with money given to us\n by Captain Moore and his crew, when they took leave of\n us in December, 1857.\n</p>\n<p>\n We had visited every part of Apaiang in the little Al\u00ac\n fred; and we had even crossed in her to Tarawa, the\n largest island of the group, being towed by one of the\n great war-proas, which was bearing presents from our king\n to a high chief, whose two sons had been recently be\u00ac\n trothed to two of his daughters.\n</p>\n<p>\n But there were other islands which could not be reached\n in our small boat, and on which the Gospel had never been\n preached. To these we longed to go. One of them\n could be seen from the top of the cocoa-nut trees near our\n house ; but the ocean channel was more than twenty miles\n wide, and the current often so swift as to make it very\n unsafe to venture across in the Alfred.\n</p>\n<p>\n We were very glad, therefore, when the new surf-boat\n arrived in the Morning Star , and still more glad were we,\n when Captain Gelett said, after he had helped me rig it,\n that he thought I might safely cross to Marakei and\n Maiana ; for he thought that I was a pretty good sailor.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:or:yo:fm:or:ni:ng:st:00:bi:ng:_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1_0058/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 233, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 418}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:or:yo:fm:or:ni:ng:st:00:bi:ng:_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1_0058/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 467, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 836}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:or:yo:fm:or:ni:ng:st:00:bi:ng:_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1_0058/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 934, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1673}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:or:yo:fm:or:ni:ng:st:00:bi:ng:_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1_0058/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1869, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3346}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:or:yo:fm:or:ni:ng:st:00:bi:ng:_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1_0058/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/or/yo/fm/or/ni/ng/st/00/bi/ng/_1/storyofmorningst00bing_1/storyofmorningst00bing_1_0058.jp2", "height": 3346, "width": 1869, "levels": 6, "size": 375419}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"58\">\n<p>\n 56\n</p>\n<p>\n STORY OF THE MORNING STAR.\n</p>\n<p>\n You may be sure that I was anxious to be off as soon\n as possible.

The\n wind was favorable when I started ; but it changed after\u00ac\n wards, and we were greatly at the mercy of a current which\n was very strong. At sundown, Tarawa bore due east,\n about twelve miles. The wind lulled, but the sea was\n rough, and we were fast drifting to the westward. A fear-\n ful hour was that! No land to the leeward for more than\n two hundred miles!

A book, however, telling us how to print had\n been sent, and we hoped soon to understand the business.\n Only two days after Captain James\u2019s departure, a boat\n entered our lagoon, which had gone adrift with several\n sailors, when trying to reach a small guano island, some\n forty miles from the place where they had been wrecked.\n For ten days they were upon the ocean, and after a voy\u00ac\n age of six hundred miles they reached Maiana.\n</p>\n<p>\n They rested one night, and then set out for Apaiang,\n in the hope of finding the Morning Star , and going in her\n to Honolulu. The current was too strong, and the wind\n too much ahead; so they put back, and remained five\n days longer. They then set out again for Apaiang, and\n reached us just too late! A few weeks later they had\n an opportunity of leaving for Sydney in a cocoa-nut oil\n trader.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:or:yo:fm:or:ni:ng:st:00:bi:ng:_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1_0062/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 233, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 418}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:or:yo:fm:or:ni:ng:st:00:bi:ng:_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1_0062/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 467, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 836}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:or:yo:fm:or:ni:ng:st:00:bi:ng:_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1_0062/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 934, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1673}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:or:yo:fm:or:ni:ng:st:00:bi:ng:_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1_0062/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1869, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3346}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:or:yo:fm:or:ni:ng:st:00:bi:ng:_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1_0062/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/or/yo/fm/or/ni/ng/st/00/bi/ng/_1/storyofmorningst00bing_1/storyofmorningst00bing_1_0062.jp2", "height": 3346, "width": 1869, "levels": 6, "size": 339446}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"62\">\n<p>\n 60\n</p>\n<p>\n STORY OF TI1E MORNING STAR.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of the men was a printer, and he was willing to\n remain, and set our little press to work.

Hiram\n Bingham, the Micronesian missionary who wrote the\n preceding story of the first Morning Star. Mr.\n Bingham proved his fitness for the task committed to\n him, by bringing the new Star safely aroundCape Horn\n and into Honolulu Harbor on March 15, 1867, after a very\n short passage of 122 days. Two thousand Hawaiian\n Sundajr-school children marched to the wharf to see\n \u201ctheir ship\u201d; for three or four thousand out of one\n hundred and fifty thousand of her stockholders were\n Hawaiians.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was on March 28, 1867, that the Star began her\n missionary work in the Pacific, still sailing under com\u00ac\n mand of Captain Bingham. The plan for her yearly\n trip is to go from Honolulu first to the Gilbert Islands,\n although they are the southernmost group, lying directly\n under the equator. This is in order to take advantage\n of prevailing winds and currents. Then she sails north\u00ac\n west nearly a thousand miles to Ponape, taking the other\n mission islands on the way. Since Micronesia began to\n have foreign missions of her own, the Star has gone\n from Ponape to the Mortlocks, and the missionaries\n wish she had time to go still further. Often the loved\n and longed-for ship has to wait becalmed, miles out from\n the anchorage, drifting about helplessly under the tropi\u00ac\n cal sun. This sadly delays her work. In one of her\n \u201creports\u201d to her youthful owners, the Star says: \u201cI\n came down flying from Ponape \u2014 I am going back\n 4 wallowing.\u2019 I am doing the very best I can, and am\n glad no one complains at my slow progress.

I confess, too, that what I have seen and\n felt moves me in this matter. In a voyage to Micro\u00ac\n nesia I have endured a thirty day ' s calm. While we were ^\n living at the Mortlock Islands my husband was pros\u00ac\n trated by overwork and insufficient food, and there was\n less than half a loaf of bread between us and hunger,\n and this because the Morning Star was delayed by calms\n in getting to us with supplies. Later we took a weary,\n seasick voj^age of fifteen days which, with a limited\n supply of steam, might easily have been accomplished\n in four days. Still later, we had another long and dreary\n voyage of seventy-nine days: days full of discomfort\n and of anxiety, and of peril to at least one life: days in\n which I saw my children look with eager, hungry eyes\n for nourishing food which they could not have, and\n turned away to hide my tears. It is not easy to speak of\n all this. Missionaries do not commonly bring to the front\n their trials and privations; nor would I, but for the needs\n of the cause in Micronesia. I bring this before you because\n I believe that Christians at home will act upon it when\n they understand it.\u201d Will not the churches and the chil\u00ac\n dren justify this confidence, and be ready in due time to\n build a vessel with steam-power attached, to carry the\n messengers of life to the islands of the Pacific?\n</p>\n</page>\n"}]], "djvu_text_file": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/or/yo/fm/or/ni/ng/st/00/bi/ng/_1/storyofmorningst00bing_1/storyofmorningst00bing_1_djvu.txt", "epub_file": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/or/yo/fm/or/ni/ng/st/00/bi/ng/_1/storyofmorningst00bing_1/storyofmorningst00bing_1.epub", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/resource/dcmsiabooks.storyofmorningst00bing_1/", "image": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:st:or:yo:fm:or:ni:ng:st:00:bi:ng:_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1:storyofmorningst00bing_1_0003/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "representative_index": 2, "fulltext_file": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/or/yo/fm/or/ni/ng/st/00/bi/ng/_1/storyofmorningst00bing_1/storyofmorningst00bing_1_djvu.xml", "pdf": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/st/or/yo/fm/or/ni/ng/st/00/bi/ng/_1/storyofmorningst00bing_1/storyofmorningst00bing_1.pdf"}]}
