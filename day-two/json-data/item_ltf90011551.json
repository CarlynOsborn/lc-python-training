Some may suppose\n that the new covenant which was to gather Israel, made\n its appearance in the days of Christ and his Apostles.\n But Paul tells us it was yet future in his day. So in his\n 11th chapter to the Homans, he says, \u201c that blindness in\n part is happened to Israel, until the fulness of the Gen-\n tiles be come in, and so all Israel shall be saved ; as it is\n written, There shall come out of Sion the Deliverer, and\n shall turn away ungodliness from Jacob, for this is my\n covenant unto them, when I shall take away their sins.\u201d\n From this we learn that Paul placed that covenant in\n the future, even down to the restoration of Israel, in the\n last days, when the times of the Gentiles should be ful-\n filled. Then there should come a Deliverer for Israel,\n and not before, seeing that they had rejected the first\n coming of that Deliverer.

The\n answer is, By communicating His will to them by ac-\n tual revelation ; for, without this, it would be impossible\n to make a covenant between two parties. In order to\n illustrate this subject, let us bring an example. We see\n how we make covenants with each other. For instance,\n a young man wishes to enter into a covenant of matri-\n mony with a young lady ; but deprive him of the privi-\n lege of revealing his mind to her, cutoff all direct com-\n munication between them, and a covenant could never\n be made ; and so it is with the Almighty. He never did\n enter into a covenant with His creatures, without reve-\n lations ; and He never can do it.

Who teaches that those who believe and repent,\n should be baptized, and none others ? Perhaps the reader\n may say the Baptists do ; but do they call upon men to\n be baptized as soon as they believe and repent? And\n moreover, do they promise the remission of sins, with\n the gift of the Holy Ghost? Recollect, now, what effect\n the Holy Ghost has upon people who receive it. It will\n guide them into all truth, strengthen the memory, and\n show them things to come. And Joel has said, it would\n cause them to dream dreams, to see visions, and to\n prophesy.

We have\n heard many comments upon this vision ; some compare\n it to sinners being converted, and some to the body of\n Christ, the Church, when dead as to the spiritual gifts;\n but the Church becoming dead, can no longer be said to\n be the body of Christ, as when she abides in the true\n vine, she lives and bears fruit, and is not dead, and\n when she does not abide in him, she is cut off as a\n branch withered and burned, instead of rising again.\n But did you ever hear the Lord\u2019s own explanation of\n this vision, in the same chapter? It so far surpasses all\n other comments, I am inclined to believe it ; I will there-\n fore write it in preference to any other, and run the risk of\n becoming unpopular by so doing. The Lord says : \u201c Son\n of man, these bones are the whole house of Israel ; be-\n hold, they say, Our bones are dried, and our hope is\n lost : we are cut off for our parts.

Then shall ye know that I the Lord have spoken\n it, and performed it, saith the Lord.\u201d Thus you have\n the whole vision unfolded plainly, if the Lord\u2019s\n authority can once be allowed, which is seldom the case\n in this age of wisdom and learning.

Now if any nation, in any\n age of the world, or in any part of the earth, should\n happen to live up to their privilege, what would they\n obtain? I answer, revelation, for the best of reasons,\n because no people ever found God in any other way, nor\n ever will. Therefore, if they found God, they found\n Him by revelation, direct from Himself, He revealing\n His will to them ; and if they did not find Him in this\n way, they never knew Him. And if they did obtain\n revelation, it was their privilege to write it, and make a\n record of the same, and teach it to their children ; and\n this record would be sacred, because it would contain\n the word of God ; and thus it would be a Holy Bible,\n no matter whether it was written by the Jews, the Ten\n Tribes, the Nephites, or the Gentiles. I would just as\n soon have the Gospel written by Nephi, Mormon,\n Moroni, or Alma, as the Gospel written by Matthew,\n Mark, Luke, or John. Again, I would just as soon\n believe a revelation given in America, as believe a\n revelation given in Asia ; for if ever a nation failed to\n get a revelation, it was because they did not attain unto\n that which was their privilege. But why, then, was\n any nation ever left in darkness, from age to age, with-\n out the light of revelation to guide them? I answer,\n because their forefathers, in some age of the world, re-\n jected revelation, cast out and .killed the Prophets, and\n turned a deaf ear to the things of God, until God took\n away that which they enjoyed, and committed it to\n some other people, and left them from generation to\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:vo:ic:eo:fw:ar:ni:ng:in:00:pr:at:_0:voiceofwarningin00prat_0:voiceofwarningin00prat_0_0176/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 239, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 413}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:vo:ic:eo:fw:ar:ni:ng:in:00:pr:at:_0:voiceofwarningin00prat_0:voiceofwarningin00prat_0_0176/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 478, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 827}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:vo:ic:eo:fw:ar:ni:ng:in:00:pr:at:_0:voiceofwarningin00prat_0:voiceofwarningin00prat_0_0176/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1654}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:vo:ic:eo:fw:ar:ni:ng:in:00:pr:at:_0:voiceofwarningin00prat_0:voiceofwarningin00prat_0_0176/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1912, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3308}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:vo:ic:eo:fw:ar:ni:ng:in:00:pr:at:_0:voiceofwarningin00prat_0:voiceofwarningin00prat_0_0176/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/vo/ic/eo/fw/ar/ni/ng/in/00/pr/at/_0/voiceofwarningin00prat_0/voiceofwarningin00prat_0_0176.jp2", "height": 3308, "width": 1912, "levels": 6, "size": 458947}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"176\">\n<p>\n 158\n</p>\n<p>\n THE DEALINGS OF GOD\n</p>\n<p>\n generation to grow up in ignorance, until he should see\n fit again to send His light and truth to that nation ; but\n those who reject no light are under no condemnation,\n and the mercy of God hath claim upon them, through\n the blood of Christ which atoneth for the sins of the\n world.
