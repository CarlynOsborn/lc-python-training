I am denominated by my\n Lord, an illuminator of the world.\u201d For this is\n true of the Church considered as a body of men,\n as well as of the individual believers who com\u00ac\n pose that body.\n</p>\n<p>\n The sacred history informs us that \u201c God made\n the greater light to rule the day, and the lesser\n light to rule the night.\u201d The wisdom and benefi\u00ac\n cence of that ordination are very manifest. The\n right to do it, none can question. And if the sun\n and moon were rational creatures, none would\n doubt either their indebtedness for the privileges\n of that important position, or their obligation to\n obey Him who ordained them to their beneficent\n office. Nor will any true disciple of Christ hesitate\n to acknowledge the honor and favor conferred on\n him, in being appointed to reflect the light he gets\n from the Sun of righteousness, on a world lying\n in the darkness of unbelief.
