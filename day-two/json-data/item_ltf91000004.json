Boston of To-day. A General Review of its Unrivalled\n</p>\n<p>\n Location and the more prominent Industrial Enterprises\n that have made it the Metropolis of New England.\n</p>\n<p>\n ' TTTHENEVER tlie earlier history of our country is mentioned, there is one location that stands\n Y \u2019 out more prominently than any other, and within it and about it centres a great portion\n of the important events that preceded and immediately followed the War of the Revolution. The\n history of Boston is so closely interwoven into that of our country and the formation of the\n United States, that no historian of the latter can fully portray the events coming under his pen\n without devoting very considerable space to this city.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this work no effort has been made to go into the detail of the history of Boston, the writer\n confining himself, after an epitomized review of the more important events of the city\u2019s settle-\n ment and growth, to the present appearance of the \u201cMetropolis of New England,\u201d and the very\n superior location the city enjoys for trade and manufacturing purposes, coupled with more minute\n details of those business interests that are to-day the chief instruments in advancing the city,\n commercially and otherwise. With no attempt, therefore, to correct anything previously written,\n and with the view only of compiling into useful and convenient form, and to the profit of all con-\n cerned, much data scattered about, the subject-matter is entered upon.\n</p>\n<p>\n Early Settlement.\n</p>\n<p>\n To whom belongs the credit of first discovering that portion of the New England coast now\n known as Boston Harbor is not definitely known ; though, in absence of more positive proof, his-\n torians have conceded that it was the Northmen. The first authentic settlement of Boston, which\n was originally called \u201c Shawmutt\u201d by the Indians, was in the year 1630, by the colonists from\n Salem, who named the site of the present city Trimountain. Two years previous, 1628, the district\n known as the Massachusetts Bay Colony was bought by people from Dorchester, England, and a\n year later Charlestown, now a part of Boston, was first settled. The necessity for good water in\n 1630 caused the little band, under the leadership of Winthrop, to remove across to the peninsula,\n or Trimountain\u2014 a name derived from the three peaks afterward known as Copp\u2019s, Beacon, and\n Fort Hills.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0008/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 184, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 307}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0008/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 368, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 615}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0008/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 736, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1230}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0008/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2461}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0008/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4923}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0008/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/le/ad/in/gm/an/uf/ac/tu/00/un/se/_0/leadingmanufactu00unse_0/leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0008.jp2", "height": 4923, "width": 2945, "levels": 6, "size": 905560}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"8\">\n<p>\n 18\n</p>\n<p>\n CITY OF BOSTON.\n</p>\n<p>\n Upon this strip of land was Mr. William Blaxton, or as more generally accepted Blaxstone, an\n Englishman, who had been living there for several years, and held an unquestioned proprietor-\n ship to the whole peninsula of Boston. This tract, with the exception of six acres where his\n house stood, was sold to Winthrop and his associates for the sum of \u00a330, and the colonists began\n at once to make a permanent settlement, the site being selected for the centre and metropolis of\n the Massachusetts Bay Colony. During 1630 near fifteen hundred persons came over from Eng-\n land, and rapid development was made.\n</p>\n<p>\n The first settlers located chiefly within the limits between what are now Hanover, Tremont,\n Bromfield, and Milk streets. Pemberton Hill was also a favorite place of residence. The first\n buildings were rude and unsightly. They were of wood, with roofs thatched, while the chim-\n neys were built of pieces of wood placed crosswise, and covered with clay. Winthrop\u2019s company\n found Boston sparsely wooded ; water, however, was abundant and good. Id addition to the\n springs near Blaxstone\u2019s house, mention is made in the first records of a \u201c great spring\u201d in Spring\n Lane, as well as other springs on the Neck and elsewhere. Economy in building was carried so\n far that Governor Winthrop reproved his deputy, in 1632, for nailing clapboards upon his house ;\n saying, \u201c that he did not well to bestow so much cost about the wainscoting, and adorning his\n house in the beginning of a plantation, both in regard of the public charges and for example.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The First Fifty Years\u2019 History.\n</p>\n<p>\n From King\u2019s Hand-book* we extract : \u201cIn 1630 the first General Court of the colony was held\n in Boston. John Winthrop was the first Governor elected by the colonists, and Thomas Dudley\n the Deputy-Governor. Had these two carried out their plan of fortifying \u2018 New-towne,\u2019 the\n present Cambridge, the result would have been that either the latter, or some other town, would\n have become the New England metropolis, instead of Boston. Winthrop, however, after he and\n others had built houses at New-towne, saw that Boston was the most promising site, and conse-\n quently abandoned the project, causing thereby the enmity of Dudley. This circumstance, possi-\n bly combined with jealousy, led to unfriendly disputes between these two magnates, which had to\n be settled by arbitrators.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe old beacon shown in all the early plans of the town, and which gave the name to\n Beacon Hill, was erected in 1634-35, to alarm the country in case of invasion. It stood near the\n present State House, the exact spot being the south-east corner of the reservoir on Temple Street.\n It was a tall mast, standing on cross timbers placed upon a stone foundation, supported by braces,\n and was ascended by treenails driven into it ; and sixty-five feet from the base projected a crane\n of iron, from which an iron skeleton frame was suspended, to receive a barrel of tar or other com-\n bustibles. When fired this could be seen for a great distance inland. It was newly erected in\n 1768, having fallen from some cause unknown ; and in 1789 it was blown down.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe happiest people are those who have no history ; and there is not much of moment to\n record concerning this thriving town during the first century of its existence. A few interesting\n facts from the quaint records of the early day will show the state of society and public opinion.\n From 1637 up to 1676, in the pages of local history can be found cases where persons were either\n banished from Boston, or murdered on account of heresy, hung on charges of witchcraft, pun-\n ished for petty misdemeanors by imprisonments in the stocks, whipped or fined for being Baptists,\n persecuted in various ways for being Quakers, or placed in cases for violating the Sabbath. Up to\n the last century, too, slavery existed in Boston.

On the 5th of\n March occurred what is known as the Boston Massacre, which had its origin from the following\n circumstance :\n</p>\n<p>\n A barber\u2019s boy in King Street, who saw an officer passing by, and cried after him, \u201cThere\n goes a mean fellow, who has not paid for dressing his hair.\u201d The sentinel at the Custom House,\n hearing this insult, left his post, and struck the boy on the head with his musket.

The crowd threatened to kill the soldier, who\n called out the main guard to his assistance. They were immediately surrounded by a mob of men\n and boys, who began to throw missiles at them, and dared the soldiers to fire. At last they did\n fire, and four persons were killed. This painful collision illustrates the extreme tension that the\n people\u2019s feelings had reached, and was the forerunner of the famous \u201c Boston Tea-party.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n A writer says: \u201cThis disturbance was still fresh in the minds of the people when the East\n India Company sent several vessels to Boston, loaded with tea. The inhabitants declared that they\n would not pay any duty on tea imported from England; and, on the arrival of the ships, a call was\n made to citizens, December 16, 1773, by Samuel Adams and others, for a public meeting at Fan-\n euil Hall, to put into action plans already made to prevent the lauding of the tea. On account of\n the immense crowd which more than filled the hall, a motion was made to adjourn to the Old\n South Church. At this meeting was made the first suggestion to dispose of the tea in the way\n finally adopted. John Rowe, who lived on Pond Street, now Bedford, said, \u2018Who knows how\n tea will mingle with salt water? \u2019 This idea was received with great laughter and approval.

Some sixty\n went on board. Each detachment had its leader. Everything was orderly, systematic, and doubt-\n less previously concerted. The leaders demanded of those in charge of the ships the keys to the\n hatches, candles and matches; which were produced. The contents of three hundred and forty-\n two chests were thrown overboard.

The reading of this instrument on July 18, from the balcony of\n the Town Hall, enlisted the greatest favor and rejoicing. Though the war continued until 1781,\n before peace was declared, Boston\u2019s important connection with it was principally embraced within\n the first two years.\n</p>\n<p>\n At this time Boston was the most influential town in the country, and it at once entered upon a\n period of rapid growth, the latter part of the eighteenth century showing a very marked improve-\n ment in the city. In 1790 the population exceeded 18,000, and in its importance throughout the\n new United States was probably greater than either New York or Philadelphia. The last twenty\n years of the eighteenth century was an era of advancement. The Charles River Bridge, the first of\n the numerous avenues connecting the town with its northern and western surburbs, was completed;\n the New State House was finished, and the first two theatres \u2014 the Boston and the Haymarket \u2014\n opened their doors.\n</p>\n<p>\n Incidents of History during the Present Century.\n</p>\n<p>\n The century closed with Boston on the highway to greater commercial importance, and rapid\n increase in population. From King\u2019s Hand-book we trace the principal events of the city to the\n present time :\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cDuring the autumn of 1804 a terrific gale visited Boston, blowing down several church-\n steeples, and doing much damage. The news of the declaration of war against England in 1812 was\n received by Bostonians with indignation. Her influential men had opposed the embargo laid upon\n commerce with England, which w T as a heavy blow to the interests of Boston and Massachusetts, one\n third of the shipping of the United States being at that time owned in the State, and they pro-\n nounced the war a serious mistake. Nevertheless, at the call for troops a regiment was raised here;\n and in 1814 when a British fleet was reported to be off the coast extensive preparations were made\n to give it a warm reception should it come this way. Peace was gladly welcomed the next year.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c In 1816 Webster came to Boston. He lived first in Mount Vernon Street, on the summit of\n Beacon Hill, a few rods northwest of the State House; later in the house standing at No. 37\n Somerset Street ; and afterward at the corner of High and Summer streets, where he entertained\n Lafayette in magnificent style during the visit of the latter in 1824. Webster\u2019s residence in Summer\n Street, now numbered 136 and 138, was long marked by a splendid block of stores, known as \u00a3 The\n Webster Buildings.\u2019 This went down in the great fire of 1872, but was soon replaced by a sub-\n stantial iron-front building erected as a warehouse for Wm. Claflin, Coburn & Co., one of the oldest\n and most prominent boot-manufacturing firms in the United States. In 1821 the West Point Cadets,\n under command of Major Worth, U. S. A., marched to Boston and encamped on the Common.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cOn Feb. 22, 1822, after many years\u2019 agitation of the subject, the first petition having been\n made as early as the year 1709, an act establishing the city of Boston was passed by the Legislature,\n and accepted by the citizens, and May 1 Boston became a city. John Phillips was the first Mayor.\n He was succeeded by Josiah Quincy, who was in office six successive years.

Mr. Ticknor was an occupant of the house from 1830 until his death in 1870.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIn 1824 the population of the city was 58,000. During the next few years numerous public\n improvements were made; among them the opening of the East Boston and Chelsea ferries; the\n completion of the Warren Bridge, connecting Charlestown with Boston; the laying of gas-pipes;\n and the erection of many notable public and private buildings, including a new court-house, custom-\n house, and three theatres \u2014 the Tremont, Federal, and Warren.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIn 1830 the population had grown to 61,000, and the city celebrated the second centenary of\n its settlement. In 1833 the old hero Andrew Jackson visited Boston, and was received with great\n popular enthusiasm. The Whig Party was formed about this time. It was in 1834 that the Ursu-\n line Convent in Charlestown was burned by a mob. \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c In 1837 a large delegation of the Sacs and Fox Indians arrived from the far West, and, in all\n the gorgeousness of paint and feathers, exhibited on the Common their war-dances and other feats\n before interested thousands. Boston suffered, in common with other parts of the country, in the\n panic of this year, and its banks suspended specie payments; but in good time it recovered, and\n entered upon another season of prosperity. In 1840 the first steamship line between Boston and\n Liverpool was established. In 1843 President Tyler and Gen. Scott visited Boston.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c In 1844, after a period of intense cold, the harbor was firmly frozen as far down as the light-\n house; and its surface was enlivened with skating, coasting, sledding, and sleighing. Cargoes\n were discharged on to teams, and transported to the warehouses. Booths, as on high holidays, filled\n with eatables and drinkables, added to the gayety of the scene. It was during this ice-embargo that\n the enterprising Boston merchants, aided by the Fresh Pond ice-cutters, cut a channel seven miles\n long to enable the imprisoned Cunard steamship to prosecute her voyage to England.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIn 1847 President Polk was the guest of the city. During this year there was a great fire at\n the North End, which consumed more than one hundred buildings, with their contents. In 1848 the\n Cochituate water was introduced, and the event celebrated with an imposing display. In 1849 there\n was unexampled mortality from Asiatic cholera. In 1850 Professor John W. Webster was hung for\n the murder of Dr. George Parkm an\u2014 one of the most extraordinary cases in the history of American\n crime. The advent of Jenny Lind was a notable event of the same year; the great Swedish vocalist\n singing to audiences of upward of 4000 people. At this period the anti-slavery agitation became\n intense; and in 1854 the Burns riot occurred, caused by efforts to liberate Anthony Burns, a fugitive\n slave, one man being killed and several seriously hurt.

The same year the city was called upon to mourn the death\n of George Peabody, the philanthropist, and of the Hon. Anson Burlingame, whose remains lay in\n state in Faneuil Hall. In 1871 the old building standing in the middle of Court Street, near Tremont\n and Cornhill, known as Scollay\u2019s Building, was removed, leaving an open area, now called Scollay\n Square. This year the Grand Duke Alexis of Russia visited the city, and was treated to a round of\n brilliant gayeties. The year 1872 was eventful. From June 17 to July 7 the second grand musical\n festival was held, and was attended by from 30,000 to 100,000 people daily. It also was held in a\n temporary Coliseum of vast size; and special national musical features were introduced by bands\n from England, France, Germany, and other countries. Johann Strauss led the orchestra while it\n played his own waltzes. A grand ball was given, Gen. Grant being present. The enterprise was\n regarded as a grand success, although it was not remunerative to the shareholders. During the\n following autumn came the epizootic epidemic, rendering almost all the horses useless for the time\n being, and causing great inconvenience.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Great Fire.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cOn Nov. 9, this year, at 7.15 o\u2019clock in the evening, the great Boston Fire broke out. The\n flames started at the corner of Summer and Kingston streets, and spread with terrible speed. In\n spite of the efforts of the firemen, the flames sped northeast and north into the very heart of the\n substantial business district of the city, where a great proportion of the buildings were of solid\n granite, and used for wholesale business. Aid was summoned from the surburban and even from\n distant cities; and special trains bearing fire-engines came hastening into the panic-stricken city\n from all sides. Buildings were blown up in the hope that the gaps thus left would not be bridged\n by the furious on-sweeping flames, and the gas was cut off, leaving the city almost in darkness.\n The militia went on duty to aid the police in preventing the wholesale lawlessness that threatened\n to add to the terrors of the time. When the fire finally stopped, it had spread over 65 acres, and\n destroyed about $80,000,000 worth of property and many lives, leaving the entire district bounded\n by Summer, Washington, Milk, and Broad streets a smoking chaos of ruins. Boston recovered\n with almost incredible elasticity and pluck from this terrible blow ; and the \u2018 burnt district \u2019 is to-day\n a section of imposing and substantial business warehouses, its appearance greatly improved, and\n the wealth and convenience of this part of the city thereby increased. In 1873 another serious fire\n destroyed several squares of buildings. Subsequent calamities have not been infrequent. Within\n a few years there have been numbers of those startling and often unaccountable accidents so com-\n mon in American cities. Among these may be mentioned extensive fires in 1874, 1877, and 1878;\n the blowing up of a building on the corner of Washington and La Grange streets; the explosion\n under the sidewalk near the Federal Street Bridge iD South Boston, by which several lives were lost;\n and the explosion of Jenney\u2019s oil establishment in South Boston. The burning of a tenement-house\n on Sliawmut Avenue, in which several of the unfortunate occupants lost their lives or were terribly\n injured, will be remembered as a comparatively recent occurrence. So also has Boston of late years\n had an unpleasant notoriety from a peculiar class of criminals: notably the boy Jesse Pomeroy, con-\n fined for life in the State Prison, who murdered a boy and a girl, and tortured several children,\n making himself the terror of the neighborhood in which he lived; and Piper, who one Sunday after-\n noon murdered the little six-year-old girl, Mabel Young, in the belfry of the Warren Avenue Baptist\n Church, of which he was sexton. According to his confession just before his execution, May 26,\n 1876, he had also murdered one Bridget Landregan, whose death up to that time had been a\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0019/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 184, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 307}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0019/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 368, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 615}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0019/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 736, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1230}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0019/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2461}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0019/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4923}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0019/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/le/ad/in/gm/an/uf/ac/tu/00/un/se/_0/leadingmanufactu00unse_0/leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0019.jp2", "height": 4923, "width": 2945, "levels": 6, "size": 853166}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"19\">\n<p>\n CITY OF BOSTON.\n</p>\n<p>\n 27\n</p>\n<p>\n mystery, and he had almost fatally assaulted one Mary Tyner on Oxford Street.

The city, the State, and the private citizens vied with each other in their efforts to make\n the event a glorious success. The celebration was begun by an official reception in the Music Hall\n on the evening of June 16, given by the city to its guests, many of whom were from the South.\n The affair was made memorable especially by the spontaneous expressions of good-will and of a\n desire for reconciliation on the part of the late Confederates who participated ; and a tone of lofty\n and heartfelt patriotism pervaded the meeting. The hall was brilliantly decorated, and hundreds of\n distinguished guests were present, besides military bodies from South Carolina, Virginia, Maryland,\n New York, and many other States. The speaking was by Mayor Cobb, Gov. Gaston, Col. A. O.\n Andrews of South Carolina, Gen. Fitz-Hugh Lee of Virginia, Gen. Judson C. Kilpatrick, Gen.\n W. T. Sherman, Gen. A. E. Burnside, and Vice-President Wilson. The enthusiasm cannot be de-\n scribed, and was entirely unusual in its character. The next morning the city woke up to find its\n streets filled with vast crowds of visitors; flags floated from almost every building, the streets were\n gay with banners, and the entire town was in gala array. After a military review in the morning,\n the great procession started on its long march at 1.15 p.m., under Chief-Marshal Gen. Francis A.\n Osborn. The procession included the whole militia force of Massachusetts; regiments from New\n York, Baltimore, Philadelphia, Providence; companies from Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Connec-\n ticut, Virginia, Washington, New York, South Carolina, and New Hampshire; hundreds of gov-\n ernors, generals, and distinguished guests from all parts of the country; civic associations, secret\n societies, veteran bodies, benevolent and temperance societies, and a trades division in which were\n 421 vehicles drawn by 1587 horses. The number of men marching in the parade has never been\n approximately estimated, but may be inferred from the fact that the time occupied by the proces-\n sion in passing a given point (all delays being deducted) was three hours and fifty minutes. The\n railroads alone brought 140,000 people into the city on that day. Exercises at the Bunker Hill\n Monument in the afternoon were presided over by Judge G. W. Warren; and the oration was de-\n livered by Gen. Charles Devens, Jun.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cOn March 17 following this memorable celebration the one hundredth anniversary of the\n evacuation of Boston by the British was observed in a somewhat elaborate fashion. Historic\n points and buildings were noted and decorated, speeches were made in the Old South Church, and\n an oration was delivered in Music Hall.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cJan. 25, 1877, the Moody and Sankey Tabernacle, a large brick building, well constructed,\n though built for a temporary purpose, and capable of seating 6000 persons, situated at the junction\n of Tremont Street and Warren Avenue, was dedicated; and on the 28th began the season of daily\n revival meetings that continued without interruption until May 27. Dwight L. Moody preached\n and held prayer-meetings daily, both afternoon and evening, with few exceptions; and Ira D. San-\n key sang, supported by a vast choir under the direction of Eben Tourjee. Great crowds were\n attracted, not only from the city, but from the surrounding country, excursion trains running on\n the railroads. The meetings created a profound sensation. On March 9 of this year there was one\n of the severest gales ever known in this vicinity. The velocity of the wind was seventy-two miles\n an hour. The storm area was of great extent, striking the whole Atlantic seaboard, and extending\n west beyond the Mississippi. On the evening of April 9 the social event of the season occurred \u2014\n the Old South Ball, in aid of the preservation fund, which was given in Music Hall. June 26-27\n President Hayes, with Evarts, Sherman, Key, and Devens, of his Cabinet, visited the city. There\n was a procession and review in their honor, and a civic banquet at the Hotel Brunswick.

Long, Mayor Green, and several cabinet officers were present.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Changes of a Century.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cOf old Boston a hundred years ago the following pleasing sketch is condensed from the\n address of the Rev. Dr. George E. Ellis, on the occasion of the celebration of the hundredth anni-\n versary of the evacuation of Boston by the British: * \u201cWell-to-do,\u201d \u201cforehanded,\u201d were the local\n phrases by which the general condition of the people would have been described. There was real\n wealth, too, in the hands of some, with complacency, luxury, and display. There were stately and\n substantial dwellings, with rich and solid furnishings for parlor, dining-room, hall, and chamber,\n with plate and tapestry, brocades and laces. There were portraits, by foreign and resident artists,\n of those who were ancestors, and those who meant to be ancestors. There were formal costumes\n and manners for the gentry, with parade and etiquette, a self-respecting decorum in intercourse\n with their own and other classes, warm hospitality, good appetites, and abundant viands, liquid\n and solid, for all. The buildings were detached, none of them in blocks. The homes of many of\n the merchant-princes and high magistrates were relatively more palatial than are any in the city\n to-day. They stood conspicuous and large, surrounded by generous spaces, with lawns and trees,\n with fruit and vegetable gardens, and fields for pasture, and coach and cattle barns. There were\n fine equipages, with black coachmen and footmen. There were still wide unfenced spaces, and\n declivities and thickets, where the barberry-bush, the flag, and the mullein-stalk grew undisturbed.\n There were many quaint old nooks and corners, taverns and inns, \u201ccoffee-houses,\u201d \u2014 the drinking-\n vessels in which were not especially adapted to that beverage, \u2014 shops designated by emblems and\n symbols, loitering-places for news and gossip, resorts of boys and negroes for play or roguery,\n and some dark holes on wharf or lane. . . . There were some two thousand buildings, four being\n of stone, of which King\u2019s Chapel alone remains. Between Beacon and the foot of Park Street stood\n the workhouse, the poorhouse, and the Bridewell\u2014 all facing the Common. On the site of the\n Park Street Church stood the Granary; opposite, a large manufactory building, used by the British\n for a hospital. The jail occupied the site of the present Court-House. King and Queen, now State\n and Court streets, were the most compactly covered, and lined with taverns, dwellings, marts, and\n offices of exchange. The house provided by the Province for the British Governor was opposite the\n Old South, standing far back, stately, commodious, with trees and lawn up to Washington Street.\n The Old State House, with a dignity which it has not now, held the halls of the council and the\n representatives, with royal portraits and adornings. How little is there here now which the patriots\n and citizens of the old days, if they came back, would recognize!\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Such was Boston a hundred years ago. A great, far-reaching, imposing modern city has taken\n the place of the bustling, quaint, picturesque town of that day. Even during the past half-century\n Boston has changed marvellously in appearance, customs, and manners. Few of the historic old\n landmarks remain, and these few are evidently doomed soon to disappear before the onward march\n of the utilitarian. It has lost much of its homely quaintness; but with this loss it has gained\n greatly in other directions. To the older citizen much of its charm has gone forever, and in many\n parts it has to him an unfamiliar look. Its odd old streets, so incomprehensible to the\n stranger, have been untwisted and untangled, widened and straightened and cut away, and their\n peculiar characteristics almost entirely effaced. A new and modern architecture in its buildings\n has largely superseded the old, and radical changes have been made in every direction. Pictur-\n esque and attractive in many ways as was old Boston, the new Boston, with its wealth of magnifi-\n cent buildings in the busy, bustling * down town\u2019 section, its rows of elegant and costly residences\n in the Back Bay and other districts, its countless refined homes, its artistic adornments, and its\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0024/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 184, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 307}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0024/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 368, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 615}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0024/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 736, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1230}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0024/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2461}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0024/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4923}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0024/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/le/ad/in/gm/an/uf/ac/tu/00/un/se/_0/leadingmanufactu00unse_0/leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0024.jp2", "height": 4923, "width": 2945, "levels": 6, "size": 966076}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"24\">\n<p>\n 32\n</p>\n<p>\n CITY OF BOSTON.\n</p>\n<p>\n many stately structures, public and private, is a most attractive modern city, frankly accorded to\n be\u2014 even by those of other places proud of their own cities\u2014 the finest in the country.

But first a brief glance at the industrial\n influences which, originating in this city, have floated out in every direction, multiplying the re-\n sources and augmenting the wealth of the entire country.\n</p>\n<p>\n What the World Owes to Boston\u2019s Inventive Genius.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe building up of one of the first and the most successful sewing-machines was done in Bos-\n ton. In the manufacture of paper, textiles, watches, and shoes, this city has furnished to every\n community in America the springs of prosperity. In the stitching and pegging of boots and shoes\n Boston invention and capital have revolutionized the industry throughout the world. The most\n important machinery now employed in this great industry was invented here. Dennison & How-\n ard, with the financial backing of their own city, made a machine-made watch and a watcli-factory\n possible and actual. Modern architecture in great cities has been entirely remodelled through a\n Boston invention \u2014 the elevator. In the matter of musical instruments, pianos, and reed organs, the\n ideas and triumphs and names of Boston have gone all over the earth. The first complete woollen\n factory ever set running was established in 1830 by Boston capital, when the Middlesex Mills were\n erected at Lowell. In 1814 Francis C. Lowell of Boston first applied the power-loom to the manu-\n facture of cotton, and the development of the great factory system of the country in all of its bene-\n ficial features has devolved in a great measure upon Boston capital.\n</p>\n<p>\n Is Boston a Manufacturing Centre ?\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Suffolk County presents a greater and more diversified variety of manufactured pro-\n ducts than any other county in the Commonwealth, and gives employment to more help. In\n 1875 the manufactures of Suffolk County exceeded any other county by more than $40,000,000.\n In 1875 there were employed 46,977 persons in the manufacturing of this city, and in 1880 the num-\n ber was 56,813. At the present time there must be considerably over 60,000 people who live on the\n wages earned in Boston manufactories. The earnings of the help employed in Boston have been\n conspicuously greater than in other sections of the State. In 1875 the average in the State was\n $475.76, while the average in Boston was $616.23. One hundred years ago the annual value of the\n manufactured products of Boston was less than $4,000,000; in 1870 it amounted to $106,000,000;\n in 1875, $135,931,504, and in 1880 to $155,805,422. It is expected that the manufactures of Boston\n the present year will reach the value of $175,000,000. Comparing these figures with the values in\n other counties, the pre-eminence of Boston will be at once perceived. In 1880 Worcester County\n produced in manufactures $79,372,529; Essex County, $93,008,271; Middlesex County, $115,040,661 ;\n while the entire State aggregated $581,983,449. In 1880 there were 3521 manufacturing establish-\n ments in Boston\u2014 a gain of 488 in five years. There were 37,831 males, 17,753 females, and 1229\n youths and children furnished employment. There was paid out that year in wages $23,715,140,\n with an invested capital of $42,750,134. The value of the stock consumed was $77,586,607.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Early Business Enterprises.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cNothing in the whole scope of industrial history is more substantial than has been the develop-\n ment of manufactures in the metropolis of New England. Before 1650 those industries which to\n day include more than one half of the entire products of the Commonwealth were well established\n in Boston and the immediate vicinity. Paper was manufactured early and extensively. So was\n rope. During the Revolutionary War manufactures were prosperous, and although for a decade\n after the war there was a natural decline, the revival followed swift and healthy. In 1789 the\n General Court encouraged the manufacture of cotton duck, so that the annual product in Boston\n rose to 120,000 yards, and the finest quality was made. Here it was that the first Workingman\u2019s\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0028/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 184, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 307}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0028/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 368, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 615}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0028/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 736, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1230}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0028/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2461}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0028/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4923}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0028/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/le/ad/in/gm/an/uf/ac/tu/00/un/se/_0/leadingmanufactu00unse_0/leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0028.jp2", "height": 4923, "width": 2945, "levels": 6, "size": 1148928}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"28\">\n<p>\n 36\n</p>\n<p>\n CITY OF BOSTON.\n</p>\n<p>\n Union was formed \u2018for mutual improvement and support.\u2019 One of the industrial eccentricities of\n the town of Boston in 1794 was a chocolate-mill, which would turn out 2500 pounds a day.

There was a lime when Boston could boast of over 30 distilleries within\n her boarders, but before 1800 this important industry had dwindled to 15, and those were not espe-\n cially prosperous.

Upon the foundations which he laid some of the most solid industrial structures\n of this city stand to-day. The largest gun ever cast in America before the late war was cast at Mr.\n Alger\u2019s foundry. The first quarter of this century had just turned when Boston became famous as\n the centre of the manufacture of musical instruments, and in the production of pianos and organs\n she leads the world. Boston pianos and reed organs have an unsurpassed reputation wherever the\n art of music is carried to its best achievements, and the industry of musical instruments appears to\n be one of those whose prosperity and enlargement in the future is fully assured.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Advancement of the Last Half Century.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe glory of Boston\u2019s ship building has come and gone. It came soon after John Quincy\n Adams was made President of the United States and it ended with the Mexican War. Between 1830\n and 1840 the two industries saw and glass manufacturing were brought to great perfection in Bos-\n ton, the only black glass-bottle factory in the United States being located here. The New England\n Crown Glass Company had a capital of $450,000. The manufacture of India-rubber, which in its\n various forms has so largely contributed to the wealth of this community, took its rise in the early\n thirties, and very soon hundreds of women and scores of men were employed in this industry,\n which since the war has increased to colossal proportions. Boston has furnished one of the best\n known and standard printing-presses to the book-making world \u2014 this industry aiding much for many\n years in bringing Boston into manufacturing prominence. In the year 1837 this city manufactured\n products to the value of nearly $25,000,000. One of the celebrities of the Hub in the manipulation\n of metals was the biggest bell ever cast in this country, the industry getting its initial impetus in\n 1843.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c The life of the whole country to-day must trace back the inception of some of its most essential\n comforts to Boston invention and manufacturing enterprise, as exhibited in 1842 by Walworth &\n Nason. It was here that gas, steam, and water-fittings as a separate industry was first inaugurated.\n Just about the time when General Frank Pierce was shipping his New England contingent for a\n sanguinary exploration of the halls of the Montezumas, a work was begun whose continuation and\n results are at this very time doing more to conquer Mexico than all the United States bayonets could\n do on the limited scale of \u201946. The manufacture of locomotives was then begun in South Bos-\n ton, and has ever since been pressed with vigor and success by different corporations. So, too,\n the manufacture of stationary and marine engines made Boston famous. It was in this city that\n the system of steam-heating was first introduced. The material for the building of iron steamships\n was largely manufactured here before 1850. For ten years following the latter date, the watch and\n the sewing-machine were attractive to the capital of Boston. The first successful sewing-machine\n was made here, and the inventions of several men received their practical test. Quite a number of\n different patents found capital and manufactories in Boston, and the immense industry of sewing-\n machine making gained its conspicuous headway in Boston. The third State Census was taken in\n 1855, and the products of Boston were shown as $58,301,028. A single item shows the development\n of a leading Boston industry: there were twenty pianoforte manufactories, turning out in that\n year 6122 instruments, valued at $1,984,700.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIn 1857 a severe blow was inflicted upon the industries of this city, but the war quickly obliter-\n ated the signs of depression, and stimulated them to an abnormal and somewhat dangerous activity.\n The close of the war found Boston with an annual industrial production which had nearly doubled\n in ten years. For six years following 1873 the manufacturers of Boston were under a cloud, but\n in 1879 they recovered, and were again in a healthy condition. While the actual products of\n Boston, territorially, in 1880 reached the value of about $150,000,000, the production from Boston\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0030/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 184, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 307}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0030/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 368, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 615}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0030/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 736, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1230}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0030/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2461}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0030/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4923}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0030/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/le/ad/in/gm/an/uf/ac/tu/00/un/se/_0/leadingmanufactu00unse_0/leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0030.jp2", "height": 4923, "width": 2945, "levels": 6, "size": 876294}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"30\">\n<p>\n \u25a038\n</p>\n<p>\n CITY OF BOSTON.\n</p>\n<p>\n capital for that year has been estimated at not less than $300,000,000.

On the basis of\n the last census there are in Boston 107 establishments devoted to the boot-and-slioe industry. Nearly\n 1900 hands are employed, who receive considerably more than $500,000 in wages. The capital\n behind the industry is $550,000, the manufactured products being valued at $2,670,823. There are\n 103 leather establishments, employing 1200 help, paying more than $500,000 in wages, having a\n capital of $1,500,000, and turning out products valued at $3,381,156. There are 37 manufactories\n of musical instruments, employing nearly 2000 hands. The employes earn good pay, for their\n wages amount to nearly $1,100,000. The capital invested is a good deal more than $2,000,000; and\n the sales reach about $3,250,000. In the matter of fertilizers, $1,250,000 is added to the wealth of\n Boston by five establishments and 250 employes. In rubber and elastic goods there are 10 manu-\n factories, turning out $2,100,000 worth of products, having $1,000,000 capital and employing 1000\n hands. In cordage and twine about a million and a quarter in value is produced. In iron and\n steel, the production reaches nearly $2,250,000, and in metals of all kinds, $7,250,000, with 261\n manufactories, and more than 4000 hands, over $4,000,000 capital, and about the same amount\n of stock consumed. In machinery, the product reaches in value $6,000,000. There are 125\n establishments, employing 3448 hands, who earn $1,867,207. There are 145 printing and publishing\n establishments, which enrich the community to the amount of $5,469,518, and pay out to 2900 em-\n ployes the sum of nearly $1,800,000. The capital invested in this industry is about two and a half\n millions. The furniture manufacturers number 130, and they employ 2500 hands, who earn nearly\n a million and a quarter in wages. The capital involved is a million and a half, while the manufac-\n tured product foots up $4,125,155.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIn the food realm, Boston can boast the heaviest pork-packer in the country outside of\n Chicago. The value of the meats put up is well rising $7,000,000. The four sugar-refineries do a\n business of more than sixteen and a-lialf millions, consuming stock valued at $15,544,084.

The value of their products reaches the\n heavy figures of $30,574,120.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c One of the most conspicuous industries in Boston is its manufacture of clothing. In this she\n has been pre-eminent and still excels, although powerful Western rivals threaten this industry. In\n 1880 there were 311 clothing manufactories, giving employment to 12,661 hands, who earned $4,-\n 206,768. The product reached in value almost $20,000,000. In the department of men\u2019s clothing\n the product was valued at more than $16,000,000.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c As to the present condition of Boston\u2019s industries, it is to be observed that while most of the\n great establishments have suffered from the business depressions of the past year, some of them\n have measurably recovered. Others have the certainty of a prosperous revival before them. A few\n are permanently crippled.

Several important foundations are at the present time being quietly laid, upon\n which will be reared colossal industries, and which \u25a0will enable Boston to dispense with some\n of those establishments which have heretofore contributed to her industrial fame, but\n which may not in the far future avail her. In the manufacture of artistic and costly\n stained-glass work Boston has within a few years made great strides, so that the best judges-\n throughout the country send their orders here. When such careful critics as the committee of the\n Trinity Church in Providence and the Old Centre Church in Hartford turn away from New York\n and select in Boston the finest memorial-windows for their sanctuaries, it is a tribute to Boston art\n and enterprise quite satisfactory. The finest furniture manufactured in New England is produced\n in Boston, and these establishments are now rapidly recovering from the temporary stagnation\n which has prevailed. The establishments which turn out house-building materials, particularly of\n wood, have been busy hives of late, and the outlook is excellent. In the line of boots and shoes\n the reports are most encouraging. It is no doubt true that the manufactures of Boston have suf-\n fered by the existing depression, but not altogether in the volume of business. The biggest pork-\n packing establishment in the city, John P. Squire & Co., reports that its bulk of business will be a\n little larger than last year, but the prices being lower, the cash amount of business is considerably\n less. This industry and all related ones are in better condition than ever before for future growth\n and success.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Altogether, every indication signifies that Boston must continue to be what she has been ever\n since 1650 \u2014 the manuf during centre of the Commonwealth, while at the same time her surplus\n capital is now readier thru at any period of the past to fill and control those new channels of enter-\n prise which the growth and necessities of the country may open up. \"\n</p>\n<p>\n City Government.\n</p>\n<p>\n The corporation of the city is derived from Legislative enactment, and the charter already in-\n existence is subject to amendments from the same authority. The legislative power of the city is-\n vested in the City Council, chosen annually on the Tuesday after the second Monday of December,\n consisting of the Mayor, twelve Aldermen chosen by districts, and seventy-two Common Council men.\n chosen by the twenty -five wards. The executive power is vested in the Mayor and Aldermen. The\n municipal year commences on the first Monday in January.\n</p>\n<p>\n The public buildings of the city are notably substantial. The City Hall, fronting on School-\n Street, is a handsome structure, and, though closely hemmed in by its surroundings, thus robbing\n its beauty of much of its effect, it is without doubt the most elaborate municipal structure in Bos-\n ton. The style in which the building has been erected is the Italian Renaissance, with modifica-\n tions and elaborations suggested by modern French architects, and its cost reached about $500,000.\n The faces of the front and west sides are of white Concord granite; those of the Court Square and\n City Hall Avenue fa 9 ades are of stone from the old City Hall, which stood on the same spot. The\n Louvre dome, which is surmounted by an American eagle and a flagstaff, is occupied within by\n some of the most important offices of the city. Here is the central point of the fire-alarm tele v -\n graph. Most of the offices of the city have commodious and comfortable quarters within the-\n building, but it is not large enough for all, and the pressing necessity for more room has been met\n by placing some of the city offices in other buildings.\n</p>\n<p>\n Within the neat area on the School Street front stand the bronze statues of Franklin by-\n Richard S. Greenougli, erected in 1856, and of Josiali Quincy, one of the earliest Mayors of Bos-\n ton, which was placed in its position September 17, 1879.

One of the advantages of the peninsula which attracted the early\n settlers was its abundance of pure water: the Indian name, Shawmutt, it is said, signifies \u2018Living\n Fountains.\u2019 But early in its history the wants of the town had increased beyond its internal re-\n sources. As early as 1795 a company was incorporated to introduce water from Jamaica Pond. In\n 1845 this company had laid about 15 miles of pipe, conveying water to nearly 3000 of the 10,370\n houses the city then contained. Pipes were at first of pine logs. The elevation of this pond, how-\n ever, was too low to bring the water into the higher portions of the city, and its capacity was not\n sufficient for the portions it did reach. For many years the subject of a better supply had been\n agitated; and at length, in the year 1845, Long Pond, or Lake Cochituate, as it was afterward\n called, situated in the towns of Framingham, Natick, and Wyland, about twenty miles west from\n the city proper, was selected. In August of the next year ground was formally broken for the\n new works by John Quincy Adams and Josiali Quincy, Jr., and in 1848 the works was completed.\n But the growth of the city was so great that in less than twenty years the source was insufficient;,\n and the waters of Sudbury River have been made tributary, the city having been given the necessary\n authority in 1872.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c The extreme length of Lake Cochituate, in a direct line, is three and a half miles; and the\n breadth of the widest part is about 1800 feet, with a water surface of 800 acres at high-water mark.\n In addition to the supply in the lake, \u2018 Dug Pond,\u2019 containing 44| acres, and \u2018 Dudley Pond,\u2019 con-\n taining 81 acres, are connected with and form important tributaries to it. The whole circuit of the\n lake, measuring at its verge when within two feet of high-water mark, is about 16 miles; and the\n city owns an average width of five rods around it which is held free from taxation, also one and a\n quarter acres at the outlet of Dudley Pond: the whole line of the water-works extending from\n Lake Cochituate, and continuing through a brick aqueduct, iron pipes, and stone tunnel, 14\u00a3 miles,\n to a reservoir in Brookline of about 23 acres of water surface and 119,583,960 gallons capacity.\n The Brookline reservoir is a beautiful structure of irregular elliptical shape.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Another receiving reservoir \u2014 Chestnut Hill \u2014 is situated in the Brighton district a very extern\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0034/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 184, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 307}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0034/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 368, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 615}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0034/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 736, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1230}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0034/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2461}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0034/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4923}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0034/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/le/ad/in/gm/an/uf/ac/tu/00/un/se/_0/leadingmanufactu00unse_0/leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0034.jp2", "height": 4923, "width": 2945, "levels": 6, "size": 1221070}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"34\">\n<p>\n 42\n</p>\n<p>\n CITY OF BOSTON.\n</p>\n<p>\n sive and attractive work.

There are fifteen police divisions in the city, as follows:\n First, No. 209 Hanover Street; Second, No. 21 Court Square; Third, Joy Street; Fourth,\n No. 56 La Grange Street; Fifth, East Dedham Street; Sixth, Broadway, South Boston;\n Seventh, Paris Street, above Maverick Square, East Boston; Eighth, Commercial, corner\n Battery Street; Ninth, Dudley, corner Mt.

The Eighth Division includes\n the harbor and wharves, and has charge of the steamboat Protector, with its men and row-boats.\n</p>\n<p>\n There has been an effort made to establish the police under the Metropolitan system, and a bill\n to that effect was introduced into the last Legislature.\n</p>\n<p>\n Fire Department. \u2014The business enterprise and character of a city can be well tested by\n the protection that the corporation vouchsafes public and private property against destruction by\n fire. In this respect Boston is without a peer in the country, her fire department being thoroughly\n well-organized and equipped with the very superior facilities that modern science and skill have\n given to battle with this destructive element. In seeking a location for active business enterprise or\n the investment of capital in property, the fact that the location has superior advantages in a thor-\n oughly efficient fire department is of prime importance, and with the energetic tradesman or the\n prudent capitalist it ofttimes decides the query.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the credit of Boston, it was the first city to put into practical use the magnetic fire-alarm\n system. With Dr. William F. Channing of this city and Moses G. Farmer of Salem the idea\n originated; Dr. Channing in 1845, in a lecture before the Smithsonian Institute, Washington, hav-\n ing suggested the employment of the telegraph as a means of giving alarms of fire.

The second ship\n built was the Rebecca, of 60 tons, and her first voyage was to Narragansett Bay, to buy corn\n from the Indians. Subsequently she went to the Bermudas, bringing back potatoes, oranges, and\n limes. In 1641 trade was begun by Boston merchants with the \u201cIsle of Sable,\u201d the return cargoes\n consisting of walrus teeth and oil. During the next year considerable commerce wutli England\n sprang up, ten ships sailing from Boston laden with pipe-staves and other produce. A vessel\n .arrived from Madeira, bringing wine and sugar. In 1643 a trade with Fayal began, the pioneer\n ship being the Trial, of Boston. Her cargo consisted of pipe-staves and codfish, for which a\n good market was found. The ship returned with wine, sugar, and cotton. During the following\n year the people began to manufacture their own goods. Cotton brought from Barbadoes, and\n hemp and flax, were the raw material of these early manufacturers. The coastwise trade -was also\n \u25a0extended, vessels going to the Delaware to buy furs, and to New York to trade with the Dutch.\n A Spanish voyage of the ship Trial proved very successful, and greatly encouraged the Boston\n merchants of that early day. In 1645 eleven ships arrived from England, bringing linen, woollens,\n shoes and stockings, and other useful goods, and taking back for their return cargoes, wheat, rye,\n and peas. So early began the shipping of grain to the mother-country. The same year an at-\n tempt was made to bring slaves from Africa, but only two arrived at Boston. One of these\n negroes being sold here, the owner was compelled to deliver him up, \u201c that he might be returned to\n his native country.\u201d Ship-building thrived apace. The ship Seafort,\u2014 so named out of compli-\n ment to her strength,\u2014 of 400 tons, was built here, and so elegant was her ornamentation of carven\n wood, that she was for years pointed out as an instance of the splendid work done in Boston ship-\n yards. In 1660 began the attempts of England to restrict the commerce of the colonies: exporta-\n tions to America were forbidden except in English vessels navigated by Englishmen, and the\n colonists were required to send their products only to England; duties to be imposed on the pro-\n ductions of one another equal to the duties collected at English ports. But the Boston merchants\n and ship owners determined not to obey such tyrannical laws. Before the close of the seventeenth\n century our products were shipped to Portugal, Spain, and Madeira, as well as to the other colon-\n ists, the West Indies, and Great Britain, in exchange for the fruits, wines, and manufactures of\n those countries, and the construction of wharves on a systematic scale was begun\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1710 Long Wharf-a great undertaking in its time-was built. Ship-building continued to\n thrive. In 1714 there was at one time on the stocks here 40 topsail vessels, measuring altogether\n 7000 tons. Up to the period of the Revolution Boston continued to flourish commercially. There\n were 27 dock-yards here, and at one yard 12 ships were built in a single year. The conclusion of\n the Revolution found the merchants ready to renew their extensive commerce. A temporary\n check was met from too heavy importations, that glutted the market and occasioned some bad\n failures among merchants.\n</p>\n<p>\n The British, still jealous of our maritime importance as a nation, continued their illiberal\n legislation.

In the same year also the first Cunard steamship was put on for Boston, the Acadia, whose\n arrival in Boston Harbor was a great event. The line was maintained exclusively to Boston until\n 1848, when a line was also established in New York. About this time came the decline of Boston\u2019s\n commerce with China and the East generally, and its transfer to New York.

It was then freely predicted that New\n York would soon do all the importing of the country, and the croaker was abroad with the doleful\n cry that Boston had seen her best days. Vessels would not come to Boston except at high /sates of\n freight, because outward cargoes could not be obtained here. Those who did come were obliged\n to leave in ballast for other ports. In 1867 a strong effort was made to establish a direct line of\n American steamships to Liverpool; but though backed by large capital and experienced men it\n failed. The enterprise was abandoned and the vessels sold at a sacrifice. The Cunard line con-\n tinued its service during this period, but high freight rates were demanded, and the line was\n inadequate to develop the business of the city.

It was in the early part of this period that Thayer & Lincoln and Warren &\n Co. began to load steamships here. This work was one of immense difficulty: there were the\n prejudices of shippers to overcome and the co-operations of railways to secure. The change\n which has at last enabled Boston to become a great shipping-port has been brought about by the\n railway companies so reducing their rates as to successfully compete with the water-routes termi -\n nating at New York City. The securing of cotton from the South for light freights for the steam-\n ship lines was another important step forward. This was accomplished by offering low rates of\n freight, which diverted the cotton from New York. In 1870 the exports of cotton from Boston\n were valued at $135,000, and ten years later the value was raised to $7,268,000. Another important\n improvement is the system of through billing from interior points to Europe. These through bills\n given to shippers in the South and West are negotiable at the banks. The foreign commerce of\n the city in recent years has come to be fed by other railroad trunk-lines and through the Hoosac\n Tunnel; and Boston now holds direct communication with the great trunk-lines of the country,\n and possesses, through recent improvements, the best terminal facilities of any port on the coast.\n At the present time Boston occupies the position of the second port in the Union.\n</p>\n<p>\n REVERE HOUSE, BOWDOIN SQUARE.\n</p>\n<p>\n Street Improvements.\n</p>\n<p>\n A stranger landing in this city for the first time is at once impressed with the fact that the\n early citizens of Boston either had no regard for the future, or else gratified whims of street\n</p>\n<p>\n topography that appear entirely at variance with the\n common idea of the present. The streets of Boston,\n in the lower part, are in many instances narrow and\n crooked; but since the great fire even these were\n somewhat straightened, and, taken as a whole, the\n city has spacious thoroughfares. To the old resident\n of Boston the crooked streets have their uses, and\n with their \u201cshort-cuts\u201d are more than convenient in\n getting quickly from one point to another. The\n work of improving the streets has been gradually\n going along, and among the most noticeable instances\n of improvement in this direction may be mentioned the lengthening and widening of Washington\n Street; the building of Atlantic Avenue, along the water-front, at an expense of two and a half\n millions; the widening and straightening of the principal streets in the burnt district of the fire of\n 1872; and many handsome streets and avenues in the newer portion of the city, notably Common-\n wealth Avenue, in the wealthy Back Bay district.\n</p>\n<p>\n Boston, at an enormous expense, has added to her territory, taking in large water areas, and,\n by a system of judicious filling, brought into the market thousands of acres of available building\n sites, the most noticeable improvement being that portion of the city now known as the Back Bay\n district. This section is now the centre of the wealth and fashion of Boston, and has few equals\n in the country for handsome and stately residences.\n</p>\n<p>\n Before entering upon the subject of public parks and suburban towns, as the Back Bay\n improvement seems naturally to suggest, mention will be made of the city\u2019s financial and educa-\n tional institutions, places of amusement, etc.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0045/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 184, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 307}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0045/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 368, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 615}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0045/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 736, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1230}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0045/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2461}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0045/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2945, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4923}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:ad:in:gm:an:uf:ac:tu:00:un:se:_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0:leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0045/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/le/ad/in/gm/an/uf/ac/tu/00/un/se/_0/leadingmanufactu00unse_0/leadingmanufactu00unse_0_0045.jp2", "height": 4923, "width": 2945, "levels": 6, "size": 787941}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"45\">\n<p>\n CITY OF BOSTON.\n</p>\n<p>\n 53\n</p>\n<p>\n Banks and Savings Institutions.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Banks of Boston are very generally recognized as being thoroughly organized, and\n founded upon solid and substantial bases.

It is a recognized centre of learning, and throughout the private and public\n institutions devoted to this very important department of life there has been displayed a constant\n care and attention, a wise and liberal management, and a generous and intelligent expenditure of\n money. During the present year the Latin School celebrated its 250th anniversary of continued\n existence, and is probably the oldest public educational institution in the country. The public\n schools of the city are under the control and management of a School Committee, the offices being\n located on Mason Street. The Committee is composed of twenty-four members, and the Mayor\n President ex-officio. The term of service of eight of the members expires each year, while that of\n the Mayor continues during his term of office. In addition there is a Superintendent, Secretary,\n and six Supervisors. The schools are:\n</p>\n<p>\n Normal, Dartmouth Street, for girls. Estab-\n lished 1854.\n</p>\n<p>\n Latin, Warren Avenue, for boys. Est. 1635.\n</p>\n<p>\n Girls\u2019 Latin, West Newton Street.
