Abraham J. Feldman.\n November 27, 1921.\n</p>\n<p>\n Scripture Lesson: Genesis 11:18-24; Ruth I: 1-19.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the July number of the Atlantic Monthly there\n appeared an article from the pen of one Paul Scott Mowrer\n entitled The Assimilation of Israel. The author of the arti\u00ac\n cle, it appears, is the Paris representative of the Chicago\n Daily News. I know nothing of the -man\u2019s previous ac\u00ac\n quaintance with or knowledge of Jewish life, tradition or\n teaching. His article does not betray any such knowledge\n or. acquaintance. The article bears as a superscription, a\n biblical verse which seems to serve as the author\u2019s text\n and suggests his reasoning and argument. It is from the\n book of Esther and is Haman\u2019s charge: \u201cThere is a certain\n people scattered abroad and dispersed among the peoples\u2014\n and their laws are diverse from those of every people.\u201d\n And this is his argument.\n</p>\n<p>\n Anti-Semitism is growing by leaps and bounds. The\n Jew is hated and feared. He is attacked in all forums of\n public expression. Sentiment against him is growing. This\n Jew-hatred is no longer a matter to be ignored. It is not\n sporadic.

His wife was a Christian (Metho\u00ac\n dist), and a New York Rabbi married them. The woman is now\n expecting a child, and the man wanted me to advise him in what\n faith the expected child is to be reared. His wife never accepted\n Judaism. Her mother is a strict Methodist; his mother is a\n Jewess, and each wants the child reared in her respective faith.\n I have made inquiry of the New York Rabbi who married them,\n and he assures me that he never married a couple under such\n circumstances without getting the promise- of the alien party to\n rear the children in the Jewish faith, and to study (by himself\n or herself) some guide to Jewish instruction. He also tells me\n that they abjure their old faith in his presence and promise to\n cast their lot in with our people. He remembers marrying this\n couple and is certain that he exacted such a promise from this\n woman. (This Rabbi does not go through the formality of issu\u00ac\n ing a paper of conversion in the presence of witnesses.)\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI feel that I would not be justified in saying that the child\n should be reared as a Jew, if the mother is and intends to remain\n a Christian. It would be dividing the home, and the child would\n hardly be Jewish. It would be mockery and hypocrisy. On the\n other hand, how could I, a Jewish teacher, tell the parents to\n raise the child a Christian ? I feel, if the child is to be reared in\n our faith, that the mother must cease to be a Christian. If the\n child is to be reared in the Christian faith, the father cannot re\u00ac\n main a Jew without\u2014in later years\u2014taking the consequence of\n having children who would mock and scoff and deride him. If\n this is not a certainty, it is, to say the least, a possibility or a\n probability. Again, then, how can I, how dare I, advise this man\n who wants to remain a Jew (or he would not belong to a con\u00ac\n gregation and be a frequent attendant at services), to change his\n faith? I will, of course, urge the mother to become a Jewess.\n But if she refuses, what shall my advice be?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe Jewish law,\u201d Professor Kohler replied, \u201cdeclares that\n the child of a non-Jew has its character determined by the mother.\n The Christian wife of your member should, therefore, be per\u00ac\n suaded as far as possible, especially for the sake of the husband\n who wants to have a Jewish home, to become a Jewess in order\n to have her child born as a Jew. Of course, when raised as a\n Jew (in the event of the non-conversion of the mother), the\n child could afterward through Confirmation be adopted into the\n Jewish fold like any proselyte. On the other hand, it must be\n stated that the Rabbi who solemnized the marriage of a Jew to a\n non-Jewess did not act in conformity with the Jewish law. . . .\n Mixed marriages belong before the civil magistrate who is to\n give them legal sanction. The Jewish religion cannot consecrate\n a home divided by two different creeds, as you well state.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n I communicated this opinion to the husband, and when\n the child was born, a daughter, the Methodist branch of the\n household won the day.\n</p>\n<p>\n These, friends, are some of the factors that enter into\n the determination of the Jewish position on intermarriage.\n Those mentioned heretofore concerned primarily the lives\n of the contracting parties.

And although every lecturer and writer of\n the Society is careful to repeat what is tantamount to a\n dogma that he is voicing only his own opinions, and that\n these opinions are not to be saddled upon the Ethical Culture\n Societies, a careful reading and study of the opinions of\n most of them reveal a remarkable unanimity.\n</p>\n<p>\n I have read and studied the available literature on the\n subject, from Professor Felix Adler\u2019s magnum opus \u2014 \u201cAn\n Ethical Philosophy of Life\u201d through numerous pamphlets,\n addresses and articles, and their magazine, and I believe that\n I am justified in saying that insofar as the Ethical Culture\n Society assumes an attitude of superiority towards Judaism\n it has yet to prove its thesis, and to defend its attitude when\n measured by the facts and emphases of modern Judaism,\n particularly that \u201cLiberal Judaism\u201d which Dr. Neumann\n in this published address misunderstands or misrepresents.\n</p>\n<p>\n When a few years ago a leading American Rabbi char\u00ac\n acterized the Ethical Culture Society as \u201ca synagogue with\u00ac\n out God,\u201d Dr. Felix Adler\u2019s reply in the public press was,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:te:rm:ar:ri:ag:eo:th:00:fe:ld:intermarriageoth00feld:intermarriageoth00feld_0020/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 265}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:te:rm:ar:ri:ag:eo:th:00:fe:ld:intermarriageoth00feld:intermarriageoth00feld_0020/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 316, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 530}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:te:rm:ar:ri:ag:eo:th:00:fe:ld:intermarriageoth00feld:intermarriageoth00feld_0020/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 633, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:te:rm:ar:ri:ag:eo:th:00:fe:ld:intermarriageoth00feld:intermarriageoth00feld_0020/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1266, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2121}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:te:rm:ar:ri:ag:eo:th:00:fe:ld:intermarriageoth00feld:intermarriageoth00feld_0020/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2533, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4243}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:te:rm:ar:ri:ag:eo:th:00:fe:ld:intermarriageoth00feld:intermarriageoth00feld_0020/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/te/rm/ar/ri/ag/eo/th/00/fe/ld/intermarriageoth00feld/intermarriageoth00feld_0020.jp2", "height": 4243, "width": 2533, "levels": 6, "size": 587466}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"20\">\n<p>\n 14\n</p>\n<p>\n that the day has passed when there was need for the kind\n of discussion which the Rabbi\u2019s characterization challenged.\n That may be so.

There is much\n vagueness existing among Jews and non-Jews about the\n content of Judaism, its message and its hope. There is, too,\n much misinformation being spread broadcast concerning the\n Jew and Judaism. Most of it is so formulated as to be\u00ac\n guile the uninformed and the little-informed. A catchword,\n an attractive motto, a euphonious phrase is sounded, and\n many in Israel\u2019s ranks, many who crave the designations of\n \u201cmodern\u201d and \u201cliberal,\u201d readily \u201ctake it up\u201d\u2014I believe this\n is the current phrase\u2014with that zeal, that extreme fervor\n which are so characteristic of the high-strung Jew. I conceive\n it as the supreme function of a Jewish teacher to teach and\n to interpret Judaism, and the duty of the modern Jewish\n teacher it is to reinterpret in the light of the advancement\n and progress of a new day the ancient teachings of the Jew.\n It is his sacred duty to fortify his people whose teacher he is,\n to strenghten them in their convictions, to give to them the\n results of that training and study which are his life\u2019s work,\n and which the people, for reasons into which we need not\n enter now, do not or cannot receive elsewhere.\n</p>\n<p>\n Hence my choice of this particular theme for this morn\u00ac\n ing\u2019s instruction. My attitude is one of high regard for the\n sincere convictions of others. I have a profound respect\n for Professor Felix Adler, the founder and head of the\n Ethical Culture Society, and I pay here high and unstinting-\n tribute to his life of noble service, of idealism, of genuine\n achievement. There is no doubt but that the American com\u00ac\n munity is the better for hi*s life and the richer for his service.\n</p>\n<p>\n In paying this well-merited tribute, however, it does\n not necessarily follow that one therefore subscribes to Dr.\n Adler\u2019s opinions, or yields the right to examine them in the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:te:rm:ar:ri:ag:eo:th:00:fe:ld:intermarriageoth00feld:intermarriageoth00feld_0021/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:te:rm:ar:ri:ag:eo:th:00:fe:ld:intermarriageoth00feld:intermarriageoth00feld_0021/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 322, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 537}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:te:rm:ar:ri:ag:eo:th:00:fe:ld:intermarriageoth00feld:intermarriageoth00feld_0021/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 644, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1074}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:te:rm:ar:ri:ag:eo:th:00:fe:ld:intermarriageoth00feld:intermarriageoth00feld_0021/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1289, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2149}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:te:rm:ar:ri:ag:eo:th:00:fe:ld:intermarriageoth00feld:intermarriageoth00feld_0021/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2579, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4299}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:te:rm:ar:ri:ag:eo:th:00:fe:ld:intermarriageoth00feld:intermarriageoth00feld_0021/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/te/rm/ar/ri/ag/eo/th/00/fe/ld/intermarriageoth00feld/intermarriageoth00feld_0021.jp2", "height": 4299, "width": 2579, "levels": 6, "size": 507473}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"21\">\n<p>\n *5\n</p>\n<p>\n light of history and reason, and to differ from him.

Jewish literature, pro\u00ac\n phetic and rabbinic, Jewish teachers through the ages, re\u00ac\n fute emphatically the charge that virtue for virtue\u2019s sake,\n duty for its own sake is alien to Jewish teaching. \u201cBe not\n like servants who serve their master for the sake of reward;\n be rather like unto those who serve without the expectation\n of reward,\u201d is sound Jewish teaching, and reveals a concep\u00ac\n tion of Duty which has nothing to equal it in the teachings\n of Church or Mosque or Ethical Culture Society. \u201cDuty\n carries its own reward,\u201d is another of the teachings of the\n Jew.

In a universe\n based on Law, immutable, unchangeable Law, prayer,\n we are told, can mean nothing.

All\n these are forms of prayer. Ethical Culture, however, is con\u00ac\n cerned only with that religion which will appeal to the in\u00ac\n tellect, to the mind, forgetting that if man has a mind, so\n has he also a heart, and emotions, and instincts. And these\n latter are as important as, yea, more important, methinks,\n than the former.\n</p>\n<p>\n And, finally, another objection to Judaism made by Dr.\n Neumann and Professor Adler, an objection which it seems\n they do not find to Ethical Culture, is the idea that Israel\n considers itself a chosen people. To be sure, it is admitted\n by them that\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018\u2018the thought of Israel as chosen has its noble meanings, too\u2014for\n instance that Israel was selected to win from its sorrows the light\n whereby all earth might walk.

Criticism is disturbing\n to the man who chooses merely to sit. Criticism may cause\n him to think. No cause and no organization that is true to\n its purpose, no movement that is really a movement, that is\n not static, that grows, and wishes and desires to grow, re\u00ac\n jects criticism;\u2014it welcomes criticism, in fact.\n</p>\n<p>\n Criticism is wholesome. Criticism is stimulating.\n Truly, \u201cour antagonist is our helper.\u201d And although critic\u00ac\n ism it at times painful and unpalatable, it is generally help\u00ac\n ful and beneficial in its results.\n</p>\n<p>\n But there are two kinds of criticism. There is the\n criticism that is born of hatred and malice, and its purpose is\n to injure and to slay; and there is another kind of criticism;\n it is the criticism of a friend, the criticism of one who so\n loves a cause, is so concerned about the cause being as worthy\n as possible that he will invoke criticism in order to improve\n it, in order to strengthen it, in order to have it true and\n worthy.

It is nothing new; and while,\n in its modern organized expression as a definitive, positive\n movement, it is recent, the idea of reform in Judaism is\n over twenty-six hundred years old. We find the beginnings\n of conscious reform in Judaism with the Book of Deu\u00ac\n teronomy, when that book was found, according to the\n account in the Book of Kings, about seven hundred years\n before the present era. There we find the beginnings of\n reform in Judaism, and like a golden thread we can trace\n the growth and development of Reform Judaism through\n all of the subsequent ages of Jewish history.\n</p>\n<p>\n There has always been a struggle in Judaism between\n liberalism and rationalism, on the one hand, and tradition\u00ac\n alism on the other. Traditionalism, not tradition; I dis\u00ac\n tinguish between the two. Reform was always deeply\n rooted in the Jewish tradition, and it claimed the right to\n interpret Jewish tradition in the light and knowledge and\n experience of successive generations. But it was ever\n opposed to Traditionalism, to a worship of tradition merely\n because it was of the past, and the struggle between ration\u00ac\n alism or liberalism or reform\u2014call it what you will\u2014and\n Traditionalism continued through the ages of Jewish history.\n And we note this remarkable fact: that whenever there was\n liberty, whenever there was freedom given to the Jew,\n whenever there was civic and political opportunity given\n to the Jew, liberalism gained the upper hand; but no sooner\n were there persecution and oppression, than the Jew found\n it necessary as a means of self-defense to draw himself into\n his own seclusion, there to remain until the dawn of a\n brighter day, and at such times Traditionalism gained the up\u00ac\n per hand. And it is quite natural for one who is persecuted\n and hounded, when the present is dark and the future holds\n out no hope, to turn to the past, there to try to find hope\n and consolation and strength and cheer.

It came\n to build, not to destroy; to construct, not to tear down. And\n it interpreted Judaism in terms of life rather than in terms\n of customs and observances and ceremonies. They took out\n of the Talmud all that could be of value in the\n new day and age, and found renewed inspiration in the pro\u00ac\n phetic idealism of the Bible which Orthodoxy neglected,\n and gave an ethical rather than ritualistic emphasis to\n Jewish life.

I,\n for one, see in Mark Sabre a type of man, but for whom,\n life today would still be at the low level of barbarism and\n on the plane of the uncivilized. I see in Mark Sabre a\n type of that company of souls truly brave of whom evolv\u00ac\n ing History has a growing roster, a type of them who dared\n to be true to themselves, who nobly dared to dream in a\n world of ^wrealties, and having dreamed had the supreme\n courage to guide their lives by the glow of their stirring\n ideals. I see in Mark Sabre one who is of that company of\n the aristocrats of the Ideal, who, in the face of crushing\n conventions, in the face of antiquated standards of conduct,\n standards false, and unworthy as they are false, dare to\n take their idealism seriously and strive to live by those\n high standards.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is not the weak man, the spineless creature that\n guides his life by his ideal. It is the strong of heart, the\n heroic of soul, the clean and honest of purpose, that is the\n true hero in the strife of life. Not he the weakling who\n accepts martyrdom rather than yield one jot or tittle of his\n principle. Not he the weakling who dares to be true to\n himself, and to his convictions. Rather is he the coward\n who, professing an ideal, compromises in the face of diffi\u00ac\n culty, flinches in the face of obstacles, and supinely yields\n for the sake of the material comforts, the conveniences, the\n things of the body, the considerations of prosperity, and\n the opinion and adulations of the thoughtless crowd.\n \u201cSacred courage,\u201d says Emerson somewhere, \u201cindicates\n that a man loves an idea better than all things in the world;\n that he is aiming neither at self nor comfort, but will ven\u00ac\n ture all to put in act the invisible thought of his mind.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n An instance of such courage and devotion came to my\n notice recently.

The mob also\n passed with the corpse by the Temple just as I was preaching. You\n may well imagine the disturbance and excitement. It was done, so\n I am assured, by the most representative members of this town\u2019s\n aristocracy. The challenge was too strong for me not to take it\n up, and naturally enough, I am now looking for another pulpit.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:te:rm:ar:ri:ag:eo:th:00:fe:ld:intermarriageoth00feld:intermarriageoth00feld_0060/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 153, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 265}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:te:rm:ar:ri:ag:eo:th:00:fe:ld:intermarriageoth00feld:intermarriageoth00feld_0060/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 307, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 530}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:te:rm:ar:ri:ag:eo:th:00:fe:ld:intermarriageoth00feld:intermarriageoth00feld_0060/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 614, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:te:rm:ar:ri:ag:eo:th:00:fe:ld:intermarriageoth00feld:intermarriageoth00feld_0060/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1229, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2121}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:te:rm:ar:ri:ag:eo:th:00:fe:ld:intermarriageoth00feld:intermarriageoth00feld_0060/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2458, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4243}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:te:rm:ar:ri:ag:eo:th:00:fe:ld:intermarriageoth00feld:intermarriageoth00feld_0060/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/te/rm/ar/ri/ag/eo/th/00/fe/ld/intermarriageoth00feld/intermarriageoth00feld_0060.jp2", "height": 4243, "width": 2458, "levels": 6, "size": 624070}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"60\">\n<p>\n 54\n</p>\n<p>\n It was a challenge; a challenge to the honesty of the\n teacher.

One\n thinks of Girolamo Savonarola, of Florence, inveighing\n mightily against the sins and misdeeds of his age, and of his\n choice of martyrdom in preference to becoming untrue to\n himself!
