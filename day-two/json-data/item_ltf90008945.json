His attention was called up\n to consider this very interesting question through the means of\n sermons received lroin the Old World, particularly some able\n discourses from the pen and pulpit of English preachers,\n clergymen of the Church of England. McNeile, Bickersteth,\n Melvill, and some others, have written and preached with great\n force on this subject, while the Dissenters generally have been\n opposed to the doctrine, and have looked at it only, or chiefly,\n with a view to resist it, and put it down. At the time of the\n writer\u2019s embracing these views, he was not aware that any in\n this New World had paid the least attention to the subject.\n And what is most astounding, the Christian public have dis\u00ac\n covered very little interest in the Doctrine, however distinctly\n proclaimed, while the proclaimers have said little or nothing\n about The Time. Really, the professors of Christ\u2019s holy\n religion seemed to be proof against all impression arising from\n the mere assertion of the truth itself; but as soon as his\n coming speedily\u2014his being at the very door, was declared,\n men began to be uneasy; and when 1843 was announced, the\n whole matter of the Advent began to be clearly apprehended.\n Then \u201c there were great searchings of heart;\u201d then men began\n to be in trouble. O the depravity and deceitfulness of the\n human heart! While the Judgment of the Great Dav is yet\n considered in the obscurity of distance, \u201c for many days to\n come\u2014for times that are afar off,\u201d men can bear the prophecy.\n \u201cA little more sleep, a little more slumber.\u201d But no sooner is\n the cry, \u201cBehold, the Bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet\n him,\u201d than the world is up in arms\u2014the church too ! Alas,\n the blood-bought sons of Zion will not endure the tidings:\u2014-\n the church will do anything rather than prepare for the im\u00ac\n mediate coming of her Lord: she will bestir herself anew,\n and set about the conversion of the world afresh, rather than\n admit the possibility of her Lord\u2019s coming without delay.\n Though I may not be satisfied with the announced date of\n 1843 as the year of the Lord, yet if our learned chronologists\n can make it appear that our Time Table is 157 years behind\n H eaven\u2019s Dial, then I shall be persuaded to believe that\n A. D. 1843 will close the sixth millenary; and then, upon this\n system, the following year, A. D. 1844, the seventh millenary\n will commence, and so the coming of the Lord may be ex\u00ac\n pected, early in the first Sabbatic year; on what day or at\n what hour who shall presume to say !\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:pe:ar:in:gk:in:gd:om:00:sa:bi:appearingkingdom00sabi:appearingkingdom00sabi_0004/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 234, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 383}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:pe:ar:in:gk:in:gd:om:00:sa:bi:appearingkingdom00sabi:appearingkingdom00sabi_0004/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 469, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 766}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:pe:ar:in:gk:in:gd:om:00:sa:bi:appearingkingdom00sabi:appearingkingdom00sabi_0004/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 939, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1532}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:pe:ar:in:gk:in:gd:om:00:sa:bi:appearingkingdom00sabi:appearingkingdom00sabi_0004/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1879, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:pe:ar:in:gk:in:gd:om:00:sa:bi:appearingkingdom00sabi:appearingkingdom00sabi_0004/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ap/pe/ar/in/gk/in/gd/om/00/sa/bi/appearingkingdom00sabi/appearingkingdom00sabi_0004.jp2", "height": 3065, "width": 1879, "levels": 6, "size": 400431}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"4\">\n<p>\n POSTSCRIPT.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWhile the Bridegroom tarried they all slumbered and\n slept.\u201d Such is the state of the whole ehurch, as a body, at\n this present time; both the wise and the unwise: and if such\n be the condition with the professed followers of Christ, how\n much more may it be expected that the world,\u2014\u201c the world\n which lieth in wickedness,\u201d should be totally indifferent to\n this all-important subject.

It maybe\n asked whether the ministers of Christ, who fulfil the ordinary\n and positive duties of their calling, can be justified in stepping\n over the line of their appointed path in order to increase the\n influence of their labors and render such labors more salutary\n and successful: I say this may admit of a question. But here\n is a case which no ordinary duties of a pastor and teacher,\n however well and faithfully those duties may be performed,\n can reach.

Or if\n the regular means of ministration be denied him, may he\n not be excused, if not justified, in going into more general\n measures?

Th*e church, the accredited house\u00ac\n hold of faith, will not hear! Those who have been formally\n invited will not hear! They go one to his farm, another to his\n merchandise. He may go, therefore, out into the highway,\n into the streets and lanes of the city, and as many as he finds\n bid to the wedding!

The first prom\u00ac\n ise was to man, to the man who first sinned,\n to him and to his posterity, even to as many\n as should believe. This covenant of the\n woman\u2019s seed was confirmed, in the line of\n Seth, from Adam to Noah, and from Noah\n to Abraham. When this covenant was\n confirmed to Abraham, and to his descend\u00ac\n ants, there was in the promise more than\n a little which pertained to an earthly inher\u00ac\n itance, a particular and defined country, the\n land of Canaan. This promise runs along,\n and from time to time is afresh confirmed\n with additional pledges, royal domains and\n a line of kings. To David especially, this\n promise is made, and that in reference to a\n King of his lineage, who is to be the Sover\u00ac\n eign of the world, as well as king of Israel.\n Thus the coming and power of this \u201c Great\n King,\u201d are foreseen and celebrated all through\n the books of the prophets. Hence we are\n led to see that the hope of Israel was dis\u00ac\n tinctly fixed upon a king of the house of\n David, whose throne was to be established\n in Jerusalem. It was, however, in the expec\u00ac\n tation of every true Israelite, to be a king\n reigning in righteousness, establishing truth\n and justice in the earth.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:pe:ar:in:gk:in:gd:om:00:sa:bi:appearingkingdom00sabi:appearingkingdom00sabi_0055/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 227, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 389}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:pe:ar:in:gk:in:gd:om:00:sa:bi:appearingkingdom00sabi:appearingkingdom00sabi_0055/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 455, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 778}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:pe:ar:in:gk:in:gd:om:00:sa:bi:appearingkingdom00sabi:appearingkingdom00sabi_0055/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 911, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1556}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:pe:ar:in:gk:in:gd:om:00:sa:bi:appearingkingdom00sabi:appearingkingdom00sabi_0055/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1822, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3112}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:pe:ar:in:gk:in:gd:om:00:sa:bi:appearingkingdom00sabi:appearingkingdom00sabi_0055/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ap/pe/ar/in/gk/in/gd/om/00/sa/bi/appearingkingdom00sabi/appearingkingdom00sabi_0055.jp2", "height": 3112, "width": 1822, "levels": 6, "size": 320700}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"55\">\n<p>\n OF OUR LORD.\n</p>\n<p>\n 55\n</p>\n<p>\n This hope of Israel was never relinquished\n nor denied by the apostles of Jesus; when\n they went out and preached Christ crucified,\n and offered him to the world as a Saviour\n to save mankind from their sins, they never\n blinked the question of the kingdom, nor the\n title of their Master to royal dignity, as heir\n to the throne of David.
