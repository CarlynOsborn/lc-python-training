The Freedmen\u2019s Bureau also began to\n make liberal grants for the erection of school buildings for the use\n of the Freedmen, and thus the resources at the command of the\n Association were greatly increased. Its receipts from all sources ran\n up from $47,828 in 1861 to $253,045 in 1866, and $420,769 in 1870.\n</p>\n<p>\n But in the South there was growing discontent, culminating in\n the reign of terror under the infamous Ku-Klux Klans\u2014the\n Thugs of America. The colored people were often assaulted by\n mobs, dragged from their homes at midnight, and shot down in\n the streets. Our missionaries and teachers were to some extent\n the objects of embittered hate and ruffianly threats, but God\n mercifully protected them and made them moral supporters of\n their flocks and schools. There was no want of courage on their\n part to enter or remain in the field ; the number of teachers,\n which was 320 in 1865, was enlarged to 528 in 1867, and 532 in\n 1868, and 533 in 1870!\n</p>\n<p>\n PERMANENT EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was during this very period that the beginnings were made\n for most of our permanent educational institutions. The call was\n imperative. The vast numbers of the colored people indicated\n that they must become largely their own educators ; the astonish\u00ac\n ing progress of the pupils proved that they were capable of it.\n Hence the policy of the Association began to take definite shape ;\n it must train the teachers and preachers for this people. Its teach\u00ac\n ers were accordingly withdrawn from the primary schools in great\n measure, and graded and normal schools, colleges, incipient uni\u00ac\n versities and theological classes were established\u2014the design being\n to plant a school of high grade in each of the principal cities or\n centres of population, and one college or university in each of the\n large Southern States. The increased resources of the Associa\u00ac\n tion enabled it to begin the work, and both the resources and the\n work have been largely supplemented by the energy of Gen.

When\n the prison doors of the slaves were opened its attention was\n largely concentrated upon the blacks, both because they were so\n needy and so accessible. But the Association never lost its sense\n of responsibility to the whites. The Mountain Region of the Cen\u00ac\n tral South presented a promising opening for reaching them. It\n embraces southwestern Virginia, southeastern Kentucky, western\n North Carolina, eastern- Tennessee, and portions of northern\n Georgia and northern Alabama. It is 500 miles long and 200\n miles wide, and contains a population of about 2,000,000, seven-\n eighths of whom are white. Berea College had already in a por\u00ac\n tion of that region won the victory over all caste distinctions on\n account of race or color, and the way was open for the Association\n to enter that field. At length the fit man was found to inaugurate\n the work. Rev. A. A. Myers organized a church in Williams\u00ac\n burg, Ky., in 1881, among the mountains of that beautiful State.\n By his indomitable energy and his great skill in securing the co-op\u00ac\n eration of the people, he moved them to aid him in putting up a\n commodious house of worship. The town was sixty years old,\n and this was the first church edifice brought to completion, three\n others having rotted down, unfihished. The next year a building\n was erected for an Academy, and the school was opened. The\n members of the church and the pupils of the school were white,\n there being very few colored people in the county. The color\n question was tested, and after a struggle similar to that which\n Berea had encountered, the result sustained the right of the\n colored race to equal privileges in church and school. Churches,\n preaching stations or schools have been established along or near\n the lines of railroads traversing the mountain districts of Ken\u00ac\n tucky and Tennessee, and sweeping nearly across both States : in\n Kentucky at Williamsburg, South Williamsburg, Pleasant View,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0014/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 270}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0014/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 540}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0014/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1081}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0014/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2163}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0014/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2542, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4327}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0014/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fa/me/ri/ca/00/am/er/_1/historyofamerica00amer_1/historyofamerica00amer_1_0014.jp2", "height": 4327, "width": 2542, "levels": 6, "size": 538958}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"14\">\n<p>\n 12\n</p>\n<p>\n HISTORY OF THE\n</p>\n<p>\n Rockhold, Lynn Camp, Liberty, Mahan Station, Dowlais, Saxton\n -and Grey Hawk ; in Tennessee at Robbins, Hellenwood, Jellico,\n Pomona, Grand View arid Pleasant Hill.

The beginnings made by the Western Evangelical Mis\u00ac\n sionary Society and transmitted to it were enlarged and extended,\n until in 1852 it had 21 missionaries stationed among the Indians of\n the Northwest. Various causes conspired to the gradual diminu\u00ac\n tion of these missions, and in 1859 they* were abandoned. The\n supreme demand of the newly-emancipated slaves soon afterward\n -claimed, and almost of necessity, for the time absorbed, the care\n and strength of the Association.\n</p>\n<p>\n GENERAL GRANT\u2019S PEACE POLICY.\n</p>\n<p>\n One feature of General Grant\u2019s excellent Peace Policy adopted\n in 1870, was the attempt to secure honest and capable Indian\n agents. To this end he invited the religious and missionary bodies\n to nominate the agents.

At the Annual Meet\u00ac\n ing of 1873 ^ was voted to confine the foreign mission work of the\n Association to Africa. This was done at once, except in re\u00ac\n gard to the missions in Jamaica, where local reasons deferred\n the completion of the arrangement for a time. The mission in\n Africa was much weakened by sickness and death, and in 1877 the\n new policy of sending colored missionaries thither from our schools\n in the South, was inaugurated with a success that was modified\n only by the want of experience and maturity of character in the\n young missionaries. Up to the time of the transfer fourteen such\n missionaries had been sent to Africa. In 1879 the gift of $15,000\n by Mr. Robert Arthington, of Leeds, England, supplemented by\n other donations from Great Britain and America, encouraged the\n Association to undertake a mission on the Upper Nile Basin, in\n Africa. In 1881 Rev. Henry M. Ladd and E. E. Snow, M.D.,\n made an exploration in the locality designated by Mr. Arthington ;\n but the fanatical war of the Mahdi broke out while they were\n there, and they narrowly escaped with their lives. Under the\n agreement with the American Board and in view of the troubled\n condition of that region, the Association arranged with the donors\n to withdraw from the proposed mission, and it holds the funds in\n readiness to be turned over to any missionary society that has the\n faith and experience to carry it forward, under the approval of Mr.\n Arthington and the British donors. We trust the time maybe near\n at hand when the work may be begun with the prospect of success,\n under the Divine blessing.\n</p>\n<p>\n In making the exchange, the American Board, having under\u00ac\n taken recently a new mission on the western coast of Africa, de\u00ac\n clined to take our Mendi Mission. Hence to the satisfaction of all\n parties this mission was transferred to the United Brethren in Christ,\n a body of Christians who have long had a mission contiguous to it\n and between whose missionaries and ours the relations have always\n been of the most harmonious and fraternal character. With the\n mission the Association also transferred to the United Brethren\n for five years the avails of about $100,000, the gift of the late Rev.\n Charles Avery, and also the use of the steamer John Brown, built\n for the Mendi mission. At the expiration of the five years, the\n Mendi Mission is to remain in the hands of the United Brethren,\n but the avails of the Avery fund are to be given to the American\n Board for the benefit of its missions in Africa.

S. V. Blakeslee, under the auspices of the\n Association, undertook to reach and save these heathen strangers on\n a plan substantially the same as that which in later years is proving '\n its wisdom by its success\u2014that is, to take advantage of their desire\n to learn the English languageto introduce them to the knowledge of\n the Scriptures, instead of requiring their teachers to learn Chinese.\n But Mr. Blakeslee, finding that the Presbyterians were already on\n the ground, and were prepared to occupy it with special facilities,\n at length resigned, and the field was fraternally yielded to them.\n As, however, the number of Chinese immigrants increased, and as\n they were exposed to the same persecution as that endured by the\n other colored races in this country, the Association resumed its work\n among them. In 1870 Rev. John Kimball was appointed Superin\u00ac\n tendent, assisted by a local \u201c Advisory Board.\u201d He had under his\n care that year 5 teachers. After carrying on the work successfully\n for four years, he resigned, and the present efficient Superintendent,\n Rev. W. C. Pond, pastor of the Bethany Church, San Francisco,\n was appointed to the position. In 1875 a new impulse was given\n to the work by the organization of the \u201c California Chinese Mis\u00ac\n sion,\u201d in connection with the General Association of California, and\n as an auxiliary to the American Missionary Association. It secures\n some funds in aid of the work, and its officers are the valuable\n counselors of the Superintendent.\n</p>\n<p>\n The last annual report (1885) gives the number of teachers 34\n and schools 18, located at Alameda, Alturas, Fresno, Marysville,\n Oakland, Oroville, Petaluma, Sacramento, San Diego, Santa Bar\u00ac\n bara, Santa Cruz, Stockton, Tulare, and five in San Francisco.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Mission has been greatly blessed in turning these strangers\n from their idolatry to the worship of the true God. It is now\n undergoing the severe strain of not only overcoming the depravity\n of the heathen heart, but of that depravity aggravated by the\n bitter persecution that comes from the hands of nominal Chris\u00ac\n tians.\n</p>\n<p>\n The converted Chinamen have long desired the establishment\n of missions in their native country, to which, if they should return\n thither, they might resort as a Christian home, and from which\n they might go forth for mission work among their countrymen.-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0019/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 270}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0019/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 540}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0019/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1081}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0019/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2163}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0019/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2542, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4327}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0019/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fa/me/ri/ca/00/am/er/_1/historyofamerica00amer_1/historyofamerica00amer_1_0019.jp2", "height": 4327, "width": 2542, "levels": 6, "size": 569691}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"19\">\n<p>\n AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION. 17\n</p>\n<p>\n As the Association has withdrawn from missions abroad, it is\n gratifying to state that the American Board in 1882 founded such\n a mission at Hong Kong, to which the brethren of the \u201c Chinese\n Christian Association \u201d contributed $700 at the outset.\n</p>\n<p>\n BUREAU OF WOMAN\u2019S WORK.\n</p>\n<p>\n When, in 1861, the Association entered upon its large mission\n field in the South, the help of Christian women became necessary.\n As teachers and missionaries they have done a great share of the\n work among the Negroes, and as in each succeeding year hun\u00ac\n dreds of these brave women went out from the churches, a wide\u00ac\n spread interest was felt in their self-denying labors, leading to\n the organization of sewing circles and freedmen\u2019s aid societies. But\n the work of uplifting was found to be a slower process than that of\n emancipating, and enthusiasm waned. Frequent appeals were\n therefore made for the aid of Christian women of the North, and\n in 1873 a form of constitution was prepared for the organization\n in the churches of women\u2019s societies auxiliary to the Association.\n</p>\n<p>\n At the Annual Meeting of the Association in 1874, the ladies\n held a conference upon the best methods of co-operation. Fre\u00ac\n quent reports of woman\u2019s work were made in our monthly mag\u00ac\n azine, and in 1877 there began specific work on the part of the\n ladies in the churches for the support of special lady missionaries.\n At the Annual Meeting in 1878 the Association added to its pro\u00ac\n gramme a woman\u2019s meeting, at which ladies from the South gave\n reports of the condition of the field. During the next few years\n marked progress was made in the special effort for the support of\n lady missionaries, and missionary operations were enlarged by\n more direct effort for women among the blacks, for the mountain\n people of the South, and by the adoption of the Indian field. A\n corresponding growth of interest was manifested in the North.\n</p>\n<p>\n The work at length assumed such proportions as to call for a\n special department, and experience and knowledge of the field\n made it evident that this department could be best utilized by\n forming it not outside, but within the direct control of the Asso \u00ac\n ciation, thus adjusting it fully to our established methods.\n Accordingly in 1883 the Bureau of Womans Work was formed.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0020/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 270}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0020/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 540}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0020/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1081}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0020/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2163}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0020/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2542, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4327}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0020/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fa/me/ri/ca/00/am/er/_1/historyofamerica00amer_1/historyofamerica00amer_1_0020.jp2", "height": 4327, "width": 2542, "levels": 6, "size": 570089}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"20\">\n<p>\n i8\n</p>\n<p>\n HISTORY OF THE\n</p>\n<p>\n This Bureau inaugurated no new organization. It simply gave\n a more direct and efficient form to a large work already in hand,\n and added no increase of machinery and but little expense.\n</p>\n<p>\n The object of the Bureau is to present truthfully the condition\n of the women for whom the Association labors, and to solicit\n woman\u2019s aid in their behalf, urging a cash contribution from the\n women of every Congregational Church as well as the usual help\n of the needle. Accordingly a system of monthly letters from the\n missionary teachers in the field was planned, and a proposition\n was made to women at the North to take a definite part in sustain\u00ac\n ing these field workers, in sums ranging from $20 each to the\n amount of full support, the ladies thus contributing to have their\n special missionary from whom they should hear regularly.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Results.\u2014 During the past year (1885) the ladies of the\n Congregational churches have sustained the following schools and\n teachers :\n</p>\n<p>\n For the Negroes: One school in McIntosh, Ga., 3 teachers ; one\n school in Thomasville, Ga., 3 teachers ; 3 missionary teachers in\n Texas, 2 in Mississippi, 3 in Georgia, 2 in Alabama, 3 in Tennessee,\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 in Louisiana, 1 in North Carolina.\n</p>\n<p>\n For the Mountain Whites: 2 missionary teachers in Tennessee,\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 in Kentucky.\n</p>\n<p>\n For the Indians: 3 missionary teachers in Nebraska ; 3 in Dakota.\n</p>\n<p>\n An interesting feature of the work of this Bureau has been the\n securing of the help of the freedwomen for those more needy than\n themselves. It was proposed to them to aid in the support of a\n missionary to the Indians at Fort Berthold, Dak. The response\n was prompt and hearty, the Ladies\u2019 Missionary Association of\n Alabama alone pledging $100. One little mission band of colored\n women pledged a share of $20, and paid it in installments of $2 per\n month, the money being earned at the washtub or by -other hard\n work, and needed in their own families for what we would deem\n the necessaries of life. But it was a revelation to many of them\n that in our own country there was any people as needy as them\u00ac\n selves and in greater spiritual darkness.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Woman\u2019s Bureau has proved an effective agency in all our\n work, opening new channels for the missionary activity of the women\n of the North, imparting direct information, assigning special fields,\n and strengthening the bond between the missionaries and the\n churches.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0021/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 270}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0021/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 540}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0021/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1081}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0021/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2163}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0021/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2542, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4327}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fa:me:ri:ca:00:am:er:_1:historyofamerica00amer_1:historyofamerica00amer_1_0021/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fa/me/ri/ca/00/am/er/_1/historyofamerica00amer_1/historyofamerica00amer_1_0021.jp2", "height": 4327, "width": 2542, "levels": 6, "size": 554114}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"21\">\n<p>\n AMERICAN MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION.\n</p>\n<p>\n 19\n</p>\n<p>\n FINANCES.\n</p>\n<p>\n The income of the Association was small at first. None of the\n large denominations of Christians indorsed it, and few of the\n churches had it on the list for regular contributions. Its donors\n were mainly individuals,of strong anti-slavery convictions. The\n influences which gradually produced the increase of its resources\n were the growth of the anti-slavery sentiment and the increased\n demand for mission work that should lend no sanction to slavery ;\n the emancipation of the slaves and the call for a large effort for\n their enlightenment ; a renewed zeal for African evangelization ;\n an interest in the Indians and Chinamen on the Pacific coast ; and\n the opening avenues for work among the white people of the\n South. Special agencies assisted in gathering the results which\n these influences produced.\n</p>\n<p>\n Marked by decades, the statement may thus be summarized :\n</p>\n<p>\n First, Decade, 1847-1856. The receipts for the first year were\n $r3,\u00b033, rising somewhat steadily to $49,818 in the last year.\n Several auxiliary societies formed in different parts of the country\n aided in collecting funds.\n</p>\n<p>\n Second Decade, 1857-1866. The first seven years showed\n little advance in receipts, but the closing years witnessed a decided\n increase. Beginning with $47,190 in 1857, the figures sprang up\n to $95,395 in 1864, to $134,181 in 1865 and to $253,045 in 1866,\n the year after the war. The aid of the Free-Will Baptists, the\n Wesleyans, the Congregationalists in this country and friends in\n Great Britain, contributed to this increase.\n</p>\n<p>\n Third Decade, 1867-1876. This was a marked era in the\n financial history of the Association, showing in the first five years\n a great enlargement of income, reaching $420,769 in 1870, fol\u00ac\n lowed by a growing indebtedness and a diminished income. The\n debt touched its highest point, $96,559, in 1875, and the income in\n 1876 was only $264,709.\n</p>\n<p>\n The sources of the increased receipts in the first five years were\n the same that yielded so largely in the closing years of the last\n decade, and in addition to them were the large gifts of the Freed-\n men\u2019s Bureau and the ingatherings of the Jubilee Singers.\n</p>\n<p>\n The debt is traceable in part to the nature of the heavy receipts\n of the first five years. Those coming from the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau\n could be expended only in buildings (/. e., in new plant).
