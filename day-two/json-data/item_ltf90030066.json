India,\n i nder the name of Tarshish , was known in the days of Solomon,\n and celebrated as the land of spices, gold, and precious stones ;\n but, whether it be the Tarshish of the ancients or not, it has for\n a long time been justly regarded with great interest. Here, vast\n and powerful empires have successively sprung up and flourished,\n while Europe was in a state of barbarism. Long before Chris-\n tianity shed its light upon the world, India was the land of science\n and the arts. At the present time, however, its prominent char-\n acteristics are ignorance, poverty, and superstition.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is not my purpose to direct your attention to the whole of\n India, but only to that portion of it usually denominated Hindu-\n stan, or India within the Ganges. This is a large peninsula, pro-\n jecting into the Indian Ocean, south-west of the Chinese Empire,\n from which it is separated by the Himalaya Mountains. With a\n territory about as large as Mexico, it is supposed to contain a pop-\n ulation of one hundred and thirty millions, or more inhabitants\n than England, Scotland, Ireland, Russia, and the continent of\n America.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Hindus are of various dissimilar races, differing materially\n in stature, complexion, manners, language, and general character\n The Rajpoots and mountaineers of the north are large and of great\n muscular strength, while the inhabitants farther south are gener-\n ally of small stature and of slender form. In complexion, they\n vary from a dark olive approaching to black, to a light, transparent,\n beautiful brown, resembling that of the natives of Northern Italy.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0050/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0050/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0050/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0050/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0050/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0050/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0050.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 616411}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"50\">\n<p>\n 4G\n</p>\n<p>\n LECTURES ON INDIA.\n</p>\n<p>\n They are very fond of ornaments, such as rings in the ears and\n nose, with bracelets on the arms and ankles ; ye\u2019t their dress is ex-\n ceedingly simple. See Engravings, Nos. 20 and 22.\n</p>\n<p>\n The dress of the male consists of two pieces of cotton cloth, each\n containing about two yards. The one, called the dhotee , is girt\n about the loins and extends to the ankles. The other, called the\n chadder , is worn over the shoulders. The dress of the female is\n called a saree, and consists of a sihgle piece of cloth of from four\n to seven yards. One end of this piece is wrapped around the\n loins, the width reaching to the feet ; the other is gracefully\n thrown around the shoulders. In some parts of the country, it\n also covers the head. The children wear no clothing until they\n are from live to eight years of age ; but they are frequently deco >\n rated with ornaments and jewels of considerable value.\n</p>\n<p>\n The food of this people, with but few exceptions, is vegetable\n The use of animal food is denied them by their religion, unless\n the animals be first sacrificed to some idol. At their meals, they\n use neither tables, chairs, knives, forks, nor spoons. They sit upon\n the floor, and put the food into the mouth with the fingers of the\n right hand. They take their drink from a brass cup, which they\n never touch with the lips, but pour the liquid into the mouth.\n Fermented and distilled liquors are used only by the lowest castes :\n but the use of tobacco is almost universal, and here, as elsewhere\n nas a most pernicious influence. Many of both sexes chew betel\n a drug more filthy, if possible, than tobacco itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n Most of the Hindu dwellings are rude huts, See Engraving,\n Number 20. The usual size is about eighteen feet long and twelve\n wide. The walls are built of mud, and the roof is thatched with\n straw or with the leaves of the palm. In cities, however, and in\n large villages, to prevent damage by fire, tiles are used instead of\n thatch. The cost of such dwellings varies from five to twenty\n dollars, according to the size and manner of finish. About one\n house in a thousand is built of durable materials, such as brick or\n stone. In cities they may be found from two to four stories high.\n These have flat roofs, and are built around a court or open space\n in the centre. In some houses, the court is very large, and is dec-\n orated with fountains, trees, and flowering shrubs. Most of the\n windows open into the court. As Hindu dwellings have few or\n no windows towards the street, they appear very much like prisons ;\n and, in some respects, they are prisons ; for within their walls\n the females are incarcerated for life.

Should a\n Hindu be asked why he conducts in this manner at the time of\n the Huli, he would say, \u201c It is our custom, and it can be proved\n from the Shasters that it has been the custom of our forefathers\n for millions of generations.\u201d To the mind of a Hindu, whatever\n is customary is proper ; for he believes that the customs of his\n forefathers, civil, social, and religious, were instituted by the gods,\n and are therefore incapable of improvement. The effect of this\n belief is to keep every thing stationary. There is no progress in\n knowledge \u2014 no change for the better in any department in life.\n The fashion of dress, the form of agricultural and mechanical in-\n struments, the manner of erecting habitations, and the performance\n of various kinds of labor, are the same as they were thousands of\n years ago. This fact may be illustrated by an anecdote. An\n English gentleman devised various plans of introducing improve-\n ments ; among others, he wished to substitute wheelbarrows for\n the baskets in which the natives carry burdens on their heads.\n He caused several of these useful articles to be constructed, and\n labored with much assiduity to introduce them among his work-\n men. In his presence, they used them with apparent cheerfulness,\n and even admitted that they were far preferable to the baskets.\n The gentleman was delighted with his success. On one occasion,\n however, having been absent a few hours, on returning somewhat\n unexpectedly, he was surprised to find all his laborers carrying\n the wheelbarrows filled with earth on their heads.\n</p>\n<p>\n Their unyielding attachment to ancient customs is the natural\n result of their religious belief. Any change, however slight, in\n the mode of labor or business, is a violation of religious duty.\n It is evident, therefore, that the comforts and improvements of\n civilized life can never be introduced among the Hindus until they\n become convinced of the falsity of their Shasters and the foolish-\n ness of their traditions. The first step in the process of reform\n and improvement is to renounce that system of religion which for\n thousands of years has held them in the most cruel bondage.\n</p>\n<p>\n The subject of engraving, No. 26 is beautifully sculptured on\n the surface of a large rock in the Ganges, and is also frequently\n represented by the Hindus in their paintings. An enormous ser-\n pent, having many heads, is coiled up in such a manner as to form\n a couch, upon which a Hindu divinity is sleeping. Tt illustrates a\n familiar legend in their Shasters.

Having formed the world anew and\n created many of the gods, he proceeded to create man, when the\n tour classes or castes into which the Hindus are divided issued from\n different parts of his body : the Brahmins from his head, the Kshu-\n tryus from his arms, the Voishnus from his breast, while the\n Shudras had their ignoble origin in his feet ; agreeably to which\n legend, the Brahmins are supposed to be entitled to a very high\n rank, while the Shudras are hardly regarded as human beings.\n These four classes have, from various causes, been divided into\n more than two hundred distinct castes. If one of high caste vio-\n late the rules of his community, he cannot receive an honorable\n dismission, and enter a lower caste, but is forever excluded from\n all respectable society ; repentance and reformation have no ten-\n dency to restore him. One of low caste, though ever so learned,\n wise, or virtuous, can make no approximation to a higher caste.\n The distance between the Shudra, the lowest caste, and the\n Brahmin, is immeasurably great ; the Brahmin cannot even instruct\n the Shudra, but with the greatest precaution, lest he should be\n defiled. But, low as the Shudra is, he has an honorable standing\n in society when compared with the Parriahs, a race who are not\n regarded as having any caste. They, when walking in the street,\n must keep on the side opposite the sun, lest their filthy shadows\n should fall upon the consecrated Brahmin. It is not uncommon\n to see the lower castes prostrating themselves as worshippers at\n the feet of the Brahmin, and greedily drinking the water which he\n lias condescended to sanctify by the immersion of his great toe.\n</p>\n<p>\n The pernicious influence of caste is strikingly illustrated by an\n incident related to me by Rev. Mr. Day, a missionary at Madras.\n As he was riding through a native village, he saw a woman .ying\n by the side of the street, apparently in the agonies of death ; she\n had lain there about twenty-four hours, and, during all this time,\n the villagers had been constantly passing and re passing, without\n manifesting the least interest or sympathy. When Mr. Day asked\n them why they thus neglected this woman, and suffered her to lie\n there and die, they replied, \u201c Why should we take care of her ? She\n does not belong to our caste.\u201d A little rice-water, it appears, had\n been offered her, but she would not drink it, simply because the per-\n son offering it belonged to a lower caste.

Thus she would\n necessarily become an outcast and a vagabond.\n</p>\n<p>\n In most of the large houses in India, there is an apartment which\n serves as a family chapel. Engraving, No. 27 represents such an\n apartment in a very elegantly-finished house in the city of Benares.\n In the farther part of the chapel is the altar or shrine on which the\n idols are placed. Each member of the family is expected to offer\n up his devotions to these idols every morning and evening.\n</p>\n<p>\n According to their own standard, the Hindus are preeminently\n a religious people. The number of their gods, as stated in their\n Shasters, is three hundred and thirty millions. These fabled gods\n are not represented as acting in concert ; they fight and quarrel with\n each other, and with their wives and children, murder the innocent\n for the sake of plunder, and commit crimes, the bare recital of which\n to a Christian audience would excite the utmost horror and disgust.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is generally admitted, that neither nations nor individuals aim\n at greater purity of morals than their religion requires. We may\n expect to find any community below, rather than above this stand-\n ard. This is true in regard to the Hindus. Their gods and god-\n desses being extremely vicious, the manner in which they are\n worshipped must correspond with their character; it cannot be\n expected that the moral character of the people should be other\n than it is, a compound of every thing that is debasing. Gross\n and polluted as their divinities are, they are yet too refined and\n elevated, in their estimation, to be worshipped without imagery.\n Images are made in forms as various, unnatural, and horrid, as the\n imagination can conceive. When one of them is consecrated by\n the Brahmin, the divinity for whom it is designed is supposed to\n take up his abode in it, and is propitious or unpropitious accord-\n ing to the manner in which it is worshipped.\n</p>\n<p>\n The goddess Kali, (See Number 29) is represented as a woman\n of a dark blue color, with four arms, in the act of trampling under\n her feet her prostrate and supplicating husband.

It would be quite\n inconsistent with their religious principles, to rob any person until\n he is first deprived of life by strangulation. They affirm that this\n system was instituted by Kali, and is consequently of divine\n origin ; that, for many thousands of years, she assisted them in\n escaping detection, by devouring the dead bodies of their victims ;\n but, on a certain occasion, a Thug, contrary to her command,\n looked back to see how she disposed of the corpses, and saw her\n feasting on them. This circumstance so offended her, that she\n declared she would no longer devour those whom they murdered*\n They believe, however, that she still continues to assist them, and\n that she directs their movements by certain omens. When, there-\n fore, they are about to commence their excursions, in order to pro-\n pitiate the favor of Kali, they sacrifice a sheep, by cutting off its\n nead, upon which the priest pours water and repeats the following\n prayer : \u201c Great Goddess ! Universal Mother ! If this our medi-\n tated expedition is fitting in thy sight, vouchsafe us thine help\n and the signs of thy approbation.\u201d While repeating this invoca-\n tion, they watch the head of the victim ; if they observe tremu-\n lous or convulsive motions in the mouth and nostrils, it is to them\n the sign that Kali approves their expedition.

In 1826, the East\n India Company adopted measures to suppress this system of whole-\n sale murder. Since that time, between iwo and three thousand\n Thugs have been arrested, tried, and convicted. Two hundred\n and six were convicted at a single session of the court.

It is devoted to the worship of Kali, and is situated at\n Kali Ghat, three miles from Calcutta. The small building on the\n left, and the other on the right, are temples of Shiva.\n</p>\n<p>\n In Calcutta, the missionaries have established several schools,\n which are in a flourishing condition. The one under the super-\n intendence of Rev. Dr. Duff is attended by more than a thou-\n sand young men, belonging to the most respectable families in\n the city. Kali Prasanna Mukarje, one of the young men edu-\n cated at the mission schools, is a \u201c Kulin Brahmin of the highest\n caste, and, on his mother\u2019s side, is a Holdar Brahmin. The Hol-\n dars are the original proprietors of Kali Ghat, and the hereditary\n officiating priests of the temple, to whom all the offerings at this\n shrine of idolatry belong. Kali Prasanna is heir to his mother\u2019s\n property, being her only son ; he is also heir to his uncle, who is\n a Zemindar, and one of the proprietors of the temple of Kali ; and,\n by marriage, he is heir to his father-in-law\u2019s property. He is\n thus the only male representative of three ancient and highly-\n respectable families, and, by inheritance, would have been the prin-\n cipal proprietor of Kali Ghat and the high priest of the temple.\u201d\n Besides what he was to inherit, he possessed property to the\n amount of about one hundred thousand dollars. He was fully\n aware that, should he become a Christian, he would, by the laws\n of his country, not only be deprived of his property, but would be\n despised by hia countrymen, forsaken by his relatives, and regarded\n as an outcast. Yet he gave up all, was baptized, and became a\n member of one of the mission churches. At various missionary\n stations which I visited were several other Brahmins, who had\n forfeited their title to large estates by becoming Christians.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0067/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0067/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0067/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0067/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0067/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0067/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0067.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 831365}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"67\">\n<p>\n No. 28.

It is an image of Shiva, who, according to\n Hindu mythology, is the husband of Kali. He has eight arms and\n three eyes, one of which is in the centre of his forehead. The ser-\n pent with which he is decorated is rearing its head over his right\n shoulder. With one foot he is crushing an enemy in the act of\n drawing a sword ; with two of his hands he is tossing a human\n victim on the points of a trident ; in a third he holds a drum, in a\n fourth an axe, in a fifth a sword, in a sixth a portion of the Vedas,\n and in a seventh a club, on the end of which is a human head.\n</p>\n<p>\n The figure on the right was copied from a sculpture on the\n wall of a temple at Gaya. It has four legs, sixteen arms, and\n seven heads. Its girdle and crown are ornamented with heads.\n In each hand it has an animal on a plate, as if dressed for food.\n It is dancing on four men\u2019s bodies, two prostrated and two ready\n to be crushed. Above, beneath, and on each side, were armed\n female furies dancing on human carcasses ; but these are not\n copied into the engraving. By the inhabitants of Gaya, this image\n is called Mahamaya , another name for Kali; but it is a male,\n and, perhaps, was originally intended to represent her husband,\n Shiva.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the month of April, a festival in honor of Shiva is celebrated\n in almost every town and village. One of these festivals I wit-\n nessed in Calcutta. On the first day, at sunset, the worshippers\n assembled at different places, and danced, to the sound of drums\n and other rude and noisy music, before an image of Shiva. Then,\n one after another, they were suspended from a beam, with the\n head downward, over a fire. The next day, about five o\u2019clock\n in the afternoon, each company reassembled and erected a stage\n about ten feet in height, from which they threw themselves upon\n large knives. The knives being placed in a sloping position,\n the greater part of the thousands that fall upon them escape un-\n hurt ; but occasionally an individual is cruelly mangled. About\n forty persons threw themselves from one stage. None but the\n last appeared to receive much injury. He pretended to be killed,\n and was carried off with great shouting. During the whole of\n the night, Calcutta resounded with the sound of gongs, drums,\n trumpets, and the boisterous shouts of the worshippers. Early\n the next morning, forty or fifty thousand persons were assembled\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0070/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0070/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0070/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0070/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0070/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0070/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0070.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 633750}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"70\">\n<p>\n 66\n</p>\n<p>\n LECTURES ON INDIA.\n</p>\n<p>\n on the adjoining plain. Processions, accompanied by music, were\n passing and repassing in every direction. In the processions\n many persons were daubed over with the sacred ashes of cows '\n ordure. Hundreds of these were inflicting self-torture. In one\n procession, I saw ten persons, each with more than a hundred\n iron pins inserted in the flesh. In another, each devotee had a\n cluster of artificial serpents fastened with iron pins to his naked\n back. In other processions, many had the left arm perforated, for\n the insertion of rods from five to fifteen feet in length. These\n rods were kept in constant and quick motion through the flesh, to\n increase the pain. Some had their tongues pierced, for the inser-\n tion of similar rods, which were occasionally drawn rapidly up\n and down through the tongue. One man, having a rod fifteen\n feet long, and, at the largest end, nearly one inch in diameter,\n commencing with the smaller end, drew the whole rod through\n his tongue. After wiping the blood from it upon his garment, he\n thrust it again into his tongue. Others were drawing living ser-\n pents through their tongues and dancing around like maniacs.\n In the streets through which the processions passed were devotees,\n with their sides pierced ; a rope passed through each incision, and\n the ends of the two ropes were fastened to four stakes driven into\n the earth. In this condition, the infatuated creatures dance back-\n ward and forward, drawing the ropes, at each movebient, through\n their lacerated flesh. On the afternoon of the next day, swinging\n machines were erected at the places of concourse. They con-\n sisted of a perpendicular post, about twenty-five feet high, upon\n the top of which was a transverse beam, balanced on its centre,\n and turning on a pivot. A rope was attached to one end of this\n beam, by which the other cou.d be elevated or depressed at\n pleasure. From this end, many of the worshippers were sus-\n pended by iron hooks inserted into the muscular parts of their\n backs. I have in my possession a pair of hooks which have been\n used for that purpose. These hooks I saw thrust into a man\u2019s\n naked back. The rope attached to them was made fast to the\n beam of the machine, by which he was lifted up twenty-five or\n thirty feet from the earth.

It is\n surrounded by a high mound, composed wholly of the fragments\n of earthen bottles. On one of the last days of February, from\n twenty to forty thousand pilgrims assemble, each being provided\n with two or three earthen bottles, containing water from the\n Ganges, and a few copper coins. Such is the offering they make\n to Shiva ; and, believing him to be greatly pleased with the act,\n they dash and break the bottles against the temple. The next\n day, the Brahmins, faithful and true to Shiva, do not forget to\n pick up the money, and, as the trustees of the idol, keep it for\n him. That the temple may not be buried beneath the fragments\n of this novel offering, and that no com may escape their vigilance,\n they also have the broken bottles removed to a short distance,\n where they had accumulated to the extent here represented. It\n cannot be difficult to understand why this peculiar mode of wor-\n ship was invented by the Brahmins. It may also- serve as an il-\n lustration of the manner in which they take advantage of the\n credulity of the people and secure a large amount of property.\n</p>\n<p>\n The two figures in engraving 83 are portraits of individuals\n whom I had the opportunity of frequently seeing. The one on\n the left is the portrait of a religious mendicant. The number of\n mendicants in India amounts to many hundreds of thousands.\n As a religious duty, they forsake their families and friends, re-\n nounce every useful occupation, and wander from place to place,\n begging their food. They are literally clothed with filth and\n rags ; the latter, in many instances, being less in quantity than\n the former. Some of them are decorated with large quantities of\n false hair, strings of human bones, and artificial snakes. Others\n carry a human skull containing a most filthy mixture. If no\n money or food be given them by those persons of whom they so-\n licit alms, they profess to eat the filth out of the skull, as an act\n of revenge. One sect of them, professing to be extremely anxious\n to avoid destroying animal life, carry a broom, composed of soft\n cotton threads, gently to sweep the insects from their path. They\n aiso erect hospitals for the reception of aged, sick, and lame ani-\n mals. There is an institution of this kind in the vicinity of\n Bombay, which, in 1840, contained from fifty to one hundred\n horses, one hundred and seventy-five oxen and cows, and two\n hundred dogs, beside cats, monkeys, and reptues. ft has been said\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0074/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0074/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0074/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0074/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0074/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0074/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0074.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 607807}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"74\">\n<p>\n 70\n</p>\n<p>\n LECTURES ON INDIA.\n</p>\n<p>\n that paganism never erected a hospital ; but this is not quite\n true.

For\n seven years he had been a religious mendicant. At length he\n read a Christian tract entitled \u201c A Precept to the Inhabitants of\n this Part of the World, by the Missionaries.\u201d \u201c By studying it,\u201d\n said he, \u201c I found there was a great difference between the notions\n I had imbibed and the virtuous precepts contained in that book ;\n I plainly saw that my former way was all deception, and that this\n book pointed out a better.\u201d He embraced that better way, and is\n now a preacher of the gospel.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many religious mendicants subject themselves to various modes\n of self-torture.

In\n order to secure a livelihood, as well as a large stock of religious\n merit, he turned devotee.

Under a wretched shed on the bank of the Ganges,\n he had been standing, day and night, for eight years. He had\n nothing to lean against but a piece of bamboo suspended by cords\n from the roof of his shed. His dress was a ragged woollen blanket\n saturated with filth. His face was smeared with the sacred ashes,\n his body greatly emaciated, while his fee-t and legs were so drop-\n sical and swollen as to require bandages to prevent their bursting,\n Sometimes he slept as he stood, but generally he was awake and\n busily employed in his devotions. In his right hand he held a\n string of wooden beads contained in a red bag. Hour after hour\n he repeated the names of the gods, and at each repetition passed a\n bead between his thumb and finger. Occasionally he laid aside\n his beads, and with his finger wrote, on a board covered with\n ashes, \u2666he names of the idol gods upon whom he depended for\n happiness in a future life, as the reward of his self-inflicted mis-\n eries. In this manner he had spent the last eight years of his\n life. I asked him how long he intended to stand there. His re-\n ply was, \u201cUntil Gunga calls for me,\u201d \u2014 meaning until death,\n when his body would be thrown into the River Gunga or Ganges.\n</p>\n<p>\n On one occasion, I saw a devotee performing a pilgrimage to\n the Ganges in a manner somewhat peculiar. He prostrated\n himself at full length upon the ground, and, stretching forward\n his hands, laid down a small stone ; he then struck his head three\n times against the earth, arose, walked to the stone, and, picking\n it up, again prostrated himself, as before; and thus continued to\n measure the road with his body. I was told by a missionary at\n Benares, that he had recently seen a devotee prostrating himseli\n every six feet of the way towards the temple of Juggernaut, from\n which he was then four hundred miles distant, and that he was\n accompanied on his pilgrimage by a poor cripple, who, unable to\n walk, was crawling along on his hands and knees. Another dev-\n otee has been rolling upon the earth for the last nine years. He\n has undertaken to roll from Benares to Cape Comorin, a distance\n of one thousand five hundred miles, and more than half of the\n journey he has accomplished.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0078/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0078/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0078/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0078/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0078/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0078/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0078.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 650676}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"78\">\n<p>\n 74\n</p>\n<p>\n LECTURES ON INDIA.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is universally believed by the Hindus, that, if a man perform\n a pilgrimage, or swing upon hooks, or torture himself in any other\n manner, he will be rewarded for it, either in this life or in a future\n state of existence. No matter what the motive of the devotee\n may be ; if he perform the service, he must receive the reward.\n As an illustration of this delusive theory, permit me to relate an\n anecdote from their sacred books.\n</p>\n<p>\n Narayan is the name of a Hindu god. A certain man, notori-\n ously wicked, having a son of that name, was laid upon a sick-\n bevl. In the hour of death, being parched with a fever, he called\n upon his son to give him water. The son being disobedient, the\n father called again in anger, and expired. The messengers of\n Yumu, the god of the infernal regions, immediately seized him, and\n would have dragged him to the place of torment, but they were\n prevented by the servants of Narayan, who took him by force and\n carried him to heaven. The messengers of Yumu, in great rage,\n hastened to their master and told him what had transpired. Y umu\n ordered his recordef to examine his books. He did so, and found\n that the man in question was a great sinner. Yumu then repaired\n n person to Narayan and demanded an explanation. Narayan\n made this reply: \u201cHowever sinful the man has been, in his last\n moments, and with his last breath, he repeated my name ; and\n you, Yumu, ought to know that, if any man, either by design or\n accident, either in anger or derision, repeats my name with his\n last breath, he must go to heaven.\u201d The doctrine of this fable is\n literally and universally believed by the people. Hence, when a\n person is in the agonies of death, his friends exhort him to repeat\n the names of the gods ; and, if he is so fortunate as to die with\n one of these names upon his lips, they consider it a sure passport\n to heaven. Many spend a large portion of their time in repeating\n the names of gods. Parrots are taught to do the same ; and such\n a spokesman commands a great price, especially among business\n men, who imagine that, by owning such a parrot, their spiritual\n treasures are accumulating while they attend to their usual occu-\n pations.\n</p>\n<p>\n The opposite engraving, No. 34, is a view in Benares, the holy\n city of the Hindus. It is situated upon the River Ganges, about\n eight hunared miles from its mouth, and, with a population of two\n hundred thousand, is estimated to contain one thousand temples.\n Benares is not only celebrated for the number of its temples, and\n the benefits they are supposed to confer, but for the learning and\n sanctity of its Brahmins, for its schools of science and the arts\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0079/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0079/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0079/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0079/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0079/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0079/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0079.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 865355}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"79\">\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n No. 33.

The Hindus say that the indignant idol,\n to escape the impious hands of the Mohammedans, while tearing\n down the temple, threw itself into a neighboring well. This cir-\n cumstance rendered the water very holy and purifying. The\n well is in a spacious and beautiful pavilion, as represented near\n the centre of the engraving. It is built of stone, and consists of a\n roof supported by four rows of columns. On the left of the pa-\n vilion are three temples of a pyramidical form. The one in the cen-\n tre is esteemed the most holy temple in Benares, because it contains\n the celebrated idol which concealed itself in the well. The Brah-\n mins who officiate at this temple are also esteemed very holy. I\n will relate a few incidents illustrative of their character. They\n discovered that an aged pilgrim, who came there to worship, had a\n large sum of money about him. They told him that, if he would\n give them his money, and then, in the presence of the idol, cut his\n throat, the idol would immediately restore him to the vigor and\n freshness of youth. The deluded man believed them. He gave\n up all his money, entered the temple, called on the name of Shiva,\n and then cut his throat from ear to ear. Rev. Mr. Smith, who de-\n scribed to me this horrid transaction, saw him welteiing in his\n blood. Mr. Smith also stated that, soon after he commenced his mis-\n sionary labors in Benares, the Brahmins murdered a celebrated dan-\n cing girl in this temple, for the sake of the jewels which decorated\n her person. To prevent discovery, they cut off her head and threw\n it into the Ganges. T1 ey then cut her body into small pieces\n and strewed them about the streets, to be eaten by the dogs and\n vultures.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are more than eight thousand religious mendicants in\n this city who li~e on charity.

They are readily distinguished by their\n long hair and beards, which are never trimmed or cleansed, and\n also by their dress, which is neither more comely nor substantial\n than that which was in fashion before garments were made by\n sewing together fig-leaves. These reputed gods sometimes come\n in contact with men who have not attained to their state of per-\n fection. Some years since, Mr. Bird, an English magist. ate ol\n Benares, seeing a Purumhunse in his yard, ordered him to be gone,\n and threatened to horsewhip him. if he ever saw him there again.\n A few days afterwards he came again, and found that Mr. Bird\n was faithful to his promise. The natives, who came running from\n every direction, were greatly enraged that an unholy foreigner\n should chastise one of their gods. Whatever power the whip may\n have had in exciting the wrath of this human god, still he did not\n dare to manifest it ; for, had he uttered a single angry word, he\n would have lost all claim to perfection and divinity. He therefore\n said, with much apparent coolness and unconcern, \u201c It is all right,\n it is perfectly right ; for I recollect that, in a former birth, this\n magistrate was my donkey. I used to ride him beyond his\n strength, whip and abuse him, and now I am justly suffering for\n the sins thus committed.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Engraving, No. 36 illustrates a custom which prevails in the\n northern part of Bengal. I allude to a species of infanticide.\n When an infant declines in health, the mother imagines that it is\n under the influence of an evil spirit, to appease whose wrath, she\n places her child in a basket and suspends it from the branch of a\n tree in which evil spirits are supposed to reside. The infant is\n generally visited and fed by its mother for three days. If it be\n not devoured by ants nor birds of prey, nor die through exposure to\n the cold and the rain, it is afterwards taken home. In the vicinity\n of Malda, an infant thus exposed fell from its basket and wa? im-\n mediately seized by a prowling jackal. Fortunately, the Rev.\n Mr. Thomas happened to pass that way just in time to prevent\n the child from being devoured. He had the satisfaction of pre-\n senting it alive to its mother. On another occasion, as he was\n passing under the same tree, he found a basket suspended from\n its branches containing the skeleton of an infant, the flesh having\n been devoured by the white ants.\n</p>\n<p>\n Among the Jerejas, a fierce and warlike tribe, who live m the\n north-west part of Hindustan, great numbers of female infants are\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":

At the time of sacrifice, the victim is tied to a post ;\n the sacrifices with an axe in his hand, slowly advances towards\n him, chanting to the goddess and her train the following hymn,\n which has been translated for me by Rev.

part of\n Asia, is frequently arrested by splendid edifices, and occasionally\n by large cities, long since deserted by their inhabitants. They\n were built by the Mohammedans, who, about the year one thou-\n sand, invaded India, and, by a long series of the most ferocious\n and cruel wars, established the great Mogul empire. This vast\n empire, and other extensive countries in Asia, have, within the\n last hundred years, been annexed to the British dominions.\n</p>\n<p>\n Delhi, the residence of the Mogul emperors, is supposed to have\n been founded about three hundred years before the Christian era.\n In the course of a few centuries, it became the largest and most\n magnificent city in India. In 1398, Tamerlane, having\n slaughtered great numbers of the unoffending Hindus in battle,\n and murdered one hundred thousand who had surrendered as\n prisoners of war, besieged Delhi. The city surrendered, was\n pillaged and almost destroyed. Delhi, however, not only recov-\n ered from this calamity, but attained to still greater splendor and\n magnificence than at any former period. In 1739, in the height\n of its prosperity, and when its population was estimated at two\n millions, it was taken by Nadir Shah.

The choultry of Rajah Trimal Naig, at\n Madura, (see engraving, number 40) consists of one vast hall,\n three hundred and twelve feet long and one hundred and twenty-\n five wide. The ceiling is supported by six rows of columns\n twenty-five feet high. The entire edifice is composed of a\n hard, gray granite, and every part of its surface is elaborately\n carved into representations of cows, monkeys, tigers, lions, ele-\n phants, men, women, giants, gods, and monsters.\n</p>\n<p>\n Choultries generally have but one apartment, and are entirely\n destitute of furniture of every kind. The ground, beaten hard,\n and covered with lime cement, serves as a floor, which, at night,\n is strewed with travellers of all classes and of both sexes, wrapped\n separately in their various-colored cotton cloths, and lying side\n by side like so many bales of merchandise in a warehouse. As\n choultries are much of the time unoccupied, they become the\n favorite resort of bats, monkeys, rats, and serpents. Of these\n troublesome creatures, the rats are the most annoying, for, while\n the travellers are asleep, they eat the skin from the soles of their\n feet, so as often to make it difficult for them to walk for some\n days afterwards. \u201cI was awoke, and astonished, one night,\u201d\n says a missionary, \u201c by something tugging at my ear. It was a\n rat. The moment I stirred, my visitant made good his retreat ;\n had my sleep been more sound, I should probably have suffered\n severely.\u201d At another time, as he was sleeping in a choultry, he was\n awoke by the cry of \u201c Pambu ! pambu ! \u201d \u2014 \u201cA serpent ! a serpent ! \u201d\n His bearers were on the alert ; \u2014 the serpent had passed between\n them and himself without biting any one. Having ascertained\n that it was not the cobra, which their superstitious reverence\n will not allow them to destroy, they killed it, and found it was a\n species of viper whose bite is fatal. The cobra, and various\n other reptiles, receive religious homage. Inanimate objects are\n also deified. Of this numerous class of divinities is the Ganges.\n The Shasters, which are regarded with as much reverence by the\n Hindu as the Bible is by the Christian, contain these passages: \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIf a person has been guilty of killing cows* or Brahmins,\n only le* him touch the water of the Ganges, desiring the remis-\n</p>\n<p>\n * See page 247.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0095/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0095/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0095/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0095/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0095/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0095/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0095.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 835498}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"95\">\n<p>\n No. 39.

The Rev. Mr. Thompson, a Baptist missionary, informed\n me that, on one occasion, he saw more than three hundred thou-\n sand pilgrims assembled at Hurd war, to bathe at the place where\n Brahma, the creator of the world, is said to have performed his\n ablutions. At two o\u2019clock in the morning, when it was announced\n by the Brahmins that the propitious time for the ceremony had\n arrived, the immense multitude rushed down a flight of steps into\n the Ganges. Those who first entered the water and bathed,\n attempted to return, but the passage continued to be wedged up\n with the dense mass of those who were still descending. There\n were, indeed, other passages by which they might have returned,\n but that would not do ; it was not the custom. To return by\n another way would diminish the merit of the bathing. They\n endeavored, therefore, to force their way upward. Consequently\n a scene of great violence took place, which resulted in the death\n of six hundred persons.\n</p>\n<p>\n Engraving, No. 41 is a view of the junction of the Ganges and\n Jumna. It is believed that every person, of either sex, who,\n immediately after being shaved, bathes at the point of land where\n those two rivers unite, will be permitted to dwell in heaven as\n many years as the number of hairs removed by the razor. To\n obtain immediate admission there, many thousands of the pil-\n grims have drowned themselves here.\n</p>\n<p>\n The strip of land extending from the point at the junction of\n the rivers to the Fort of Allahabad, on thp light of the engraving,\n is a desolate waste; but during an annual festival, which I\n witnessed here, it was crowded with tents, and huts, and more\n than one hundred thousand pilgrims. On entering this vast en-\n campment, I saw several missionaries, who, in a small shed by\n the wayside, were preaching the gospel and distributing tracts.\n A little beyond was the bazaar, or market, where food and various\n kinds of merchandise were exposed for sale.

I also witnessed a very shrewd method\n of getting rid of sin. The person who wished to become per-\n fect took in his right hand some money and a few blades of\n a particular grass, esteemed sacred. Then, with the same hand,\n he grasped the tail of a cow, while a Brahmin poured on it some\n water from the Ganges and repeated an incantation. The money,\n as a matter of course, was given to the Brahmin, the sins were\n reputed to pass along the tail of the animal, the grass and the\n deception remained to the pilgrim.

which\n sometimes happens, they become outcasts. Their nearest rela-\n tives will neither eat with them nor show them the smallest\n favor. They are held in utter abhorrence, and are allowed to\n associate only with persons in similar circumstances. I have\n seen a large village, inhabited entirely by these wretched beings.\n</p>\n<p>\n Great numbers of the dead are thrown into the Ganges, that\n their souls may be purified. It has been officially stated that, in\n the course of one month, more than a thousand human bodies\n have been seen floating on the surface of the Ganges, in the im-\n mediate vicinity of Calcutta. At that place, and as far as its\n waters are agitated by the tide, it contains so much earthy matter\n and other impurities, that no object can be seen at the distance of\n two inches below its surface. Yet the inhabitants of the city use\n the water of this river for drinking and culinary purposes, and\n the numerous merchant vessels trading there are supplied with it\n for the homeward voyage.\n</p>\n<p>\n Pilgrims carry water from the Ganges into every part of India,\n to be used for religious and medicinal purposes. It is put up in\n glass bottles. These are packed in baskets, and suspended from\n the ends of a bamboo which rests upon the pilgrim\u2019s shoulder. I\n have frequently seen the roads thronged with pilgrims thus ac-\n coutred. They resembled an immense army on the march.\n You will see one of them by turning to the next page of engravings.\n He has stopped by the wayside, near Balasore, to worship cer-\n tain stones, an accurate representation of which you see in the\n engraving. There are his baskets filled with bottles of Ganges\n water. Having made his salam , he mutters a few words\n in a careless manner, and then takes a bottle of water from one\n of his baskets, and pours a small quantity of it upon the stones.\n To appease the wrath, or to procure the favor of divinities like\n these, splendid festivals are instituted. About ten o\u2019clock at\n night, the worshippers assemble. By the glare of flaming torches,\n and amid the shouts and loud peals of barbarous music, great\n numbers of swine, sheep, goats, and buffaloes, are sacrificed\n Many of the worshippers throw themselves upon the ground, and\n wallow in the pools of warm blood flowing from the slaughtered\n animals. Then, leaping upon their feet, reeking with gore and\n filth, they jump and frolic, and twist themselves into the most\n wanton attitudes, and vociferate the most indecent songs, for the\n gratification of the image, or the rough stone before which these\n acts of worship are performed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0102/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0102/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0102/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0102/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0102/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0102/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0102.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 613672}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"102\">\n<p>\n 98\n</p>\n<p>\n LECTURES ON INDIA.\n</p>\n<p>\n Number 44 is a scene in the house of a wealthy native, at the\n celebration of a festival in honor of Ganesa, the god of wisdom.\n Ganesa is represented as a very corpulent man, of a red color,\n with four arms, and the head of a white elephant. In front of\n him is a rat, upon the back of which he is said to perform his\n journeys. The men on the right are musicians. For the grati-\n fication of the idol, and the multitude of assembled worshippers,\n a dancing girl is performing. She is clad in garments of the\n finest texture, and of the most brilliant colors, and is decorated\n with a profusion of costly ornaments. Her movements are slow\n and monotonous, and occasionally very indecent, and her songs\n are plentifully spiced with amorous allusions. After singing and\n dancing for some hours, her place is supplied, either by others of\n the same class, or by playactors, jugglers, or mountebanks ; and\n the performance is thus continued from ten o\u2019clock till sunrise.\n Many of the dancing girls belong to the temples, and are called\n the wives of the gods. At an early age they are united in wed-\n lock to the images worshipped in the temples. This strange\n matrimonial connection is formed in compliance with the wishes\n of the parents, who believe it to be a highly meritorious act\n to present a beautiful daughter, in marriage, to a senseless\n idol, and thus doom her to a life of vice and infamy. Dancing is\n deemed so disreputable by the Hindus that none engage in it\n but the most dissolute and abandoned. Here, as in other coun-\n tries, there appears to be an intimate connection between dancing\n and licentiousness.\n</p>\n<p>\n The following is one of the songs, which, at religious festivals,\n are sung for the amusement of the idols and their worshippers.\n The boy mentioned in the first line is Krishna, the favorite\n divinity, who married sixteen thousand wives.

The principal edifice\n rises to the elevation of two hundred feet. In the two adjacent\n buildings, morning and evening, the dancing girls display their\n professional skill, for the amusement of the idols enthroned in\n the large edifice. There, also, three times a day, large quantities\n of the choicest food are presented to these wooden images. The\n people are taught that the appetite of these gods is perfectly satis-\n fied by smelling and seeing the food at a distance. This is a\n remarkably fortunate circumstance, since the Brahmins always\n take what the idols leave.\n</p>\n<p>\n The wall which surrounds the temple is about twenty feet\n high, and forms an enclosure six hundred and fifty feet square.\n On each side of the square is a gateway. The gateway in the\n engraving is through the base of a highly-ornamented tower.\n The small buildings, in front of the wall, are the shops of mer-\n chants, where clothing and ornaments are exposed for sale. The\n column on the right is a very beautiful specimen of architecture.\n The shaft, which is thirty feet high, is composed of a single\n stone. The figure on the top is an image of Huneman, a deified\n monkey.\n</p>\n<p>\n The only foreigner who ever saw the inside of this temple\n was an English officer, who, about thirty years since, succeeded\n in gaining admission, by painting and dressing himself like a\n native. When the Brahmins discovered that their holy place had\n been thus defiled, they became so enraged that all the English\n residing at the station were obliged to flee for their lives. Sus-\n pecting their pursuers to be more desirous of gratifying their\n avarice than their revenge, they strewed silver money by the way,\n and, while the natives stopped to pick it up, they gained time,\n and succeeded in reaching a place of safety.\n</p>\n<p>\n Twelve festivals are annually celebrated here in honor of\n Juggernaut. The most important of these are the bathing and\n the car festivals. These I witnessed, and there were present\n more than one hundred and fifty thousand pilgrims. Nearly\n half were females. There is not only great suffering among the\n multitude of pilgrims who, from distant places, attend these\n festivals, but many of them die in consequence^, of excessive\n fatigue, exposure to the annual rains, and the want of suitable\n and sufficient food. The plains, in many places, are literally\n whitened with the bones of the pilgrims, while dogs and vultures\n are continually devouring the bodies of the dead. Rev.

From an elevated\n position, on an elephant, I saw them pouring in from every di-\n rection, until four o\u2019clock, when the concourse became immense.\n Every street and avenue leading to the temple was thronged,\n and the flat roofs of the houses were also densely crowded with\n anxious spectators. About five o\u2019clock, a company of men pro-\n ceeded from the temple, making a horrid din with drums, gongs,\n and trumpets. Next came the idols, shaded by umbrellas of state\n and attended by various emblems of royalty. The vast multi-\n tude greeted them with loud and long-continued shouts. Jugger-\n naut, and his brother and sister, were now to mount their cars ; but\n from the infirmities of age, or some more obvious cause, they\n submitted to the awkward expedient of being dragged through\n the mud to their elevated seats, by the aid of ropes and Brahmins.\n A variety of ceremonies followed, but, as it was growing late, I\n returned to my lodgings.\n</p>\n<p>\n At sunrise the next morning, the gates of the town were\n thrown open, to admit the beggars. As they passed, I was in-\n formed by the English magistrate, by whose order they were\n admitted, that their number probably exceeded fifty thousand.\n They were the most weary, ragged, filthy, wretched-looking\n objects I ever saw. They had been prevented from entering the\n town at an earlier period, because of their inability to pay the\n tax which the Honorable East India Company demanded of their\n heathen subjects for the privilege of seeing their idols. The\n Company, I ascertained, had, in the preceding thirty-four days,\n received fifty-five thousand dollars as admission fees. Having\n already extorted so large a sum from the richer pilgrims, they\n could well afford, now that a part of the festival was over, to\n admit gratuitously those from whom no money could be ex-\n torted. It affords me much pleasure to say that this unrighteous\n source of gain has recently been abolished. The multitude of\n beggar pilgrims hastened onward to the cars, and appeared to be\n lost in the much larger multitude there assembled.\n</p>\n<p>\n Hearing the tumultuous sound of many voices at a distance, I\n looked towards the place from which it came, when I saw about\n a thousand men advancing, with green branches elevated in their\n hands. They rushed forward, leaping through the crowd, and,\n with mighty shoutings, seized the ropes of one of the cars, and\n dragged it forth in triumph. Soon other companies, in a similar\n manner, dashed forward and put the two remaining cars in motion.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0114/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0114/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0114/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0114/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0114/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0114/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0114.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 652741}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"114\">\n<p>\n 110\n</p>\n<p>\n LECTURES ON INDIA.\n</p>\n<p>\n The pilgrims are taught to believe that the cars are not moved\n and guided by the strength of the men who pull at the ropes, but\n by the will and pleasure of the idols. This being admitted, it\n must be that Juggernaut made a grand mistake, for he ran his\n car against a house, and was not able to extricate himself until\n the afternoon of the next day. But perhaps he was merely in a\n surly mood, for they believe that the cars move only when the\n idols are pleased with the worship. So, if for any reason a cai\n stops, they suppose that the idol thus expresses his disapprobation.\n One of the priests then steps forward to the front of the platform,\n as here represented, rehearses the deeds and extols the character of\n the idol, in a manner the most obscene. No person, educated in\n * a Christian country, can possibly conceive expressions so debas-\n ing and abominable as are used on such occasions. Should\n the speaker quote from the Shasters, or invent an expression more\n than usually lascivious, the multitude give a shout, or rather a\n sensual yell. The men again pull, with renewed energy, at the\n ropes, the idol is supposed to be delighted, and the car is permit-\n ted to move on. When dragged a short distance farther, it is\n stopped again by a priest, who slyly clogs one of the wheels.\n Then another scene of pollution is apted out with all its debasing\n influence upon the mind and morals of the people. In this man-\n ner, eight days are spent in drawing the car about two miles.\n</p>\n<p>\n In one of the apartments of Juggernaut\u2019s temple, there is a\n golden image of Luckshme, the wife of Juggernaut. Near mid-\n night, on the fourth day of the car festival, it was brought out of\n the temple, on a splendid litter, borne on the shoulders of men.\n Preceded by a band of rude music, and men bearing flaming\n torches, they soon approached the cars, when Luckshme was\n presented directly in front of Juggernaut, her husband. Immedi-\n ately the whole multitude appeared to be in a perfect rage, and\n rent the air with the most violent and clamorous yells. The\n women, who at this time were unusually numerous, appeared\n to be by far the most excited. In the midst of these dreadful\n yells, which had now continued several minutes, one of the priests\n took a garland of flowers from Juggernaut, and placed it around\n the neck of his wife. She was then borne off towards the\n temple, and the clamor ceased.\n</p>\n<p>\n I inquired the meaning of this strange and terrific ceremony.\n The reply was, that on the first day of the festival, Juggernaut\n had eloped with his sister.

The number of guests was estimated\n at two hundred thousand, and the expense of the feast, together\n with the presents made, was estimated at seventy-five thousand\n dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\n The efficacy of one of the numerous ceremonies for the benefit\n ot deceased relatives is supposed to depend very much upon the\n place where it is performed. If performed at a certain temple in\n the town of Guyah, it is supposed that inconceivable benefits will\n be conferred upon the deceased. The East India Company, seiz-\n ing upon this superstitious feeling, have until recently made it a\n source of revenue by imposing a tax upon all who perform this\n ceremony at Guyah. The tax collected at that temple amounted\n to about one hundred and twelve thousand dollars annually.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ceremonies for the repose of the soul are exceedingly numer-\n ous ; but I will mention only one more. The son of the deceased\n procures one male and four female calves. These are tied to five\n posts, near an altar, constructed for the occasion. Four learned\n Brahmins sit on the four sides of the altar, and offer a burnt sacri-\n fice. A fifth Brahmin reads certain passages in the Shasters, to\n drive away evil spirits. The son washes the tail of the male calf,\n and with the same water presents a drink-offering to his deceased\n ancestors. The male and the four female calves are then gravely\n united in wedlock. During the marriage ceremony, many formu-\n las are repeated, in which the parties are recommended to culti-\n vate love and mutual sympathy. The Brahmins, having per-\n formed the duties of their sacred office, are dismissed with\n presents, including the four brides ; but the bridegroom is dedi-\n cated to Shiva, and allowed to run at large until old age carries him\n off. These vagrant calves may almost be said to constitute one of\n the numerous orders of religious mendicants, or holy beggars. As no\n provision is made for their daily wants, and as they are under the\n necessity of securing their living, they become very cunning, and\n are scarcely less impudent than the bipeds constituting the other\n orders of that fraternity. It is not uncommon for them to walk up,\n unbidden, to the stalls where vegetables are for sale, and help them-\n selves. Being esteemed sacred, the poor deluded inhabitants dare\n to use only the most gentle means of ridding themselves of their\n unprofitable customers. During the first year or two, these cattle\n i ' are rather scantily ; but, after having learned their sacred functions,\n they live well, and are the fattest and best-looking of all the ani-\n mals to be seen in Hindustan.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0119/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0119/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0119/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0119/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0119/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0119/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0119.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 844387}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"119\">\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n No. 50.

The\n third are punished in places of torment. The fourth again be-\n come the offspring of human parents. The fifth become beasts,\n birds, and insects. Hence, should a Hindu inhale an insect with\n his breath, he knows not but, in so doing, he has swallowed some\n departed relative \u2014 possibly his own father.

In the vicinity of Puna, a person dreamed that the\n cholera, then raging in his village, was inflicted by a certain wo-\n man commissioned by Zurremurre, the goddess of the cholera.\n The villagers, on hearing this, immediately assembled and put\n her to death. In Orissa, a woman was told by her priest that\n Kali, the goddess whom she worshipped, had appeared to him in a\n vision, and had commanded him to inform her that she must sac-\n rifice her only child. In the night, while he slept, she cut off his\n head, and gave it to the priest as an offering to the idol. In Nag-\n pore, several persons died suddenly, which led many to believe\n that they had been destroyed by witchcraft. They therefore\n employed a man, who professed to be skilled in the art of magic,\n to discover the authors of their death. He put some oil and rice\n into a leaf, and began to repeat the name of each person belonging\n to the village. When he called the name of a certain woman,\n the oil, as he said, ran through the leaf. This circumstance was\n regarded as sufficient proof of her guilt. She was immediately\n seized, and whipped until death ended her sufferings. The death\n of the favorite wife of Rajah Zelim Singh, of Kotah, being\n attributed to witchcraft, he sentenced four hundred women to be\n put into sacks and thrown into a tank. It is stated by General\n Malcolm, in an official report, that, in the province of Malwa\n alone, in the course of thirty years, between two and three\n thousand females had been put to death for the imputed crime of\n witchcraft.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many of the Hindus believe that those persons who commit\n suicide become malignant spirits delighting in every kind of\n mischief.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0122/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0122/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0122/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0122/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0122/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0122/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0122.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 611290}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"122\">\n<p>\n 118\n</p>\n<p>\n LECTURES ON INDIA.\n</p>\n<p>\n The scene represented by engraving No. 58 occurred in Ghaze-\n pore.

In Calcutta, a servant, having quarrelled with\n his master, hung himself, in the night, in front of the street door,\n that he might become a devil and haunt the premises. The\n house was immediately forsaken by its occupants, and, though a\n large and beautiful edifice, suffered to go to ruin.\n</p>\n<p>\n In Mirzapoor, a Brahmin took his own child, an infant about\n fifteen months old, from the arms of its mother, and, holding it\n by the legs, dashed its head against the ground, that it might be-\n come an evil spirit and torment a certain person by whom he\n imagined himself injured. Another little girl was, by her own\n father, beheaded with an axe. Another was stabbed to the heart,\n with a dagger, and her bleeding body thrown at the door of the\n person upon whom the murderer sought to be revenged.

A householder, who had for a time given him a halfpenny a\n day, refused to continue his allowance ; and, though the priest\n insisted upon the payment, he remained inflexible. The priest\n then threatened that, unless he received the amount, he would\n cut out his own tongue, and the householder would have to an-\n swer for giving him such a provocation. Incensed at the obsti-\n nacy of his opponent, he whetted his knife and cut off the tip of\n his tongue. He bled profusely, and his tongue swelled to a pro-\n digious size. The pains which he endured only served to render\n him more desperate, and he declared he would bring his whole\n family and sit in dhema, till he should obtain a sum sufficient to\n make a feast to his god. The householder was not to be intimi-\n dated, and remained as obstinate as the Brahmin. The priest,\n his wife, and his four sons, sat down, and kept their pos\u2019-ion at\n the door of the defendant ; but, during the second night, the fe-\n male was bit by a snake, and died in the morning. This event\n exasperated the priest ; he increased his demand ; and, as the vil-\n lage had remained neutral in the affair, he now laid a tax upon all\n its inhabitants. As he had not only sustained a personal injury,\n but had lost his wife while standing up for the rights of his order,\n and for the honor of his god, nothing less would satisfy him now,\n than a sum adequate to meet the expenses of the funeral and to\n make a feast to propitiate the deity who was offended by such\n daring sacrilege. Till these demands were met, he resolved to\n keep his station, and to retain the corpse of his wife unburied at the\n door of the house. As the people of the village rejected his claim,\n he then threatened that, in order to be avenged upon them, he would\n first kill his four children, and then put an end to his own exist-\n ence. It was the act of a Brahmin ; it might be viewed by Hindus\n as a pardonable offence ; it was done in honor of his god ; it was\n occasioned by the obstinacy of the people ; it was a sacrifice that,\n according to a monstrous mythology, would meet with a future\n and a bountiful reward ; its helpless victims were to be raised to\n life again by the divinity whose honor it was done to vindicate.\n But it is not ours to make apologies ; we have only to record the\n fact, that this priest \u2014 this worshipper of Shiva \u2014 this monster \u2014 -\n this raging fury \u2014 took his knife, laid hold of three of his children,\n and severed their heads from their bodies. It was not enough !\n His eldest son tried to make his escape ; but this murderous\n father allured him back, and promised that, prior to his own self-\n destruction, he c ly wished to embrace him and bid him farewell.\n Thus invited back by the soft whispers of love, he returned ; but,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0126/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0126/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0126/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0126/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0126/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0126/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0126.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 631526}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"126\">\n<p>\n 122\n</p>\n<p>\n LECTURES ON INDIA.\n</p>\n<p>\n the moment that he came within the grasp of the murderer, he\n laid him prostrate, as another victim at the shrine of superstition\n and reve: lge.

To a Hindu the\n nirth of a daughter is an occasion of sorrow. At the early age\n of twelve or thirteen years, she is required to leave the parental\n roof, and to become the wife of a man whom she has had no\n voice in choosing as her companion. Her duties to him are thus\n prescribed in the Shasters : \u201c When in the presence of her hus-\n band, a woman must keep her eyes upon her master, and be ready\n to receive his commands. When he speaks, she must be quiet,\n and listen to nothing beside. When he calls, she must leave\n every thing else, and attend upon him alone. A woman has no\n other god on earth than her husband. The most excellent of all\n good works she can perform is, to gratify him with the strictest\n obedience. This should be her only devotion. Though he be\n aged, infirm, dissipated, a drunkard, or a debauchee, she must still\n regard him as her god. She must serve him with all her might,\n obeying him in all things, spying no defects in his character, and\n giving him no cause for disquiet. If he laughs, she must also\n laugh ; if he weeps, she must also weep ; if he sings, she must\n be in an ecstasy. She must never eat until her husband is satis-\n fied. If he abstains, she must also fast ; and she must abstain\n from whatever food her husband dislikes.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In engraving, No. 55 you will see the interior of a Hindu dwelling\n at meal time. The husband, according to custom, is seated upon\n a mat, eating his boiled rice with his fingers, while his wife is\n standing by him ready to obey his commands. She is never\n permitted to eat with her husband, but waits upon him in the\n capacity of a servant, and afterwards partakes of the fragments\n in retirement.\n</p>\n<p>\n Schools are not uncommon in India, but there are none for the\n \u2018nstruction of the female. Her mind is entirely uncultivated, and\n she has no fixed principles to regulate her conduct. She is\n therefore an easy prey to vice, and the devoted slave of supersti-\n tion.

As I approached the spot, I found\n two females, almost exhausted by fatigue. I learnt that they\n had vowed to their goddess to roll, in this manner, from one tem-\n ple to another. They had spent nearly the whole day, and had\n not accomplished one half their journey. But no arguments,\n no remonstrances, on my part, could induce them to relinquish\n their undertaking ; for they feared that, unless they performed\n their vow, the goddess would be angry with them. On leav-\n ing these deluded votaries of superstition,\u201d continued he, \u201c with\n my feelings aroused almost to indignation, I expostulated with a\n learned Brahmin who stood not far distant, and pointed to the\n miserable objects I had just left. \u2018 O,\u2019 said he, c this is wot-\n ship exactly suited to the capacity of females.

The\n consequence of this course, was, that the men of the tribe became\n much more numerous than the women; and hence arose the\n custom of appropriating several husbands to one wife, \u2014 a custom\n that still prevails in some of the southern as well as the northern\n tribes of Hindustan. Among the Rajpoot tribes in the north-west\n part of that country nearly all the female children are put to death\n immediately after birth ; consequently the men are obliged to pro-\n cure their wives from other tribes.

It is the\n mother of the world, and preserves the kingdoms, and fills the\n cities, and the churches, and heaven itself. Like the useful bee,\n it builds a house, and gathers sweetness from every flower, and\n labors, and unites into societies and republics, and sends out\n colonies, and feeds the world with delicacies, and keeps order,\n and promotes the interest of mankind, and is that state of good\n things, to which God has designed the present constitution of\n the world.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n But ah this supposes confidence and esteem, growing out of\n acquaintance between the parties, \u2014 affection, inspiring a mutual\n desire to please, and the immerging of individual interests in the\n common stock of domestic enjoyments. And of this, Paganism\n knows nothing. It holds females as articles of merchandise,\n to be disposed of to those who will pay for them the highest\n price. Girls of six or eight years are bought and sold by their\n fathers as calves of the stall, to be taken, at twelve or fourteen,\n (whether willing or unwilling,) from the home of their childhood,\n and put into the hands of the man for whom they were pur-\n chased.\n</p>\n<p>\n In Hindustan, females, who remain unmarried till they are\n fifteen or sixteen years of age, (however correct in their con-\n duct,) are regarded as infamous, and (like widows) are never\n sought for in marriage ; and widowers (even if sixty or seventy\n years old) invariably marry girls of ten or twelve. Among the\n poorer classes in China, when a man dies, his relatives (to regain\n the money originally paid for his bride) are allowed to sell his\n widow to become the wife of another man. The arrangement is\n made without her knowledge, and (regardless of her wishes) she\n is forced into a palenkeen, and carried to the house of her pur-\n chaser. The price of a bride varies much in different countries.\n In some parts of Africa ten or fifteen bullocks are paid as an\n equivalent, while a handsome red-haired Circassian or Georgian\n girl cannot be bought for less than six or seven thousand piasters.\n In the kingdom of Dahomey, all unmarried women are held as\n the property of the king.

Mr. Barrington (who had long resided in Parametta)\n mentions an instance that fell under his own observation, pleas-\n antly illustrating this fact. \u201cA brother of twenty-three, and two\n sisters of twenty and fourteen respectively, dwelt together affec-\n tionately in a cave near the city. On returning one day from\n hunting the kangaroo, just as the darkness of night mantled the\n heavens, and while the forked lightning played vividly around\n him, at the mouth of the cave, his eye caught the form of his\n younger sister, bleeding on the ground. Troubled before at the\n warring of the elements, his soul was now in agony. He\n endeavored to raise her up, but she was senseless. At length,\n however, his efforts were successful, and, with returning anima-\n tion, she exclaimed, 4 Dear brother ! our sister is torn from us,- -\n a wretch came to the cave, beat her cruelly with his club, and\n caught up one arm to drag her away, \u2014 I laid hold of the other\n to prevent him, but the moment he saw it, with a single blow,\n he knocked me to the ground, where you have now found me.\u2019\n The night was passed in the anguish of grief and amid harrow-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0142/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0142/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0142/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0142/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0142/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0142/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0142.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 631013}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"142\">\n<p>\n 188\n</p>\n<p>\n LECTURE ON WOMEN.\n</p>\n<p>\n ing purposes of revenge.

A fine opportunity was thus presented\n for revenge. The brother (bidding his sister to hide herself)\n flew upon the young woman, with club in hand, and with all\n the ferocity of a savage in his heart.

Jealousy, bitterness, and strife, are its inva-\n riable attendants, even when associated with faith as strong as\n that of the patriarchs, and piety as ardent as that of the sweet\n singer of Israel.

thirty wives, and\n five hundred other women at his disposal. The emperor of Tur-\n key swells his harem, usually, with more than a thousand\n wives, \u2014 the sultan Achmet I. is said to have had three thousand.\n The king of Ashantee has three thousand three hundred and\n thirty- three, \u2014 a mystical number, on the integrity of which the\n prosperity of his kingdom is supposed to depend. And the king\n of Yarriba boasted to Capt. Clapperton, that his wives, linked\n hand in hand, would reach entirely across his kingdom.\n</p>\n<p>\n Not only kings, but nobles, and men of wealth and station, and\n indeed men of all classes, who have the ability to sustain a\n plurality of wives, are eager to possess them, \u2014 not as objects of\n affection, but as honorable appendages to their establishments, or\n as ministering to their pride and sensuality. Love is not known\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c where pleasure is adored,\n</p>\n<p>\n That ruling goddess, with a zoneless waist\n And wandering eyes, still leaning on the arm\n Of novelty.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n but its place is supplied by envy, and rancor, and hate, bursting\n forth, often, in words of wrath and deeds of cruelty, and the\n wanton murder of the innocent. Says Lady Montague, during\n her residence in Constantinople, \u201c The body of a young woman\n of surpassing beauty was found one morning near my house.\n She had received two wounds, one in her side, and the other in\n ner breast, and was not quite cold. Many came to admire her\n beauty ; but no one could tell who she was, \u2014 no woman\u2019s face\n being known out of her family. She was buried privately, and\n little inquiry made for the wretch who had imbrued his hands in\n her blood.\u201d The Pacha of Acre, in Palestine, a few years since,\n put to death seven of his wives, at one time, with his own hands.\n And even where cruelties like these are not perpetrated, the wife\n is kept a prisoner in the house of her lord, and her face is never\n seen beyond it. She is thus entirely in the irresponsible power\n of her husband, nor is one earthly ear but his. open to the tale\n of her wrongs, how terrible soever they may be. That she\n endures such wrongs, is no more to be questioned than the exist-\n ence of caprice in man\u2019s proud heart, or of contempt for the\n whole sex, which he regards is infinitely inferior to his own.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Pagan or Mahometan wife is liable to divorce, and con-\n sequent poverty and shame, at any moment when her husband\n wills it. For one cause, and only one, Christianity permits the\n disruption of the conjugal tie.

Mr. Williams,) 11 were denied those kinds of food\n reserved for the men and the gods, \u2014 compelled to eat their scanty\n meals by themselves, and forbidden to dwell under the same roof\n with their tyrannical masters.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Till Riho Riho became ruler of the Sandwich Islands, similar\n customs prevailed there. About the time when he caused the\n idols to be destroyed, a dinner party was made, to which the prin-\n cipal chiefs and other persons of distinction were invited. When\n l he company were seated around the table spread in an open\n bower, the king took his seat between two of his queens, \u2014 pre-\n sented them with some of the forbidden food, and ate from the\n same dish with them. The whole company were astonished at\n such an innovation on ancient usages ; so great, indeed, was the\n excitement produced, that it threatened a revolution in the gov-\n ernment. The authority of the monarch, however, sustained by\n the incipient influences of Christianity, prevailed.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1787, the emperor of China issued the following decree .\n \u2018\u2018 ' All persons of the female sex, of whatever quality or condition,\n are forbidden, upon any pretext whatever, to enter a temple or\n quit their houses, except in cases of absolute necessity.

In other parts of the same country, the morning\n after a wedding, a man representing the father of the bride,\n delivers to the husband a whip, which, whenever the wife\n offends, is to be used freely. In the interior of Java the bride\n washes the bridegroom\u2019s feet in token of subjection. In Bambouk ;\n Africa, she takes off her sandals, kneels before the bridegroom,\n pours water upon his feet, and wipes them with her mantle. In\n Madagascar, when a husband returns from war, his wife gives\n him the customary salutation of passing her tongue over his feet\n most respectfully. In New Holland, the slightest offence given\n to the husband brings down the club upon the wife, which never\n fails to draw forth a stream of blood and often fractures the\n skull. Among the Mandingoes, the terrible personage called\n Mumbo Jumbo, is called forth to frighten the refractory wife into\n submission. This demon form, assumed either by the husband\n himself or some one instructed by him, gives notice of his\n approach from the neighboring woods, near sunset, by the most\n frightful yells. At dark the men go out to meet him. He has a\n rod in his hand, a hideous mask on his head, and is fantastically\n decorated with the bark of trees. He is conducted to the village,\n where all the married women are assembled. The ceremonies\n commence. Songs and dances continue till a late hour. Mumbo\n Jumbo himself sings a song peculiar to the occasion. Then the\n women are required to arrange themselves in a circle. After a\n long pause and profound silence, Mumbo points out those that\n have been disobedient to their husbands, or otherwise have\n behaved improperly, and they are immediately seized, stripped,\n tied to a post, and severely beaten with Mumbo\u2019 s rod, amid the\n shouts and deridings of the whole assembly.\n</p>\n<p>\n And to such humiliation of woman, are boys, in some instan-\n ces at least, systematically trained.

Father Joseph (a missionary on the\n banks of the Oronoco) ventured to reprove an Indian female, foi\n destroying her infant daughter. She replied, \u201cO that my\n mother had thus prevented the manifold sufferings I have\n endured ! Consider, father, our deplorable condition. Our hus-\n bands go out to hunt ; we are dragged along with one infant at\n the breast and another in a basket. Though tired with long\n walking, we are not allowed to sleep when we return, but must\n labor the whole night in grinding maize to make chica for them\n They get drunk and beat us ; they drag us by the hair of the\n head and tread us under foot. And after such a slavery of twenty\n years, what have we to comfort us ? A young wife is brought\n home and permitted to abuse us and our children. What kind-\n ness can we show our daughters, equal to putting them to death?\n Would to God my mother had put me under ground the moment\n l was born ! \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n One case more only for the sake of contrast. \u201c Soon after my\n acquaintance with these Indians,\u201d (says a missionary to the\n Choctaws,) \u201cI one day saw a chief travelling on horseback,\n quite at his ease, followed by his poor wife, who was not only on\n foot, but carried his infant child, his rifle, and a quantity of pro-\n visions in a large basket at her back, supported by a strap drawn\n across her forehead. At a subsequent season, I met the same\n family again on their travels ; the chief was now on foot, laden\n with his own arms, and he had kindly placed his wife on the\n saddle. The child, too, now much larger than before, was\n sweetly sleeping in the arms of its father, who himself seemed\n chserful and happy amid the fatigues of the way.\u201d The\n larguage of the poet to his wife he practically adopted as\n his own :\n</p>\n<p>\n 11 On all ner days let health and peace attend,\n</p>\n<p>\n May she ne\u2019er want nor lose a friend ;\n</p>\n<p>\n May some new pleasure every hour employ\n But let her husband be her highest joy.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n And what think you was the cause of this wonderful trans-\n formation? The Choctaw Chief had become a follower of\n Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n But the widowhood of the Pagan wife and mother is, if pos-\n sible, more wretched than her married life. As if Satan could\n not bear that the daughters of the first victim of his seduction\n should find peace in any condition, he first torments them as\n daughters in the house of their fathers, then as wives in the\n dwellings of their husbands, and then as widows, cast out from\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":

Under the dark covert of Pagan\n superstition and Mahometan delusion, unopposed by the sword\n of the Spirit, he accomplishes with ease his fiendish purposes,\n and adds the wormwood and gall of universal malice and con-\n tempt to all the bitterness of the dregs that had filled her cup of\n woe, from the cradle to the death of her husband. Formerly,\n the Cadre widow, on the decease of her husband, whatever\n was the season of the year, and whatever her condition, was\n compelled to fly to the forest, and houseless, hungry, and alone,\n mourn her loss day after day. During her absence her dwelling\n was plundered by her relatives of everything valuable, set on\n fire, and consumed, and the only dowry allotted her from her\n husband\u2019s property was a new garment, made from the hide of\n one of his oxen. On returning from the wildernesss, she built a\n new hut with her own hands, and subsisted on the avails of her\n own labor. Missionary enterprise has succeeded in abolishing\n this cruel custom, and Mr. Shaw, the missionary who was instru-\n mental in accomplishing it, received the name of Umkinets Um-\n fazie, (the woman\u2019s shield,) by which he is now generally known\n in Caflraria. In Greenland, when the husband dies, the widow,\n if unprotected by friends, is usually robbed of a considerable por-\n tion of her property by those -who come to sympathize with her\n by an affected condolence, and can obtain no redress. If aged\n and infirm, she is not unfrequently buried alive by her own\n children.\n</p>\n<p>\n As the legitimate consequences of their servile and wretched\n condition, females of every unevangelized land are devoid of\n those sentiments of delicacy, and that refined taste and acute dis-\n crimination between the lovely and the disgusting in manners\n and customs, which distinguish the sex in lands enlightened by\n the gospel. Before Christianity commenced its reign in the Soci-\n ety Islands, wrestling was a favorite amusement of females, and\n one in which those of the highest rank engaged, not only with\n each other, but also with the men, in the presence of thousands\n of spectators of both sexes. Immediately after marriage, every\n female provided herself with an instrument set with rows of\n shark\u2019s teeth, with which, on the death of any of the family, she\n fearfully cut and lacerated herself, beating the head, temples,\n cheeks, and breast, till blood flowed profusely, while she uttered\n the most deafening and ag6nizing cries.

In Persia, they paint a black streak around the\n eyes, color their eye-brows and hair, and stain the face and neck\n with figures of beasts, birds, flowers, & c.

The process is painful,\n though not more so than that of the female Greenlander, who\n first saturates threads with soot, and then inserts them beneath\n the skin, and draws them through.

In some parts of\n Hindustan, at the time of marriage, a like portion of the third\n and little finger is removed. A similar custom prevails among\n the Hottentots. Among some of the savage tribes of America,\n and also in Sumatra and Arracan, continual pressure is applied\n to the skull to flatten it, and add to the beauty of its form.

Sometimes the child is drowned in a\n vessel of water prepared for the purpose, or thrown into a pit,\n with its face downward, or suffocated by stuffing a cloth into its\n mouth ; but the parents themselves are commonly the execution-\n ers, under the impression that there is no other way of saving the\n child from the misfortunes that await its future years.

The Hindu widow burns on the funeral pile\n of her husband. Thus she escapes the obloquy of widowhood,\n and becomes entitled, as she believes, to a residence with her\n husband and their relatives in heaven. Thanks to the gospel of\n Christ, this horrid superstition has relaxed its grasp on Indian\n mind ; but, till within a few years, thousands of widows became\n annually its victims ; and at the death of princes and other men\n of elevated rank, possessed of many wives, the dreadful sacri-\n fice has been all that ' Abaddon himself could desire. Twelve\n widows in one instance, eighteen in another, thirty-seven in\n another, and on the death of Ajie, prince of Malwar, fifty-eight\n threw themselves on the funeral piles of their husbands and per-\n ished. As late as 1844 twenty-four women were burnt in Pun-\n jab. There can be no doubt that this dreadful sacrifice is some-\n times voluntary on the part of the victim, but it is by no means\n universally so. Not only is all the earthly glory of the deed, and\n the happiness of a Pagan heaven promised on the one hand, and\n all the terrors of contempt and persecution through life, with ever-\n lasting infamy, arrayed on the other, but force is applied, with\n fiend-like perseverance, to compel the unhappy wife to mount\n the blazing altar of Moloch.\n</p>\n<p>\n Follow me to the immolation of a Brahmin\u2019s widow in Northern\n Hindustan.

The torture of the fire is more than she\n can endure, and by a violent struggle she throws herself beyond\n the reach of the flames, and tottering to a river near by, is kindly\n plunged into it by some English gentlemen present, to assuage her\n tormants.

TO PLUNDER AND MURDER.\n</p>\n<p>\n COMPILED PRINCIPALLY FROM THE OFFICIAL DOCUMENTS OF CAPT. SLEEMAN, AGENT\n OF THE EAST INDIA COMPANY FOR THE SUPPRESSION OF THUGGEE\n</p>\n<p>\n W hile Europeans have generally travelled through India in\n comparative security, arising from the dread inspired by the\n power and dominion of the British government, the path of the\n native has been beset with perils by hordes of ferocious robbers,\n which every where abound, from the highest regions of the\n Himelaya Mountains to the southern extremity of Hindoostan.\n The most sanguinary class of these freebooters are the Thugs,\n or Phansigars. Their existence appears to have been entirely\n unknown to Europeans until about the year 1800. From Janu-\n ary, 1826, to December, 1835, the number of Thugs committed\n by various magistrates amounted to 1562. Of these 328 were\n punished by death, 999 by transportation, 77 by imprisonment\n for life; from 21 security was required; 71 were sentenced to\n limited periods of imprisonment ; making a total of 1450 con-\n victed. Of the remainder, 21 were acquitted, 11 escaped, 31\n died before sentence, and 49 were admitted evidence for the\n prosecution.\n</p>\n<p>\n Gangs of Thugs sometimes consist of two or three hundred\n persons.

The number has, without doubt,\n varied greatly at, different periods. There is reason to believe\n that, from the time of the conquest of Mysore, in 1799, to 1807\n and 1808, the practice, in that part of India, reached its height,,\n and that hundreds of persons were annually destroyed. In one\n of his reports, the magistrate of Chittoor observes, \u201c I believe\n that some of the Phansigars have been concerned in above two\n hundred murders : nor will this estimate appear extravagant, if\n it be remembered that murder was their profession \u2014 frequently\n their only means of gaining a subsistence. Every man of fifty\n years of age has probably been actively engaged, during twenty-\n five years of his life, in murder ; and, on the most moderate com-\n putation, it may be reckoned that he has made one excursion a\n year, and met, each time, with ten victims.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The profession of a Thug, like almost* every thing in India,\n is hereditary, the fraternity, however, receiving occasional reen-\n forcement from \u2018strangers ; but these are admitted with great\n caution, and seldom after they have attained mature age.\n</p>\n<p>\n The children of Thugs, during their more tender years, are\n kept in ignorance of the occupation of their fathers. After a\n time they are permitted to accompany them ; but a veil is thrown\n over the darker scenes of the drama. To the novice, indeed,\n the expedition presents nothing but an aspect of pleasure. He\n is mounted on a pony ; and being, by the laws of the Thugs,\n entitled to his share of the booty, he receives a portion of it, in\n presents suited to his years ; the delight attending the acquisi-\n tion being unalloyed by any consciousness of the means by which\n it has been obtained. The truth reveals itself by degrees. In\n a short time, the tyro becomes aware that his presents are the\n fruits of robbery. After a while, he has reason to suspect that\n robbery is aggravated by a fouler crime.

The following affecting\n story, related by a Thug who had become approver against his\n comrades, will illustrate this. \u201c About twelve years ago,\u201d said\n the narrator, \u201c my cousin, Aman Subahdar, took out with us my\n cousin Kurhora, brother of Omrow, (approver,) a lad of fourteen,\n for the first time. He was mounted on a pretty pony ; and\n Hursooka, an adopted son of Aman, was appointed to take\n charge of the boy. We fell in with five Sieks; and when we\n set out before daylight in the morning, Hursooka, who had been\n already on three expeditions, was ordered to take the bridle, and\n keep the boy in the rear, out of sight and hearing. The boy\n became alarmed and impatient, got away from Hursooka, and\n galloped up at the instant the 1 1 hirneej or signal for murder,\n was given- He heard the screams of the men, and saw them\n all strangled. He was seized with a trembling, and fell from his\n pony. He became immediately delirious, was dreadfully alarmed\n at the turbans of the murdered men, and, when any one touched\n or spoke to him, talked wildly about the murders, screamed as\n if in sleep, and trembled violently. We could not get him for-\n ward ; and, after burying the bodies, Aman, myself, and a few\n others, sat by him while the gang went on. We were very fond\n of him, and tried all we could to tranquillize him, but he never\n recovered his senses, and before evening he died. I have seen\n many instances of feelings greatly shocked at the sight of the\n first murder, but never one so strong as this. Kurhora was a\n fine boy ; and Hursooka took his death much to heart, and\n turned Byragee. He is now at some temple on the banks of the\n Nerbudda River.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The indiscriminate slaughter in which these miscreants might\n Oe tempted to indulge is in some degree restrained by supersti-\n tion. It is deemed unlucky to kill certain castes and classes ;\n and their members are therefore usually respected. The most\n important and extended exception to the general rule of murder,\n is that of the female sex. Thugs, who have any real regard to\n the principles which they profess to respect, never take the lives\n of women. It cannot, however, be supposed that such a rule\n should be invariably observed by such persons as form the soci-\n ety of Thugs ; and, in fact, it is constantly violated. \u201c Among\n ns,\u201d said one of the approvers interrogated by Captain Sleeman,\n \u201c it is a rule never to kill a woman ; but if a rich old woman is\n found, the gang sometimes get a man to strangle her, by giving\n him an extra share of the booty, and inducing him to take the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0180/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0180/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0180/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0180/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0180/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0180/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0180.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 609266}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"180\">\n<p>\n 176\n</p>\n<p>\n HABITS AND SUPERSTITIONS\n</p>\n<p>\n responsibility upon himself.

Of Kalee, the deity\n of destruction, they are the most devout and assiduous worship-\n pers : in her name they practise their execrable art ; and their\n victims are immolated in her honor. The Thugs believe that\n Kalee formerly cooperated more directly with them, by dispos-\n ing of the bodies of those whom they murdered, but she required\n them not to look back to witness her operations. All was well,\n so long as they observed this rule ; but the services of the god-\n dess as a sextoness were lost through the carelessness or indiscreet\n curiosity of one of the association. Of the circumstances attend-\n ant on this mischance, there are different versions ; and at least\n two are in pretty general circulation. According to one, a party\n of Thugs, having destroyed a traveller, left the body, as usual,\n unburied, in perfect confidence of receiving the wonted aid from\n the goddess. A novice, however, unguardedly looking behind\n him, saw the patroness of the Thugs in the act of feasting on\n the corpse, one half of it hanging out of her mouth.

Though she refused any\n longer to relieve the earth of the loathsome burdens with which\n her worshippers encumbered it, she was so considerate as to pre-\n sent her friends with one of her teeth for a pickaxe, a rib for a\n knife, and the hem of her lower garment for a noose. Whether or\n not this origin of the pickaxe be generally received, it is certain\n that this instrument is held by the Thugs, throughout India, in\n the highest veneration. Its fabrication is superintended with the\n greatest care ; and it is consecrated to the holy duty to which it\n is destined with many ceremonies. In the first place, a lucky\n day must be fixed upon : the leader of the gang then instructs a\n smith to make the required tool, and the process is conducted\n with the most profound secrecy. The door is peremptorily\n closed against all intrusion ; the leader never quits the forge\n while the manufacture is going on ; and the smith must engage in\n no other work till his sacred task is completed. The pickaxe, being\n made, must next be consecrated. Certain days of the week are\n deemed more auspicious for this purpose than the rest : Monday,\n Tuesday, Wednesday, and Friday, enjoy the distinction. Care\n is taken that the shadow of no living thing may fall on the axe,\n as this would contaminate the devoted implement, and frustrate\n all the pains that had been taken in its formation. A doctor\n most deeply versed in the learning of the Thugs undertakes the\n solemn office of consecration. He sits down with his face to\n the west, and receives the pickaxe in a brass dish. The instru-\n ment which is to supply the want occasioned by the cessation\n of the goddess\u2019s personal labors is first washed in water, which\n is received into a pit dug for the purpose. The pickaxe then re-\n ceives three other ablutions. The second washing is made with\n a mixture of sugar and water ; the third with sour milk ; and\n the fourth with ardent spirits. With red lead the pickaxe is\n marked, from the head to the point, with seven spots. It is\n again placed on the brass dish, and, with it, a cocoa-nut, some\n cloves white sandal-wood, sugar, and a few other articles. A\n fire is now kindled, and the fuel consists of dried cow-dung and\n the wood of the mango or byr-tree. All the articles deposited\n in the brass pan are, with the exception of the cocoa-nut, thrown\n into the fire ; and when the flame rises, the Thug priest, hold-\n ing the pickaxe with both hands, passes it seven times through\n the fire.

It is admitted by all Hindoos, that the\n demons multiplied in the manner described ; but there is a dif-\n ference of opinion respecting the manner in which they were\n finally disposed of.

Such is the commonly received account of the\n goddess\u2019s dexterity and address. That of the Thugs is varied,\n for the purpose of affording a superhuman sanction to their mode\n of assassination. According to Thug mythology, the goddess,\n when she became embarrassed by the constant reenforcements\n of the demon army which .accrued from her labors, relinquished\n all personal efforts for their suppression, and formed two men\n from the perspiration brushed from her arms. To each of these\n men she gave a handkerchief ; how fabricated, at a time when\n reels and looms were not, is a question open to the discussion of\n the learned. With these handkerchiefs they were commanded\n to put all the demons to death, without shedding a drop of blood.\n It does not appear why the goddess might not thus have plied\n the handkerchief herself : it may be presumed that she was too\n much exhausted by her previous exertions. Her commands,\n however, were faithfully executed; and the demons were all\n strangled without delay.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is some difficulty in understanding how demons so pow-\n erful succumbed thus readily to two agents, who, though sprung\n from an exudation of the goddess\u2019s arms, were, as appears by\n the sequel of the tale, merely children of mortality. But the\n difficulty never seems to have occurred to the Thugs, whose\n faith, like that of the mass of their countrymen, is of a very un-\n scrupulous character. The story is wound up with such poet-\n ical justice as might be expected in a Hindoo legend. The\n champions, having vanquished all the demons, offered, like hon-\n est men, to return the handkerchiefs ; but their patroness, in the\n sp^\u2019t, of a grateful goddess, desired that they would retain them,\n not merely as memorials of their heroism, but as the implements\n of a lucrative trade in which their descendants were to labor\n and thrive. They were not only permitted, but commanded, to\n strangle men, as they had strangled demons. They forbore,\n indeed, to exercise this privilege for a long period, and several\n generations passed before Thuggee became practised as a profes-\n sion.

But the same religion that allowed the\n mother to strangle her infant, that suffered the Brahmans to offer\n up their human sacrifices, that commanded the helpless female\n to mount the funeral pile, that encouraged the devotee to throw\n himself under the wheels of Juggernaut, patronized the Thugs\n in theii assass lations, and gave them the license of plunder at\n their will.

Nay, such was the encouragement\n these murderers received, and so useful were they to the public\n treasury, that, when the British government resolved to put them\n down, and applied to the

India, the division of time into weeks has all along been\n observed. The remembrance, however, of the seventh as a\n Sabbath , or sacred day of rest , has been completely 1 ' st. In-\n stead thereof, there have been substituted certain periodical or\n anniversary days of high festival, in honor of the principal divin-\n ities. These are so numerous, that it would be impossible\n within our limits to describe them all, as the description would\n be exceedingly voluminous. Every sect has its own favorite\n tutelary deity, in honor of whom stated periodical festivals\n are held.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is scarcely a day in the twelvemonth on which the\n anniversary of one or other of the gods is not celebrated by one\n or other of the leading sects, or sub-sects. It is quite enough\n for our purpose, to refer to one or two of those festivals which\n \u2014 from the superiority of the divinity adored, the prodigious\n multitudes that engage in the religious rites, and the universal\n suspension of business among all classes for several days \u2014 may\n strictly and truly be denominated national. In Bengal, in par-\n ticular, the consort of Shiva, the destroying power, is the divin-\n ity that engrosses the largest proportion of daily, monthly, and\n annual devotion. Like the other principal deities, she has been\n manifested under an immense variety of forms. Of these a\n thousand are usually enumerated, under as many distinct appel-\n lations. Of the thousand forms, there are two that have risen\n to unrivalled preeminence above the rest. These are the forms\n of Durga and Kali. To these, therefore, our attention may be\n chiefly directed.*\n</p>\n<p>\n * This description of the Durga and Kali Festivals is compiled from this\n writings of Rev. Alexander Duff, D. D., of Calcut ta.

He con-\n quered the three worlds ; dethroned all the gods, except the\n sacred Triad ; banished them from their respective heavens to\n live in forests ; and compelled them, at his nod, to come and\n bow down and worship before him, and celebrate his praise\n He abolished all religious ceremonies. The Brahmans, through\n fear of him, forsook the reading of the Vedas. The rivers\n changed their courses. Fire lost its energy. The terrified\n stars retired from his sight. He assumed the forms of the\n clouds, and gave rain whenever he pleased ; the earth, through\n fear, gave an abundant increase ; and the trees yielded flowers\n and fruits out of season. The gods at length applied to Shiva.\n One said, He has dethroned me ; another, He has taken my king-\n dom ; and thus all the gods related their misfortunes. Shiva,\n pitying their case, desired his wife, Parvati, to go and destroy\n the giant. She willingly accepted the commission. Durga\n prepared to meet her with an army of thirty thousand giants,\n who were such monsters in size, that they covered the surface\n of the earth, \u2014 ten millions of swift-footed horses, \u2014 a hundred\n millions of chariots, \u2014 a hundred and twenty thousand millions\n of elephants, \u2014 and soldiers beyond the power of arithmetic to\n number. Parvati, having assumed a thousand arms, sat down\n upon a mountain, coolly awaiting the approach of her formidable\n foes. The troops of the giant poured their arrows at her, thici\n as the drops of rain in a storm ; they even tore up the trees and\n the mountains, and hurled them at the goddess: she turned\n them all away, and caused millions of strange beings to issue\n from her body, which devoured all her enemies except their\n great leader. He then hurled a flaming dart at the goddess ;\n she easily turned it aside. He discharged another ; this she\n resisted by a hundred arrows.

On inquiry, you\n are told that wealthy natives have images of the goddess in their\n houses, made of gold, silver, brass, copper, crystal, stone, or mixed\n metal, which are daily worshipped. These are stable and per-\n manent heir-looms in a family ; and are transmitted from sire to\n son, like any other of the goods and chattels that become hered-\n itary property. But, besides these, you are next informed that,\n for the ceremonial purpose of a great festival, multitudes of\n temporary images are prepared. The reason why we call these\n temporary will appear by and by. These may be made of a\n composition of hay, sticks, clay, wood, or other cheap and light\n materials. They may be made of any size, from a few inches\n to ten, twelve, or twenty feet in height. But the ordinary size\n is that of the human stature. The only limitation is that of the\n form.

At length the government offices are by\n proclamation shut for a whole week! Secular business of every\n description, public or private, is suspended by land and by\n water, in town and in country. All things seem to announce\n the approach of a grand holiday \u2014 a season of universal joy and\n festivity.\n</p>\n<p>\n It extends altogether over a period of fifteen days. The\n greater part of that time is occupied with the performance of\n preliminary ceremonies, previous to the three great days of\n worship. Early on the morning of the first of the three great\n days commences the grand rite of consecrating the images.\n Hitherto these have been regarded merely as combinations of\n lifeless, senseless matter. Now, however, by the power of the\n Brahmans, \u2014 those vicegerents of deity on earth, \u2014 they are to\n be endowed with life and intelligence. A wealthy family can\n always secure the services of one or more Brahmans ; and of\n the very poor, a few may always unite, and secure the good\n offices of one of the sacred fraternity. At length the solemn\n hour arrives. The officiating Brahman, provided with the\n leaves of a sacred tree, and other holy accoutrements, approaches\n the image. With the two forefingers of his right hand he\n touches the breast, the two cheeks, the eyes., and the forehead\n of the image, at each successive touch giving audible utterance\n to the prayer, \u2014 \u201c Let the spirit of Durga descend, and take\n possession of this image ! \u201d And thus, by the performance of\n various ceremonies, and the enunciation of various mystical\n verses or incantations, called mantras , the ghostly officiator is\n devoutly believed to possess the divine power of bringing down\n the goddess to take bodily possession of the image. The image\n is henceforward regarded as the peculiar local habitation of the\n divinity, and is believed to be really and truly animated by her.\n In this way, the relation of the visible image to the invisible\n deity is held to be precisely the same as the relation of the\n human body to the soul, or subtile spirit, that actuates it. The\n constant and universal belief is, that when the Brahman repeats\n the muntras, the deities must come, obedient to his call, agree-\n ably to the^ favorite Sanskrit sloka , or verse \u2014 \u201c The universe\n is under the power of the deities ; the deities are under the\n power of the muntras ; the muntras are under the power of\n the Brahmans ; consequently, the Brahmans are gods.\u201d This\n is the creed of the more enlightened ; but a vast proportion of\n the more igno.ant and unreflecting believe something far more\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0211/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0211/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0211/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0211/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0211/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0211/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0211.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 600815}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"211\">\n<p>\n DURGA FESTIVAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n 207\n</p>\n<p>\n gross.

Round the greater part of the interior\n is a range of galleries, with retiring chambers. Part of these is\n devoted to the reception of visitors of the higher ranks, whether\n European or native, and part is closed for the accommodation\n of the females of the family, who, without being seen them-\n selves, may, through the Venetians, view both visitors and wor-\n shippers, as well as the varied festivities. The walls, the\n columns, and fronts of the verandas and gallenes, are all fan-\n tastically decorated with a profusion of tinsel ornaments of\n colored silk and paper, and glittering shapes and forms of gold\n and silver tissue. To crown all, there is, in the genuine Orien-\n tal style, an extravagant display of lustres , \u2014 suspended from\n the ceiling, and projecting from the walls, \u2014 which, when .tin-\n died at night, radiate a flood of light enough to dazzle and con-\n found ordinary vision.\n</p>\n<p>\n At the upper extremity of the hall is the ten-armed image of\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0212/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0212/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0212/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0212/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0212/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0212/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0212.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 635371}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"212\">\n<p>\n 208\n</p>\n<p>\n DURGA FESTIVAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n the goddess, raised several feet on an ornamented pedestal.

valuable qualities thereby imparted to them. Hence the more\n ignorant natives often come craving for a small portion of the\n sacred food, to be carried home, to cure diseases.\n</p>\n<p>\n But it is to the almost incredible profusion of the offerings\n presented at such festivals that we would desire to call your\n special attention. In general it may be said that the bulk of\n the people, rich and poor, expend by far the larger moiety of\n their earnings or income on offerings to idols, and the countless\n rites and exhibitions connected with idol worship. At the cel-\n ebration of one festival, a wealthy native has been known to\n offer after this manner \u2014 eighty thousand pounds\u2019 weight of\n sweetmeats ; eighty thousand pounds\u2019 weight of sugar; a thou-\n sand suits of cloth garments ; a thousand suits of silk ; a thou-\n sand offerings of rice, plantains, and other fruits. On another\n occasion, a wealthy native has been known to have expended\n upwards of thii ' ty thousand pounds sterling on the offerings,\n the observances, and the exhibition, of a single festival ; and\n upwards of ten thousand pounds annually , ever afterwards to\n the termination of his life. Indeed, such is the blindfold zeal\n of these benighted people, that instances are not unfrequent of\n natives of rank and wealth reducing themselves and families to\n poverty by their lavish expenditure in the service of the gods,\n and in upholding the pomp and dignity of their worship. In\n the city of Calcutta alone, at the lowest and most moderate\n estimate, it has been calculated that half a million , at least, is\n annually expended on the celebration of the Durga Pujah\n festival. How vast, how inconceivably vast, then, must be\n the aggregate expended by rich and poor on all the daily,\n weekly, monthly, and annual rites, ceremonies, and festivals,\n held in honor of a countless pantheon of divinities !\n</p>\n<p>\n Ah ! it is when gazing at these heaps of offering, so lavishly\n poured into the treasury of the false gods of heathenism, that\n one is constrained to reflect, in bitterness of spirit, on the mis-\n erable contrast presented by the scanty, stinted, and shrivelled\n offerings of the professed worshippers of the true God in a Chris-\n tian land ! Would that, in this respect., the disciples of Christ\n could be induced to learn a lesson from the blinded votaries of\n Hinduism! Take the case of a renowned city, the third, in\n point of wealth and commercial importance, in the British e m-\n pire ; a city on whose escutcheon and banner is inscribed the\n noble motto, that it is to \u201cflourish by the righteousness of the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0216/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0216/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0216/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0216/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0216/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0216/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0216.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 651081}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"216\">\n<p>\n 212\n</p>\n<p>\n DURGA FESTIVAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n Word.\u2019 ; What has been, on the part of its citizens, the mani-\n festation of a liberality that must needs astound all Christen-\n dom, and, if it were possible, cause the very universe to\n resound with the never-dying echoes of its fame?

It is within the present half century that the\n rajah of Nudiya, in the north of Bengal, offered a large number\n of sheep, and goats, and buffaloes, on the first day of the feast,\n and vowed to double the offering on each succeeding day, so\n that the number sacrificed in all amounted, in the aggregate, to\n upwards of sixty-five thousand!

It is in the central roofless court or\n area of the house that the process of slaughter is usually carried\n on. There a strong upright post is fastened in the ground,\n excavated at the top somewhat like a double-pronged fork. In\n this excavation the neck of the victim is inserted, and made fast\n by a transverse pin above. Close at hand stands the hired exe-\n cutioner, usually a blacksmith, with his broad, heavy axe. And\n woe be to him if he fail in severing the head at one stroke !\n Such failure would betide ruin and disgrace to himself, and\n entail the most frightful disaster on his employer and family !\n</p>\n<p>\n Each animal is duly consecrated by the officiating Brahman,\n who marks its horns and forehead with red lead, \u2014 sprinkles it,\n for the sake of purifying, with Ganges water, \u2014 adorns its neck\n with a necklace of leaves, and its brow with a garland of flowers,\n \u2014 and reads various incantations in its ears, adding, \u201c O Durga,\n I sacrifice this animal to thee,

sacrificial\n victim, whether goat, sheep, or buffalo, is dedicated and slain,\n amid the din and hubbub of human voices. The heads and\n part of the blood are then carried in succession to the hall with-\n in, and ranged before the image, each head being there sur-\n mounted with a lighted lamp. Over them the officiating\n Brahman repeats certain prayers, utters appropriate incanta-\n tions, and formally presents them as an acceptable feast to\n the goddess. Other meat-offerings and drink-offerings are also\n presented, with a repetition of the proper formulas. And, last of\n all, on a small, square altar, made of clean, dry sand, burnt-offer-\n ings of flowers, or grass, or leaves, or rice, or clarified butter, are\n deposited \u2014 with prayers, that all remaining sins may be* de-\n stroyed by the sacrificial fire. This naturally leads, us to\n answer a question that is often asked, namely, What becomes\n of the flesh meat of so many animals ? Part of it is offered on\n the altar as a burnt-sacrifice. But the larger part of it always,\n and not unfrequently the whole, is devoured as food. The\n Brahmans of course have their choice ; and the remainder is\n distributed in large quantities among the inferior castes. As it\n has been consecrated by being offered to the goddess, it is law-\n ful for all who choose to partake of it.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is impossible to note all the variations in the different\n modes in which the Durga Pujah is celebrated by the different\n castes and sects. Some individuals expend the largest propor-\n tion in peace-offerings, and meat and drink-offerings ; others in\n bloody sacrifices and burnt -offerings : some in the dances, and\n the tinsel garnishings, and fire-work exhibitions ; and others in\n entertaining and giving presents to Brahmans. The disciples\n of the numerous sect of Vishnu, though they celebrate the fes-\n tival with great pomp, present no bloody offerings to Durga ;\n instead of slaughtering animals, pumpkins, or some other\n substitute / are split in two and presented to the goddess.\n</p>\n<p>\n The multitudinous rites and ceremonies of the first day and\n night of the festival being now nearly concluded, numbers of\n old and young, rich and poor, male and female, rvsh into the\n open area that is streaming with the blood of animals slain in\n sacrifice. They seize a portion of the gory dust and mud, and\n with the sacred compost literally bedaub their bodies, dan-\n cing and prancing all the while with almost savage ferocity.\n With their bodies thus bespattered, and their minds excited into\n frenzy, multitudes now pour into the streets \u2014 some with\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0222/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0222/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0222/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0222/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0222/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0222/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0222.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 602125}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"222\">\n<p>\n 218\n</p>\n<p>\n DURGA FESTIVAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n blazing torches, others with musical instruments ; and ah\n twisting their frames into the most wanton attitudes, and vocif-\n erating the most indecent songs, rush to and fro, reeling, shout-\n ing, and raving, more wildly than the troops of \u201c iron-speared \u201d\n and \u201c ivy-leaved \u201d Amazons, that were wont, in times of old, to\n cause the woods and the mountains of Greece to resound with\n the frantic orgies of Bacchus.\n</p>\n<p>\n For two days and two nights more, there is a renewal of the\n same round of worship, and rites, and ceremonies, and dances,\n and sacrifices, and Bacchanalian fury.\n</p>\n<p>\n As the morning of the first day was devoted to the consecra-\n tion of the images, so the morning of the fourth is occupied with\n the grand ceremony of unconsecrating them.

Accordingly, the officiating Brah-\n man, su -rounded by the members of the family, engages, amid\n various rites, and sprinklings, and incantations, to send the divin-\n ity back to her native heaven ; concluding with a farewell\n address, in which he tells the goddess that he expects her to\n accept or all his services, and to return again to renew her\n favors on the following year.

It is one living , moving mass \u2014\n dense, vast, interminable. The immediate margin being too\n confined for the contact of such a teeming throng, hundreds and\n thousands of boats, of every size and every form, are put in requi-\n sition. A processional party steps on board, and each vessel is\n speedily launched on the broad expanse of the waters. The\n bosom of the stream seems, for miles, to be converted into the\n crowd, and the movement, and the harlequin exhibitions, of an\n immense floating fair. When the last rites and ceremonies are\n terminated, all the companies of image-carriers suddenly fall\n upon their images. They break them to pieces, and violently\n dash the shivered fragments into the depths of the passing\n stream. But who can depict the wondrous spectacle? \u2014 the\n numbers without number ; the fantastic equipages of every rank\n and grade ; the variegated costumes of every caste and sect ;\n the strangely indecorous bodily gestures of deluded worship-\n pers ; the wild and frenzied mental excitement of myriads\n of spectators intoxicated with the scene ; the breaking, crash-\n ing, and sinking, of hundreds of dispossessed images, along\n the margin and over the surface of the mighty stream, \u2014 amid\n the loud, shrill dissonance of a thousand untuneful instruments,\n commingled with the still more stunning peals of ten thousand\n thousand human voices ! Here, language entirely fails. Imagi-\n nation itself must sink down with wings collapsed, utterly\n baffled in the effort to conceive the individualities and the group-\n ings of an assemblage composed of such varied magnitudes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Towards evening the multitudes return to their homes.\n Return, you will ask, for the purpose of refreshment and\n repose ? No ; but to engage in fresh scenes of boisterous mirth\n and sensual revelry. But when these are at length brought to\n a close, is there not a season of respite ?

Intense devotion to Kali is the mysterious\n link that unites them in a bond of brotherhood that is indisso-\n luble ; and with a secrecy which, for generations, has eluded\n the efforts of successive governments to detect them. It is\n under her special auspices that all their sanguinary depredatiot s\n have been planned, prosecuted, and carried into execution. It\n is the thorough incorporation of a feeling of assurance in her aid,\n with the entire framework of their mental and moral being,\n that has imparted to their union all its strength and all its terror.\n In their sense of the term, they are of all men the most super-\n stitiously exact, the most devoutly religious, in the performance\n of divine worship. In honor of their guardian deity, there is a\n temple dedicated at Bindachul, near Mirzapur, to the north of\n Bengal. There , religious ceremonies are constantly performed,\n and thousands of animals offered in sacrifice. When a band of\n these leagued murderers, whose individuality and union have\n for ages been preserved in integrity, resolve to issue forth on\n their worse than marauding expedition, deliberately intent on\n imbruing their hands in the blood of their fellows, they first\n betake themselves to the temple of the goddess : present their\n prayers, a nd supplications, and offerings there ; and vow, in the\n event of success, to consecrate to her service a large proportion\n of the booty. Should they not succeed, \u2014 should they even be\n seized, convicted, and condemned to die, \u2014 their confidence in\n Kali does not waver ; their faith does not stagger.

An upright pole, twenty\n or thirty feet in height, is planted in the ground. Across the\n top of it, moving freely on a pin or pivot, is placed horizontally\n an ' ther long pole. From one end of this transverse beam is a\n rope suspended, with two hooks affixed to it. To the other ex-\n tremity is fastened another rope, which hangs loosely towards\n the ground. The devotee comes forward, and prostrates him-\n self in the dust. The hooks are then run through the fleshy\n parts of his back, near the shoulders. A party, holding the\n rope at the other side, immediately begin to run round with\n considerable velocity. By this means the wretched dupe of\n superstition is hoisted aloft into the air, and violently whirled\n round and round. The torture he may continue to endure for a\n longer or shorter period, according to his own free-will ; only,\n this being reckoned one of the holiest of acts, the longer he\n can endure the torture the greater the pleasure conveyed to the\n deity whom he serves; the greater the portion of merit acciu-\n ing to himself ; and, consequently, the brighter the prospect of\n future reward. The time usually occupied averages from ten\n minutes to half an hour; and as soon as one has ended,\n another candidate is ready, \u2014 aspiring to earn the like merit and\n distinction. And thus, on one tree, from five to ten or fifteen\n may be swung in the course of a day. Of these swinging-posts\n there are hundreds and thousands simultaneously in operation in\n the province of Bengal. They are always erected in the most\n conspicuous parts of the towns and villages, and are surrounded\n by vast crowds of noisy spectators. On the very streets of the\n native city of Calcutta, many of these horrid swings are annu-\n ally to be seen, and scores around the suburbs. It not unfre*\n quently happens that, from the extreme rapidity of the motion,\n the ligaments of the back give way, in which case the poor devo-\n tee is tossed to a distance, and dashed to pieces.

The throng is now so dense that one is\n literally carried along. On approaching the precincts of the\n sacred shrine, it is found surrounded by a court and high wall.\n After entering the principal gate, which is on the western side,\n the temple itself starts up full in view. To the south of it is a\n spacious open hall or portico, elevated several feet above the\n ground, and surrounded by a flight of steps, above which rise\n a range of pillars that support the roof. Between the portico\n and the temple is a narrow pathway, along which the stream\n of spectators was flowing ; while the groups of the devotees\n marched round the side farthest from the temple. Being of the\n number of the spectators, we mingled with the teeming throng\n that pressed on, with maddening frenzy, to obtain a glimpse of\n the idol. Here one and another would start aside, and knock\n their heads against the temple wall or brick pavement, mutter-\n ing incantations to command the attention and attract the favor\n of the goddess. It may here be noticed, in passing, that a tem-\n ple in India is not, like a Christian church, a place for the disci-\n ples to assemble in and engage in reasonable worship ; but it\n is ordinarily designed as merely a receptacle for the senseless\n block of the idol, and a company of Brahmans, as its guardian\n attendants.

To the first class belong the Foue. Yedas.\n The Brahmins believe these to be as old as eternity. They also\n assert that they were communicated to mankind, not through the\n medium of a mortal, but by the mouth of Brahma himself.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Yedas consist of a compilation of prayers, called Mun \u2022\n Irus ; and, at a later period, a collection of doctrines and precepts,\n which are called Brahmanas , was added. They detail an endless\n number of ceremonies which are to be performed by the priest,\n the ascetic, and the hermit, at their religious services.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of the oldest sages of Hindu antiquity collected the\n Brahmanas, or religious statutes from the Yedas, into special\n tracts, with the title of Upanishads.

By far the\n most numerous class of Shasiers is comprehended in the poetical\n works of the Purannas, treating on the creation of the world,\n the power and attributes of the gods, the incarnations of Vishnu.\n & c. Among the most interesting of these may be numbered the\n Mahabharat and Bhagavat Gita. The latter contains a description\n of Krishna\u2019s life.

You cannot lay your hand on one point of doctrine,\n which is not in conflict with another, or denied by some rival\n system.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Hindu, however, acknowledges one Supreme Being as\n the ground and foundation of his religion. \u201c Ek Brumho, dit-\n tyo nashti,\u201d \u2014 One God, and beside him no other, \u2014 this sentence\n is become a proverb, and is in the mouth of every Brahmin.\n His writings dignify this supreme and eternal Being with the\n title \u201c Brahm,\u201d which is to be carefully distinguished from\n Brahma, an emanation of the former, and the first person in the\n Hindu trinity. The Shasters describe Brahm as a being without\n beginning and without end, almighty, omniscient, unchangeable :\n in short, as being possessed of all the divine attributes, as the\n sublimest conceptions of the Holy Scriptures describe Jehovah.\n This being, however, all spirit and without form, is devoid of\n qualities. The Shasters declare that the very idea of allowing\n attributes in Brahm renders a multiplication of him a necessary\n consequence. For this very reason, the Brahmin will not allow\n the God of the Bible, because to him it appears impossible and\n irrational to believe that spirit can act and create without being\n united with matter.\n</p>\n<p>\n Brahm is therefore represented without mind, without will,\n without consciousness of his existence. No wonder that many\n Hindus, in going one step farther, declare the Supreme is noth-\n ing ; for a spirit without power and energy is like a thing of\n nought. Nevertheless, it is asserted, on the other hand, that ne\n enjoys the highest beatitude, \u2014 it is the bliss of a deep, uninter-\n rupted sleep.\n</p>\n<p>\n Brahm, however, must one day have awaked from his long\n sieep ; or, in other words, the negative character of his existence\n must have changed into the positive.

It is the\n most perfect system of pantheism. The cosmogony of the\n Shasters runs thus : All the germs or seed corns of the world\n that was to come into existence were condensed in the shape of\n an egg, and the supreme took possession of it in the form of\n Brahma. One year of the creation, or one thousand jugs, which,\n according to our reckoning, makes three hundred millions of\n common years, elapsed before the egg was hatched. During that\n long period, it was swimming like a bubble upon the mighty\n deep or chaos ; its brightness resembled that of a thousand suns.\n</p>\n<p>\n At last it broke, and Brahma sprang forth. His appearance was\n terrific ; he had a thousand heads, a thousand eyes, and a\n thousand arms \u2014 a suitable complement to undertake the work of\n creation. Another monstrous being escaped from the egg with\n him, evidently signifying the crude materials from which the\n great mundane machine was to be prepared.

Here is a specimen of geography, which surpasses all our\n preconceived and short-sighted notions of the globe we inhabit !\n</p>\n<p>\n I mentioned above that the cosmogonies in the mythology of\n the Hindus are many. One of the most popular among them\n deserves to be noticed. The god Vishnu slept in the depth of\n the ocean. Prom him grew a water-lily, which swam on the\n surface of the water, and out of which proceeded Brahma, to\n whom the gods delivered the work of the creation of the uni-\n verse. In order to accomplish his purpose, he led for a long time\n the life of an ascetic. But he was unsuccessful. The disappoint-\n ment drove him into a rage, and the tears gushed from his eyes.\n Out of these briny drops arose gigantic beings of terrific shape.\n One of his deepest sighs over this sad catastrophe produced the\n god Rodru, that is, light and warmth, who, upon Brahma\u2019s\n request, undertook the continuation of the arduous task. But it\n did not proceed in his hands. Brahma was therefore obliged\n to resume it again ; and, after much anxiety, various beings issued\n from his fingers, ears, and other members. The work then ad-\n vanced with more success; and fire, earth, and wind, followed\n each other in quick succession.\n</p>\n<p>\n Upon this, Brahma divided himself into human forms, and\n created men ; then he assumed the shape of a bullock, and after-\n wards that of a horse, and thus produced the various kinds of\n four-footed animals, birds, & c. In this way the uncounted mul-\n titudes of animated beings, which now people the earth and other\n worlds, rose gradually into existence.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus you see how the idea of pantheism pervades the base\n fiction of this very absurd and immoral history of the creation.\n To create is, in fact, nothing but a manifestation of Brahma in\n new forms ; he becomes an elephant, a mountain, a river ; and\n thus he produces and propagates the different species of living\n beings. The whole universe is a portion of himself. In this\n view he is represented in the Vedas : \u201c Brahma is not separated\n from the creation : he is the light of the sun, of the moon, and\n of the fire ; the Vedas are the breath of his nostrils ; the primi-\n tive elements are his eyes ; the shaking movements of events are\n his laugh ; his sleep is the destruction of the world In various\n forms he enlivens the creature : in the form of fire, he digests\n their nourishment ; in the form of air, he preserves their life ; as\n water, he quenches their thirst ; as the sun, he ripens the fruits ; as\n the moon, he gives them refreshing sleep. The progress of time\n is the step of his foot. Brahma hears and sees every thing.

By successive emanations from himself, Brahma called\n various classes of mankind into existence. First the Brahmin\n escaped from his mouth, as the representative of God in human\n form.

For thirty centuries past have those unhappy beings\n groaned uuder the curse of the haughty Brahmin, and patiently\n borne the intolerable burden. \u201c What God has appointed,\u201d say\n they, \u201cwe cannot alter.\u201d So holy and unchangeable is this insti-\n tution of castes, in the eyes of the people, and so firm is the belief\n of the Hindu as to the appointment being of divine authorty,\n that a transition from one caste to the other is absolutely impos-\n sible. A prince cannot purchase the Brahminical thread, which\n is the badge of their dignity, for millions. As a mouse can never\n be changed into an elephant, or the thorn-bush into an orange-tree,\n so neither can a Sudra be turned into a Brahmin.

Accordingly, at the present day, Brahmins of the first,\n second, and third class, are met with in India. The purest and\n most honored are, of course, those who, both on the paternal and\n maternal side, have derived their descent from ancestors of pure\n blood.\n</p>\n<p>\n In modern times, however, the castes have been considerably\n intermixed with each other. The Kshutryus were nearly extir-\n pated, even before the country was conquered by the Mohamme-\n dans, because they resisted the dominion of the Brahmins. The\n Voishnus, or merchants\u2019 caste, is no longer found in Bengal, and\n it is believed that they have been amalgamated with, and lost\n among, the Sudras ; while these latter have, especially in Southern\n India, sunk down almost to a level with the brute creation.\n</p>\n<p>\n The laws of the Hindus are peculiarly calculated for the\n preservation of the power and authority of the priests. In the\n time when Hinduism was in its flower, the Brahmin could in no\n wise be touched. The prince dared not execute him, though he\n might have committed every possible crime. As flesh and blood\n are pervaded in him by divine holiness, his moral character must\n be judged by quite a different standard to that of the Sudra. A\n good action possesses with him a much higher value ; and the\n most hideous crime loses in his case a great deal of its heinous\n nature. When a Brahmin robbed his Sudra brother, he had to\n pay a fine in money ; but, when the latter was the offender, he\n had to be burned at the stake ; and, if he took a Brahmin by his\n beard, the law commanded his hands to be cut off. Yea, the\n revenge of this hateful priest pursued the poor wretch into the\n other world ; for, if a Sudra should meet him in an irreverential\n manner, he will after death become a tree ; and, should he venture\n to cast an angry glance at him, Yama, the god of the lower regions,\n will tear out his eyes ; or, if he beat the Brahmin but with a straw,\n he will in twenty transmigrations be born of impure beasts.\n</p>\n<p>\n India is, like Italy, a paradise for priests. All the offerings\n which the Hindu presents to his gods fall, as a matter of course,\n to the Brahmin. He that feeds a number of them has the\n promise of all the blessedness of heaven. The dying Hindu,\n who leaves him in his will some of his goods and cattle, will,\n freed from sin, enter forthwith into Shiva\u2019s heaven. He who\n sells his cow will go to hell ; but, if he make it over to a Brah-\n min, he will go to heaven.

Such evil prac-\n tices, my darling ! render thy husband the shame of the three\n worlds, and unworthy to be admitted at a sacrifice where\n Brahma, Vishnu, and all the immortals and divine sages, are\n present.\u2019 He ceased, and Sati, incensed by his words, with\n anger-inflamed eyes thus spoke : 1 That god is the lord of the\n universe, from whom all things and beings have received their\n rank and station, and whose supreme excellence no tongue is\n able to declare ; and, though delighting in cemeteries, covered\n with ashes, and adorned with human bones and serpents, he is\n the creator, the provider, and the preserver. It was alone through\n the favor of Rudra [Shiva] that Indra obtained heaven ; through\n the will, also, of Rudra, Brahma creates ; and, were it not for\n Rudra, how could Vishnu have the power to preserve ? If,\n therefore, I have derived might from my devotion, and if I be\n beloved by Rudra, since thou hast despised him, this sacrifice\n shall be undoubtedly destroyed.\u2019 Having thus spoken, Sati fixed\n her mind in profound abstraction, and by her own splendor con-\n sumed her body, while all the immortals exclaimed in astonish-\n ment, * How wonderful ! \u2019 On being informed of this event,\n Shiva, much afflicted, collected myriads of ghosts, goblins, and\n demons, and hastened to Daksha\u2019s place of sacrifice ; which he\n completely destroyed, after having vanquished all the immortals\n that opposed him.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n From the Skanda Puran, the Chapter entitled u Kapardi\n Mahatmyam .\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n GANESA CREATED.\n</p>\n<p>\n Shiva , addressing Parvati : \u2014 \u201c Formerly, during the twilight\n that intervened between the Dwapara and Kali Yugs, women,\n</p>\n<p>\n 17\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0262/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0262/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0262/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0262/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0262/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0262/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0262.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 680742}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"262\">\n<p>\n 258\n</p>\n<p>\n SPECIMENS OF THE SHASTERS.\n</p>\n<p>\n barbarians, Sudras, and other workers of sin, obtained en-\n trance into heaven by visiting the celebrated temple of Somesh-\n wara.

The juice of the plant,\n mixed with barley and other ingredients, becomes, by fermenta-\n tion, a very intoxicating liquor. The officiating Brahmins are to\n drink this liquor as a part of the performance. The sacrifice\n continues several weeks, and is accompanied by numerous aus\n terities which endanger the lives of the worshippers.\n</p>\n<p>\n Tuka Rama, a sage who fiourished about three hundred years\n ago, speaks of muzzling the animals used in carting the moon-\n plant, and of beating them to death by the fists of the Brahmins.\n His verses are to the following effect : \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Beat to death the ram you\u2019ve muzzled,\n</p>\n<p>\n And offer the Soma with sacred song : \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n So they say ; but yet I\u2019m puzzled,\n</p>\n<p>\n And half suspect such worship wrong ;\n</p>\n<p>\n For rites like these are at best but scurvy,\n</p>\n<p>\n That turn religion topsy-turvy.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In the Sama Yeda, there is a series of about a thousand verses,\n designed to be chanted or sung at the moon-plant sacrifice. The\n following extracts will serve as specimens.

Then Rahu, as Isha would not break\n silence, thus addressed Nandi: \u2018Thou art a minister and a\n general, and canst therefore inform me what means this departure\n from all received usages ; as it is not becoming that a prince, to\n whom an ambassador is sent, should preserve silence.\u2019 But\n Nandi replied not, and immediately, on a sign from Shiva,\n reconducted and dismissed Rahu, who hastened to Jalandhara\n and related to him all that had passed.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c The mighty Jalandhara, having heard the relation of his am-\n bassador, immediately arrayed his army and marched forward.\n Then the tumult of his approaching forces resounded through\n the inmost recesses of Mandara ; and wide was it spread by the\n echoes of Meru, while lions started from their dens; warlike\n instruments with their clangor, dear to the warrior, deafened the\n three worlds ; and, as trod the mighty Danavas, the lofty moun-\n tains trembled, and the seas were agitated. The armor ot\n warriors clashed as on they marched, borne on various vehicles ;\n and the wheels of the war-chanots harsh grated along the\n ground. White umbrellas shaded the mighty host from the sun,\n and fans formed of peacocks\u2019 feathers prevented heat. From the\n innumerable elephants, cars, horse, and foot, arose clouds of dust,\n which spread over the sky like the blue lotos, or the dark billows\n of the heaving ocean. * * * Then Nandi and Shumbha\n</p>\n<p>\n showered arrows on each other thick as the leaves are strown on\n Mandara when storms agitate its trees.

Ali, the caliph, was beloved by his\n subjects, but fell by the hand of an assassin, and the regal power\n was usurped by his bitterest enemy, who failed in his design of\n murdering the young princes, Hussein and Hassan. When the\n usurper died, he was succeeded by his son Yezzed, during whose\n reign a plot was formed to restore the house of Ali to the throne,\n and trusty messengers were despatched to Medina to invite Hus-\n sein to invade the kingdom, and to assure him that the faithful\n were anxious to throw off the yoke of their tyrant, and acknowh\n edge him as their rightful sovereign. The prince did not hesitate\n to comply with the invitation, and collecting a small army, headed\n them in person, taking his family with him. Yezzed, being in\n formed of his movements, sent a large army to meet him, which,\n having taken a position between Hussein and the River Eu-\n phrates, entirely cut off his supply of water. The consequence\n was, that, without coming to action, most of his followers forsook\n him, and fled; so that, in a short time, he numbered only seventy-\n two persons in his train, most of these being relatives. Still, with\n this little band, Hussein performed the most extraordinary feats\n of valor ; but on the tenth day of Mohurrum, they were entirely\n surrounded by ten thousand of Yezzed\u2019s troops, and every one\n cut in pieces, Asher, the infant son of Hussein, being butchered\n in his father\u2019s arms. The head of Hussein was carried to Da-\n mascus, and laid at the feet of Yezzed. By the harangues of the\n priests and the scenic representations, such as the horses of Hus-\n sein and his brother covered with gashes and stuck full of arrows,\n cimeters and turbans stained with blood, and pigeons (which car-\n ried the sad news to Medina) with their beaks clotted with gore,\n the minds of the spectators are often excited to a state of frenzy\n bordering on madness, when they sometimes inflict wounds upon\n themselves and others, and in some instances many have been\n slain. Those who are strict in the observance of this festival\n endure great privations by an almost total abstinence from water\n during the ten days which the Mohurrum continues. Vast sums\n are lavished upon the scenic representations, and the public mind\n is greatly demoralized by the revengeful and bloodthirsty feeling\n which are engendered.\n</p>\n<p>\n Th3 Mohammedans have no system of caste ; yet their inter\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0279/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0279/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0279/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0279/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0279/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0279/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0279.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 598221}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"279\">\n<p>\n SERVANTS -PETTY THEFTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 275\n</p>\n<p>\n course with Hindus has led them to imagine that they have, and\n this is often productive of much inconvenience in families. where\n they are employed as servants. In India, servants are a heavy\n burden upon the mind, and a great tax upon the purse.

These men carry silver wands before the palam\n keen of their master, and bear letters or messages from on\n person to another. All persons who make any pretensions t(\n gentility employ a khansammah or house steward, a dhurwhan or\n doorkeeper, an abdar or water cooler, a sherabdar or wine man-\n ager, six or eight khitmutgars or waiters at table, a sirdar-bearer\n and eight others to carry the palankeen, two or three bobajses or\n cooks, bheesties or water carriers, mhaters or sweepers, out-of-\n door servants, grooms, etc., etc., to a great number. Families in\n the middle rank of life are also obliged to keep a large number of\n servants. Even missionaries, who endeavor to do with as few as\n possible, are under the necessity of employing a bobajee, bearer,\n khitmutgar, mhater, dhurwhan, syce, grasscut, and dhobee or\n washerman. The salary of these averages about two dollars per\n month.

I told him that I should\n be heartily glad of that, as he subsisted by fraud and deceit, and\n was the means of riveting the cruel fetters which bound the poor\n infatuated beings around him. At this juncture, a European\n frend, who had long been a resident in India, passed, and hearing\n the pleadings of the fakeer, to my great surprise most heartily\n seconded them, declaring his belief that it was dangerous to cut\n down the peepul tree, as he had heard of instances where those\n who had done so had died shortly afterwards. Some other rea-\n sons which he urged I thought more conclusive j but before I\n retired, I broke off another twig, to show him, as well as the\n fakeer. that I had no superstitious reverence for the tree, and told\n the latter that, unless the branches were so secured as not to in-\n terfere with those who passed beneath them, I should still carry\n my threat into effect. The next morning, I was waited upon by\n one of the richest Baboos in Calcutta, who most respectfully en-\n treated me not to cut a single branch of the sacred peepul, prom-\n ising that forthwith the boughs should be raised high enough to\n admit a free passage under them. This was accordingly done by\n ropes drawing them upwards, and stout posts supporting them\n from below. The reasons of my friend, which had weighi with\n me, were these : The Honorable Company were averse to any\n acts of violence being used to the destruction of idolatrous usages,\n and probably, should I persevere, such an excitement would be\n produced by the influential natives as to call for the notice of\n government, and perhaps I should be sent from India on account\n of my rashness, (as it would no doubt be termed ;) and even\n should ' this not be the case, such prejudices would be formed in\n the minds of the natives against me personally as to preclude all\n hopes of my usefulness in future.

One of these animals, in passing through the bazaar,\n sudd3nly came upon a man sleeping in the path ; when, rather\n than crush him beneath its foot, the careful animal rolled him over\n with its trunk, and placed him out of danger. The man awoke\n in a terrible state of alarm ; but the elephant acted with the\n greatest coolness and caution. Whenever a branch of a tree\n hangs in the way of the howdah, although the elephant itself\n might pass under it, yet, knowing it would incommode its master,\n the considerate beast seizes it, and rends it off, that no incon-\n venience may be sustained by its rider. Whenever an elephant\n scents a tiger, which it can do at a considerable distance, it utters\n a shrill cry, and elevates its trunk perpendicularly to repel the at-\n tack. The leaps which the tiger makes in its charge are truly\n astonishing ; yet a well-trained elephant will generally succeed in\n repelling the most furious attack, by dashing the springing tiger\n to the earth with its trunk ; when, if its foe be at all stunned or\n maimed by the fall, or wounded by the rifle of the sportsman, the\n ponderous foot of the mighty beast will crush the fallen victim,\n and complete its destruction. But, in most instances, a well-\n directed ball stops the career of the tiger before he reaches the\n point of attack. When an elephant turns from the contest, the\n life of its rider is in danger, as the tiger can easily climb up in\n the rear, and seize the person in the howdah before he can turn\n to defend himself. A few years since, a party of Europeans,\n consisting of indigo planters and some of the officers of a native\n regiment stationed in their neighborhood, went into the jungles for\n the purpose of shooting tigers, and had not proceeded far before\n they roused an immense tigress, which, with the greatest intre-\n pidity, charged the line of elephants on which they were seated,\n when a female elephant, in the direct point of attack, which had\n been lately purchased, and was hitherto untried, turned suddenly\n around, to fly from the field of battle, showing the greatest dread\n of the approaching foe. The tigress instantly sprang upon her\n back, and seizing the gentleman in the howdah by the thigh,\n brought him to the ground ; then, throwing him, stunned by the\n fall, over her shoulder, just as a fox carries a goose, she started\n off into the jungle. Every rifle was pointed at her, but no one\n dared to fire on account of the position in which her captive lay.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0295/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0295/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0295/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0295/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0295/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0295/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0295.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 606386}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"295\">\n<p>\n REMARKABLE RESCUE FROM THE JAWS OF A TIGRESS 291\n</p>\n<p>\n She went through the jungle grass much faster than the elephants\n could, and was soon out of sight ; but her pursuers were enabled\n to trace her by the blood in her track ; and as a forlorn hope, they\n resolved stil. to follow on, to see if it were possible to save the\n remains of their friend from being devoured.

With the greatest\n self-possession, he maintained his position. At length, the snake,\n poking its head into the sleeve of the gentleman\u2019s white jacket,\n began to ascend his arm ; still not a muscle moved, not a feature\n was altered : soon the reptile emerged from the sleeve at the\n collar, when the movement of his friend, alarming it, caused it\n to descend his back to the ground, where it was soon killed.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0297/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 268}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0297/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 536}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0297/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 635, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1073}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0297/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2146}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0297/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4293}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:di:ai:ts:in:ha:bi:ta:00:wr:ig:_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0:indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0297/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/di/ai/ts/in/ha/bi/ta/00/wr/ig/_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0/indiaitsinhabita00wrig_0_0297.jp2", "height": 4293, "width": 2543, "levels": 6, "size": 321742}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"297\">\n<p>\n ATTACKED BY A WHIP SNAKE.\n</p>\n<p>\n 293\n</p>\n<p>\n Had not the gentleman manifested this self-possession, he would\n have alarmed the snake, which, for self-defence, would no doubt\n have seized the object of its terror.\n</p>\n<p>\n The whip snake is another venomous and most dangerous rep-\n tile.

The Brahmin declined, on the ground\n that his lotah would be rendered unclean by the touch of the\n thirsty and low-caste man. \u201c You are very particular about\n your caste to-day,\u201d rejoined the other with a sneer ; \u201c but you\n don\u2019t mind biting cartridges that are made up with animal fat.\u201d\n The Brahmin, in an agony of shame and terror, inquired the\n meaning of this startling accusation, and was informed that the\n cartridges given out for the new Enfield rifles were made up with\n pigs\u2019 or bullocks\u2019 fat. The story spread with the rapidity of\n fire in a stack-yard, and the credulous sepoys, both Hindu and\n Mohammedan, readily believed that a covert attempt was being\n made to undermine their respective religions. It is needless to\n insist upon the absurdity of the idea : they were convinced of\n its truth, and could not be persuaded that, although the car-\n tridge paper might be glazed, it was not greased. In every\n regiment there is always a certain number of chattering mis-\n chief-makers, who obtain a sort of importance by seeing farther\n through a millstone than their neighbors. These fellows were,\n of course, delighted with the semblance of an excuse for their\n mysterious nods, shrugs, and words of dark meaning. They\n pounced upon the fable of the cartridges like vultures upon\n carrion, and served it up in all quarters with various embellish-\n ments. The first consequence was a refusal on the part of the\n 19th N. I., stationed at Berhampore, to make use of the new\n cartridges.

The insurgents having opened\n upon the advanced parties with their heavy guns, two more\n companies of the 60th were sent forward to support them, while\n four guns of Captain Scott\u2019s battery, the sappers, and a troop of\n carabineers, also went into action. The enemy\u2019s guns, though\n well handled, were speedily silenced by the greater accuracy\n and rapidity of the European artillery.

One night, the troopers galloped into the in-\n fantry lines, crying aloud that the Europeans were at hand.\n The infantry regiments rose, wounded some of their officers,\n set fire to the bungalows, advanced upon the guns, and then\n made off for the Sutlej.

Their good will to the British\n government was, moreover, practically evinced by the readiness\n with which they enlisted, and the valor they subsequently dis-\n played. From the Derajat alone, 2000 horsemen responded to\n the summons of Colonel Edwardes ; and old Sikh artillerymen,\n who fought so admirably at Sobraon and Goozerat, now volun-\n tarily tendered their services to their conquerors.
