Thus the phenomena are self-induced , and\n the Theory of Pathetism is demonstrated, whatever the\n agent may be supposed to be. It is the thought , the\n belief the idea in the mind of the patient, which con\u00ac\n stitutes the proximate cause. Thus it was in the case\n of Perkins\u2019s Tractors, Mesmerism, \u201cMagnetic passes.\u201d\n Thus, Reichenbach talked his notion of the \u201c od \u201d into\n the minds of the nervous women upon whom he op\u00ac\n erated ; and thus it is, often, that the idea of \u201c spirits \u201d\n is worked into people, until they are completely \u201c pos\u00ac\n sessed,\u201d \u201c impressed,\u201d and carried away with that belief,\n and, in that state of things, it becomes an easy matter\n for such persons to sink into a state of trance, more or\n less strange and abnormal it may be.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some historical account of the manner in which my\n mind was put upon this investigation, and also some\n account of the phenomena which resulted from my\n method of operating in public, has now been given.\n But as this question of method must be kept in view in\n order to come at another, still higher, in respect to Use,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0027/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 259, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 448}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0027/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 519, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 896}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0027/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1038, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1793}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0027/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2076, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3586}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0027/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/an/ce/co/rr/el/at/iv/00/su/nd/trancecorrelativ00sund/trancecorrelativ00sund_0027.jp2", "height": 3586, "width": 2076, "levels": 6, "size": 407619}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"27\">\n<p>\n HISTORICAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n 21\n</p>\n<p>\n it may be necessary to give the facts somewhat more in\n detail.

In \u201cNeurol\u00ac\n ogy,\u201d you must touch your patient, in some form. So\n in \u201c Hypnotism,\u201d you must have the sense of sight , and\n the patient must fix his eyes upon something. But not\n so (necessarily) with Pathetism; it produces results,\n and tells how they are produced, when no conditions\n whatever are required of the patient!\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.

And here is my answer to that notice: \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Charlestown, Jan. 2, 1844.\n</p>\n<p>\n To Mr. George P. Oakes. Dear Sir: Yours of yesterday\n has been received, in which you inform me that the audience\n assembled the last evening at the Tremont Temple to listen to a\n</p>\n<p>\n lecture by Rev.-, adopted the following preamble\n</p>\n<p>\n and resolution, viz.:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Whereas, Mr.-intends to make an attack to-morrow\n</p>\n<p>\n evening upon the system of LaRoy Sunderland, who has lectured\n in this city on Pathetism, therefore,\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Resolved, That it is the desire of this audience that Mr. Sun\u00ac\n derland have the liberty to meet here and defend himself against\n such attack; and that the difference in their views be fairly dis\u00ac\n cussed, and the difference in their experiments be fully exhibited.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In reply to this and other implied invitations to engage in a pub\u00ac\n lic controversy on the subject of Pathetism, I have to observe, \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. That my Theory is before the world, not only in the second\n volume of the Magnet, but also in my work on Pathetism, pub\u00ac\n lished nearly a year since. Those who wish for information on\n that Theory will of course consult my work, or attend my own\n lectures, in which it is my object to explain it. They will not\n receive the second hand, and, in many cases, erroneous reports\n of my lectures or experiments, made by those who do not under\u00ac\n stand what my views are, or the nature of the facts and argu\u00ac\n ments by which they are supported.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The \u201c difference \u201d between my experiments and those per\u00ac\n formed by such as do not understand my theory, could not well\n be exhibited to advantage during the excitement of a public con\u00ac\n troversy. If the reality of my experiments be admitted, the\n opposite theory falls to the ground; but the effects of a debate\n on a promiscuous audience would render it very difficult for me\n to operate on any considerable number of persons who had never\n been affected by this agency before. And, it is easy to see, that\n the question at issue must be settled by facts, by experiments,\n and not by a dispute between two theorists.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

Since this gentleman\n began to write on this subject, and especially since the com\u00ac\n mencement of his lectures in this city, I have felt an interest in\n it which I never felt before, and have examined it critically, with\n such helps as were at hand.

As \u201c Plain Dealing \u201d appears to be in the dark as to the\n matters referred to by him, and as his erroneous statements are\n evidently calculated to mislead those not familiar with the facts\n in the case, I have taken some pains to inform myself, and will\n now, with your permission, proceed to state the results.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. Mr. Sunderland does not claim originality in the discovery\n of the susceptibility of the cerebral organs to excitement by\n external applications. This discovery was made by Professor\n Muller, some years ago. He excited all the senses by galvanism,\n as may be seen by his work on Human Physiology, and also by\n Walker\u2019s Pathology, page 131.

The aston\u00ac\n ishing developments of the lecturer\u2019s arts in other places induced us to\n attend to witness for ourself performances so mingled with the mar\u00ac\n vellous, and to gather facts, if any should be presented which would\n interest our readers. . . . Sunderland repudiates the theory of his\n</p>\n<p>\n predecessors, scouts at electricity as being the agent of somnambu\u00ac\n lism, and the idea of an invisible fluid passing from one to another;\n and he laughs to scorn those pretenders who can only work by friction.\n He commenced by some general remarks on the laws which govern\n mind, and spoke of the importance of his subject, as necessary to be\n understood by all classes of the people, especially the clergy, as it illus\u00ac\n trated the influence of sympathy on the susceptibilities common to all\n human beings. It was of vital importance to parents and teachers of\n children, that they may be able to make good impressions on the minds\n of those under their control. The lecturer continued, . . . and\n</p>\n<p>\n whether from sympathy with a poor sleeper who sat near to us, or some\n other cause inexplicable to us, we began to feel a strong sensation run\u00ac\n ning down our right arm, which made it rather difficult to hold a pen\u00ac\n cil ; we changed our position, but the influence, real or fanciful, kept\n hold of us, and we thought, on the whole, it would be as prudent to\n escape from the magic circle.

During some of these nocturnal excursions, I\n opened a dormer window, and crawled out thence to the very apex of\n the roof! On one of these occasions, after getting on the top of the\n house, I was awakened by a slight shower of rain, and it was with diffi\u00ac\n culty I made a safe descent by way of the next neighbor\u2019s house, which\n obliged me to rouse the family in order to get back to my bed again.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c The most singular feat, however, that I performed in the somnam\u00ac\n bulic state, was a situation that I got into, out of which I could not\n extricate myself again in a waking state, neither could I, upon trial,\n without the assistance of something to step on first, get into it again.\n The room in which I slept at this time had in it an old-fashioned cradle\n of double length, made for twin babes. This was placed upon a long,\n narrow keg, which stood on its ends, so that when standing alongside\n of it, the sides of the cradle came within two inches of my chin, and it\n was so poised, that a slight preponderance either way would capsize it.\n During one of my nocturnal perambulations in the middle of the night,\n by some means I got into this cradle, without the assistance of any\n thing that would enable me to step up, save some strange, inexplicable\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0131/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 253, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 446}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0131/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 507, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 892}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0131/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1014, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1785}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0131/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2028, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3570}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0131/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/an/ce/co/rr/el/at/iv/00/su/nd/trancecorrelativ00sund/trancecorrelativ00sund_0131.jp2", "height": 3570, "width": 2028, "levels": 6, "size": 458746}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"131\">\n<p>\n PHILOSOPHICAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n 125\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2022cause.

Although I w T ould answer questions, and\n talk freely on subjects that were indicated by my conduct, yet it was\n next to impossible to waken me by any other process than the applica\u00ac\n tion of cold water. After a more advanced age, these symptoms have\n taken a different form, my nightly perambulations being confined to my\n chamber, and they are more particularly connected with the organs of\n hearing and vision. It does appear that, like the inner vision without\n the aid of the external eye, there is also a distinct faculty of hearing,\n independent of the external ear. This has been experienced by per\u00ac\n sons of my acquaintance. I have frequently hastened to the place from\n whence sounds appeared to come. Generally it appears to be the call\u00ac\n ing of my name, by persons whose voice I can recognize ; but the most\n frequent delusions are through the eye. These symptoms, from their\n frequency, although not fearful in themselves, have been of late a\n source of annoyance, and they always occur in a half-waking condition.\n The clearer and smoother the chamber in which I sleep, the less am I\n annoyed with these delusions. Of these symptoms and their opera\u00ac\n tions, I have a tolerable distinct recollection afterwards. I generally\n find myself sitting up in bed, in the act of getting up and moving\n towards the objects, which mostly appear to be human beings, and often\n persons of my acquaintance. Although this happens to me in a half\u00ac\n waking condition, still I possess the faculty of reasoning within myself\n upon the necessity of not minding these delusions, but seldom become\n perfectly satisfied until I get up and try to touch the object; but inva\u00ac\n riably get awake on being touched by another person.

I have in my work on Human Nature\n attempted to show, that there are, strictly speaking, but\n three organs of external sense, corresponding with\n man\u2019s triune nature, Feeling , Sight , and Hearing.\n Smell and Taste are Functions of Feeling. Dr. B. Rush\n wrote an Essay on \u201c The Moral Sense; \u201d and Whewell,\n in his Philosophy of the Inductive Sciences, has argued\n the existence of a \u201c Muscular Sense,\u201d which was taught\n also by Dr. T. Brown, of Edinburgh. But if the rea\u00ac\n soning be relied upon for deducing the existence of\n these separate Senses, I do not see why we may not go\n on and prove that man has as many separate senses as\n he has distinct mental Faculties. Man has the \u201c God\u00ac\n like \u201d Faculty of Reason, which distinguishes him above\n all other animals. But, is there a Sense of Reason?\n And if so, what is its distinct external organ? I do\n not suppose the \u201c Moral Sense \u201d to depend exclusively\n on one Faculty of the Mind. It is peculiar to man, as\n the sense of Righteousness or Justice is peculiar to him.\n But, the sense of Right, it seems to me, partakes, more\n or less, of the entire mental constitution. One may have\n what is denominated \u201cConscientiousness,\u201d very large.\n But, if other Faculties (Reason, Benevolence, Acquis\u00ac\n itiveness) do not yield to the demands of Justice, his\n moral sense must be feeble in proportion to these cor\u00ac\n respondences.\n</p>\n<p>\n What we denominate the External Senses, depend on\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0139/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 253, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 446}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0139/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 507, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 892}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0139/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1014, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1785}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0139/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2028, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3570}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0139/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/an/ce/co/rr/el/at/iv/00/su/nd/trancecorrelativ00sund/trancecorrelativ00sund_0139.jp2", "height": 3570, "width": 2028, "levels": 6, "size": 402984}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"139\">\n<p>\n PHILOSOPHICAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n 133\n</p>\n<p>\n certain Physiological and Pathological conditions.

A gentleman of my\n acquaintance gives the following account of his own\n case. It is interesting, as it seems to show that we are\n most apt to dream of subjects impressed upon our minds\n in youth, when the memory is most tenacious. We\n should suppose that in the plastic state of the brains,\n when in the process of growth, subjects would be likely\n to make the most lasting impressions on the pages of\n memory. And hence it is that we dream accurately of\n things we saw or felt in early life, although those things\n have long since changed or passed away; but we do\n not now see them in our dreams as they now are, but\n as they were years ago, when they first made impres\u00ac\n sions upon our memory.\n</p>\n<p>\n The gentleman here referred to is now fifty-seven\n years of age, and ever since he was about eight years\n old he has dreamed of Mary, who was his playmate for\n a year or two.

The disease was\n considered to be progressing favorably, when he was\n seized with a sudden spasm, and died of suffocation.\n The coincidence between the stoppage of the watch\n and the death of the brother, is the most perplexing\n circumstance of the case, since the mere stopping of the\n watch, or the death of the brother, might have been\n explained on very rational principles; or had the watch\n stopped before or after the death of the brother, it\n might have been easily supposed to have been forgotten\n 18 *\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0216/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 249, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 438}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0216/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 499, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 876}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0216/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 998, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1752}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0216/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1996, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3505}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0216/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/an/ce/co/rr/el/at/iv/00/su/nd/trancecorrelativ00sund/trancecorrelativ00sund_0216.jp2", "height": 3505, "width": 1996, "levels": 6, "size": 370420}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"216\">\n<p>\n 210\n</p>\n<p>\n PATHETISM.\n</p>\n<p>\n to be wound up; or it may have suffered some injury\n from the hurry and trepidation incidental to anguish\n and bereavement, but as the case is related, it is cer\u00ac\n tainly a most extraordinary, surprising, and mysterious\n incident.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the Life of Sir Henry Wotten, by Isaac Walton,\n there is a dream related of Sir Henry\u2019s father, Thomas\n Wotten.

Hence it is, a child like Zerah Colburn or W. H.\n Safford, having those portions of the brains whose func\u00ac\n tions give a knowledge of the relations of space and\n numbers, sufficiently large to make a perfect develop\u00ac\n ment, will be able to solve mathematical problems in\u00ac\n tuitively, without mental labor; or as nearly so as their\n appropriate mental organs approach what may be called\n a state of perfection.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the head of Ole Bull, the musical organs will be\n found approaching that state, and hence the manifest\n ease with which, from a child, he was known to com\u00ac\n prehend the science of music.

A state of precocity is a\n state of maturity, which is the soonest followed by\n decay and death. 3. And, another fact important to be\n known follows, viz., that serious injuries are liable to be\n suffered in the nervous system, whenever this Intuitive\n or Clairvoyant Function is abnormally excited or arti\u00ac\n ficially called into action. Its normal exercise is not\n under the volition of any one; when it acts, its action\n is spontaneous, precisely as Instinct is. Hence, to at\u00ac\n tempt to excite this occult function artificially, for med\u00ac\n ical and other purposes, must be attended with danger.\n The mediums, or persons thus operated upon, become\n deranged in the nervous functions.

Such cases as result from sympathy, when the pa\u00ac\n tient is in sympathetic communication with another\n person; he becomes cognizant of what is passing in\n another mind (to a certain extent) and describes what\n appertains to him. 2.

The first experiment of the kind in\n music was successful. Mr. Peale could not be seen by\n her, for she was blind; and he could not touch her, for\n he was some three yards distance from the piano; nor\n could any signs be addressed to her sense of hearing\n while she was actually engaged in singing and playing\n upon the piano. And yet, in the midst of a strain, at a\n signal made to Mr. Peale by one of the spectators, Mary\n w T ould be stopped on a particular note; and, holding the\n music where Mr. Peale could see the notes, Mary was\n thus made, by mere volition, to alternate from one note\n to another in different tunes, until she had sung and\n performed the whole three or four pieces.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4.

Conditions of Clairvoyance. We learn, from an\n examination of the best cases of clairvoyance, some\u00ac\n thing which appeals to our caution in respect to what\n may or may not be hoped for in the exercise of this\n function. It is to be borne in mind, then, that the ex\u00ac\n ercise of this clairvoyant power is limited, like other\n mental faculties, by time and space. Beyond a certain\n distance, no communications can be made to either of\n the external senses. To converse by words, or by signs,\n as in speech and writing, the parties must be within a\n given space always. And if this remark be true of\n ordinary communications, it is equally so in respect to\n the distance at which a mere thought can be read,\n where there is no use by either party of the external\n senses. Ordinary communications have respect to light\n and sound. Beyond a certain distance, no object can\n be seen, no sound can be heard. And so it is in clair\u00ac\n voyance, the sense which is active in thought reading\n corresponds with light and heat , and the conditions\n upon which heat is known to radiate. Two bodies\n brought into contact, one cold and the other hot, the\n caloric is transferred from one to the other in propor\u00ac\n tion as they approximate. Separate them, and the\n transfer ceases; that is, when the separation is out of\n proportion with the sphere, largeness, and heat-con\u00ac\n taining and heat-conducting qualities, the transfer\n ceases. The amount of heat transferred depends on\n the proximity, and other conditions. And so, always,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0253/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 248, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 447}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0253/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 497, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 894}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0253/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 994, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1789}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0253/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1988, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3578}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0253/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/an/ce/co/rr/el/at/iv/00/su/nd/trancecorrelativ00sund/trancecorrelativ00sund_0253.jp2", "height": 3578, "width": 1988, "levels": 6, "size": 392176}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"253\">\n<p>\n PHILOSOPHICAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n ' 247\n</p>\n<p>\n the transfer of thought depends not merely on the pre\u00ac\n viously-established Relation, but also on the proximity\n of the physical spheres of the parties.

The clairvoyant sense is, also, spontaneous; and it\n is active, without the trance.

The legitimate use of clairvoyance is the gratifica\u00ac\n tion of the normal wants of the organism in which it is\n developed. And it is a remarkable fact, that this sense\n when first noticed and named lucidity or clairvoyance\n by M. Puysegur, its exercise by the somnambulist was\n confined to a description of his own case. It was in\n this way that this sense first attracted attention, under\n the observations of Puysegur, Deluze, and others in\n Paris, about seventy or eighty years ago. And long\n after it was ascertained that somnambulists were some\u00ac\n times clairvoyant of their own complaints, curiosity\n was excited to see if the somnambule might not also be\n lucid enough to see and prescribe the best remedies for\n other diseases besides his own. In this manner it was,\n that the practice of clairvoyant diagnosis came into\n vogue.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The clairvoyant sense, in its best cases, is exceed\u00ac\n ingly limited in its sphere of range of objects. Deluze\n mentions the case of an excellent clairvoyant in Paris,\n who prognosticated the recovery of a patient, and who\n was himself killed by an accident some days before the\n fulfilment of his own prediction. Thus, although clair\u00ac\n voyance could foretell the recovery of the patient on a\n certain day in the future, it could not take within its\n scope the death of the clairvoyant himself, which was\n to happen, even before the events which he had accu\u00ac\n rately foretold. And what was true of this case is true\n of all cases of real clairvoyance. The sphere of this\n power is limited, not in one case, but in all.

To this I reply, that it is not true that all dogs\n have this instinctive power; and those which have the\n most of it are limited in its exercise by time and space.\n No dog is able to follow the trail after the lapse of a\n few hours; the atmosphere makes such changes as puts\n it beyond the power of the dog to scent game, or the\n steps of his master. Nor is this all: this instinctive\n function in the dog is adapted only to the supply of his\n own wants and the conservation of his own nature as a\n dog. And thus it is as to this use of the psychometric\n sense. All there is of Intuition in the human species, I\n suppose to be necessary for the conservation of the\n organisms in which this sense is found. And hence\n Anthropology affords no authority for supposing that\n there is in man a function for \u201cmeasuring\u201d human\n character in the manner assumed by psychometry.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. This notion in respect to a nervous fluid elimi\u00ac\n nated upon the paper in writing one\u2019s name, has nothing\n in facts, science, or philosophy, on which to rest. It is\n improbable and absurd. Mental qualities attach to the\n mind, and not to a piece of paper, as such. Corre\u00ac\n spondences may be traced between the writing, or the\n work a man does, and some of his mental traits. But\n this correspondence is quite circumscribed, and it cannot\n therefore be relied upon for a knowledge of the entire\n character. But this correspondence is not recognized\n in psychometry; the substance relied upon in these\n experiments is not a sight of the writing, but simply\n contact with the paper on which the signature is written.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4.

About six o\u2019clock there appeared\n also walking figures, which had no connection with the first.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c I cannot assign any other cause for all this than a continued\n rumination on the vexations I had endured, which, though\n calmer, I could not forget, and the consequences of which I med\u00ac\n itated to counteract. These agitations occupied my mind three\n hours after dinner, just when digestion commenced.

I observed these phantasms very closely, and\n frequently reflected on my antecedent thoughts, to discover, if\n possible, by means of what association exactly these forms pre\u00ac\n sented themselves to my imagination.

It is\n education that fills up these deformed angles with the moral\n attributes, and exerts an influence in producing an harmonious\n circle; and these, he remarked, are the practical purposes and\n the elements of Pathetism, which has to do w ' ith the perfection\n of the human character, and the highest influences of the mind.\n</p>\n<p>\n We now began to witness some of the mental influences; a\n young and beautiful lady arose from amidst the audience, with\n eyes closed and arms extended, and slowly approached the\n speaker, w ' ho took her by the hand, and directed her to a seat.\n He remarked that he could control persons as well with eyes\n open as shut, only that in the former state, they might be dis\u00ac\n turbed by external effects, and thereby affect his influence. As\n his experiments were the sympathy or action of mind with mind,\n he cautioned the auditors against annoying any one who might\n seem to be under his influence, by any conversation or sugges\u00ac\n tions, for fear of arresting their attention, and thereby disturb,\n and perhaps interrupt the experiments. The lecturer again fixed\n his attention steadily upon the audience, and after the lapse of a\n few minutes, questioned the young lady on the platform.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Can you see any one endeavoring to respond to me ? \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Ans. \u201c I do.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Quest. \u201c What more is required ? \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Ans. \u201c They want a little more light.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Sunderland. \u201c They shall certainly have it; now ' you call\n them ; speak to them.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The young lady arose, stretched forth her arms, and several\n others among the audience began to respond to her mental\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0322/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 249, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 438}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0322/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 499, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 876}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0322/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 998, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1752}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0322/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1996, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3505}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0322/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/an/ce/co/rr/el/at/iv/00/su/nd/trancecorrelativ00sund/trancecorrelativ00sund_0322.jp2", "height": 3505, "width": 1996, "levels": 6, "size": 456304}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"322\">\n<p>\n 316\n</p>\n<p>\n PATHETISM.\n</p>\n<p>\n imitation by arising, and slowly and indifferently approaching, the\n platform in a state of trance.

The body of the house\n was crowded. The presence of so many beautiful women, and\n the extraordinary experiments of the lecturer, rendered the scene\n truly one of fascination and enchantment. Mr. Sunderland very\n clearly explained his theory of mind, and his mode of demon\u00ac\n strating its truthfulness, by bringing forth the results which had\n been witnessed by so many ' thousands of people in this city. He\n considered very fully the peculiar state of mind necessary to pro\u00ac\n duce happiness, in what happiness consists. There were three\n states of mind indicated by the three colors in his circle, they\n being the primitive colors, red, yellow, and blue; the former\n indicating the intellectual, the second the social, and the third the\n emotional. These were correspondents of the three elements of\n the mind; the harmonious developments of these conditions\n constituted happiness. Pathetism is continually productive of\n goodness; it exercised its influence over the mind warped by\n ignorance; it exercised an active influence on those portions of\n the brain that were feeble, and its continued power was felt in\n minds angular till they were developed in perfect and harmonious\n circles.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Sunderland remarked, that as relates to the subject of\n Pathetism, there were many sceptics, and many indulged the\n belief that witchcraft and sorcery had more to do with it than any\n philosophy of the mind. Upon the subject of belief, Mr. Sun\u00ac\n derland alluded to those who read and believed in certain reli\u00ac\n gious dogmas, upon -which different people were divided in\n opinion. If such peculiar dogmas were believed, asked Mr.\n Sunderland, why could not such believe that he could cause the\n results that are seen nightly in this hall, through a corresponding\n state of mind ? Scarcely a night that he has lectured, but thirty,\n forty, or fifty people had been fascinated by him; they had been\n placed in that condition of mind in which there was a sympathy\n with each other; and was not this conclusive proof that there is\n a philosophy for making the human mind, in all cases, what it\n ought to be ?\n</p>\n<p>\n The power that he held over the mind he had repeatedly de\u00ac\n monstrated ; the influence that is felt by one from another had\n been nightly witnessed; he had caused them to dance, to sing, to\n pray, to be merry, and sad. But the purpose of Pathetism was\n to do good to all.

There is, in his discourses and experi\u00ac\n ments, enough to satisfy the mind, please the eye, and charm\n the ear. To a casual observer, we confess there is much in what\n is exhibited to awaken scepticism, although investigation is cer\u00ac\n tain to overthrow it. Some sceptics will allow that the phenom\u00ac\n ena which they witness is real, and they attribute it to a super\u00ac\n natural agency, that being the favorite loophole, from which a\n want of inquiry will easily escape. The nature of the human\n mind, says Mr. Sunderland, is such, that when uninformed, it has\n always been disposed to attribute phenomena that were new and\n strange to supernatural agency. But we shall see that in strict\n philosophy, one mental result is just as supernatural or extraor\u00ac\n dinary as another ; the only difference between what we denomi\u00ac\n nate common or extraordinary phenomena, is, with the former\n we are more familiar, and at the same time the latter class may\n be just as often in their occurrence; but because it may not have\n come in our way to notice them, they seem to us more mysteri\u00ac\n ous, and have to be attributed to supernatural power.\n</p>\n<p>\n Human nature is a system of laws; and so of the mind, when\n we come to dissect it, as it were, and examine its phenomena in\n the light of its own inherent faculty of wisdom, perfectly devel\u00ac\n oped, we shall find what those laws are, and how beautifully they\n all harmonize with every other law in nature and the constitution\n of things. This degree of knowledge is the perfection of the\n human mind, and it is for the want of it that men fear investiga\u00ac\n tion. In speaking of the promulgation of new mental results,\n Mr. Sunderland goes on to say that every human being capable\n of putting forth mental manifestations, may be said by another\n to be fanatical, or in some way or other deluded. We are, says\n he, in one way, believers or sceptics; for what one believes the\n other disbelieves, so that it would be scarcely possible to describe\n or conceive of any fact, idea, emotion, volition, or action, real or\n imaginary, which has not been, or is not now, believed and\n doubted \" by different minds, the world over; and hence a good\n maxim for all would be, in non-essentials, liberty; in essentials,\n free inquiry; and in all things, charity.\n</p>\n<p>\n There were from thirty to forty individuals entranced by him\n every night, and some fifteen or twenty experimented upon, to\n give pleasure and satisfaction to the audience.

To an investi\u00ac\n gating mind, an analysis of the phenomena of Mesmerism and\n Neurology is unusually interesting, as tending to afford a satisfac\u00ac\n tory explanation of the problems of that acute susceptibility of\n mind, the governing laws of which have so long perplexed peo\u00ac\n ple, often more than ordinarily intelligent. The philosophy of\n the mind has been ever a matter of mysticism ; and to exert the\n oontrol \u2014 a control without contact even \u2014 which this learned\n operator undoubtedly does exert, over the minds of men, is\n indeed astonishing. That men of science and deep thought,\n therefore, should be attracted to witness the truly wonderful\n works produced by the lecturer, is not at all surprising. To\n enlighten the understanding on these subjects, Mr. Sunderland\n has devoted years of patient study. He is far in advance of the\n disciples of Mesmer, both in this country and in Europe, and his\n truth and credit cannot be gainsaid. He does not follow the\n beaten path, but has originated an entirely new and truthful\n theory of the functions of the mind, which is demonstrated by\n appeals to the senses as he gradually proceeds in his experi\u00ac\n menting.\n</p>\n<p>\n To deny the practical utility of this science is vain, after the\n extraordinary results which have followed his treatment of affec\u00ac\n tions derived from derangement of the nervous functions, which\n embrace a wide range of diseases, often little heeded, but inevi\u00ac\n tably ending, if not timely checked, in death. A subject in a\n cataleptic state is unaffected by the severest tests that may be\n applied; the senses are deadened, and surgical operations may\n be performed with the greatest ease and safety to the sufferer.\n Frequent witnessing these experiments has led us from scepti\u00ac\n cism to firm belief. We have seen patients undergo surgical\n operations with perfect composure, without the slightest move\u00ac\n ment of a muscle, which, by the usual method, would have pro\u00ac\n duced exceeding agony. \u2014 Boston Daily Whig , Feb. 27, 1846.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0338/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 249, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 438}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0338/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 499, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 876}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0338/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 998, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1752}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0338/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1996, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3505}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0338/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/an/ce/co/rr/el/at/iv/00/su/nd/trancecorrelativ00sund/trancecorrelativ00sund_0338.jp2", "height": 3505, "width": 1996, "levels": 6, "size": 424699}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"338\">\n<p>\n 832\n</p>\n<p>\n PATHETISM.\n</p>\n<p>\n Gratuitous Lectures.\n</p>\n<p>\n On Monday evening, Mr. Sunderland gave one of his highly\n interesting \u201c Intellectual Entertainments \u201d at Tremont Temple, for\n the benefit of the Washington Total Abstinence Society of this\n city.

And,\n sure enough, some considerable time before Mr. Sunderland\n came in, one after another was seen to arise and slowly approach\n the platform, and two gentlemen and one lady were seated upon\n it, besides a number of other cases, of persons in whom the\n trance was equally profound, but who did not leave their seats in\n the audience till some minutes after Mr. Sunderland had arrived.\n</p>\n<p>\n On Saturday evening, Mr. Sunderland reversed somewhat the\n order of proceeding, by actually inducing some eight or ten\n cases of somnambulism, even before the persons on whom the\n influence was exerted had reached the hall. The lecturer arrived\n a few minutes after six, and took his seat on the platform, as\n usual; and such was the great desire of the large audience who\n had assembled, to witness the approach of the sleep-walkers,\n that considerable commotion ensued. At about half past six, a\n young lady was seen entering the hall, with her eyes fast closed,\n the hands extended, and with a slow, and somewhat unnatural\n step she approached the place where Mr. Sunderland was stand\u00ac\n ing, and was seated upon the platform. Next came a gentleman,\n Mr. R., and then another, Mr. 1)., with the eyes closed, some\u00ac\n what awkwardly making their way up the aisle to the lecturer,\n who seated them upon the platform. Soon after, there came two\n more ladies, until there were eight seated upon the rostrum, with\n as many more entranced, promiscuously seated in the audience.\n</p>\n<p>\n After the statement of a few facts, showing the utter falsity of\n the old theories known under the terms of \u201c Mesmerism \u201d or\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0341/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 248, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 447}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0341/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 497, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 894}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0341/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 994, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1789}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0341/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1988, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3578}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0341/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/an/ce/co/rr/el/at/iv/00/su/nd/trancecorrelativ00sund/trancecorrelativ00sund_0341.jp2", "height": 3578, "width": 1988, "levels": 6, "size": 476183}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"341\">\n<p>\n LECTURES.\n</p>\n<p>\n 335\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Neurology,\u201d and proving that these results were not produced\n by any fluid, magnetic or nervous, he proceeded to the develop\u00ac\n ment of a series of the most curious and extraordinary phenom\u00ac\n ena. The patients were first thrown into a state of ecstasy, and\n with their hands clasped and elevated as in a state of devotion,\n they manifested in their countenances and conversation a state\n of mental tranquillity almost superhuman. While in this state,\n Mr. Sunderland drew from them some pieces of music, which\n were most beautifully performed. Next they were transferred\n into what they conceived to be enravishing fields of fruit and\n flowers, and now commenced a most diverting scene, for each\n patient made the motions as if actually gathering flowers, grapes\n from vines, and peaches from the trees, which they seemed to\n taste and eat with the greatest imaginable delight.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Come,\u201d said the lecturer, \u201c go with me in another direction; \u201d\n when, in a few moments, they began to describe every variety of\n wild animals.

The expressions of\n fear, the agitation and tossing about, seemed reality to the life;\n till, in a few minutes, as if the huge animal had actually stum\u00ac\n bled and fallen, and the patients were thrown upon the floor,\n with cries of fear, and complaints of broken bones, which it took\n the operator some time to restore.\n</p>\n<p>\n Other interesting results followed, which were highly gratify\u00ac\n ing to the audience, especially in view of the facts referred to by\n Mr. Sunderland, that neither of those patients had ever been\n manipulated in the usual way, the trance having been induced\n for the first time, by his new process of operating, and they had\n never been operated upon together in that manner before. And,\n what was still more interesting to the audience, and those who\n wished to understand the practical benefits of Pathetism, Mr.\n Sunderland pointed out a number of them who had been most\n remarkably relieved or cured of some nervous disease. One, a\n Mr. A., had been cured of St. Vitus\u2019s dance. Mr. H. had been\n cured of nervous sick headache; and a third was a case of\n amaurosis.

Long before the appointed hour, the house was\n filled, and \u201c expectation stood tiptoe,\u201d to witness the extraordi\u00ac\n nary phenomena promised for the evening. At half past seven,\n the lecturer made his appearance, and immediately commenced\n the experiments, which were brought on while he was explaining\n some few things peculiar to his new theory of mind, denominated\n Pathetism. In the course of fifteen minutes, about a dozen of\n the audience were found to be in a state of trance, and six of the\n number arose, one after another, and walked in a peculiar, un\u00ac\n natural gait up to the platform, and, by the assistance of the\n lecturer, seated themselves upon the sofa. Among those taken\n upon the platform under the power of the charm, was Dr. H. J.\n Payne, the dentist, Mr. Ketchum, and a young man by the name\n of Althiser. The other three ' were ladies. After causing Mr.\n Althiser to dance, and a few other results, Mr. Sunderland pro\u00ac\n ceeded to prepare one of the ladies for a surgical operation, and\n invited the medical faculty, the clergy, and gentlemen of the\n press present, to the platform, for the purpose of having them\n inspect the tooth to be drawn, and notice the manner in which it\n was done. He then took hold of Dr. Payne, (who was still\n under the influence of the spell,) and led him up to the lady\n seated in the chair. And now occurred a sight upon which, prob\u00ac\n ably, mortal eyes never gazed before! It was, to see the som\u00ac\n nambulic doctor in the process of extracting that tooth, while\n both he and the patient were in a state of trance, and neither of\n them able to open their eyes or move a muscle without the con\u00ac\n sent of the lecturer. The tooth was very firmly set, and it re\u00ac\n quired an extraordinary outlay of strength to extract it. The\n lady sat, during the operation, without the slightest manifesta\u00ac\n tion of consciousness, though she is well known to be one of the\n most fearful and timid in her natural state ; so much so, that she\n has been thrown into spasms, it is said, when attempts have been\n made to draw her teeth while she was awake.\n</p>\n<p>\n In a few minutes after, the doctor himself was seated in the\n front chair, the spell still upon him, and another physician pres\u00ac\n ent (Dr. Lyman) proceeded to perform a similar operation upon\n him. It was one of the wisdom teeth, and had grown in such an\n unnatural manner as rendered the extraction exceedingly diffi\u00ac\n cult. Five times the forceps slipped from the tooth, and the\n violence done to the jaw was such that the doctor, we learn, has\n scarcely been able to open his mouth since; and though he de\u00ac\n clared that he suffered no pain at all at the time, it would seem\n that he has since suffered enough to make it up.\n</p>\n<p>\n This experiment was intensely interesting, and highly satisfac-\n</p>\n<p>\n 29\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0344/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 249, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 438}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0344/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 499, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 876}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0344/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 998, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1752}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0344/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1996, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3505}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0344/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/an/ce/co/rr/el/at/iv/00/su/nd/trancecorrelativ00sund/trancecorrelativ00sund_0344.jp2", "height": 3505, "width": 1996, "levels": 6, "size": 453181}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"344\">\n<p>\n 338\n</p>\n<p>\n PATHETISM.\n</p>\n<p>\n tory to the audience; as we suppose it the first and only one of\n the kind ever performed since old Adam was put into the \u201c deep\n sleep,\u201d for the purpose of having the rib taken from his side. \u2014\n Troy Budget, September 23, 1845.\n</p>\n<p>\n Great Revival.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our readers will no doubt recollect of seeing in the Inquirer,\n some months since, an advertisement headed \u201c A Tremendous\n Rush Wanted.\u201d We believe the advertiser was never fully\n gratified in his very laudable desire to have the public rush to his\n store, and purchase his wares.

The house was, as it had\n been on the previous evenings, crowded in every part, and great\n satisfaction was expressed by the audience. On Friday evening,\n among the different experiments exhibited, was one which inter\u00ac\n ested every individual in the room, which consisted in the per\u00ac\n formance of a surgical operation \u2014 the drawing of a tooth from\n the lower jaw of a gentleman while in a state of trance. In\n order that the audience should be satisfied of the perfect cor\u00ac\n rectness of the proceeding, several scientific and medical gentle\u00ac\n men, besides two gentlemen of the press, were called upon the\n stage to witness it. The writer of this paragraph speaks advis\u00ac\n edly, as he was present, and took pains to detect any thing like\n humbug, if it existed, which he failed in doing, after having\n exercised the greatest degree of scrutiny. The tooth, or rather\n the stump of one of the most firmly set in the lower jaw, was\n extracted by Mr. Asay, a skilful dentist, of the city, and in con\u00ac\n sequence of the character of the stump, it was taken out with\n some difficulty, and not until the prongs had been severed, which\n were taken out separately.

He has met prejudice with an\n open front and enlightened argument, and silenced incredulity\n by incontrovertible and demonstrative facts. What follows ?\n Why, that Pathetism is a substantial science, and that Mr. Sun\u00ac\n derland\u2019s theory is in conformity with the laws of actual mental\n and physical existences, and in harmony with the nature of\n things. What he assumed in the outset he has fairly and con\u00ac\n clusively proved at the close. This may not have been equally\n obvious to every understanding present, but there are laws of\n evidence which no bias of the mind can subvert. They are\n independent of all passion, and make facts the witnesses which\n establish, by calm investigation, the omnipotence of truth. It is\n to these that Mr. Sunderland must and does appeal, and through\n their instrumentality the theory which he teaches becomes an\n actuality developed for the cognizance and use of the scientific\n and philanthropic world. The thing is proved. Let the medical\n and surgical fraternities look to it with an eye to the alleviation\n of human suffering and the prolongation of life. Let the meta\u00ac\n physician look to it as a key to some of the profound mysteries\n of human nature. Let all regard it as tending to enlarge the\n capabilities for enjoyment in our race, and as the means of un\u00ac\n folding new intellectual wonders.

The Mr. Chase, who\n lectured on Pathetism in your city last winter, was the pupil of\n Sunderland, and, skilful as he showed himself to be, he was but\n the shadow of the intellectual power and professional ability of\n the master. When Mr. Sunderland came to the city, the people\n were so incredulous on the whole range of subjects of which he\n proposed to treat, that his audiences were scarcely numerous\n enough to pay his current expenses. Gradually, one and an\u00ac\n other dropped in to see the elephant, and becoming attracted by\n the marvellousness and inherent beauty of the subject, the atten\u00ac\n tion was riveted, and the reason yielded to the palpable success\n of the numerous and severe tests. His lectures are now crowded,\n and hundreds openly avow their settled belief in mental vision.\n</p>\n<p>\n Among the auditory on the last evening, we noticed Edwin\n Forrest and Samuel Lewis, both of whom yielded entire assent\n to the openness and perfect honesty of the wonderful exhibi\u00ac\n tions. Many who a few weeks since joined in the persecution of\n the generous Pascal B. Smith, and approved the verdict which\n decided him an insane man, partly on account of his belief in\n Clairvoyance and Spiritual Vision, are themselves quite crazy ,\n which, being translated, means getting more intelligent than those\n who assume to be the leaders of the people.

Indeed, he classes all the phenomena which\n have come out under the various forms of religious fanaticism,\n or witchcraft, somnambulism, spells, & c., & c., under the same\n category; and, from what we have seen and heard, we should\n judge that he has succeeded in giving a more satisfactory expla\u00ac\n nation of these mysterious states, than any before ever offered to\n the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n His manner of illustrating the law of mind is certainly new\n and unheard of before; for while actually proceeding with his\n lecture, you will see the state of trance induced in one or a half\n dozen cases among his auditors; and a state of fascination,\n induced without contact, without touching or even speaking, par\u00ac\n ticularly to the persons who may be affected. The influence he\n exerts is said to be \u201c perfectly pleasant,\u201d and, indeed, highly\n agreeable. The accounts we have seen from those affected by it\n represent it as being tranquillizing and composing to the nervous\n system, beyond what any one would imagine who never felt it.\n And this would appear also from the numerous cases of nervous\n difficulty, which Mr. Sunderland has so wonderfully succeeded in\n curing, and which had for years resisted , the usual methods of\n medical treatment. Want of sleep, troublesome dreams, headache,\n tic douloureux, neuralgia, spasms, fits, monomania, and insanity,\n are said to have been cured by his peculiar process of operating.\n It is in vain to deny that results like these could be induced\n without a most intimate knowledge of the nervous functions, and\n the laws by which they are governed.

We listened and watched with marked\n attention to see if any enchantment, incantations, or spells were\n worked by the operator, but there was nothing of the kind. In\n a short time, however, in different parts of the hall, we saw per\u00ac\n sons \u2014 ladies and men \u2014 falling asleep. One in the seat fronting\n us was not satisfied until she had arisen and taken her seat by\n the lecturer, with her eyes shut, and while fast asleep; this was\n somnambulism. After five persons were on the platform, several\n beautiful experiments were made, such as an exhibition of the\n passions of joy, hope, grief, and actual weeping, and the expe\u00ac\n riencing all the terrors and inconveniences of passing through a\n terrible thunder storm, without shelter of any kind, & c.\n</p>\n<p>\n A true description of these things cannot be given ; they must\n be seen to be appreciated.

It\n has been used frequently since LaRoy Sunderland delivered his\n first lecture in this city, and there has been a good deal of in\u00ac\n quiry as to the definite idea conveyed by the term. We have\n attended two of Mr. Sunderland\u2019s lectures, and have been much\n interested in his experiments and explanations illustrating this\n subject, and we here propose to sketch, as near as we can, the\n idea the lecturer intends to convey by the term Pathetism, and\n the theory which it is the object of his lectures to illustrate. If\n we understand him correctly, then, he applies the term \u201c Path\u00ac\n etism \u201d comprehensively to all those phenomena which have\n heretofore been described under the name of Animal Magnetism,\n or Mesmerism, which terms, especially the former, he seems to\n regard as indefinite, or rather, as conveying an erroneous idea.\n In their endeavors to account for the various phenomena of som\u00ac\n nambulism, and its kindred states in which human existence is\n sometimes found to be, the disciples of Mesmer have advanced\n the commonly-received notion that these results were produced\n by the operation of a magnetic fluid. The existence of this\n fluid, which has of course rested on supposition alone, Mr. Sun\u00ac\n derland does not believe in, and entirely discarding this idea of\n Animal Magnetism, endeavors to account for the phenomena\n heretofore ascribed to its agency in a more philosophical and\n comprehensible manner. And he has succeeded in showing by\n his experiments that no such agency as a magnetic fluid is neces\u00ac\n sary for the production of the somnambulic results. For he has\n repeatedly produced all those states of mind and body which\n Animal Magnetizers profess to produce by the magnetic influence,\n in such a manner as to exclude entirely the idea of any such\n agency as a fluid passing from the operator to the patient. He\n has succeeded in inducing the state of somnambulism in persons\n he has never before seen, without touching, without being near\n them, and without even looking at them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Sunderland\u2019s theory is, (if we have rightly understood\n him,) that there is a certain relation which may be established\n between different individuals, which may be properly designated\n by the term \u201c Sympathy.\u201d And that there is in all persons, to a\n greater or less degree, a susceptibility to being affected by the\n influence of this sympathetic relation. Persons, then, having a\n constitution peculiarly susceptible, may be impressed by some\n other person of an essentially different constitution, with the\n \u201c apprehension,\u201d (as the lecturer expresses the idea,) that some\n</p>\n<p>\n 31\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0368/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 249, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 438}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0368/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 499, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 876}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0368/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 998, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1752}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0368/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1996, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3505}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0368/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/an/ce/co/rr/el/at/iv/00/su/nd/trancecorrelativ00sund/trancecorrelativ00sund_0368.jp2", "height": 3505, "width": 1996, "levels": 6, "size": 418691}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"368\">\n<p>\n 362\n</p>\n<p>\n PATHETISM.\n</p>\n<p>\n certain event in relation to them will take place, in consequence\n of certain means used for that purpose. This apprehension is\n produced by the power of sympathy, which is one of the prop\u00ac\n erties of human existence, excited by the influence of the opera\u00ac\n tor upon the mind of a susceptible patient. Hence, the Path-\n etizer, knowing from the constitution of the patient that the\n somnambulic state can be produced in him, seeks to impress the\n idea upon the person that such a state will certainly follow the\n use of some certain (no matter what) particular means. This\n \u201c apprehension \u201d of this result is induced in the same manner\n that any person would seek to impress the mind of another with\n any truth of which he deemed himself possessed; in the same\n manner that an orator would strive to impress his idea upon the\n minds of his auditors by gesticulation and the modulation of his\n voice. When this impression is effected, and the apprehension\n of the patient thoroughly awakened, the power of sympathy\n bends and directs all the powers of mind and body to the realiza\u00ac\n tion of the idea apprehended, and they, from their own sympa\u00ac\n thy, yield to the influence of the apprehension. In this manner\n all the phenomena connected with somnambulism are produced.\n And we understand that Mr. Sunderland thinks all those results\n that are common to persons in a somnambulic state may be pro\u00ac\n duced upon the patient when awake. As cases in point illus\u00ac\n trating this power of sympathy over human existence, he cited\n instances in which persons awake, and in their usual senses, have\n been remarkably affected by their minds being impressed with\n such apprehensions. These cases we have not room fully to\n explain, but they are those in which persons have been led to\n imagine that certain events were to take place concerning them,\n and by their very apprehensions these events have been pro\u00ac\n duced.

The gum was cut around the tooth, and a large\n double tooth of the upper jaw was extracted. The tooth had\n three prongs, and was set very firmly in the head, requiring great\n force to remove it.

The hall in which the\n course was commenced was found inadequate to the accommoda\u00ac\n tion of the large and intelligent audiences which he drew to\u00ac\n gether, and on Friday and Saturday evenings he lectured in the\n Town Hall. During our own attendance most of his experi\u00ac\n ments proved satisfactory, so far as we could judge, and one at\n least was so triumphantly successful that it must have disarmed\n scepticism itself of all doubts on the point which it was designed\n to illustrate. This was on Thursday evening, when a tooth was\n extracted from a patient while-in a state of trance. The tooth\n was drawn by Dr. Perkins, and we watched the patient closely\n during the operation, without being able to detect the movement\n of a muscle or the slightest manifestation of consciousness in\n any way. Dr. Perkins testifies that the tooth came ordinarily\n hard ; and that it was a real tooth, planted in the jaw from which\n it was extracted by the hand of Nature, no one who believes his\n own senses can doubt. The idea of collusion between the lec\u00ac\n turer, the operator, and the subject, has been suggested; but\n that will not do. A gentleman of the bar, who certainly will\n not be suspected of conniving with the lecturer, selected the\n operator at his own request; and Dr. Perkins met the lecturer\n and the patient upon the stage for the first time. A medical\n gentleman examined the pulse of the patient during the opera\u00ac\n tion, and said he could discover no variation in it.\n</p>\n<p>\n After the operation had been performed, the subject was\n waked from her trance, and was asked what had occurred. She\n said she did not know. Mr. Sunderland said she had spoken of\n having a tooth drawn, and inquired if she would have it drawn\n then. She said she preferred waiting till she was put to sleep\n again. He then showed her the tooth, and her smile of surprise\n gave good evidence, if any were wanting, of her unconsciousness\n during the operation. \u2014 Springfield Post , November 25, 1845.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0373/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 248, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 447}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0373/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 497, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 894}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0373/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 994, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1789}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0373/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1988, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3578}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0373/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/an/ce/co/rr/el/at/iv/00/su/nd/trancecorrelativ00sund/trancecorrelativ00sund_0373.jp2", "height": 3578, "width": 1988, "levels": 6, "size": 418542}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"373\">\n<p>\n DEMONSTRATIONS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 367\n</p>\n<p>\n Concord, N.

On the first trial the forceps slipped, and if there had\n been any collusion, the young lady must have manifested pain.\n But no, not a muscle moved. A second trial w ' as successful, and\n the large tooth was exhibited to the audience as the evidence of\n the benefits of Pathetism. The young lady was now led to be\u00ac\n lieve that she had tobacco in her mouth, so as to cause her to\n spit out the blood; and in a few minutes she was aw r akened from\n the trance, perfectly unconscious of what had been done to her,\n and without suffering the least pain.\n</p>\n<p>\n We are no friends to humbuggery; but if Mr. Sunderland is\n a humbug, he is one of the most intelligent and successful ones\n we have ever seen.

We say Pathetism is a wondrous,\n unfathomable, and mysterious agency ; he says it\u2019s gammon, twat-\n tle, and moonshine. We call it a miraculous somnolence; he\n says it\u2019s malversation dwindled to nothing. We assert those ex\u00ac\n periments are bona fide miracles ; he reiterates they are mala fide\n humbugs. And thus we stand \u2014 the junior\u2019s vote is one, and the\n senior\u2019s vote is one also. We can tie him, and he can tie us.\n We bring up strong and tangible evidence of its truthfulness, and\n he knocks it down with palpable facts and pugilistic arguments.\n As the lawyers say, we remain in statu quo!

Mr. S. hav\u00ac\n ing withdrawn a few paces from her, requested me to \u201c go on.\u201d\n I proceeded to cut the gum around the tooth, which I did very\n</p>\n<p>\n 34\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0404/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 249, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 438}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0404/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 499, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 876}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0404/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 998, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1752}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0404/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1996, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3505}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:an:ce:co:rr:el:at:iv:00:su:nd:trancecorrelativ00sund:trancecorrelativ00sund_0404/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/an/ce/co/rr/el/at/iv/00/su/nd/trancecorrelativ00sund/trancecorrelativ00sund_0404.jp2", "height": 3505, "width": 1996, "levels": 6, "size": 414283}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"404\">\n<p>\n 898\n</p>\n<p>\n PATHETISM.\n</p>\n<p>\n to each other \u2014 indeed, so much curved that in the effort\n to extract, about one half of the ' palatine , or inner root, was\n broken off\u2014 had not this occurred, the fracture of the bone which\n forms the socket would have been the necessary result to the\n force used in extracting it.

But the most satisfactory one,\n of several which we witnessed, was that presented on the last\n evening of his entertainments at Franklin Hall. Dr. Johnson\n had been announced as the gentleman by whom the tooth was to\n be extracted; but in his unavoidable absence Dr. Asay was called\n for, and he consented to proceed with the operation, rather than\n that the audience should remain in suspense or be disappointed\n in their expectations. The hall was crowded with ladies and\n gentleman, intensely occupied with the proceedings on the plat\u00ac\n form, and the utmost order and attention prevailed. The lady\n was led upon the platform, and placed in a state of unconscious\n trance. The arm was paralyzed, and the candlestick with its light\n placed in her hand. The arm and hand were rigidly contracted,\n and moved not, while the light from the wick shone full upon the\n face of the patient, and by it the dentists in conference examined\n the tooth. It was also examined by others, one of whom, at\n least, withheld all faith from what had been assumed for Pathe\u00ac\n tism. Dr. Asay brought his instruments in contact with the\n tooth for the purpose of extracting it. It was a moment of in\u00ac\n tense interest to all present. The tooth for an instant resisted,\n but the firm grasp and determined skill of the hand which held\n the instrument did not falter till it. was loosened from the socket,\n and held up to the view of the relieved and gratified multitude\n present. It was an upper tooth of the left jaw. A burst of ap\u00ac\n plause followed the result of the experiment, during which not a\n muscle of the patient moved, nor was the slightest indication of\n pain on her part manifested. It was triumphantly satisfactory.\n Such w r as the statement of those in immediate contact with the\n lady\u2014such the undivided testimony of the audience.
