I am rea\u00ac\n dy to admit that I am what is called a rational Christian; but\n if I knew of any attempt on the part of the liberal clergy to\n usurp powers which can only be lawfully exercised by lay\u00ac\n men, I w ' ould as readily expose the project to publick indig\u00ac\n nation. That the publick may fully comprehend the nature\n and design of the extraordinary attempt made to bind to all\n future generations, the descendants of several thousand peo\u00ac\n ple in this city, and to effect by the forms of law, what the\n inventors feel conscious they could not produce by elo\u00ac\n quence or the force of truth, it w ill be necessary that I should\n give a brief sketch of the history of Christians, so far as it\n respects the most valuable of their rights, the right of\n thought.

Within a few years after this\n act, confirmatory of the meaning of the third article, the\n highest courts of law in this state were called upon succes\u00ac\n sively in various cases to settle the true meaning of the con\u00ac\n stitution on this point, and they have confirmed the rights,\n the exclusive rights of the members, of all the members of\n towns, parishes, precincts and religious societies, to elect\n their pastors without any control, let, hindrance, or impedi\u00ac\n ment on the part of the associations, technically called\n \u00ab churches\u201d in the narrowest and in my judgment anti-\n christian, and anti-apostolical sense of that term.\n</p>\n<p>\n Since the recent revival of a spirit of intolerance which\n has had no example from the banishment of Roger Williams\n and the murder of Servetus, and the persecution of the fol\u00ac\n lowers of Arminius ; since a minority of the Christian church\n calling themselves by way of eminence the orthodox, the\n evangelical\u2014the only true saints, have undertaken to deny\n the name and character of Christians to a large body of di\u00ac\n vines, who, without other motive or inducement than the\n convictions of conscience, resulting from a most laborious in\u00ac\n vestigation of the Bible itself, had dared to dissent from the\n early opinions of the first reformers ; since these intolerant\n 2\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:ce:nt:at:te:mp:tt:od:00:un:se:recentattempttod00unse:recentattempttod00unse_0010/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 487}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:ce:nt:at:te:mp:tt:od:00:un:se:recentattempttod00unse:recentattempttod00unse_0010/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 602, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 974}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:ce:nt:at:te:mp:tt:od:00:un:se:recentattempttod00unse:recentattempttod00unse_0010/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1205, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1948}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:ce:nt:at:te:mp:tt:od:00:un:se:recentattempttod00unse:recentattempttod00unse_0010/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2411, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3897}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:ce:nt:at:te:mp:tt:od:00:un:se:recentattempttod00unse:recentattempttod00unse_0010/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/ce/nt/at/te/mp/tt/od/00/un/se/recentattempttod00unse/recentattempttod00unse_0010.jp2", "height": 3897, "width": 2411, "levels": 6, "size": 634157}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"10\">\n<p>\n 10\n</p>\n<p>\n men, without consulting the opinions of their parishioners,\n have refused all intercourse with other Christian teachers of\n equal piety and learning, and have pronounced that the lat\u00ac\n ter were unworthy of announcing gospel truths from their\n more hallowed pulpits, the orthodox party have resorted to\n a novel method of restraining religious liberty.

whatsoever.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n I. The first remark we shall make upon this very extra\u00ac\n ordinary document, the first, we believe, of the kind which\n has appeared since the reformation, is, that it is an attempt\n to substitute legal covenants and contrivances in the place\n of the old and shorter process, (we may even say the fairer\n process, because there was no disguise about it) the sharp\n sword of the soldier and the unanswerable argument of fire\n and faggot. Lewis the 14th, when he wished to repress the\n free opinions of our protestant brethren, the Hugonots, mild\u00ac\n ly and humanely banished them from his dominions. Our\n protestant brethren of Boston, in the nineteenth century, are\n simply content with covenants and provisoes, clothed in\n legal language, by which the future heretick simply agrees\n to surrender his rights of conscience and of thought, on the\n pain and penalty of forfeiting his property in the Church.\n The principle is precisely the same; but it must in candour\n be admitted, that the modern ecclesiastical tyranny has been\n compelled to modify its penalties by the spirit of the age.\n Would it be ungenerous to presume, that nothing but the\n want of power has produced the comparative moderation of\n the enlightened founders of Hanover Street Church ?\n</p>\n<p>\n II. The second reflection which this novel mode of co\u00ac\n ercing and restraining the human mind, the freedom with\n which Christ himself has made us free, is, that it is not an\n indirect, but a palpable, plain, undisguised attempt, by legal\n instruments, to defeat the express provisions of our constitu\u00ac\n tion, and the decisions of the highest courts of law within the\n state,, upon the subject matter of these instruments. The\n constitution and decisions secure to all pewholders, parish\u00ac\n ioners and others, who support the minister, the right of\n electing him. It is a natural and reasonable right, founded\n upon the principles of equality, and of civil and religious\n freedom, which no convention, or contract, can weaken or\n destroy. He w 7 ho supports a ruler, a teacher, or officer of\n any sort, ought to have the privilege of voting for him. If it\n is true of the choice of civil rulers, how much more valuable,\n how much more important a#d vital, the right to give his\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:ce:nt:at:te:mp:tt:od:00:un:se:recentattempttod00unse:recentattempttod00unse_0014/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 487}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:ce:nt:at:te:mp:tt:od:00:un:se:recentattempttod00unse:recentattempttod00unse_0014/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 602, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 974}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:ce:nt:at:te:mp:tt:od:00:un:se:recentattempttod00unse:recentattempttod00unse_0014/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1205, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1948}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:ce:nt:at:te:mp:tt:od:00:un:se:recentattempttod00unse:recentattempttod00unse_0014/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2411, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3897}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:ce:nt:at:te:mp:tt:od:00:un:se:recentattempttod00unse:recentattempttod00unse_0014/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/ce/nt/at/te/mp/tt/od/00/un/se/recentattempttod00unse/recentattempttod00unse_0014.jp2", "height": 3897, "width": 2411, "levels": 6, "size": 636222}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"14\">\n<p>\n 14\n</p>\n<p>\n voice in the election of a pastor, on whose capacity, judg\u00ac\n ment, manners, principles and piety, may depend the moral\n growth and immortal hopes of himself and of his offspring.\n Any attempt, by whatever artifice or contrivance, to defeat\n this right, is a species of treason against the inestimable\n rights of a Christian.
