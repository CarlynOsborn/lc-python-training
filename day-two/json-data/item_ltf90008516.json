and require, that it be received as such by all the Members of the same: And this\n book shall be in use from and after the first day of October, in the Year of our Lord one thousand seven hundred and\n ninety.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE PREFACE.\n</p>\n<p>\n I T is a most invaluable part of that blessed liberty whereioith Christ hath made us free, that in his worship, dif\u00ac\n ferent forms and usages may without offence be allowed, provided the substance of the Faith be kept entire; and\n that, in every Church, what cannot be clearly determined to belong to Doctrine, must be referred to Discipline; and\n therefore, by common consent and authority, may be altered, abridged, enlarged, amended, or otherwise disposed of,\n as may seem most convenient for the edification of the people, \u201c according to the various exigencies of times and oc\u00ac\n casions.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Church of England, to which the Protestant Episcopal Church in these States is indebted, under GOD, for her\n first foundation and a long continuance of nursing care and protection, hath, in the Preface of her Book of Common\n Prayer, laid it down as a rule, that \u201c The particulai forms of Divine Worship, and the Rites and Ceremonies appoint\u00ac\n ed to be used therein, being things in their own nature indifferent and alterable, and so acknowledged, it is but reasona\u00ac\n ble that upon weighty and important considerations, according to the various exigencies of times and occasions, such\n changes and alterations should be made therein, as to those who are in places of authority should, from time to time,\n seem either necessary or expedient.\u201d .\n</p>\n<p>\n The same Church hath not only in her Preface, but likewise in her Articles and Homilies, declared the necessity and\n expediency ofoccasional alterations and amendments in her Forms of Public Worship ; and we find accordingly, that,\n seeking to \u201c keep the happy mean between too much stiffness in refusing, and too much easiness in admitting varia\u00ac\n tions in things once advisedly established, she hath, in the reign of several Princes, since the first compiling of her Lit\u00ac\n urgy in the time of Edward the Sixth, upon just and weighty considerations her thereunto moving, yielded to make such\n alferations in some particulars, as in their respective times were thought convenient; yet so as that the main body and\n essential parts of the same (as well in the chiefest materials, as in the frame and order thereof) have still been continu\u00ac\n ed firm and unshaken.\u201d , .,,,\n</p>\n<p>\n Her general aim in these different reviews and alterations hath been, as she further declares in her said Preface, to\n do that which, according to her best understanding, might most tend to the preservation of peace and unity in the\n Church ; the procuring of reverence, and the exciting of piety and devotion in the worship of God ; and, finally,the cut\u00ac\n ting off occasion, from them that seek occasion, of cavil or quarrel against her Liturgy.\u201d And although, according to\n her judgment, there be not \u201c any thing in it contrary to the Word of God, or to sound doctrine, or which a godly man\n may not with a good conscience use and submit unto, or which is not fairly defensible, if allowed such just and favour\u00ac\n able construction, as in common equity ought to be allowed to all human writings yet upon the principles already\n laid down, it cannot but be supposed, that further alteration would in time be found expedient. Accordingly a commis\u00ac\n sion for a review was issued in the year 1689: but this great and good work miscarried at that time; and the Civil Au\u00ac\n thority has not since thought proper to revive it by any new Commission. . , ,\n</p>\n<p>\n But when in the course of Divine Providence, these American States became independent with respect to Civil Gov\u00ac\n ernment, their ecclesiastical independence was necessarily included, and the different religious denominations of Christ\u00ac\n ians in these States were left at lull and equal liberty to model and organize their respective Churches, and forms of\n worship, and discipline, in such manner as they might judge most convenient for their future prosperity ; consistently\n with the constitution and laws oftheir country. , T . . . ,\n</p>\n<p>\n The attention of this Church was, in the first place, drawn to those alterations m the Liturgy which became necessa\u00ac\n ry in the prayers for our Civil Rulers, in consequence of the Revolution. And the principal care herein was to make\n them confirmable to what ousht to be the proper end of all such prayers, namely, that \u201c Rulers may have grace, wis\u00ac\n dom, and understanding to execute justice, and to maintain truth and that the People \u201c may lead quiet and peaceable\n lives, in all godliness and honesty.\u201d ^ _ ,\n</p>\n<p>\n But while these alterations were in review before the Convention, they could not but, with gratitude to God, embrace\n the happy occasion which was offered to them (uninfluenced and unrestrained by any worldly authority whatsoever) to\n take a further review of the Public Service, and to establish such other alterations and amendments therein as might he\n</p>\n<p>\n ^It ' seems mmecessary to enumerate all the different alterations and amendments. They will appear, and it is to be\n hoped the reasons of them also, upon a comparison of this, with the Book of Common Prayer of the Church of England.\n In which it will also appear, that this Church is far from intending to depart from the Church of England in any essen\u00ac\n tial point of doctrine, discipline, or worship; or further than local circumstances require . , , . .,\n</p>\n<p>\n And now, this important work being brought to a conclusion, it is hoped the whole will be received and examined by\n every true member of our Church, and every sincere Christian, with a meek, candid, and charitable frame of mind;\n without prejudice or prepossessions ; seriously considering what Christianity is, and what, the truths of the Gospel are;\n and earnestly beseeching Almighty God to accompany with his blessing every endeavour for promulgating them to man\u00ac\n kind in the clearest, plainest, most affecting and majestic manner, for the sake of Jesus Christ, our blessed Lord and\n Saviour.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0012/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 157, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 271}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0012/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 315, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 543}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0012/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 631, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1086}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0012/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1263, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2172}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0012/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2527, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4344}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0012/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ok/of/co/mm/on/pr/ay/00/ep/is/_7/bookofcommonpray00epis_7/bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0012.jp2", "height": 4344, "width": 2527, "levels": 6, "size": 536913}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"12\">\n<p>\n THE ORDER\n</p>\n<p>\n HOW THE PSALTER IS APPOINTED TO BE READ.\n</p>\n<p>\n T HE Psalter shall be read through once every month, as it is there appointed, both for Morning and Evening Pray\u00ac\n er.

by reading one or more of the\n following Sentences of Scripture.\n</p>\n<p>\n T HE Lord is in his holy tem\u00ac\n ple; let all the earth keep silence\n before him. Hab. ii. 20.\n</p>\n<p>\n From the rising of the sun even\n unto the going down of the same, my\n Name shall be great among the Gen\u00ac\n tiles; and in every place incense shall\n be offered unto my Name, and a pure\n offering: for my Name shall be great\n among the heathen, saith the Lord\n of hosts. Mai. i. 11.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let the words of my mouth, and\n the meditation of my heart, be alway\n acceptable in thy sight, O Lord, my\n strength and my redeemer. Psal.\n xix. 14,15.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the wicked man turneth\n away from his wickedness that he\n hath committed,and doeth that which\n is lawful and right, he shall save his\n soul alive. Ezek. xviii. 27.\n</p>\n<p>\n I acknowledge my transgressions ;\n and my sin is ever before me. Psal.\n li. 3.\n</p>\n<p>\n Hide thy face from my sins; and\n blot out all mine iniquities. Psal.\n li. 9.\n</p>\n<p>\n The sacrifices of God are a broken\n spirit: a broken and a contrite heart,\n O God, thou wilt not despise. Psal.\n</p>\n<p>\n li. 17.\n</p>\n<p>\n Rend your heart, and not your gar\u00ac\n ments, and turn unto the Lord your\n God; for he is gracious and merciful,\n slow to anger, and of great kindness,\n and repenteth him of the evil. Joel\n ii. 13.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the Lord our God belong mer\u00ac\n cies and forgivenesses, though we\n have rebelled against him; neither\n have we obeyed the voice ofthe Lord\n our God, to walk in his laws which\n he set before us. Dan. ix. 9, 10.\n</p>\n<p>\n O Lord, correct me, but with judg\u00ac\n ment; not in thine anger, lest thou\n bring me to nothing. Jer. x. 24.\n Psal. vi. 1.\n</p>\n<p>\n Repent ye; for the Kingdom of\n Heaven is at hand. St. Matt. iii. 2.\n</p>\n<p>\n I will arise, and go to my father,\n and will say unto him, Father, I have\n sinned against heaven, and before\n thee, and am no more worthy to be\n called thy son.

Love work-\n eth no ill to his neighbour ; therefore\n love is the fulfilling of the Law.

St. Lukeviii. 4.\n HEN much people were\n gathered together, and were\n come to him out of every city, he\n spake by a parable. A sower went\n out to sow his seed: and as he sow\u00ac\n ed, some fell by the way-side ; and\n it was trodden down, and the fowls\n of the air devoured it. And some\n fell upon a rock; and as soon as it\n was sprung up, it withered away,\n because it lacked moisture. And\n some fell among thorns; and the\n thorns sprang up with it, and chok\u00ac\n ed it. And other fell on good ground,\n and sprang up, and bare fruit an\n hundred-fold. And when he had\n said these things, he cried, He that\n hath ears to hear, let him hear.\n And his disciples asked him, saying,\n What might this parable be ? And\n he said, Unto you it is given to know\n the mysteries of the Kingdom of\n God: but to others in parables ; that\n seeing they might not see, and hear\u00ac\n ing they might not understand.\n Now the parable is this: The seed\n is the Word of God. Those by the\n way-side are they that hear ; then\n cometh the devil, and taketh away\n the word out of their hearts, lest\n they should believe and be saved.\n They on the rock are they, which,\n when they hear, receive the word\n with joy; and these have no root,\n which for a while believe, and in\n time of temptation fall away. And\n that which fell among thorns are\n they, which, when they have heard,\n go forth, and are choked with cares\n and riches and pleasures of this life,\n and bring no fruit to perfection. But\n that on the good ground are they,\n which in an honest and good heart,\n having heard the word, keep it, and\n bring forth fruit with patience.\n</p>\n<p>\n 47\n</p>\n<p>\n THE SUNDAY CALLED Q.UINQ.UA\n GESIMA, OR THE NEXT SUNDAY\n BEFORE LENT.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Collect.\n</p>\n<p>\n O LORD, who hast taught us\n that all our doings without\n charity are nothing worth; Send thy\n Holy Ghost, and pour into our hearts\n that most excellent gift of charity,\n the very bond of peace and of all\n virtues, without which whosoever\n liveth is counted dead before thee.\n Grant this for thine only Son Jesus\n Christ\u2019s sake.

And the\n chief priests took the silver pieces,\n and said, It is not lawful for to put\n them into the treasury, because it is\n the price of blood.

For when\n Moses had spoken every precept to all\n the people, according to the Law he\n took the blood of calves and of goats,\n with water, and scarlet wool, and\n hyssop, and sprinkled both the book\n and all the people, saying, This is\n the blood of the testament which\n God hath enjoined unto you. More\u00ac\n over, he sprinkled likewise with blood\n both the tabernacle, and all the ves\u00ac\n sels of the ministry. And almost all\n things are by the Law purged with\n blood; and without shedding of blood\n is no remission. It was therefore\n necessary that the patterns of things\n in the heavens shc & ld be purified\n with these; but the heavenly things\n themselves with better sacrifices than\n these. For Christ is not entered into\n the holy places made with hands,\n which are the figures of the true;\n but into heaven itself, now to appear\n in the presence of God for us. Nor\n yet that he should offer himself often,\n as the High Priest entereth into the\n holy place every year with blood of\n others; (for then must he often have\n suffered since the foundation of the\n world;) but now once in the end of\n the world hath he appeared to put\n away sin by the sacrifice of himself.\n And as it is appointed unto men once\n to die, but after this the judgment:\n so Christ was once offered to bear\n the sins of many; and unto them\n that look for him shall he appear\n the second time without sin unto\n salvation.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Gospel. St. Luke xxii. 1.\n OW the feast of unleavened\n bread drew nigh, which is\n called the Passover. And the chief\n priests and scribes sought how they\n might kill him ; for they feared the\n people. Then entered Satan into\n Judas surnamed Iscariot, being of\n the number of the twelve. And he\n went his way, and communed with\n the chief priests and captains, how\n</p>\n<p>\n 61\n</p>\n<p>\n he might betray him unto them\n And they were glad, and covenanted\n to give him money. And he pro\n mised, and sought opportunity to\n betray him unto them in the absence\n of the multitude. Then came the\n day of unleavened bread, when the\n passover must be killed. And he\n sent Peter and John, saying, Go and\n prepare us the passover, that we may\n eat. And they said unto him, Where\n wilt thou that we prepare ? And he\n said unto them, Behold, when ye\n are entered into the city, there shall\n a man meet you, bearing a pitcher\n of water; follow him into the house\n where he entereth in. And ye shall\n say unto the good man of the house,\n The Master saith unto thee, Where\n is the guest-chamber, where I shall\n eat the passover with my disciples ?\n And he shall show you a large upper\n room furnished: there make ready.\n And they went and found as he had\n said unto them: and they made\n ready the passover. And when the\n hour was come, he sat down, and\n the twelve apostles with him. And\n he said unto them, With desire I have\n desired to eat this passover with you\n before I suffer. For I say unto you,\n I will not any more eat thereof, until\n it be fulfilled in the Kingdom of God.\n And he took the cup, and gave\n thanks, and said, Take this, and di\u00ac\n vide it among yourselves. For I say\n unto you, I will not drink of the fruit\n of the vine, until the Kingdom of God\n shall come.

And\n Pilate asked him, saying, Art thou\n the King of the Jews ? And he an\u00ac\n swered him, and said, Thou sayest\n it. Then said Pilate to the chief\n priests and to the people, I find no\n fault in this man. And they were\n the more fierce, saying, He stirreth\n up the people, teaching throughout\n all Jewry, beginning from Galilee\n to this place. When Pilate heard\n of Galilee, he asked whether the\n man were a Galilean. And as soon\n as he knew that he belonged unto\n Herod\u2019s jurisdiction, he sent him\n to Herod, who himself was also at\n Jerusalem at that time. And when\n Herod saw Jesus, he was exceeding\n glad: for he was desirous to see\n him of a long season, because he had\n heard many things of him ; and he\n hoped to have seen some miracle\n done by him. Then he questioned\n with him in many words ; but he\n answered him nothing. And the\n chief priests and scribes stood and\n</p>\n<p>\n vehemently accused him. Ana\n Herod with his men of war set him\n at naught, and mocked him, and ar\u00ac\n rayed him in a gorgeous robe, and\n sent him again to Pilate. And the\n same day Pilate and Herod were\n made friends together; for before,\n they were at enmity between them\u00ac\n selves. And Pilate, when he had\n called together the chief priests, and\n the rulers, and the people, said\n unto them, Ye have brought this\n man unto me, as one that pervert-\n eth the people: and behold, I, hav\u00ac\n ing examined him before you, have\n found no fault in this man, touching\n those things whereof ye accuse\n him. No, nor yet Herod : for I sent\n you to him; and lo, nothing wor\u00ac\n thy of death is done unto him. 1\n will therefore chastise him, and\n release him. (For of necessity he\n must release one unto them at the\n feast.) And they cried out all at\n once, saying, Away with this man,\n and release unto us Barabbas: (who\n for a certain sedition made in the\n city, and for murder, was cast into\n prison.) Pilate therefore, willing\n to release Jesus, spake again to\n them. But they cried, saying, Cru\u00ac\n cify him! crucify him! And he said\n unto them the third time, Why,\n what evil hath he done?

For it is not possible that the\n blood of bulls and of goats should\n take away sins. Wherefore, when\n He cometh into the world, he saith,\n Sacrifice and offering thou wouldest\n not, but a body hast thou prepared\n me: in burnt-offerings and sacrifices\n for sin thou hast had no pleasure.\n Then said I, Lo, I come (in the vol\u00ac\n ume of the book it is written of me)\n to do thy will, O God. Above, when\n he said, Sacrifice and offering and\n burnt-offerings and offering for sin\n thou wouldest not, neither hadst\n pleasure therein; which are offered\n by the Law ; then said he, Lo, I\n come to do thy will, O God. He\n taketh away the first, that he may\n establish the second. By the which\n will we are sanctified, through the\n offering of the body of Jesus Christ\n</p>\n<p>\n once for all. And every priest stand-\n eth daily ministering and offering\n oftentimes the same sacrifices, which\n can never take away sins : but this\n Man, after he had offered one sacri\u00ac\n fice for sins for ever, sat down on\n the right hand of God ; from hence\u00ac\n forth expecting till his enemies be\n made his footstool. For by one offer\u00ac\n ing he hath perfected for ever them\n that are sanctified. Whereof the\n Holy Ghost also is a witness to us:\n for after that he had said before,\n This is the covenant that I will\n make with them after those days,\n saith the Lord, I will put my laws\n into their hearts, and in their minds\n will I write them; and their sins\n and iniquities will I remember no\n more. Now where remission of\n these is, there is no more offering for\n sin. Having therefore, brethren,\n boldness to enter into the holiest by\n the blood of Jesus, by a new and\n living way, which he hath conse\u00ac\n crated for us, through the vail, that\n is to say, his flesh ; and having an\n High Priest over the house of God;\n let us draw near with a true heart,\n in full assurance of faith, having our\n hearts sprinkled from an evil con\u00ac\n science, and our bodies washed with\n pure water.

And im\u00ac\n mediately I was in the Spirit: and\n behold, a throne was set in heaven,\n and One sat on the throne ; and He\n that sat was to look upon like a jas\u00ac\n per and a sardine stone : and there\n was a rainbow round about the\n throne, in sight like unto an eme\u00ac\n rald. And round about the throne\n were four and twenty seats : and\n upon the seats I saw four and twenty\n elders sitting, clothed in white rai\u00ac\n ment ; and they had on their heads\n crowns of gold. And out of the\n throne proceeded lightnings, and\n thunderings, and voices. And there\n were seven lamps of fire burning\n before the throne, which are the se\u00ac\n ven Spirits of God. And before the\n throne there was a sea of glass like\n unto crystal. And in the midst of\n the throne, and round about the\n throne, were four beasts full of eyes\n before and behind.

And\n the four beasts had each of them six\n wings about him; and they were\n full of eyes within; and they rest not\n day and night, saying, Holy, holy,\n holy, Lord God Almighty, which\n was, and is, and is to come.

Jesus answer\u00ac\n ed, Verily, verily, I say unto thee,\n Except a man be born of water and\n of the Spirit, he cannot enter into the\n Kingdom of God.

He that loveth\n not knoweth not God ; for God is\n love. In this was manifested the\n love of God towards us, because that\n God sent his only-begotten Son into\n the world, that we might live through\n him. Herein is love, not that we\n loved God, but that he loved us, and\n sent his Son to be the propitiation for\n our sins. Beloved, if God so loved\n us, we ought also to love one anoth\u00ac\n er. No man hath seen God at any\n time. If we love one another, God\n dwelleth in us, and his love is per\u00ac\n fected in us. Hereby know we that\n we dwell in him, and he in us ; be\u00ac\n cause he hath given us of his Spirit.\n And we have seen and do testify\n that the Father sent the Son to be\n</p>\n<p>\n L\n</p>\n<p>\n the Saviour of the world. Whoso\u00ac\n ever shall confess that Jesus is the\n Son of God, God dwelleth in him,\n and he in God. And we have\n known and believed the love that\n God hath to us. God is love ; and\n he that dwelleth in love dwelleth in\n God, and God in him. Herein is\n our love made perfect, that we may\n have boldness in the day of judg\u00ac\n ment ; because as he is, so are we\n in this world. There is no fear in\n love; but perfect love casteth out\n fear : because fear hath torment.\n He that feareth is not made perfect\n in love. We love him, because he\n first loved us. If a man say, I love\n God, and hateth his brother, he is a\n liar : for he that loveth not his bro\u00ac\n ther whom he hath seen, how can\n he love God whom he hath not\n seen ? And this commandment have\n we from him, That he who loveth\n God love his brother also.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Gospel.

For God\n is my record, how greatly I long\n after you all in the bowels of Jesus\n Christ. And this I pray, that your\n love may abound yet more and more\n in knowledge and in all judgment;\n that ye may approve things that\n are excellent; that ye may be sin\u00ac\n cere and without offence till the day\n of Christ; being filled with the fruits\n of righteousness, which are by Jesus\n Christ, unto the glory and praise of\n God.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Gospel.

But\n forasmuch as he had not to pay, his\n lord commanded him to be sold, and\n his wife and children, and all that\n he had, and payment to be made.\n The servant therefore fell down and\n worshipped him, saying, Lord, have\n patience with me, and I will pay\n thee all. Then the lord of that ser\u00ac\n vant was moved with compassion,\n N\n</p>\n<p>\n and loosed him, and forgave him\n the debt. But the same servant\n went out, and found one of his fel\u00ac\n low-servants, which owed him an\n hundred pence : and he laid hands\n on him, and took him by the throat,\n saying, Pay me that thou owest.\n And his fellow-servant fell down at\n his feet, and besought him, saying,\n Have patience with me, and I will\n pay thee all. And he would not;\n but went and cast him into prison,\n till he should pay the debt. So when\n his fellow-servants saw what was\n done, they were very sorry, and\n came and told unto their lord all that\n was done. Then his lord, after that\n he had called him, said unto him, O\n thou wicked servant, I forgave thee\n all that debt, because thou desiredst\n me: shouldest not thou also have had\n compassion on thy fellow-servant,\n even as I had pity on thee ? And\n his lord was wroth, and delivered\n him to the tormentors, till he should\n pay all that was due unto him.

These\n things if ye earnestly consider, ye\n will by God\u2019s grace return to a bet\u00ac\n ter mind: for the obtaining whereof\n we shall not cease to make our hum\u00ac\n ble petitions unto Almighty God, our\n heavenly Father.\n</p>\n<p>\n IT At the time of the Celebration of the\n Communion, the Priest shall say this\n Exhortation.\n</p>\n<p>\n D EARLY beloved in the Lord,\n ye who mind to come to the\n holy Communion of the Body and\n Blood of our Saviour Christ, must\n consider how Saint Paul exhorteth\n all persons diligently to try and ex\u00ac\n amine themselves, before they pre\u00ac\n sume to eat of that Bread, and drink\n of that Cup. For as the benefit is\n great, if with a true penitent heart\n and lively faith we receive that holy\n Sacrament; so is the danger great,\n if we receive the same unworthily.\n Judge therefore yourselves, breth\u00ac\n ren, that ye be not judged of the\n Lord; repent ye truly for your sins\n past; have a lively and steadfast faith\n in Christ our Saviour; amend your\n lives, and be in perfect charity with\n all men; so shall ye be meet par\u00ac\n takers of those holy mysteries. And\n above all things ye must give most\n humble and hearty thanks to God,\n the Father, the Son, and the Holy\n Ghost, for the redemption of the\n world by the death and passion of\n our Saviour Christ, both God and\n man; who did humble himself, even\n to the death upon the Cross, for us,\n miserable sinners, who lay in dark\u00ac\n ness and the shadow of death; that\n he might make us the children of\n God, and exalt us to everlasting life.\n And to the end that we should al\u00ac\n ways remember the exceeding great\n love of our Master, and only Saviour,\n Jesus Christ, thus dying for us, and\n the innumerable benefits which by\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0136/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 156, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0136/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 313, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 548}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0136/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 626, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1096}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0136/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1252, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2193}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0136/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2505, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4387}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0136/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ok/of/co/mm/on/pr/ay/00/ep/is/_7/bookofcommonpray00epis_7/bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0136.jp2", "height": 4387, "width": 2505, "levels": 6, "size": 672348}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"136\">\n<p>\n 124\n</p>\n<p>\n THE COMMUNION.\n</p>\n<p>\n his precious blood-shedding he hath\n obtained for us; he hath instituted\n and ordained holy mysteries, as\n pledges of his love, and for a contin\u00ac\n ual remembrance of his death, to\n our great and endless comfort.

The same came to\n Jesus by night, and said unto him,\n Rabbi, we know that thou art a\n teacher come from God; for no\n man can do these miracles that thou\n doest, except God be with him. Je\u00ac\n sus answered and said unto him,\n Verily, verily, I say unto thee, Ex\u00ac\n cept a man be born again, he can\u00ac\n not see the Kingdom of God. Nico\u00ac\n demus saith unto him, How can a\n man be born when he is old ? can\n he enter the second time into his\n mother\u2019s womb, and be born ? Jesus\n answered. Verily, verily, I say unto\n thee, Except a man be born of water\n and of the Spirit, he cannot enter\n into the Kingdom of God. That\n which is born of the flesh is flesh;\n and that which is born of the Spirit\n is spirit. Marvel not that I said unto\n thee, Ye must be born again. The\n wind bloweth where it listeth, and\n thou hearest the sound thereof; but\n canst not tell whence it cometh, and\n whither it goeth: so is every one\n that is born of the Spirit.\n</p>\n<p>\n IT After which he shall say this Exhortation\n following.\n</p>\n<p>\n B ELOVED, ye hear in this Gos\u00ac\n pel the express words of our\n Saviour Christ, that except a man\n be born of Water and of the Spirit,\n he cannot enter into the Kingdom\n of God. Whereby ye may perceive\n the great necessity of this Sacra-\n ment,whereitmaybehad. Likewise,\n immediately before his ascension\n into heaven, (as we read in the last\n Chapter of Saint Mark\u2019s Gospel,) he\n s\n</p>\n<p>\n gave commandment to his disciples,\n saying, Go ye into all the world, and\n preach the Gospel to every creature.\n He that believeth and is baptized\n shall be saved; but he that believeth\n not shall be damned. Which also\n showeth unto us the great benefit\n we reap thereby. For which cause\n Saint Peter the Apostle, when upon\n his first preaching of the Gospel\n many were pricked at the heart, and\n said to him and the rest of the\n Apostles, Men and brethren, what\n shall we do? replied and said unto\n them, Repent, and be baptized every\n one of you for the remission of sins,\n and ye shall receive the gift of the\n Holy Ghost. For the promise is to\n you and your children, and to all\n that are afar off, even as many as\n the Lord our God shall call. And\n with many other words exhorted he\n them, saying, Save yourselves from\n this untoward generation. For (as\n the same Apostle testifieth in another\n place) even Baptism doth also now\n save us, (not the putting away of\n the filth of the flesh, but the answer\n of a good conscience towards God,)\n by the resurrection of Jesus Christ.\n Doubt ye not therefore, but earnestly\n believe, that he will favourably re\u00ac\n ceive these present Persons , truly\n repenting, and coming unto him by\n faith; that he will grant them remis\u00ac\n sion of their sins, and bestow upon\n them the Holy Ghost; that he will\n give them the blessing of eternal life,\n and make them partakers of his ever\u00ac\n lasting kingdom.\n</p>\n<p>\n Wherefore we being thus per\u00ac\n suaded of the good will of our hea\u00ac\n venly Father toward these Persons ,\n declared by his Son Jesus Christ;\n let us faithfully and devoutly give\n thanks to him, and say,\n</p>\n<p>\n LMIGHTY and everlasting\n God, heavenly Father, we give\n thee humble thanks, for that thou\n hast vouchsafed to call us to the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0150/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 156, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0150/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 313, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 548}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0150/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 626, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1096}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0150/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1252, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2193}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0150/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2505, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4387}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0150/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ok/of/co/mm/on/pr/ay/00/ep/is/_7/bookofcommonpray00epis_7/bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0150.jp2", "height": 4387, "width": 2505, "levels": 6, "size": 713857}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"150\">\n<p>\n 138\n</p>\n<p>\n BAPTISM OF THOSE OF RIPER YEARS.\n</p>\n<p>\n knowledge of thy grace, and faith in\n thee: Increase this knowledge, and\n confirm this faith in us evermore.\n Give thy Holy Spirit to these Per\u00ac\n sons, that they may be born again,\n and be made heirs of everlasting sal\u00ac\n vation ; through our Lord Jesus\n Christ, who liveth and reigneth with\n thee and the Holy Spirit, now and for\n ever.

XV. 20.\n</p>\n<p>\n OW is Christ risen from the\n dead, and become the first-fruits\n of them that slept. For since by man\n came death, by man came also the\n resurrection of the dead. For as in\n Adam all die, even so in Christ shall\n all be made alive. But every man\n in his own order: Christ the first-\n fruits ; afterward they that are\n Christ\u2019s, at his coming. Then\n cometh the end, when he shall have\n delivered up the kingdom to God,\n even the Father; when he shall have\n put down all rule, and all authority,\n and power. For he must reign, till\n he hath put all enemies under his\n feet. The last enemy that shall\n be destroyed is death. For he hath\n put all things under his feet.\n But when he saith, all things are\n put under him, it is manifest that\n he is excepted, which did put all\n</p>\n<p>\n THE DEAD.\n</p>\n<p>\n things under him. And when all\n things shall be subdued unto him,\n then shall the Son also himself be\n subject unto Him that put all things\n under him, that God may be all in\n all. Else what shall they do which\n are baptized for the dead, if the dead\n rise not at all? Why are they then\n baptized for the dead? and why\n stand we in jeopardy every hour?\n I protest by your rejoicing, which 1\n have in Christ Jesus our Lord, I die\n daily. If after the manner of men\n I have fought with beasts at Ephe\u00ac\n sus, what advantageth it me, if the\n dead rise not? let us eat and drink,\n for to-morrow we die. Be not de\u00ac\n ceived: evil communications corrupt\n good manners. Awake to righteous\u00ac\n ness, and sin not; for some have not\n the knowledge of God. I speak this\n to your shame. But some man will\n say, How are the dead raised up?\n and with what body do they come?\n Thou fool! that which thou sowest\n is not quickened, except it die. And\n that which thou sowest, thou sowest\n not that body that shall be, but bare\n grain, it may chance of wheat, or of\n some other grain. But God giveth\n it a body as it hath pleased him, and\n to every seed his own body. All\n flesh is not the same flesh; but there\n is one kind of flesh of men, another\n flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and\n another of birds. There are also\n celestial bodies, and bodies terres\u00ac\n trial ; but the glory of the celestial is\n one, and the glory of the terrestrial\n is another. There is one glory of the\n sun, and another glory of the moon,\n and another glory of the stars; for\n one star differeth from another star\n in glory. So also is the resurrection\n of the dead. It is sown in corrup\u00ac\n tion ; it is raised in incorruption: it\n is sown in dishonour; it is raised in\n glory: it is sown in weakness; it is\n raised in power: it is sown a natural\n body; it is raised a spiritual body.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0168/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 156, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0168/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 313, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 548}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0168/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 626, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1096}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0168/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1252, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2193}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0168/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2505, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4387}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0168/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ok/of/co/mm/on/pr/ay/00/ep/is/_7/bookofcommonpray00epis_7/bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0168.jp2", "height": 4387, "width": 2505, "levels": 6, "size": 705270}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"168\">\n<p>\n 156\n</p>\n<p>\n BURIAL OF THE DEAD.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is a natural body, and there\n is a spiritual body.

I. Of Faith, in the Holy Trinity.\n</p>\n<p>\n HERE is but one living and true God, everlasting,\n without body, parts, or passions; ofinfinite power,\n wisdom, and goodness; the Maker, and Preserver of all\n things both visible and invisible. And in unity of this\n Godhead there be three Persons, of one substance, power,\n and eternity ; the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. II. Of the Word, or Son of Ood, which was made\n very Man.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Son, which is the Word of the Father, begotten\n from everlasting of the Father, the very and eternal God,\n and of one substance with the Father, took Man\u2019s nature\n m the womb of the blessed Virgin, of her substance: so\n that two whole and perfect Matures, that is to say, the\n Godhead and Manhood, were joined together in one Per\u00ac\n son, never to be divided, whereof is one Christ, very God,\n and very Man ; who truly suffered, was crucified, dead,\n and buried, to reconcile his Father to us, and to be a\n sacrifice, not only for original guilt, but also for actual\n sins of men.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. III. Of the going doicn of Christ into Hell.\n</p>\n<p>\n As Christ died for us, and was buried; so also is it to\n be believed, that he went down into Hell.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. IV. Of the Resurrection of Christ-\n</p>\n<p>\n Christ did truly rise again from death, and took again\n his body, with flesh, bones, and all things appertaining\n to the perfectionof Man\u2019snature; wherewith he ascended\n into heaven, and there sitteth, until he return to judge all\n Men at the last day.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. V. Of the Holy Ghost.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Holy Ghost, proceeding from the Father and the\n Son, is of one substance, majesty, and glory, with the\n Father and the Son, very and eternal God.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. VI. Of the Sufficiency of the Holy Scriptures for\n Salvation.\n</p>\n<p>\n Holy Scripture containeth all things necessary to sal\u00ac\n vation : so that whatsoever is not read therein, nor may\n be proved thereby, is not to be required of any man, that\n it should be believed as an article of the Faith, or be\n thought requisite or necessary to salvation. In the name\n of the Holy Scripture we do understand those canonical\n Books of the Old and New Testament, of v/hose author\u00ac\n ity was never any doubt in the Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of the Names and Number of trie Canonical Books.\n</p>\n<p>\n Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy,\n Joshua, Judges, Ruth, The First Book of Samuel, The\n Second Book of Samuel, The First Book of Kings, The\n Second Book of Kings The First Book of Chronicles,\n The Second Book of Chronicles, The First Book of Es-\n dras, The Second Book of Esdras, The Book of Esther,\n The Book of Job, The Psalms, The Proverbs, Ecclesiastes\n or Preacher, Cantica, or Songs of Solomon, Four Prophets\n the greater, Twelve Prophets the less.\n</p>\n<p>\n And the other Books (as Hierome saith) the Church\n doih read for example of life and instruction of man\u00ac\n ners; but yet doth it not apply them to establish any\n doctrine; such are these following:\n</p>\n<p>\n The Third Book of Esdras, The Fourth Book of Es\u00ac\n dras, The Book of Tobias, The Book of Judith, The rest\n \u25a0 of the Book of Esther, The Book of Wisdom, Jesus the\n Son of Sirach, Baruch the Prophet, The Song of the\n Three Children, The Story of Susanna, Of Bel and the\n Dragon, The Prayer of Manasses, The First Book of\n Maccabees, The Second Book of Maccabees.\n</p>\n<p>\n All the Books of the New Testament, as they are\n commonly received, we do receive, and account them\n \u25baCanonical\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. VII. Of the Old Testament.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Old Testament is not contrary to the New: for\n bom in the Old and New Testament everlasting life is\n offered to Mankind by Christ, who is the only Mediator\n</p>\n<p>\n between God and Man, being both God and Man.\n Wherelore they are not to be heard, which feign that the\n old Fathers did look only for transitory promises. Al\u00ac\n though the Law given from God by Moses, as touching\n Ceremonies and Rites, do not bind Christian men, nor\n the Civil precepts thereof ought of necessity to be re\u00ac\n ceived in any commonwealth; yet notwithstanding, no\n Christian man whatsoever is free from the obedience of\n the Commandments whicli are called Moral.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. VIII. Of the Creeds.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Nicme Creed, and that which is commonly called\n the Apostles ' Creed, ought thoroughly to be received and\n believed : for they may be proved by most certain war\u00ac\n rants of Holy Scripture.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. IX. Of Original or Birth-Sin.\n</p>\n<p>\n Original sin standeth not in the following of Adam (as\n the Pelagians do vainly talk;] but it is the fault and cor\u00ac\n ruption of the Nature of every man, that naturally is en\u00ac\n gendered of the offspring of Adam ; whereby man is very\n far gone from original righteousness, and is of his own\n nature inclined to evil, so that the flesh lusteth always\n contrary to the Spirit; and therefore in every person bom\n into this world, it deserveth God\u2019s wrath and damnation.\n And this infection ofnature doth remain, yea in them that\n are regenerated; whereby the lust of the flesh, called in\n Greek (ppouppa aapKos , (which some do expound the\n wisdom, some sensuality, some the affection, some the\n desire, of the flesh,) is not subject to the I.aw of God.\n And although there is no condemnation tor them that be\u00ac\n lieve and are baptized ; yet the Apostle doth confess, that\n concupiscence and lust hath of itself the nature of sin.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art.X. Of Frec-lVxll.\n</p>\n<p>\n The condition of Man after the fall of Adam is such,\n that he cannot turn and prepare himself, by his own nat\n ural strength and good works, to faith, and calling upon\n God. Wherefore we have no power to do good works\n pleasant and acceptable to God, without the grace of God\n by Christ preventing us, that we may have a good will,\n and working with us, when we have that good will.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XI. Of the Justification of Alan.\n</p>\n<p>\n We are accounted righteous before God, only for the\n merit o & our Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ by Faith,\n and not for our own works or deservings. Wherelore,\n that we are justified by Faith only, is a most wholesome\n Doctrine, and very full of comfort, as more largely is\n expressed in the Homily of Justification.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XII. Of Good Works.\n</p>\n<p>\n Albeit that Good Works, which arc the fruits of Faith,\n and follow after Justification, cannot put away our sins,\n and endure the severity of God\u2019s judgment; yet are\n they pleasing and acceptable to God in Christ., and do\n spring out necessarily of a true and lively Faith ; inso\u00ac\n much that by them a lively Faith may be as evidently\n known, as a tree discerned by the fruit.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XIII. Of Works before Justification.\n</p>\n<p>\n Works done before the grace of Christ, and the Inspi\u00ac\n ration of his Spirit, are not pleasant to God, forasmuch\n as they spring not of faith in Jesus Christ; neither do\n they make men meet to receive grace, or (as the Sehool-\n authors say) deserve grace of eongruity : yea rather, for\n that they are not done as God hath willed and command\u00ac\n ed them to be done, we doubt not but, they have the\n nature of sin.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XIV. Of Works of Supererogation.\n</p>\n<p>\n Voluntary Works besides, over and above, God\u2019s Com\u00ac\n mandments, which they call Works of Supererogation,\n cannot be taught without arrogancy and impiety: for by\n them men do declare, that they do not only render unto\n God as much as (hey are bound to do, but that they do\n more for his sake, than of bounden duty is required:\n whereas Christ saith plainly, When ye have done all that\n are commanded to you,say,We are unprofitable servants-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0287/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 157, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0287/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 315, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 548}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0287/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 631, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1096}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0287/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1263, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2193}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0287/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2527, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4387}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0287/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ok/of/co/mm/on/pr/ay/00/ep/is/_7/bookofcommonpray00epis_7/bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0287.jp2", "height": 4387, "width": 2527, "levels": 6, "size": 771966}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"287\">\n<p>\n 275\n</p>\n<p>\n ARTICLES OF RELIGION.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XV. Of Christ alone without Sin.\n</p>\n<p>\n Christ in the truth of our nature was made like unto\n us in all things, sin only except, from which he was\n clearly void, both in his flesh, and in his spirit. He came\n to be the Lamb without spot, who, by sacrifice of himself\n once made, should take away the sins of the world ; and\n sin (as St. John saith) was not in him. IJut all we the\n rest, although baptized, and born again in Christ, yet\n ofiend in many things; and if we say we have no sin,\n we deceive ourselves, and the truth is not in us.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XVI. Of Sin after Baptism.\n</p>\n<p>\n Not every deadly sin willingly committed after Bap\u00ac\n tism is sin against the Holy Ghost, and unpardonable.\n Wherefore the grant of repentance is not to be denied\n to such as fall into sin after Baptism. After we have\n received the Holy Ghost, we may depart from grace\n given, and fall into sin, and by the grace of God we may\n arise again, and amend our lives. And therefore they\n are to be condemned, which say, they can no more sin\n as long as they live here, or deny the place of forgive\u00ac\n ness to such as truly repent.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XVII. Of Predestination and Election.\n</p>\n<p>\n Predestination to Life is the everlasting purpose of\n God, whereby (before the foundations ofthe world were\n laid) he hath constantly decreed by his counsel secret to\n us, to deliver from curse and damnation those whom he\n hath chosen in Christ out of mankind, and to bring them\n by Chrisi to everlasting salvation, as vessels made to\n honour. Wherefore, they which be endued with so ex\u00ac\n cellent a benefit of God, be called according to God\u2019s\n purpose by his Spirit working in due season : they\n through Grace obey the calling : they be justified freely :\n they be made sons of God by adoption : they be made\n like the image of his only-begotten Son Jesus Christ :\n they walk religiously in good works, and at length, by\n God\u2019s mercy, they attain to everlasting felicity.\n</p>\n<p>\n As the godly consideration of Predestination, and our\n Election in Christ, is full of sweet, pleasant, and un\u00ac\n speakable comfort to godly persons, and such as feel in\n themselves the working ofthe Spirit of Christ, mortify\u00ac\n ing the works of the flesh, and their earthly members,\n and drawing up their mind to high and heavenly things,\n as well because it doth greatly establish and confirm\n their faith of eternal Salvation to be enjoyed through\n Christ, as because it doth fervently kindle their love\n towards God: So, for curious and carnal persons, lack\u00ac\n ing the Spirit of Christ, to have continually before their\n eyes the sentence ofGod\u2019s Predestination, is a most dan\u00ac\n gerous downfall, whereby the Devil doth thrust them\n either into desperation, or into wretchlessness of most\n unclean living, no less perilous than desperation.\n</p>\n<p>\n Furthermore, we must receive God\u2019s promises in such\n wise, as they be generally set forth to us in Holy Scrip\u00ac\n ture : and, iri our doings, that Will of God is to be fol\u00ac\n lowed, which we have expressly declared unto us in\n the Word of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art.

Of obtaining eternal Salvation only ly the\n Name of Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n They also are to be had accursed that presume to say,\n That every man shall be saved by the Law or Sect which\n he professeth, so that he be dili gent to frame his life\n according to that Law and the light of Nature. For\n Holy Scripture doth set out unto us only the Name of\n Jesus Christ, whereby men must be saved.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XIX. Of the Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n The visible Church of Christ is a congregation of faith\u00ac\n ful men, in the which the pure Word of God is preached,\n and the Sacraments be duly ministered according to\n Christ\u2019s ordinance, in all those things that of necessity\n are requisite to the same.\n</p>\n<p>\n As the Church of Jerusalem^ Alexandria , and Antioch ,\n have erred ; so also the Church of Rome hath erred, not\n only in their living and manner of Ceremonies, but also\n in matters of Faith.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XX. Of the Authority of the Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Church hath power to decree Rites or Ceremonies,\n and authority in Controversies of Faith: and yet it is not\n lawful for the Church to ordain any thing that is contrary\n to God\u2019s Word written, neither may it so expound one\n place of Scripture, that it be repugnant to another.\n Wherefore, allhough the Church be a witness and a\n keeper of Holy Writ, yet, as it ought not to decree any\n</p>\n<p>\n thing against the same, so besides the same ought it not to\n enforce any thing to be believed lor necessity ol Salvation\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XXL Of the Authority of General Councils.*\n Art. XXII. Of Purgatory.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Romish Doctrine concerning Purgatory, Pardon,\n Worshipping and Adoration, as well of Images as of\n Relics, and also Invocation of Saints, is a fond thing,\n vainly invented, and grounded upon no warranty of\n Scripture, but rather repugnant to the Word of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XXIII. Of Ministering in the Congregation.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is not lawful for any man to take upon him the office\n of public preaching, or ministering the Sacraments in\n the Congregation, before he be lawfully called, and sent\n to execute the same. And those we ought to judge\n lawfully called and sent, which be chosen and called to\n this work by men who have public authority given umo\n them in the Congregation, to call and send Ministers\n into the Lord\u2019s vineyard.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XXIV. Of Speaking in the Congregation in such a\n Tongue as the people understandeth.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is a thing plainly repugnant to the Word of God,\n and the custom ofthe Primitive Church, to have public\n Prayer in the Church, or to minister the Sacraments, in\n a tongue not understanded of the people.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XXV. Of the Sacraments.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sacraments ordained of Christ be not only badges or\n tokens of Christian men\u2019s profession, but rather they be\n certain sure witnesses, and effectual signs of grace, and\n God\u2019s good will towards us, by the which he doth work\n invisibly in us, and doth not only quicken, but also\n strengthen and confirm our Faith in him.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are two Sacraments ordained of Christ our Lord\n in the Gospel, that is to say, Baptism, and the Supper\n of the Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n Those five commonly called Sacraments, that is to\n say, Confirmation, Penance, Orders, Matrimony, and\n Extreme Unction, are not to be counted for Sacraments\n ofthe Gospel, being such as have grown partly of the\n corrupt following of the Apostles, partly are states of\n life allowed in the Scriptures; but yet have not like\n nature of Sacraments with Baptism and the Lord\u2019s\n Supper, for that they have not any visible sign or cere\u00ac\n mony ordained of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Sacraments were not ordained of Christ to be\n gazed upon, or to be carried about, but that we should\n duly use them. And in such only as worthily receive\n the same, they have a wholesome effect or operation:\n but they that receive them unworthily, purchase to\n themselves damnation, as Saint Paul saith.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XXVI. Of the Unworthiness of the Ministers , which\n hinders not the effect of the Sacraments.\n</p>\n<p>\n Although in the visible Church the evil be ever min\u00ac\n gled with the good, and sometimes the evil have chief\n authority in the Ministration of the Word and Sacra\u00ac\n ments, yet forasmuch as they do not the same in their\n own name, but in Christ\u2019s, and do minister by his com\u00ac\n mission and authority, we may use their Ministry, both\n in hearing the Word of God, and in receiving the Sacra\u00ac\n ments. Neither is the effect of Christ\u2019s ordinance taken\n away by their wickedness, nor the grace of God\u2019s gifts\n diminished from such as by faith, and rightly, do receive\n the Sacraments ministered urito them ; which be effect\u00ac\n ual,because of Christ\u2019s institution and promise, although\n they be ministered by evil men.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nevertheless, it appertaineth to the discipline of the\n Church, that inquiry be made of evil Ministers, and that\n they be accused by those that have knowledge of their\n offences; and finally, being found guilty, by just judg\u00ac\n ment be deposed.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XXVII. Of Baptism.\n</p>\n<p>\n Baptism is not only a sign of profession, and mark\n of difference, whereby Christian men are discerned f rom\n others that be not christened, but it is also a sign of Re\u00ac\n generation. or New Birth,whereby, as by an instrument,\n they that receive Baptism rightly are grafted into the\n Church ; the promises ofthe forgiveness ofsin, andofour\n adoption to be the sons of God by the Holy Ghost, are\n</p>\n<p>\n * The 21st of the former Articles is omitted ; because\n it is partly of a local and civil nature, and is provided\n for, as to the remaining parts of it, in other Articles.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0288/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 156, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0288/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 313, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 548}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0288/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 626, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1096}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0288/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1252, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2193}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0288/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2505, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4387}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0288/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ok/of/co/mm/on/pr/ay/00/ep/is/_7/bookofcommonpray00epis_7/bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0288.jp2", "height": 4387, "width": 2505, "levels": 6, "size": 762094}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"288\">\n<p>\n 276\n</p>\n<p>\n ARTICLES OF RELIGION.\n</p>\n<p>\n visibly signed and sealed ; Faith is confirmed, and Grace\n increased by virtue ofprayer unto God. The Baptism of\n young Children is in any wise to be retained in the\n Church, as most agreeable with the institution of Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XXVIII. Of the Lord ' s Supper.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Supper of the Lord is not only a sign of the love\n that Christians ought to have among themselves one to\n another; but rather it is a Sacrament of our Redemption\n by Christ\u2019s death: insomuch that to such as rightly,\n worthily, and with faith, receive the same, the Bread\n which we break is a partaking of the Body of Christ;\n and likewise the Cup of Blessing is a partaking of the\n Blood of Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n Transubstantiation (or the change of the substance of\n Bread and Wine) in the Supper of the Lord, cannot be\n proved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the plain\n words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of a Sacra\u00ac\n ment, and hath given occasion to many superstitions.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Body of Christ is given, taken, and eaten, in the\n Supper, only after an heavenly and spiritual manner.\n And the mean whereby the Body of Christ is received\n and eaten in the Supper, is Faith.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper was not by\n Christ\u2019s ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up, or\n worshipped.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XXIX. Of the Wicked , which eat not the Body of\n Christ in the use of the Lord ' s Supper.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Wicked, and such as be void of a lively faith,\n although they do carnally and visibly press with their\n teeth (as Saint. Jlupustine saith) the Sacrament of the\n Body and Blood of Christ; yet in no wise are they par\u00ac\n takers of Christ: but rather, to their condemnation, do\n eat and drink the sign or Sacrament of so great a thing.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XXX. Of both Kinds.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Cup of the Lord is not to be denied to the Lay-\n people: for both the parts of the Lord\u2019s Sacrament, by\n Christ\u2019s ordinance and commandment, ought to be min\u00ac\n istered to all Christian men alike.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XXXI. Of the one Oblation of Christ finished upon\n the Cross.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Offering of Christ once made is that perfect re\u00ac\n demption, propitiation, and satisfaction, for all the sins\n of the whole world, both original and actual; and there\n is none other satisfaction for sin, but that alone. Where\u00ac\n fore the sacrifices of Masses, in the which it was com\u00ac\n monly said, that the Priest did offer Christ for the quick\n and the dead, to have remission of pain or guilt, were\n blasphemous fables, and dangerous deceits.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XXXII. Of the Marriage of Priests.\n</p>\n<p>\n Bishops, Priests, and Deacons, are not commanded by\n God\u2019s Law, either to vow the estate of single life, or to\n abstain from marriage: therefore it is lawful for them,\n as for all other Christian men, to marry at their own\n discretion, as they shall judge the same to serve better\n to godliness.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XXXIII. Of excommunicate Persons , how they are\n to be avoided.\n</p>\n<p>\n That person which by open denunciation of the Church\n is rightly cut off from the unity of the Church, and ex\u00ac\n communicated, ought to be taken of the whole multitude\n of the faithful, as an Heathen and Publican, until he be\n openly reconciled by penance, and received into the\n Church by a Judge that hath authority thereunto.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XXXIV. Of the Traditions of the Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is not necessary that Traditions and Ceremonies be\n In all places one, or utterly like; for at all times they\n have been divers, and may be changed according to the\n diversity of countries, times, and men\u2019s manners, so that\n nothing be ordained against God\u2019s Word. Whosoever,\n through his private judgment, willingly and purposely,\n doth openly break the Traditions and Ceremonies of the\n Church, which be not repugnant to the Word of God,\n and be ordained and approved by common authority,\n ought to be rebuked openly, (that others may fear to do\n the like,) as he that offendet h against the common order of\n the Church, and hurteth the authority of the Magistrate,\n and woundeth t he consciences of the weak brethren.\n</p>\n<p>\n Every particular or national Church hath authority to\n ordain, change, and abolish, Ceremonies or Rites of the\n Church ordained only by man\u2019s authority, so that all\n things be done to edifying.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XXXV. Of the Homilies.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Second Book of Homilies, the several titles\n whereof we have joined under this Article, doth contain\n a godly and wholesome Doctrine, and necessary for\n these times, as doth the former Book of Homilies, which\n were set forth in the time of Edward the Sixth; and\n therefore we judge them to be read in Churches by the\n Ministers, diligently and distinctly, that they may be\n understanded of the people.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of the Names of the Homilies.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. Of the right Use of the Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Against Peril of Idolatry.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Of repairing and keeping clean of Churches.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Of good Works: first of Fasting.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Against Gluttony and Drunkenness.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Against Excess of Apparel.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Of Prayer.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. Of the Place and Time of Prayer.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9.

Of the Nativity of Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. Of the Passion of Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. Of the Resurrection of Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15 Of the worthy receiving of the Sacrament of the\n Body and Blood of Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n 16. Of the Gifts of the Holy Ghost.\n</p>\n<p>\n 17. For the Rogation-days.\n</p>\n<p>\n 18. Of the State of Matrimony\n</p>\n<p>\n 19. Of Repentance.\n</p>\n<p>\n 20. Against Idleness\n</p>\n<p>\n 21. Against Rebellion.\n</p>\n<p>\n [This Article is received in this Church, so far as it\n declares the Books of Homilies to be an explication of\n Christian doctrine, and instructive in piety and morals.\n But all references to the constitution and laws of England\n are considered as inapplicable to the circumstances of\n this Church ; which also suspends the order for the read\u00ac\n ing of said Homilies in churches, until a revision of\n them may be conveniently made, for the clearing of\n them, as well from obsolete words and phrases, as from\n the local references .] f\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XXXVI. Of Consecration of Bishops and Ministers.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Book of Consecration of Bishops, and Ordering of\n Priests and Deacons, as set forth by the General Conven\u00ac\n tion of itiis Church in 1792, doth contain all things neces\u00ac\n sary to such Consecration and Ordering; neither hath it\n any thing that, of itself, is superstitious and ungodly.\n And, therefore, whosoever are consecrated or ordered\n according to said Form, we decree all such to be rightly,\n orderly, and lawfully consecrated and ordered.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XXXVII. Of the Power of the Civil Magistrates.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Power of the Civil Magistrate extendeth to all\n men, as well Clergy as Laity, in all things temporal; but\n hath no authority in things purely spiritual. And we\n hold it to be the duty of all men who are professors of\n the Gospel, to pay respectful obedience to the Civil Au\u00ac\n thority, regularly and legitimately constituted.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XXXVIII. Of Christian Men ' s Goods , which are\n not common.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Riches and Goods of Christians ore not common,\n as touching the right, title, and possession of the same;\n as certain Anabaptists do falsely boast. Notwithstand\u00ac\n ing, every man ought, of such things as he possesseth,\n liberally to give alms to the poor, according to his ability.\n</p>\n<p>\n Art. XXXIX. Of a Christian Man ' s Oath.\n</p>\n<p>\n As we confess that vain and rash Swearing is forbidden\n Christian men by our Lord Jesus Christ, and James his\n Apostle, so we judge, that Christian Religion doth not\n prohibit, but that a man may swear when the Magistrate\n requireth, in a cause of faith and charity, so it be done\n according to the Prophet\u2019s teaching, in justice, judgment,\n and truth.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0289/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 157, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0289/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 315, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 548}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0289/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 631, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1096}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0289/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1263, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2193}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0289/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2527, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4387}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ok:of:co:mm:on:pr:ay:00:ep:is:_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7:bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0289/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ok/of/co/mm/on/pr/ay/00/ep/is/_7/bookofcommonpray00epis_7/bookofcommonpray00epis_7_0289.jp2", "height": 4387, "width": 2527, "levels": 6, "size": 647179}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"289\">\n<p>\n [ 277 ]\n</p>\n<p>\n THE FORM AND MANNER OF\n</p>\n<p>\n MAKING, ORDAINING, AND CONSECRATING\n</p>\n<p>\n BISHOPS, PRIESTS, AND DEACONS;\n</p>\n<p>\n ACCORDING TO THE ORDER OF THE PROTESTANT EPISCOPAL CHURCH IN THE UNITED STATES\n OF AMERICA, AS ESTABLISHED BY THE BISHOPS, THE CLERGY, AND LAITY OF SAID CHURCH,\n IN GENERAL CONVENTION, IN THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER, A.

Then\n saith he unto his disciples, The har\u00ac\n vest truly is plenteous, but the labour\u00ac\n ers are few. Pray ye therefore the\n Lord of the harvest, that he will\n send forth labourers into his harvest.\n</p>\n<p>\n IT Or else this that followeth, out of the tenth\n Chapter of Saint John.\n</p>\n<p>\n St. John X. 1.\n</p>\n<p>\n ERILY, verily, I say unto you,\n He that entereth not by the door\n into the sheep-fold, but climbeth up\n some other way, the same is a thief\n and a robber. But he that entereth\n in by the door is the Shepherd of\n the sheep. To him the porter open-\n eth, and the sheep hear his voice;\n and he calleth his own sheep by\n name, and leadeth them out. And\n when he putteth forth his own sheep,\n he goeth before them, and the sheep\n follow him ; for they know his voice.\n And a stranger will they not follow,\n</p>\n<p>\n MM\n</p>\n<p>\n but will flee from him; for they\n know not the voice of strangers.\n This parable spake Jesus unto them,\n but they understood not what things\n they were which he spake unto\n them. Then said Jesus unto them\n again, Verily, verily, I say unto you,\n I am the door of the sheep. All\n that ever came before me are thieves\n and robbers ; but the sheep did not\n hear them. I am the door; by me\n if any man enter in, he shall be\n saved, and shall go in and out, and\n find pasture. The thief cometh not\n but for to steal, and to kill, and to\n destroy: I am come that they might\n have life, and that they might have\n it more abundantly. I am the good\n Shepherd: the good Shepherd giveth\n his life for the sheep. But he that\n is an hireling, and not the Shepherd,\n whose own the sheep are not, seeth\n the wolf coming, and leaveth the\n sheep, and fleeth; and the wolt\n catcheth them, and scattereth the\n sheep. The hireling fleeth, because\n he is an hireling, and careth not for\n the sheep. I am the good Shepherd,\n and know my sheep, and am known\n of mine. As the Father knoweth\n me, even so know I the Father:\n and I lay down my life for the sheep.\n And other sheep I have, which are\n not of this fold: them also I must\n bring, and they shall hear my voice ;\n and there shall be one fold, and one\n Shepherd.\n</p>\n<p>\n IT Then the Bishop shall say unto them as\n followeth.\n</p>\n<p>\n Y E have heard, Brethren, as\n well in your private examina\u00ac\n tion, as in the exhortation which\n was now made to you, and in the\n holy Lessons taken out of the Gospel,\n and the writings of the Apostles, of\n what dignity, and of how great im\u00ac\n portance this Office is, whereunto ye\n are called.

And now be\u00ac\n hold, I go bound in the spirit unto\n</p>\n<p>\n Jerusalem, not knowing the things\n that shall befall me there; save that\n the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every\n city, saying, That bonds and afflic\u00ac\n tions abide me. But none of these\n things move me, neither count 1 my\n life dear unto myself, so that I might\n finish my course with joy, and the\n ministry which I have received of the\n Lord Jesus, to testify the Gospel of\n the grace of God.

Wherefore I take you to\n record this day, that 1 am pure from\n the blood of all men. For I have\n not shunned to declare unto you all\n the counsel of God. Take heed,\n therefore, unto yourselves, and to all\n the flock, over the which the Holy\n Ghost hath made you Overseers, to\n feed the Church of God, which he\n hath purchased with his own blood.\n For I know this, that after my de\u00ac\n parting shall grievous wolves enter\n in among you, not sparing the flock.\n Also of your own selves shall men\n arise, speaking perverse things, to\n draw away disciples after them.\n Therefore watch, and remember,\n that by the space of three years, 1\n ceased not to warn every one, night\n and day, with tears. And now,\n brethren, I commend you to God, and\n to the Word of his grace, which is\n able to build you up, and to give you\n an inheritance among all them which\n are sanctified. I have coveted no\n man\u2019s silver, or gold, or apparel;\n yea, ye yourselves know, that these\n hands have ministered unto my ne\u00ac\n cessities, and to them that were with\n me.
