So, although\n you may always as now be poor in this world\u2019s\n goods, you may be rich in faith and look forward\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:rg:ar:et:go:rd:on:or:00:my:er:margaretgordonor00myer:margaretgordonor00myer_0102/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 235, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 411}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:rg:ar:et:go:rd:on:or:00:my:er:margaretgordonor00myer:margaretgordonor00myer_0102/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 471, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 823}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:rg:ar:et:go:rd:on:or:00:my:er:margaretgordonor00myer:margaretgordonor00myer_0102/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 943, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1647}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:rg:ar:et:go:rd:on:or:00:my:er:margaretgordonor00myer:margaretgordonor00myer_0102/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1887, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3295}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:rg:ar:et:go:rd:on:or:00:my:er:margaretgordonor00myer:margaretgordonor00myer_0102/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ma/rg/ar/et/go/rd/on/or/00/my/er/margaretgordonor00myer/margaretgordonor00myer_0102.jp2", "height": 3295, "width": 1887, "levels": 6, "size": 346548}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"102\">\n<p>\n 92 MARGARET GORDON,\n</p>\n<p>\n to an inheritance in heaven and a crown which is\n incorruptible and never-fading/\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n Margaret was silent; the felt that what her\n father had said was not mere words, for his life\n was a commentary on what he professed to believe.\n His prayers, spiritual and earnest, were as if he\n met his Maker face to face,\u201d his daily walk like\n that of one intimate with Christ; but the doctrine\n of implicit faith he was endeavouring to inculcate\n appeared too hard to be received by the rebellious\n heart of childhood.

There is but one way,\n however, of answering this question : God only can\n make rules and conditions which we are bound to\n obey, for he alone is perfect; and he has said, \u2018 If\n thy brother trespass against thee rebuke him, and\n if he repent forgive him.\u2019 But even if there is no\n repentance shown, and we are unable to forget the\n wrong, we are not the less obliged to forgive fully\n and freely; not ^seven times only, but seventy\n times seven.\u2019 \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Margaret had remained for the most part silent,\n but she had been an attentive listener; leaning\n her head upon her hand and looking up into her\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:rg:ar:et:go:rd:on:or:00:my:er:margaretgordonor00myer:margaretgordonor00myer_0195/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 235, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 411}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:rg:ar:et:go:rd:on:or:00:my:er:margaretgordonor00myer:margaretgordonor00myer_0195/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 471, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 823}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:rg:ar:et:go:rd:on:or:00:my:er:margaretgordonor00myer:margaretgordonor00myer_0195/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 943, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1647}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:rg:ar:et:go:rd:on:or:00:my:er:margaretgordonor00myer:margaretgordonor00myer_0195/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1887, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3295}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:rg:ar:et:go:rd:on:or:00:my:er:margaretgordonor00myer:margaretgordonor00myer_0195/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ma/rg/ar/et/go/rd/on/or/00/my/er/margaretgordonor00myer/margaretgordonor00myer_0195.jp2", "height": 3295, "width": 1887, "levels": 6, "size": 351132}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"195\">\n<p>\n OR CAN I FORGIVE?\n</p>\n<p>\n 185\n</p>\n<p>\n father\u2019s face, she did not lose a single word of what\n he taught the little group before him, but, like\n Mary, she kept all the sayings and pondered\n them in her heart;\u201d secretly treasuring them there\n until a time should come when there might be need\n to bring them forth.

The space between the windows where it\n stood was filled up by a deep arch or grotto, made\n of the branches of green sjiruce, extending over\n the platform and fountain, and, with the flower-\n garden, ornamented as it was with statuettes, had\n a beautiful effect.\n</p>\n<p>\n There was one great want, however, which Mrs.\n Ainslie had not once thought of.

The beginnings of these small faults of our\n nature are most treacherous; their growth is im\u00ac\n perceptible, until they at length advance into emo\u00ac\n tions which, when their dominion is established,\n are likely to pierce the heart with many sorrows.\n What the wise king said of one of them holds true\n of all, \u2018 That their beginning is as one that letteth out\n waterJ It at first issues from a small chink, which\n might have been easily stopped, but, being ne\u00ac\n glected, it is soon widened by the stream, until the\n bank is at last totally thrown down, and the flood\n is at liberty to deluge the whole plain.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. Ainslie could not find words to reply, and\n Mrs. Preston continued:\n</p>\n<p>\n Bear with me, Clara, while I say a few words\n more; not in the way of reproach\u2014for your own\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:rg:ar:et:go:rd:on:or:00:my:er:margaretgordonor00myer:margaretgordonor00myer_0451/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 235, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 411}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:rg:ar:et:go:rd:on:or:00:my:er:margaretgordonor00myer:margaretgordonor00myer_0451/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 471, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 823}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:rg:ar:et:go:rd:on:or:00:my:er:margaretgordonor00myer:margaretgordonor00myer_0451/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 943, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1647}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:rg:ar:et:go:rd:on:or:00:my:er:margaretgordonor00myer:margaretgordonor00myer_0451/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1887, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3295}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:rg:ar:et:go:rd:on:or:00:my:er:margaretgordonor00myer:margaretgordonor00myer_0451/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ma/rg/ar/et/go/rd/on/or/00/my/er/margaretgordonor00myer/margaretgordonor00myer_0451.jp2", "height": 3295, "width": 1887, "levels": 6, "size": 348402}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"451\">\n<p>\n OR CAN I FORGIVE?\n</p>\n<p>\n 435\n</p>\n<p>\n heart is busy enough with that now\u2014but on ac\u00ac\n count of the love I bear to you and yours.
