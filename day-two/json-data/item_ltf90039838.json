A wondrously\n beautiful light fell on the ocean, and the distant\n heights of the Neversink became a purple\n tinged with gold. The ships seemed still and\n spectral ; the night came up in a heavy blue,\n and there was solace in the rhythmic beat of\n the waves. In front of the balcony on which\n he rested, a fine band played, and the music\n was indescribably softened by the contiguity\n of the water. A crowd of promenaders surged\n through the halls and piazzas. There were\n animation, variety, brilliancy, and at the same\n time the communicative repose and exhilara-\n tion of the sea. We have only described the\n mood of an hour. There were other times in\n the day when the water twinkled with myriad\n diamond-points of reflected sunshine, and the\n East was belted with a delicate violet haze ;\n when the lower bay was dotted with the white\n sails of yachts, and the foliage of the Highlands\n was visible in a dark blue-green, and when the\n beach was crowded with ladies, children and\n nurses.
