In reply to your letter of the\n 19th, let me, first of all, urge you to place your feet down\n upon the firm and fundamental principle which is the ground\n on which every true Catholic stands,\u2014 viz., that the church,\n being the divine teacher established by Christ in the world,\n rightly claims from her disciples a hearty and intellectual\n acceptance of all that she authoritatively teaches. This prin\n ciple, given us by Our Lord, will carry you safely over all\n objections and difficulties that may spring up along your path.\n It was applied by St. Augustine to his acceptance of the Scrip\n tures, where he says: Ego vero Evangelio non crederem , nisi me\n Catholics? Ecclesix commoveret auctoritas.\n</p>\n<p>\n But, if you are going to give the assent of faith only to\n such doctrines as present no difficulties beyond the power of\n your finite intelligence to see through and solve by direct\n answer, you must put aside at once all the mysteries of faith,\n and you must frankly own yourself to be a rationalist pure\n and simple. You then constitute your own ability to solve\n difficulties, intellectual or scientific, into your test of the doc\u00ac\n trines proffered for your acceptance.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is to return to the old Protestant system of private\n judgment, or to open rationalism and unbelief.\n</p>\n<p>\n But you will let me, I hope, be frank, and urge that it is\n your moral, rather than your intellectual, nature that needs\n attention. God gives this grace to the humble; it is \u201c the\n clean of heart \u201d who \u201c shall see God.\u201d Let me press upon\n you the primary necessity of humility and persevering prayer\n for light and grace.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:de:rb:an:co:rr:es:po:00:mi:va:underbancorrespo00miva:underbancorrespo00miva_0021/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 467}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:de:rb:an:co:rr:es:po:00:mi:va:underbancorrespo00miva:underbancorrespo00miva_0021/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 935}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:de:rb:an:co:rr:es:po:00:mi:va:underbancorrespo00miva:underbancorrespo00miva_0021/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1871}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:de:rb:an:co:rr:es:po:00:mi:va:underbancorrespo00miva:underbancorrespo00miva_0021/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3742}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:de:rb:an:co:rr:es:po:00:mi:va:underbancorrespo00miva:underbancorrespo00miva_0021/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/de/rb/an/co/rr/es/po/00/mi/va/underbancorrespo00miva/underbancorrespo00miva_0021.jp2", "height": 3742, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 365139}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"21\">\n<p>\n 19\n</p>\n<p>\n Having said this much in general, I now refer more directly\n to your questions as to Holy Scripture.

When you\n asked me for \u201c spiritual help and enlightenment,\u201d I urged the\n importance of cultivating three virtues,\u2014humility, purity, and\n a spirit of prayer,\u2014virtues bearing, as it seemed to me, di\u00ac\n rectly on your present state of mind. And for enlightenment I\n referred you to the most authoritative teaching of Leo XIII.,\n as I would any person who came to me as a serious inquirer\n on the question of Holy Scripture. If you think that I\n \u201c shirked \u201d your request, or \u201d shuffled,\u201d as you say, you can\u00ac\n not have read the letter of the Holy Father in extenso or with\n care. In that letter the pope says :\n</p>\n<p>\n Rationalists deny that there is any such thing as revelation\n or inspiration, or Holy Scripture at all; they see, instead,\n only the forgeries and the falsehoods of men; they set down\n the Scripture narratives as stupid fables and lying stories; the\n miracles and the wonders of God\u2019s power are not what they\n are said to be, but the startling effects of natural law, or else\n mere tricks and myths. These detestable errors, whereby\n they think they destroy the truth of the divine books, are ob\u00ac\n truded on the world as the peremptory pronouncements of a\n certain newly-invented \u201c free science a science, however,\n which is so far from final that they are perpetually modifying\n and supplementing it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Surely you will have been able yourself, knowing the real\n state of your own mind better than I can know it, to say\n whether or not your catalogue of narratives described by you\n as \u201c altogether false,\u201d \u201c mere fiction devoid of any particle\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:de:rb:an:co:rr:es:po:00:mi:va:underbancorrespo00miva:underbancorrespo00miva_0029/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 467}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:de:rb:an:co:rr:es:po:00:mi:va:underbancorrespo00miva:underbancorrespo00miva_0029/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 935}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:de:rb:an:co:rr:es:po:00:mi:va:underbancorrespo00miva:underbancorrespo00miva_0029/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1871}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:de:rb:an:co:rr:es:po:00:mi:va:underbancorrespo00miva:underbancorrespo00miva_0029/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3742}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:de:rb:an:co:rr:es:po:00:mi:va:underbancorrespo00miva:underbancorrespo00miva_0029/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/de/rb/an/co/rr/es/po/00/mi/va/underbancorrespo00miva/underbancorrespo00miva_0029.jp2", "height": 3742, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 386532}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"29\">\n<p>\n 27\n</p>\n<p>\n of truth,\u201d etc., is alluded to and condemned under the above\n extract.\n</p>\n<p>\n But I have said that you have not done justice to the Holy\n Father\u2019s teaching by the quotation that you have made from\n his encyclical.

This the Galileo case demonstrated absolutely\n and once for all; since we may safely affirm that whatever has\n shown itself to be a fact is at least a possibility.\n</p>\n<p>\n God has thus taught us, through history, that it is not to\n ecclesiastical congregations, but to men of science, that He\n has committed the elucidation of scientific questions, whether\n such questions are or are not treated of by Scripture, the\n Fathers, the church\u2019s common teaching, or special congrega\u00ac\n tions or tribunals of ecclesiastics actually summoned for the\n purpose. This also applies to all science\u2014to Scripture criti\u00ac\n cism, to biology, and to all questions concerning evolution,\n the antiquity of man, and the origin of either his body or his\n soul, or of both. For all ecclesiastics who know nothing of\n natural science, it is an act necessarily as futile as imperti\u00ac\n nent to express any opinion on such subjects.\n</p>\n<p>\n Therefore, Catholic men of science should calmly follow the\n even tenor of their way, regardless of all outcries, keeping\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 This fact was first called attention to by the Rev.

He has many attributes,\n some of which our reason reveals to us, while there may be\n many more which are altogether beyond our powers of concep\u00ac\n tion. There is no doubt a certain \u201c analogy \u201d between the\n \u201c attributes \u201d and \u201c modes of being \u201d of man and of God, but\n there is also an infinite and most mysterious difference. A\n man is not always actually \u201c loving \u201d or actually \u201c angry\u201d ;\n he is for the most part but potentially one or the other. But\n with God nothing is potential; His every energy is an actual,\n eternal act of His essence. Thus it cannot be denied that the\n nature of God\u2019s attributes, like the nature of God Himself, is\n incomprehensible to us. Moreover, God\u2019s attributes, while\n distinct, are each of them equally \u201c God,\u201d and therefore\n substantial. We can hardly then venture to affirm or deny\n that they are \u201c substantially distinct \u201d and \u201c distinctly sub\u00ac\n stantial.\u201d At the least it seems that reason must admit that\n they may be much more so than is commonly supposed.

But, just as the certainty of that fact does not\n make the function of the accoucheur less useful, so the sure\n advent of new conceptions and beliefs does not render useless\n the work of those who would prepare for and facilitate their\n safe delivery into the world of ideas.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thirdly, I write, because I am very strongly impressed with\n the various dangers 1 wherewith Catholicity is now threatened.;\n and, as it is to me evident that, as a moral agent, its power\n and influence are still enormous, I would do my best to serve it\n now, as I have done in the past.\n</p>\n<p>\n Fourthly, and lastly.
