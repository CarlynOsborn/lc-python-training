Rightly judging\n that Presbyterianism, and the Presbyterian\n clergy, formed the main barrier to their purpo\u00ac\n ses in the North, they resolved, if possible, to\n neutralize this element. It struck them that\n if they.could get the appointment of the cler\u00ac\n gy into their own hands, they might gradually\n fill the Church with men after their own hearts.\n Accordingly, to the consternation of every leal-\n hearted Scotchman, word arrived in Edinburgh\n in the end of March, 1712, that a bill had\n been introduced into Parliament for bestowing\n on certain patrons the power of presenting\n ministers to all the parishes in Scotland. Some\n of the ablest ministers were forthwith despatch\u00ac\n ed to London with instructions to offer the most\n strenuous opposition to the measure.

Two of the people\n thought that he might do well enough for a\n minister ; but all the rest thought that he was\n not fit to be their minister. Consequently, the\n Presbytery refused to admit him. Hereupon\n this man and his patron raised an action\n against the Presbytery, and petitioned the Court\n of Session to find that the Presbytery was\n hound to take him on trial, with a view to ad\u00ac\n mission. So far as any spiritual consequences\n (such as ordination) were implied in the de\u00ac\n cision, the Presbytery declined the competency\n of the Court of Session to judge the case ; but\n as they were anxious to ascertain whether their\n rejection of a vetoed presentee implied that he\n should also lose the living, they allowed the\n case to be argued in their name so far as any\n civil effect was concerned.

If a probationer who is\n presented to a parish, be not unacceptable to the people, he\n is ordained and becomes a minister. Allowing that patronage\n is a trust reposed in patrons by the State, it becomes an in\u00ac\n teresting question, whether this trust is designed for the be\u00ac\n nefit of probationers or the good of the people ' ?

Were you not safe in the Church\n of Scotland ? Were you and your children\n not secure of remaining doctrinally sound\n within its pale ?

The restoration and conversion of the\n Jews will be striking facts. Whether effected\n in the more ordinary ways, or, as is almost cer\u00ac\n tain, with miracles intermingled, the result will\n be abundantly remarkable.

Many of them\n smile at the idea of a restoration, simply be\u00ac\n cause there are such hindrances in the way.\n Very well. When the restoration takes place\n it will be all the more wonderful. \u201c When the\n Lord turns the captivity of Zion, you will be\n like them that dream. Your own mouth will\n be filled with laughter, and it will be said\n among the Gentiles, The Lord hath done great\n things for them.\u201d The event is not probable.\n You do not all expect it yourselves ; and many\n Gentiles do not. So it will be very surprising\n when it does take place. Again, much as\n many of the Jews desire a restoration, and\n confidently as some look forward to it, they all\n With one accord depreciate conversion, and are\n confident that such a calamity never can befal\n them.

The cause got a new impulse,\n the Gospel got a new trial, and the work of\n evangelization went on with new success in\n Britain. If this was the reflex influence of a\n few pagans converted, what would be the effect\n of like conversions among the Jews ?

The\n Gospel has already proved itself the power of\n God and the wisdom of God unto the salvation\n of Gentiles, and that on a somewhat extensive\n scale. But to complete the case, let it prove\n itself the power of God and the wisdom of God\n unto the salvation of the Jews.

The Analogy of Butler enjoys a reputation scarcely second to any\n other book than the Bible : to praise it would be a work of supererogation.\n As a specimen of analogical reasoning, we suppose it has never been equalled ;\n and its influence, in promoting ministerial efficiency, can hardly be over-rated.\n Some ministers are in the habit of reading it, carefully, once every year. The\n Analogy occupies about one half the volume ; the remainder consists of Dis\u00ac\n sertations and Sermons on important subjects, and may be read with pleasure\n and profit.

He follows out, with a cool and careful hand, the great\n principle of fitness, comparing things with each other, and demonstrating\n their relative importance, and the propriety, beauty, a ' nd grandeur of the es\u00ac\n sential truths in morality and religion.\u201d\u2014 N.
