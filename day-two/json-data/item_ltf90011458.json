This is foolishness to the natural man, but it\n is the power of God and the wisdom of God unto salvation. It was\n with this weapon that the apostles of our Lord fought and conquered\n every form of sin ; and Pharisaism and philosophy, wisdom and\n barbarism, felt alike its subduing influence, and melted into obedi\u00ac\n ence and holiness. It was with this lever that their successors over\u00ac\n turned the opposing and persecuting systems of Paganism, and\n gained the triumph for Jesus over all the external enemies of his\n dominion. This it is which must ever give its power to the Church\n of Christ, and her danger is, especially in periods of intellectual\n movement, lest she be swerved from the simplicity of the truth and\n the purity of the faith. When all is agitation around her, when the\n intellect of man is working out new trains of thought, and devising\n new systems of philosophy, when the sphere of sense is itself ex\u00ac\n panding, and nature seems to be developing her hidden mysteries,\n \u2014it is hard for the Church, and still harder for the Christian, to be\n satisfied with the ancient truth of God, and to rest upon revelation\n as given once and forever in its completeness ! The temptation is\n toward developement,\u2014developement of doctrine, or developement\n of practice,\u2014the one running into rationalism, the other into super\u00ac\n stition. In either case is it the worldly spirit creeping into the\n Church, and manifesting itself, according to the genius of the coun\u00ac\n try, or the age, or the individual, in bold speculation, or ascetic de\u00ac\n votion. Whichever may be the shape it takes, it is alike injurious\n to the power of the Church, alike fatal to her impression upon the\n world. Infected with either tendency, she cannot do her errand of\n mercy ; or if she does, mingles so much error with her work of\n truth, that it soon corrupts and perishes. While, therefore, brethren\n beloved, we are seizing the opportunities which God, in his provi\u00ac\n dence, is affording us, let us be careful so to maintain the Church\n which has been entrusted to our keeping, that when we shall send\n her forth, we may be sure that she will teach the simple truth of\n God, and impart to the nations whereto she is sent, not merely her\u00ac\n self and her forms, but the spirit of Him who is her head and very\n life !
