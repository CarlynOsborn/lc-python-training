We do not mean to say this of history as it lias been\n generally treated ; for most school books of this kind are but little more than ex-\n tended chronological tables, and offer nothing to the reader but a tedious mass of\n dates, and general observations. Such works may be useful to people of mature age,\n but they neither amuse, nor instruct the class of readers, for whom they are designed.\n Hut of all reading, there is none that so readily attracts the attention, anti lays hold of\n the sympatliy of chiklren and youth, as lively narratives of the enterprises, adventures,\n dangers, trials, successes and failures of mankind, and these it is the business of History\n to display. Hooks which treat of the works of nature and art, which exhibit geogra])hi-\n cal details, observations upon natural history, and natural philosophy \u2014 any, or all of\n these will be immediately thrown aside by a child left to his choice, for a book of stories,\n delineating events, in corrnexiorr with the developement of human passioirs.\n</p>\n<p>\n If tlien history, when propeiiy treated, is one of the most attractive of all studies, why\n is it not regularly taught in all our schools? It is not because it is deemed less useful,\n than other studies; \u201cthe proper study of mankind is man,\u201d arrd it cannot be erueretl\n upoir too soon. After possessing a knowledge of religion, and the duties we owe to God\n and our neighbour, history is the most important of all studies. It relates to us what\n has been done by nrankind, arrd thus teaches us what they may do. It acquaints us\n with the true character of our race, and eirables us to know ourselves better. It ap-\n prizes us of the existence of evil, and the way to shun it ; it acquaints us with the ex-\n isterrce of good, arrd -shows us how to attain it. .\n</p>\n<p>\n It cannot be, thei ' efore, tlrfit the limited use of history in our schools, is owing to an\n idea that it is useless. The fact must arise from the want of historical\u2019 books, written\n in a style which shall render them botli interesting and j)rofitable. Such at least is the\n conviction of the author of this volume ; and believing that a fii-st hook of History for\n general use in our schools is much to be desired, he has undertaken, and now offers\n to the public, the present volume.\n</p>\n<p>\n In preparing it, two things have been had in view. In the first place it should be\n useful ; and in the second } > lace to make it useful it must be entertaining. To accom-\n</p>\n<p>\n f )lish these ends, the book is provided with majis, and before the pupil entera upon the\n listory of any state or countiy, he is to learn Cinm them, its shape, boundaries, rivers,\n shores, & c. He is then briefly made acquainted with its jiresent state, its towns, and cities,\n and the occupations of its inhabitants. These geographical details are conveyed to the\n ])uj)il, by narrating supposed travels through \" ^rious countries, in which he takes a part.\n</p>\n<p>\n The pupil, being thus acquainted with the ^i/scnt condition of a country, is then\n told its Iiistor)\\ The author has been careful to introduce precise tlatcs, for without\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fi:rs:tb:oo:ko:fh:is:to:00:go:od:firstbookofhisto00good:firstbookofhisto00good_0012/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fi:rs:tb:oo:ko:fh:is:to:00:go:od:firstbookofhisto00good:firstbookofhisto00good_0012/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 602, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 838}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fi:rs:tb:oo:ko:fh:is:to:00:go:od:firstbookofhisto00good:firstbookofhisto00good_0012/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1677}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fi:rs:tb:oo:ko:fh:is:to:00:go:od:firstbookofhisto00good:firstbookofhisto00good_0012/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2409, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3355}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fi:rs:tb:oo:ko:fh:is:to:00:go:od:firstbookofhisto00good:firstbookofhisto00good_0012/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/fi/rs/tb/oo/ko/fh/is/to/00/go/od/firstbookofhisto00good/firstbookofhisto00good_0012.jp2", "height": 3355, "width": 2409, "levels": 6, "size": 684606}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"12\">\n<p>\n VI\n</p>\n<p>\n PREFACE.\n</p>\n<p>\n them, it would be impossible to give any distinct view of any poition of histoiy. But\n he h;is sought more assiduously to select from the \u00bbp-eat mass of events, those topics\n wliicli would be most calculated to ])lease ajid to improve the young reatler. He has\n introduced many tales, anecilotes, adventures, and curious particulars, for the double\n purpose of enlivening the book, and throwing light upon the jieriods and events with\n which they are connected. A large number of engravings have been inserted Jis well\n for illustration, as lor fixing certain ideas permanently in the memory of the jiupil. . \u2018 \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n A familiar style has been adopted, and the materials throughout are arranged on a\n new ])lan. The common method is to begin at the earliest date, and follow down the\n train of events to the present time. The author of this work has partially revei ' sed\n this method. He begins with the incMvidual states of our own country, and hrst exhib-\n its their present condition. He then notices a few recent events, and liaving fixed tlie\n attention of the reader upon the subject, proceeds to detail its history. Avoiding gene-\n ral statements, lie ' has endeavoured to keep the attention and interest of the puytil alive,\n by descriptions, sketcht^, and tales, which may at once gratify the taste, and improve\n tlie understanding. :\n</p>\n<p>\n It will be observed, that although the book contains a large quantity of matter, yet it\n only embraces the histoty of the Western Continent. It is believed that it will be more\n useful, than if it contained tlie, history of the Eastern Continent, also, in the same number\n of {)ages. In proportion tia \u2019a work is condensed, it becomes general, and of coui-se un-\n interesting to children. It tVasMeemed preferable, therefore, to give an ample history\n of our own Hemisphere, andnfthe pkm should be approved, a second volume, embrac-\n ing the histpiy of tlie Eastern Hemisphere, will be pubhshed.\n</p>\n<p>\n I '\n</p>\n<p>\n SUGGESTIONS TQ TEACHERS.\n</p>\n<p>\n The author .would respectfully suggest, tliat this volume be put into the hands of\n pupils, of from nine to sixteen years of fige. It is. not perhaps essential, but it would be\n better, that they siipidd have jiassefl tlirough some small work on geography. The\n teacher is of coui-se at liberty to n ' ject the questions on the chapters inserted through-\n out the work, and to frame such interrogations for Exercising the pupil, as he chooses.\n It is recommended even if they afe iKS^l, tliat they bq not strictly adhered to ; the teach-\n er\u2019s knowledge of the character of his jiufiils, wih often suggest to him more apt and\n afipropriate interrogations, than could be framed without that \" knowledge. At the end\n of the work is a chronological table, which tlie autbor deems important, and he re-\n commends that it be thorouifhlv riveted in the rnembry of the pupil, before he is al-\n lowed to quit the study. It is also^ recommended thaUlie pupil in his progi-css throufrh\n the work be required to tell the length, and average width, of each of the countries\n ffmnd on the maps ; these may be ascertained witirsufiicient accuracy by applyint? the\n scale of miles. In this and some otiier parts of his studies the pupil may need the aid\n of tiie teaciier.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fi:rs:tb:oo:ko:fh:is:to:00:go:od:firstbookofhisto00good:firstbookofhisto00good_0013/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fi:rs:tb:oo:ko:fh:is:to:00:go:od:firstbookofhisto00good:firstbookofhisto00good_0013/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 602, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 838}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fi:rs:tb:oo:ko:fh:is:to:00:go:od:firstbookofhisto00good:firstbookofhisto00good_0013/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1677}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fi:rs:tb:oo:ko:fh:is:to:00:go:od:firstbookofhisto00good:firstbookofhisto00good_0013/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2409, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3355}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fi:rs:tb:oo:ko:fh:is:to:00:go:od:firstbookofhisto00good:firstbookofhisto00good_0013/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/fi/rs/tb/oo/ko/fh/is/to/00/go/od/firstbookofhisto00good/firstbookofhisto00good_0013.jp2", "height": 3355, "width": 2409, "levels": 6, "size": 707712}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"13\">\n<p>\n CONTENTS\n</p>\n<p>\n I\n</p>\n<p>\n (\u2022Ichat* 1. \u2014 State of Maine.

The Indians did not cut\n down the trees ; they had no horses, and\n they had no tame animals of any kind.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The whole country, far and wide,\n was covered with forests. In these\n forests there were a great many bears,\n panthers, wild-cats, wolves, deer, moose,\n foxes, rabbits, beavers, and other ani-\n mals. The Indians then did not culti-\n vate the land, except perhaps that they\n raised a little corn, and a few pumpkins.\n They lived almost entirely upon the\n wild animals, which they killed with\n their bows and arrows.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. But at length, some v/hite men\n came, and they began to cut down the\n trees, and build houses. Pretty soon\n they erected saw-mills, and tlien they\n cleared the land, and raised wheat, and\n rye, and corn. And at lengtli more\n</p>\n<p>\n would the Indian chief tell yon ' ?

And so the white men increased,\n and they spread their towns and vil-\n lages over the land. And the Indians\n went away, or they died ; for their for-\n ests were cut down, and they could not\n live with the white people.- Thus the\n Penobscot tribe, which once contained\n many thousands, consists now of three\n hundred Indians only. Other tribes,\n once numerous and powerful, are now\n extinct. Such would be the story that\n the Indian chief would tell you, and it\n would be all true.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. As early as the year 1607, about\n one hundred English people came to\n Maine, and began a settlement at the\n mouth of the river Kennebec.

It is a delightful thing to travel\n about these mountains in summer. A\n great many people visit them every\n year, and they all come back much\n gratified with their journey.

This\n river runs through a valley of several\n miles in width, which is very rich and\n beautiful. The meadows here are ex-\n ceedingly fine. Very large crops of corn,\n wheat and oats are also cultivated in\n the valley.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Vermont has several very plea-\n sant towns along Connecticut river.\n Brattleborough is one of the prettiest\n villages in the State. It has several\n manufactories, and it is a place of a\n good deal of business. Bellows Falls\n is situated where the river tumbles over\n some rocks, in a very violent manner.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. There are a great many mills at\n this place. There is a bridge over the\n cataract, from which you can look down\n upon the whirling waters. There were\n once a great many salmon in Connec-\n ticut river, and the Indians, about one\n hundred years ago, used to kill a great\n many of them with spears, as they at-\n tempted to ascend the falls. They\n were very expert at this, and would\n often take several of them in the course\n of an hour.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Windsor is a very pleasant town,\n and has considerable business. If you\n ever go to Windsor, I hope you will\n go to the top of Ascutney Mountain.\n It is very lofty, and when you are on\n</p>\n<p>\n Questions on the Map of Vermont. \u2014 Bounda-\n ries 1 I)escril)e Lainoile River, Onion, Missisciue,\n Otter Creek.

In going from the eastern to the\n western part of Vermont, you will cross\n a great many mountains. These are\n called the Green Mountains. There is\n a range of them running through Ver-\n mont from north to south. They spread\n over all the middle parts of this State.\n</p>\n<p>\n (). On the western border of Ver-\n mont, is a very large lake called Cham-\n ! plain. At Burlington, you will find a\n steam-boat ready to carry you on the\n lake toward Canada. A^ou will be very\n much pleased with Burlington, for it is\n one of the handsomest towns in New\n England. It is situated on the shore\n of the lake, and gives you a very fine\n prospect of it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. At this place is a college called\n the University of Vermont. If you go\n to Middlebury, you will also find a col-\n lege there. You will see at Middle-\n bury, a great many manufactories, and\n a quarry, where they obtain very hand-\n some colored marble.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8.

This battle took\n place during the revolutionary war, of\n which I shall tell you more by and by.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. Vermont was not settled by the\n white people till some time after the\n other New England States. There,\n was a fort built near Brattleborough, in\n 1724, called Fort Dummer. The re-\n mains of it are still to be seen. It was\n built to protect the people, who had\n settled near there, from the Indians.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10.

It was decided in England, in\n 1664, that it belonged to New York, and\n consequently, the government of that\n colony began to sell the land to any\n persons who would buy. The settlers\n thought this very unjust, and determin-\n ed to resist. New York then sent\n troops into Vermont and there was\n some fighting. These difficulties were\n not settled till years after.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. During the revolutionary war,\n Vermont \\vas independent, and in 1791,\n it became one of the United States. It\n is now little more than one hundred\n years since this State was a mere wil-\n derness occupied only by ' scattered tribes\n of savages, bears, and wolves. Now it has?\n a great many flourishing towns, and it\n is expected that steam-boats will soon\n navigate the Connecticut, as far up as\n Windsor.

About ten years before, some per-\n sons had come from England, and set-\n tled at Plymouth. At that period, many\n of the people in England were persecu-\n ted, and could not be happy there. \u2014 |\n They chose therefore to come to Amer-\n ica, and live in the woods with Indians\n and wild beasts around them, rather than\n stay there.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Accordingly fifteen hundred per-\n sons came over in 1630, and settled at\n Charlestown, Dorchester, and other pla-\n ces. A man, by the name of Blackstone,\n came to the place where Boston now\n stands, and liking it pretty well, he told\n some of the people about it, and they\n went and settled there.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. The place was surrounded by\n swamps then, and there were so many\n wolves, that they used often to attack\n the sheep and cattle at night, and kill\n them. The first settlers here suffered\n a great deal. They had poor miserable\n luits to live in, and in winter, the wea-\n tlier was excessively cold. They were\n almost starved, too, for want of food. A\n great many of them died from hunger,\n cold, and distress.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Such is a brief sketch of the first\n settlement of Boston. What a won-\n derful change has taken place in two\n hundred years ! The spot where Bos-\n ton stands was then a wilderness. The\n hills and the islands were covered with\n trees, and the Indians were living all\n around. Now the Indians are all gone,\n and there are sixty thousand white peo-\n ple living in this place; in the towns\n around it, there are at least as many\n more.\n</p>\n<p>\n the picture. \\Vl > en did the settlement of Boston\n take place ' t 4 . Why did some English people\n come to live in America 1 6. What of woives 1\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. The forests have all been cut\n down, the hills have been levelled, the\n valleys have been filled up; houses,\n churches, and other public edifices now\n stand on the very places which were\n then occupied by Indian wigwams. The\n Bay, where then you could see only a\n few Indian canoes, is now covei^d with\n hundreds of vessels, and in the streets\n you hear the noise of a thousand wheels,\n where then were heard only the cries of\n wild beasts and savage men.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. Such are the mighty changes\n that have taken place in this country,\n since it was settled by the white people\n It is very interesting to look arounu,\n and see the present condition of towns,\n cities, and countries. But I think it is\n still more interesting to go back, and\n study the history of places, and see\n what has happened there in times that\n have now gone by.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. The first settlement inNew Eng-\n land, was made at Plymouth in 1620.\n The settlers were English people, call-\n ed Puritans. Within ten years after, Sa-\n lem, Dorchester, Charlestown and Bos-\n ton were settled. A great many people\n came over from England, and thus the\n colony grew very rapidly.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. They had a great many difficul-\n ties to encounter. Before they could\n raise grain to make bread of, they were\n obliged to cut down trees, and till the\n land. They had also to build houses,\n to make roads, and defend themselves\n against the Indians. Their condition\n was indeed a very hard one, and some\n of the people who came over, died from\n want and fatigue, as I have said before.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12.

Having examined Norwich, we\n will take a boat, and go down the river\n Thames, to New London. At this place,\n we shall see a steam-boat that goes to\n New York, and we shall also observe a\n good many other vessels. Among the\n vessels, we shall see a large ship htting\n out to go to the Pacific Ocean to catch\n whales.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. We shall perhaps see another\n ' vessel, that has just come back from\n \u25a0 a whaling voyage, after an absence of\n</p>\n<p>\n three years.

Near New London, we shall see\n two forts; one of them is called Fort\n Trumbull, and the other. Fort Griswold.\n The latter is situated in Groton, just\n across the river Thames.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. I will tell you an odd story of\n what happened in Groton, near twenty\n years ago. There was war then, be-\n tween our country and Great Britain.\n There were several British ships in\n sight, and it was expected they would\n soon make an attack upon the forts. A\n company of soldiers from Hartford oc-\n cupied a house in Groton, as their bar-\n racks.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. One night as they were asleep,\n there was a sudden cry of alarm among ;\n the soldiers. They seized their arms, 1\n and rushed out of the barracks. The .\n drums were beat, the sentinel fired his\n gun, and all supposed that the British ;\n</p>\n<p>\n riians 1 7. New London ' ?

Some of the men declared they\n could see the enemy landing, and others\n thought they could hear the roar of can-\n non in the distance.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. The officers assembled, and in-\n quired into the matter. They soon dis-\n covered, that the British had nothing to\n do with the alarm. It seems that one\n of the soldiers, whose name was Tom\n Stire, while he was sleeping with the\n rest, fell into a dream. He dreamed\n that the British were coming, and in\n his sleep he exclaimed, \u2018Alarm! alarm!\n the enemy are coming ! \u2019 This occasion-\n ed the whole disturbance.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. After we have examined New\n ! London, we will set out and go to Hart-\n ford. This is a very fine town, situa-\n ted on Connecticut river. We must\n visit the Deaf and Dumb Asylum, where\n we shall see about one hundred deaf\n and dumb pupils, who are taught to read\n and write, and who can converse by\n signs, almost as well as we can by talk-\n ing. We shall also see at Hartford, a\n place for persons who are insane, call-\n ed the Retreat. Here they are taken\n care of, and many of them are cured.\n Before we leave town, we must go to\n Washington College, which is a fine in-\n stitution.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. After leaving Hartford, we will\n go to Middletown, which is beautifully\n situated on Connecticut river. On our\n way from Hartford, we shall pass through\n Wethersfield, a pleasant place, where\n the people raise many thousand bushels\n of onions, every year.

He now grew very anxious, for\n the night was approaching. He hal-\n looed and shouted for help, but no one\n came. At length it was night, and the\n forest all around was covered with\n darkness. The wanderer listened, but\n he could hear no human voice ; he\n could hear only the howling of wild\n beasts.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. He climbed a tree, and there he\n remained in great anxiety till morning.\n Worn out with watching and fatigue,\n and faint for want of food, Mr Chester\n still made exertions to escape. He as-\n cended to the top of a hill, and there\n he obtained a sight of the country all\n around.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. But it was one boundless forest\n on all sides.

Not many years since, salmon were\n often to be taken as far up as Vermont.\n They even used to ascend the little\n streams that come down from the moun-\n tains, and were often caught in them.\n An old gentleman told me, that about\n thirtyfive years ago he was travelling at\n night on horseback, among the moun-\n tains in that State.

A little more than two hundred\n years ago, there were in England, a\n great many people, called Puritans.\n They were not happy in England, for\n they had peculiar notions about reli-\n gion. They were cruelly treated, and\n some of them at length fled from the\n country. They went first to Holland,\n but finally they concluded to come to\n America.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. They set out in two vessels, but\n one of them was leaky, and went back.\n They all entered the other ship, and af-\n ter a long and stormy passage, they\n reached a broiad harbor. They then\n sent some people ashore to examine\n the country. These found some Indian j\n corn in baskets, buped in the sand.\n They also discovered Indian burial-\n })laces, surrounded by sticks stuck in\n the ground.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. One night, the exploring party\n built a fire in the woods, and slept by\n the side of it. In the morning, some\n arrovrs, pointed with eagles\u2019 claws and\n sharp pieces of deer\u2019s horns, fell among\n them. These were sent by some In- '\n</p>\n<p>\n I Wliat of the Britons t 2.

The\n white men fired their guns at them,\n and the Indians ran oft\u2019 in great alarm.\n At this time the savages had no gims,\n</p>\n<p>\n I and they imagined that the fire of the\n musket was lightning, and the report\n thunder. No wonder they were afraid\n of people, who, as they believed, made\n use of thunder and lightning.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Having examined the shores, the\n emigrants pitched upon a place, where\n they concluded to settle. On the 22d\n of Dec. 1620, they landed and called tho\n place Plymouth. It v/as winter when\n they arrived, and the country had a most\n dreary aspect. There were no houses\n to receive them, there were no friends\n to welcome them; there was nothing\n before them but a gloomy forest, inhab-\n ited by savages and wild beasts. There\n was nothing behind them but the vast\n ocean, rolling between them and their\n native land. This little colony consist-\n ed of one hundred and one persons.\n They were divided into nineteen families,\n and each family built itself a log house.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. For some time, the settlers were\n not visited by any of the Indians. They\n saw a few soon after their landing, but\n they ran away as if they were very\n much frightened. One day, however,\n</p>\n<p>\n i an Indian came among them, saying in '\n English, \u2018Welcome Englishmen! \\1rTl-\n come Englishmen !\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. This surprised the white people\n very much.

The winter\n was very severe, their houses were mis-\n erable, and they were destitute of all\n those conveniencies, which they had\n been accustomed to enjoy in England.\n Borne down with suflering, many of\n them were taken sick, and when the\n spring arrived, half of their number\n were dead.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. Notwithstanding these discour-\n aging circumstances, other persons\n came out from England and joined the\n settlers, so that, in ten years after, the\n whole number amounted to three hun-\n dred. In the year 1630, more than fif-\n teen hundred persons came from Eng-\n land, and settled at Boston, Dorchester,\n Salem, and other places in the vicinity.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. These people were nearly all\n Puritans, but many of them possessed\n wealth, and had been brought up in a\n very delicate manner. Their sole ob\n ject in coming to America, was to en-\n joy their religious opinions without re-\n straint. But they had not foreseen the\n sufierings that were before them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. The winter set in with unusual\n severity. The snow fell to a great\n depth, and the cold became intense.\n Assembled in log houses, which aflbrded\n but a poor shelter from the driving\n blasts, the emigrants had to endure hun-\n ger as well as cold. Their stock of\n provisions became nearly exhausted,\n and many of them were compelled to\n subsist on clams, muscles, nuts and\n acorns.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15.

The settlement at\n Plymouth was tlie first permanent Eng-\n lish settlement in New England. The\n colony of Massachusetts was so named,\n from an Indian tribe that originally in-\n habited the country. This colony in-\n creased much more rapidly than Ply-\n mouth.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2.

He was but twenty-\n five years old when he arrived, but he\n was so grave that he won the hearts of\n the people, and they made him governor.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. You will recollect it was in the\n year 1633, that the first settlement was\n made in Connecticut. In 1636, Roger\n Williams was banished, and settled in\n Rhode Island. New Hampshire was\n first settled in 1623, and Maine in 1628.\n In 1638, a settlement was made at '\n New Haven, which was afterwards call-\n ed, the Colony of New Haven. Ver-\n mont was not settled till 1724.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. About the year 1635, a woman\n whose name was Ann Hutchinson, be-\n gan to preach strange doctrines in Mas-\n sachusetts. She had a pleasing address. '\n and fluent speech, and she persuaded\n many persons to believe as she did.\n Among these was Sir Henry Vane.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. By and by, some of the principal\n people assembled to consider the sub-\n ject. They talked a great deal about\n it, and some of them became very angry.\n At length Ann Hutchinson\u2019s doctrines\n were condemned by a majority, and she\n was banished from the colony. Sir\n Henry Vane was very much displeased\n at this ; so he went back to England, and\n after several years, he was executed, by ]\n having his head cut off for high treason\n against his king and country.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6.

In !\n 1637, they killed three men at Saybrook,\n and at Wethersfield they killed six men,\n three women, and twenty cows.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. These things caused great alarm.\n Consequently, some of the people met\n at Hartford to consider what should be\n done. It was determined to send a\n body of men against them. About\n ninety white men and seventy friendly\n Indians were\u2019 soon assembled. They\n were all placed under the command of\n Captain Mason.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. They entered some boats at Hart-\n ford, and went down Connecticut river\n to Saybrook. Here they resolved to\n make a sudden attack upon Mystic, an\n Indian fort, situated where Stonington\n now stands. This was one of the prin-\n cipal places belonging to the Indians.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. They reached the spot about day-\n break. The Pequots had no suspicion\n that an enemy was near. But by and\n by, a dog barked, and then one of the\n Indians, who saw the white men, gave\n the alarm. At this instant, the soldiers\n fired upon the Indians. Many of the\n savages were killed ; but very soon the\n rest recovered from their astonishment,\n and then they fought bravely.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. They shot their arrows and\n guns at the white men, and hurled\n stones and sticks at them with the great-\n est fury.

This was\n followed by a treaty with the remaining\n Indians, and the Pequots gave the col-\n onies no more trouble.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. In 1643, the four colonies of\n Plymouth, Massachusetts, Connecticut\n and New Haven, entered into an agree-\n ment, for the purposes of mutual de-\n fence.

Accordingly, he visited, in secret,\n several of the tribes in New England.\n He conversed with the chiefs, and told\n them, that if they remained inactive, in\n a few years the beautiful rivers, and\n hills, and forests, which had descended\n from their fathers, Avould cease to be\n their inheritance. He described the\n English as crafty, long-sighted, and\n greedy, who added township to tOAcn-\n ship, and colony to colony, and who\n would never be content until they pos-\n sessed every foot of land west of the\n Hudson.\n</p>\n<p>\n What liad the Indians discovered 1 What inc-reas-\n ed the hatred of the Indians I 4.

They were\n at length obliged to retreat; but by and\n by, some Connecticut troops entered\n the fort on the opposite side, and at\n tlie same moment the attack was vigo-\n rously renewed at the entrance.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11.

The king of England\n</p>\n<p>\n < \u25a0 daimed these colonies as his OAvn, and he,\n Avith the parliament, made certain law^s\n respecting trade and commerce Avith\n ^ America.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Noav it Avas pretended that the\n colonies had violated these laws, and\n therefore the king determined to take\n away their charters. These charters\n Avere of great importance, for they gave\n the colonies many ])rivileges. I ' lie\n king, Avho reigned in England at the\n time, Avas .James II. He sent Sir Ed-\n</p>\n<p>\n mund Andros over to this country, to\n take aAvay all the charters of the Ncav\n England colonies, except Plymouth.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. He also appointed Sir Edmund\n governor over all the colonies, whoso\n charters he thus proposed to take aAvay.\n Accordingly he came. I have told you\n hoAV the charter of Connecticut Avas hid\n in an oak tree ; but Sir Edmund assumed\n the government of the NeAv England\n colonies, although he could not find that\n charter.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. At first he governed the people\n pretty Avell ; but by and by, he did many\n things, Avhich displeased them very\n much. Many unjust and oppressive\n laAvs Avere passed, and the people saAV\n that Sir Edmund had no\\egard to their\n happiness and prosperity in his admin-\n istration.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Sir Edmund began to rule in 1680.\n Tavo years after, the neAvs arrived that\n James II., King of England, had become\n so unpopular as to be obliged to leave\n the country, and that a new king, Wil-\n liam HI., had taken his place on the\n throne. This news gave the colonies\n great joy, for they hated James H. on\n account of his conduct tOAvard them, and\n more especially on account of the goA^-\n ernor. Sir Edmund Andros, Avhom he\n had sent to rule over them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6.

This aflair\n excited great attention, many people\n came to see the children, and they were\n very much pitied.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. By and by other children imagin-\n ed that they were affected in a similar\n manner, and they said that they were\n secretly tormented by an old woman in\n the neighborhood. All these things\n were believed, and more children and\n several women soon declared themselves\n bewitched. They charged several per-\n sons with being the authors of their\n distress.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10.

Strange as it may seem, this\n matter, instead of being regarded as a\n delusion, was thought to be founded in\n reality. The people in those days be-\n</p>\n<p>\n Salem in the yciir 1692 1 8. What did the people\n</p>\n<p>\n Biijiposed to he bewitched pretencll 11. What\n did the people believe in those days 1 12.

The business they were supposed\n to carry on with him, was called witch-\n craft, and any person under their\n influence was said to be bewitched. In\n England, parliament had thought it\n necessary to make severe laws against\n witchcraft. Several persons there had\n been condemned and executed under\n those laws. It was now thought proper\n to proceed in a similar manner at Salem\n Accordingly, those persons accused of\n practising witchcraft upon their neigh-\n bors, were put in prison, and a court\n was formed to try them.\n</p>\n<p>\n * 13. Many of them were examined\n and found guilty, and some, under the\n influence of a distempered imagination,\n confessed that they Avere guilty. The\n business at length reached a very alarm-\n ing height. Nineteen persons had\n been executed ; one hundred and fifty\n were in prison ; and many more were\n accused.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. In this state of things, the peo-\n ple began to doubt the correctness of\n their proceedings.

The history of these things is\n too painful for my little readers; I will\n therefore only tell them one story of\n this cruel war.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. In tlie winter of 1696, a party of\n Indians made an attack on the town\n of Haverhill, Massachusetts. Among\n the people of that town, was a Mr\n \u2022Dunstan. He was in a field at work,\n when the news of tlie attack reached\n his ears. Lie immediately started, and\n ran to his house, to save his family\n He had seven children, and these, he\n collected for the purpose of taking them\n to a place of safety before the Indians\n should arrive.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. His wife was sick, and she had\n an infant but a week old. He now\n hurried to her, but before she could get\n ready to leave the house, Mr Dunstan\n perceived that a party of the savages\n were already close to his dwelling. Ex-\n pecting that all would be slain, he ran\n to the door and mounted his horse, with\n the intention of taking one of his chil-\n dren, the one he loved best, and flying\n with that to a place of safety.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. But which should he take, which\n of his seven children should he leave to\n the savages? He could not decide, and\n therefore telling the children to run for-\n ward, he placed himself between them\n and the Indians. The savages discharg-\n ed their guns at him, but they did not\n hit him. He had a gun, too, and he\n fired back at them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Then he hurried his little chil-\n dren along, loaded his gun as he went,\n and fired at his pursuers. Thus ha\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. What of Englanri and France ?

They went in twelve ships, and\n some smaller vessels.\n</p>\n<p>\n G. They arrived at Louisburg the\n last of April, 1744.

They loved the\n services of religion, and it was one of\n their greatest enjoyments to meet to-\n gether and v/orship in their own way.\n They spent much time in praying to\n God in secret. They read the scrip-\n tures with a deep and careful interest,\n and they held it to be the great busi-\n ness of this life, to make preparation\n for another.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Such were the views and feelings\n of the Puritans. In England, they\n were miserable, for they could not in-\n dulge their religious feelings, and ex-\n press their religious opinions in peace.\n They were ridiculed, despised, and per-\n secuted. To them, therefore, the wil-\n derness of America, was a better place\n than England; for there, in the woods,\n they could assemble together, and wor-\n ship God in their peculiar manner,\n without reproach and without opposi-\n tion.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.

After this, Mr Clark, a Baptist\n clergyman of Rhode Island, came into\n Massachusetts with two other Baptists,\n named Holmes and Cranfield. One\n sabbath morning, as they had assem-\n bled for worship, they were seized by\n the public officers, and forcibly carried\n to the Congregational church, where\n they were kept during the service.\n Mr Clark refused to take off his hat ; so\n he sat with it on, and when the minis-\n ter began to pray, he took a book out\n of his pocket and amused himself with\n reading. When the service was done,\n he addressed the people and explained\n his conduct.\n</p>\n<p>\n did they propose! 6. What took place some\n time alter the colonies were settled 1 7.

A short time after this, eight\n other Quakers came to Boston, who\n were immediately put in prison, where\n they were kept eleven weeks. Very\n severe laws were then passed, banish-\n ing all Quakers from the colony upon\n pain of death. But the greater the cru-\n elty with which they were treated, the\n more they flocked to the colonies.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

The idea, now so\n common, and now so clear to us all,\n that every person has a right to worship\n God in his own way, had not then en-\n tered into the minds of men. Our fore-\n fathers were not alone in their narrow\n views; all over the wide world, mankind\n were in darkness on this subject.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. The shadow has indeed passed\n away from our own country. Here,\n every man may freely choose in what\n manner he will hold communion with\n his God. But in many parts of the\n world, even now, there are persons,\n who suffer much on account of their\n faith. There are, I think, even in our\n own land, at this very day, those who\n are spoken of unkindly and uncharita-\n bly, because of their religion.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Let us not, therefore, think too\n harshly of the New England Fathers,\n for their narrow-mindedness on this\n point. Let us look rather to their vir-\n tues; their patience under misfortune\n their steady endurance of cold, hungei,\n want, and privation; their deep and\n fervent piety; their strict observance\n of what they deemed right; and their\n stern rejection o\u2018f whatever they thought\n wrong.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8.

To give you a more lively idea\n of the character of our New England\n ancestors, I will sketch a picture of\n what might have been seen, in any of\n the New England villages, in the earli-\n er part of their history.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. We will suppose it to be the\n morning of the sabbath. Surrounded\n by a few houses, some of them built\n of logs and some of boards, is a small\n \u2018brown building, without a steeple ; this\n is the meeting-house. At the appoint-\n ed hour, the worshippers are seen\n gathering to the church from various\n quarters.\n</p>\n<p>\n A New England Church in early Times.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. But each man carries a gun,\n and over his shoulder he has the trap-\n pings of a soldier. The guns are all\n placed together near the meeting-house\n door, and one man is stationed there to\n</p>\n<p>\n tlieir self-denial t 11. What spectacle might ha\\e\n =es!n or. a sabbath morning in a New England\n</p>\n<p>\n give the alarm, if the Indians are seen\n to be approaching the spot. Thus pres\n pared to fly to the defence of their\n houses and their families, they enter the\n house of God, and there they worship.\n How powerful must have been the mo-\n tive, which drove our fathers from Eng-\n land, into the wilderness, to live a life\n like this !\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. I will sketch another picture.\n We M ' ill suppose it to be a week day;\n a day of labor. You see a man going\n with his scythe into tlie field; but he is\n armed with a musl < (\u2018t. Y^ou see a man\n ploughing, and anotlier hoeing his corn;\n they have each muskets lashed to their\n backs.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. You see a man on horseback,\n going from one village to another; he\n too is armed. You see a man reniov-\n ing with his family to some distant set-\n tlement ; he is provided with the means\n of instant defence.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15. Thus lived our New England\n Fathers, for more than one generalion.\n They were in a state of constant prepa-\n ration for attack ; ahvays siipjiosing\n that the next instant, an Indian arrow,\n or an Indian bullet, might be in the air,\n speeding with a deadly aim to the\n heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n 16. Nor was this all. The woods\n were full of wdld animals. At night,\n the wolves would come about the houses\n and barns, and often carry ofi\u2019 a sheep\n or a lamb. If a traveller on foot linger-\n ed in the forest till sunset, he heard the\n howl of these hungry beasts upon his\n track ; or perchance a bear crossed his\n path, turning back ^vith a wistful look ;\n or a panther glared on him from the\n top of some aged oak, or the lonely cry\n of , the wild cat filled his ears.\n</p>\n<p>\n village ? 13.

There was but one boat on the\n river for a long time. But now there\n are a great many.

Soon after leaving the Catskill\n Mountains, we shall reach Albany.\n This we shall find to be a large city,\n with near twenty thousand inhabit-\n ants. Here we will enter a canal-boat\n and proceed to Utica. We shall go at\n the rate of about four miles an hour,\n and we shall find the boat filled with\n men, women, and children.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. On arriving at Utica, we shall\n be surprised to find it so large and so\n handsome a place. We must now go\n in a carriage about twelve miles north\n of Utica, and see Trenton Falls. A small\n river here tumbles over the rocks, and\n presents several exceedingly beautiful\n cascades.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. A very sad accident happened\n here, a few years ago. A young lady\n from New York, came with some of\n her friends, to see the cataract. She\n was standing on the edge of one of the\n highest rocks, and her friends were at a\n little distance. Suddenly she disap-\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 . Albany 1 Canal-boat 1 2. Utica 1 Tren-\n</p>\n<p>\n peared from their view. They ran to\n the spot, and looked over the precipice.\n She had fallen to a great depth below,\n and was instantly killed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. From Utica I think we had better\n travel in the stage, for by this time we\n shall be tired of canal-boats. We must\n be particular, however, to stop and see\n the Indians at Vernon, about seventeen\n miles west of Utica. There are near\n one thousand of them, and they are the\n remnants of two famous tribes, that\n once inhabited this part of the State.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. These Indians are called Oneidas\n and Tuscaroras; they are partly civiliz-\n ed, for they till the land, go to meeting,\n and live peaceably. They are, however,\n a degraded people, and will rather ex-\n cite your pity than your respect. We\n shall perhaps on our way meet with\n other Indians ; the poor remains of tlie\n celebrated tribes, which I shall have\n occasion to mention by and by, under\n the name of the Five Nations.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. After leaving the Indians, we\n shall pass through Auburn, Canandaigua,\n and Buffalo, and at length arrive at\n Niagara Falls. These are formed by\n an immense mass of water, which comes\n from the great lakes, and pours over\n the rocks to the depth of 150 feet.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The roar of these ' waters is like\n thunder. Sometimes it is heard at the\n distance of thirty miles. The earth\n trembles around, as if in fear of the aw-\n ful scene, and a thick cloud of vapor\n rises high into the air, stretching itself\n far away over the hills and valleys.\n</p>\n<p>\n , 8. A few years ago, some people\n got a large ship, and placed in it a wiid\n bear and some other animals. They\n then brought it near, the Fails, and left\n it in the swift current.

The sliip was instantly drawn\n along by the tide toward the falls; it\n came to the edge of the rocks,, and\n down, down it went, broken in a thou-\n sand pieces. The poor bear went over\n with it. For a long time, he was buried\n in the water, but at length he rose upon\n the surface, and then he sprang ashore.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. I will tell you another story of\n these falls. There was once an Indian\n sleeping in his canoe, on the lake. He\n was not far from the falls, but the canoe\n was tied, and he felt safe. But by and\n by, the string was loosed by some acci-\n dent, and the canoe floated out upon\n the water.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. It went silently along, and the\n Indian still continued to sleep. Soon\n the current began to take the boat to-\n ward the falls. It went more and\n more rapidly, and soon was near the\n cataract. At this moment the Indian\n woke; he saw his situation, and knew\n that it Avas vain to struggle against his\n fate. He therefore seated himself erect,\n wrapped his blanket closer round his\n body, and, folding his arms, went down\n with the thundering tide.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. After staying awhile at the falls\n we must set out to return. We may\n go back to Albany by the canal, or by\n stage, or we may cross Lake Ontario, I\n and go to Montreal, and thence by way\n of Lake Champlain to Boston. By the\n time we get home we shall be satisfied\n that the State of New York abounds in\n interesting objects. The western part\n of the State will fill us with surprise.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. It now presents many large\n towns, and a multitude of thriving villa-\n ges; yet it has been wholly settled with-\n in the last thirty years. Twenty years\n ago, there was not a house in Rochester,\n</p>\n<p>\n and now there are thirteen thousana\n people there. Thirty years ago, Utica\n had scarcely fifty houses, and now it\n has, I believe, ten thousand inhabitants.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. The growth in this part of the\n i Stat e, seems indeed quite magical. I\n ! recollect a story of what happened near\n I Rochester within the last fifteen years.\n</p>\n<p>\n I Two persons were travelling on horse-\n back through the woods in winter, guid-\n ed only by a horse path. The snow\n had recently fallen to a great depth, and\n they at length lost their way. They un-\n dertook to retrace their steps, but night\n came on, while they w ' ere still in the\n midst of the forest.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. They knew they were a consid\n erable distance from any settlement,\n and had no hope of reaching a house\n during the night. It therefore became\n</p>\n<p>\n I apparent that they must spend it in the\n I woods. But as the sun went down, the\n</p>\n<p>\n I cold increased, and in a short time, it\n ; was exceedingly severe.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15. The horses were worn out with\n fatigue, and the travellers began to, fear\n that they should be frozen. They look-\n ed about for the shelter of a rock, or\n some other place, but nothing of the\n kind presented itself. Their situation\n</p>\n<p>\n j was now alarming; they could not pro-\n</p>\n<p>\n II ceed, and to remain idle, was certain\n I death.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 16. Atlenglh, one of them recollect-\n</p>\n<p>\n I ed that he had a small tinder-box in his\n I pocket. This he took out, and the\n I travellers set about making preparations\n to build a fire with great alacrity. They\n got together the bark of some trees,\n and some dry branches; they then be-\n gan to prepare the tinder-box, but on\n ! examining it, the tinder was entirely\n gone.\n</p>\n<p>\n I 17.

CONTINUED.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 . I think you cannot fail to admire |\n the great Erie Canal, in the State of j\n New York. It is 362 miles in length;,\n it is 40 feet wide, and has 83 locks. It!\n is one of the longest canals in the world, I\n and it is certainly one of the most use-j\n ful. It is frozen up in winter, but dur- j\n ing the spring, summer, and autumn, i\n many hundreds of boats, loaded with |\n every kind of produce, and all sorts ofi\n goods, are passing to and fro upon it.

Cost 1\n</p>\n<p>\n 4 *\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. This canal was begun in 1817,\n and finished in 1825. It was made by\n the people of New York. A great many\n men were occupied for eight years, in\n digging the earth, in cutting through\n the rocks, and in building walls and\n dams for the locks. The whole cost\n of the canal was 8,000,000 of dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. I will now tell you the early his-\n tory of this great State. In the year\n 1609, Henry Hudson, an English navi-\n gator, was employed by some Dutch\n people to go on a voyage of discovery.\n He came to America, and discovered\n the river, which now bears his name.\n He sailed up as far as Albany, and\n went in his boat a little further.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. He saw along the banks of the\n river then, nothing but trees, and In-\n dians, and wild .animals. What a change\n has taken place in a little more than\n two hundred years ! The island at the\n mouth of the river, which was then\n covered only with trees and shrubs, is\n now the seat of a mighty city ; and the\n banks of the Hudson, then so solitary,\n are now sprinkled over with towns,\n cities, villages, and country-seats.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Five ' years after Hudson\u2019s dis-\n covery, some Dutch people came to Al-\n bany, and began there a settlement.\n This was in the year 1614, six years\n before the Pilgrims arrived at Plymouth.\n It was the first settlement made in New\n York. About the same time they built\n a few houses, on an island called by\n tlie Indians Manhattan, where the city\n of New York now stands.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6.

He\n had been a soldier in Europe, and knew\n well how to conduct the business of\n war. He took with him one hundred\n and fifty men, and they had a great\n many battles with the Indians. The\n latter were defeated, and four hundred\n of them were killed during the war\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. In 1646, a severe battle was\n fought with the Indians, near Horse-\n neck. Great numbers were killed on\n both sides, but the Dutch wei ' e victori-\n ous The dead bodies were buried at\n a place called Strickland\u2019s Plain, and\n 100 years afterwards the graves were\n still to be seen.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. There were some disputes be-\n tween the people of New England and\n those of New York about territory.\n At length the Dutch governor went to\n Hartford, where he met some people\n sent by the New England colonies, and\n they came to an agreement about the\n land. But king Charles of England\n said that the Dutch had no right to any\n of the land, and so he granted what the\n Dutch had settled upon, to his brother\n the duke of York and Albany.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. In 1664, the duke came with\n three ships to New York, and command-\n ed the people to surrender the town.\n They refused at first, but in a little\n while they gave it up, and he took pos-\n session of it.

XXV.\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW YORK. CONTINUED\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. I will now tell you about the In-\n dians in the northern part of New York.\n The interior of the country was origi-\n nally inhabited by five nations, call-\n ed* the Senecas, Cayugas, Onondagas,\n Oneydas, and Mohaivks. These na-\n tions were friendly to the English colo-\n nies, and being very powerful, they\n protected the inhabitants from the\n French settlements in Canada.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. At length the French governor,\n De La Barre, being afraid of these In-\n dian tribes, raised an army of seventeen\n hundred men, and Avent against them.\n But his troops suffered A^ery much from\n hardship and sickness, and many of\n them died.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Being surrounded by his enemies,\n he Avas noAV obliged to ask peace of the\n saA ' ages, Avhom he had come to destroy.\n He sent to the chiefs of the Five Nations,\n requesting them to come and see him,\n and three of them came. A circle Avas\n formed, consisting of the French offi-\n cers and chiefs, and then De La Barre\n addressed the chief of the Onondagas as\n folloAVs: \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. \u2018 Chief, listen to AAffiat I have to\n say. I am sent to this country by a\n great king, Avffio commands many armies.\n He is good to his friends, but he is ter-\n rible to his enemies. What are ye, his\n friends or his enemies? I tell you that\n ye are his enemies.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018You protect the English, and you\n fight for them. You have made a\n league with them for peace and AA^ar.\n Y ' ou have led them into the country,\n and shoAvn them the trading-grounds\n</p>\n<p>\n of the French, and noAV they carry\n aAvay the furs Avhich the French ought\n to get.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. \u2018 Such is your conduct, and that\n of the Five Nations; and what shall the\n king my master do to you for these\n things? He can send an army into this\n land, that shall scatter your tribes, as\n the dry leaves of autumn arc scattered\n by the Avhirlwind ; and this he Avill do,\n unless you change your conduct, and\n instead of enemies become his friends.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Garrangula, the Onondaga chief,\n kncAv perfectly Avell the distress of the\n French army. He therefore heard this\n haughty speech Avith contempt. After\n Avalking six times around the circle, he\n made the folloAving reply, in Avhich you\n Avill perceive he calls De La Barre\n Yonnondio, and the English governor\n Corlear.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. \u2018 Yonnondio, I honor you, and the\n Avarriors that are Avith me honor you.\n Your interpreter has finished your\n speech ; I now begin mine. My Avords\n</p>\n<p>\n i|jnake haste to reach your ears ; hearken\n to them. Yonnondio, you must have\n believed, Avhen you left Quebec, that\n the sun had consumed all the forests\n Avhich render our country inaccessible\n to the French; or that the great lakes\n had overfloAvn their banks and surround-\n ed our castles, so that it Avas impossible\n for us to get out of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. \u2018Yes, Yonnondio, you must haA^e\n dreamed so ; and the curiosity of so\n</p>\n<p>\n ! great a Avonder has brought you so far.\n Noav you are undeceived ; for I, and the\n I AA ' arriors here present, are come to as-\n j sure you that the Senecas, Cayugas,\n I Onondagas, Oneydas, and MohaAvks,\n are yet alive.\n</p>\n<p>\n I 9. \u2018 I thank you, in their name, for\n</p>\n<p>\n 1.

Not long after anoth-\n er French governor went against these\n Indians with a still larger army than\n that of De La Barre. But the cunning\n Indians concealed themselves till the\n French were near, and then suddenly\n fell upon his army, and obliged him to\n retreat out of their country.

A great many fires had taken\n place, and these led the people to be-\n lieve that the rumor \" was true. \u2019 Many\n of the negroes were arrested and put in\n prison.

It is not a large State, but in\n travelling through it we shall see many\n things that are interesting. We must\n start at New York in a steam-boat and\n cross the North River to Jersey city.\n This is done in a few minutes. Then\n we get into the stage, and ride nine\n miles, over a very level road to Newark.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. This is a beautiful town, with se-\n veral handsome churches, and many\n handsome houses. We shall see many\n of the people busy in making shoes,\n gigs, coaches, stages and wagons.\n</p>\n<p>\n - Newark is the largest town in the State.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. We must not omit to make an ex-\n cursion from Newark to Patterson, to\n</p>\n<p>\n ' ' see the Passaic Falls. These are form-\n ed by the Passaic River, which rolls\n over the rocks to the depth of 72 feet.\n The spectacle is very brilliant and\n beautiful.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Some years ago, a gentleman and\n his v.nfe from New York were stand-\n ing on tlie rock, which hangs over the\n cataract. The lady suddenly became\n dizzy, and fell over the awful precipice.\n She was instantly killed by the fall.\n Patterson is a brisk manufacturing town,\n situateil near the cataract.\n</p>\n<p>\n t5.

We shall pass through Bruns-\n wick, and at length reach Princeton.\n Here we shall observe a large building,\n with a green lawn in front, covered with\n shady trees. This is Princeton College;\n it is quite celebrated, and a great many\n young men are educated here.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. After leaving Princeton, we shall\n soon arrive at Trenton, which is beau-\n tifully situated on the Delaware. We\n shall here notice a fine bridge across\n this river. I think we had better take\n the steam-boat now, and go down the\n Delaware to Philadelphia.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. We shall be delighted with this\n part of our journey. On both sides of\n the river, we shall see many very hand-\n some towns. Those on the west side\n belong to Pennsylvania, those on the\n east, to New Jersey. Among other in-\n teresting things, we shall see Joseph\n Bonaparte\u2019s house, at Bordentown.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. Joseph-Bonaparte is a brother\n of the famous Napoleon Bonaparte.\n His house is large, and quite different\n from other houses in this country.

We shall find many interesting\n objects in the city. The Bank of the\n United States is built of white marble,\n and is one of the most beautiful edifices\n in the world. The Arcade is a very\n curious building, in which there are a\n great many shops. In the upper part\n of this building is Peale\u2019s Museum.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. This is a most interesting collec-\n tion. There are hundreds of stuffed\n birds and animals, which look as if they\n Vvere really alive. There are grisly\n bears, and deer, and elks, and prodi-\n gious great serpents, and birds with\n beautiful feathers, and cranes, with legs\n as long as a man ; and there are bugs\n and butterflies, and Indian, tomahawks,\n and a multitude of other things.\n</p>\n<p>\n Questions on the Map . \u2014 Bouiulaiies 1 De-\n soribc the Delaware, Susquehanna, Schuylkill, Ju-\n niata, Lehi^i, Ohio, Alleghany.

In\n the fall of the same year, a good many\n persons, chiefly Quakers, to whom he\n had sold some of the land, set out in\n three ships, and came to America.\n These people settled on the Delaware\n river, near where Philadelphia now\n stands.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

In the Revolutionary War, the\n people of this little State put forth\n their Avhole strength for the cause of\n liberty. The Delaware regiment was\n reckoned the finest in the whole army.\n In the famous battle of Camden, in\n South Carolina, 17S0, these, wdth some\n Maryland troops, were commanded by\n a French otiicer, named De Kalb. \u2014\n This brave man was wounded in eleven\n places, and died on the field.

But it is not my intention to tell\n you of the Revolutionary War now. I\n must take you back to a much earlier\n date. More than two hundred years\n ago, there lived in Sweden, a famous\n king named Gustavus Adolphus. Un-\n der his patronage, some Swedes and\n Finns, or Finlanders, came to America, i\n and landed at Cape Henlopen, in 1G27.\n It was a, beautiful spot, covered with\n green trees, beneath which the wild\n deer with their young fawns were\n sporting. The emigrants were soj\n charmed with the place, that they called\n it Paradise Point.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.

The latter treated them\n kindly, and sold them the land on both\n sides of the wu ' .er.

But the colony was not permit-\n : ted to enjoy, its fine lands and delightful\n</p>\n<p>\n climate in peace. The Dutch claimed\n the territory, and after annoying them\n in various ways, finally built a fort at\n New Castle. A man by the name of\n Risingh, was then governor of the\n Swedish colony.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. One da}^ he proposed to the com-\n mander of the Dutch fort, to pay him a\n friendly visit. This was accepted, and\n Risingh went, accompanied by thirty\n men. They were received with kind-\n ness, and treated with great hospitality.\n But disregarding this, they treacherous-\n ly took possession of the fort, and made\n prisoners of the garrison.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. The governor of New York at\n this time, was Peter Stuyvesant, whom\n history describes as possessing a pretty\n hot temper. Such a man was not like-\n ly to permit the treachery of Risingh ,\n to go unavenged. So he fitted out an\n armament which v/ent against the\n Swedes in several vessels, in the year\n 1G55.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11.

But the most curious thing at\n Baltimore is the Rail-road. I must tell\n you that there is a great trade between\n Baltimore and the States west of the\n Alleghany Mountains. The western\n people buy a great many goods at Bal-\n timore, and send in return a great deal\n of western produce. There is, there-\n fore, a vast deal of travelling back and\n forth, and hundreds of teams are con-\n stantly occupied in transporting goods\n and produce to and from market.\n</p>\n<p>\n Rail-road Car.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8.

Two hundred years ago, the Cath-\n olics in England were persecuted bb\n the Puritans had been before. One of\n them. Lord Baltimore, determined there-\n fore to come to America. Accordingly\n he went to Virginia, which had now\n been settled some time. But he found\n the people there as little disposed to\n treat the Catholics kindly as in Eng-\n land. So he went back to EnglancL\n and begged the king to give him a\n charter of the land lying on Chesapeake\n Bay, then occupied only by the Indians.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. This request was granted, but\n before the business was completed, he\n died. His son Cecil, also called Lord\n Baltimore, determined to carry into\n effect the plans of his father. So he\n obtained the grant for himself, and in\n 1634, sent his brother, Leonard Calvert,\n with two hundred Catholic emigrants, to\n settle upon the land on the Chesapeake.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. When they arrived at the mouth\n of the Potomac river, they found an\n Indian village there, called Yoamaco.\n This village they purchased of the sa-\n vages, and thus obtained good shelter,\n till they could build better houses.\n They \u2019also acquired some good land,\n which had been cultivated.

The colony flourished, as well\n on account of its pleasant situation, as\n the liberal policy of its government.\n These Catholics did not persecute those\n who differed with them in religious\n opinion. Lord Baltimore, and Roger\n Williams, of Rhode Island, seem to\n have discovered about the same time,\n that every man has a right to worship\n God as he pleases. Thus Rhode Island\n and Maryland, at this early date, enjoy-\n ed the blessings of entire religious free-\n dom.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. Yet the colony, whose story I\n am now telling you, had its share of\n troubles. A man by the name of Clay-\n borne, stirred up the Indians to hostili-\n ty, and they made war on the settlers.\n This continued for several years, and\n the people suffered great distress. In\n 1645, the same Clayborne induced some\n of the settlers to rebel against their ru-\n lers, and Calvert the governor was obli-\n ged to fly to Virginia. But the next\n 5 ' ^ear, the revolt was suppressed. Gov-\n ernor Calvert returned, and the colony\n once more enjoyed a state of peace.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. In 1666, the colony contained\n about 12,000 inhabitants. In 1676,\n Lord Baltimore, the founder of the col-\n ony, died ; leaving behind him the en-\n viable character of a wise and good man.\n He was succeeded by his son Charles,\n as proprietor of the colony, and he dis-\n played the same amiable qualities as\n his father had done.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14.

These are\n classed together merely on account of\n their situation, and not because of any\n similarity either in the history, or the\n manners of the people. They were\n settled at difierent times by people from\n different countries, who came for differ-\n ent purposes ; \u2014 some for trade ; some to\n improve their fortunes ; and some for\n religious peace.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. There is no such reseiiblance be-\n tween the people of these five States,\n their manners, customs and opinions,\n as between the people of New England.\n On the contrary, we shall find great va-\n riety among the inhabitants, their houses,\n dress, manner of tilling the land, thoughts,\n feelings, and opinions, in different parts\n of this section of the Union.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

Instead\n of meadows, apple orchards, and small\n patches of rye, Indian corn, and flax,\n we shall see vast plains covered with\n crops of tobacco, wheat, and hemp.\n We shall see, that the whole labor of\n the field is performed on these planta-\n tions by the slaves. The planters them-\n selves have large houses, and live in\n excellent style.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

In the western part of the State,\n near the Ohio, is a remarkable mound\n of earth, filled with human bones. It\n is 70 feet high, and 300 feet across\n at the bottom.

This vast country, now oc-\n cupied by twentyfour States, and 12,-\n 000,000 of inhabitants, was then a wide\n hunting-ground for the Indians.

The Spaniards had penetrated\n into South America, and found countries\n abounding in silver and gold. Stories\n of their success were circulated through-\n out Europe, and the spirit of adventure\n entered into many minds. In England,\n a com])any W ' as formed for making a\n settlement in North America, and having\n Obtained a grant of land, they despatch-\n ed three ships with 105 adventurers, for\n the new world.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. After sailing across the Atlantic,\n a storm drove them to the mouth of\n Chesapeake Bay.

On the 13th of May, 1607, the\n emigrants landed and began their es-\n tablishment. It was on an island in\n the river.

The colony now began to en-\n</p>\n<p>\n . joy more favorable prospects. Lord\n</p>\n<p>\n Delaware, who was governor, restored\n order and contentment by his mild and\n gentle conduct, and the Indians were\n once more taught to respect and fear\n tlie English. In 1611, new settlers\n arrived, and other towns were founded ;\n and under a succession of wise govern-\n ^ ' s, Virginia became a flourishing and\n extensive colony.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. In 1612, Captain Argal wentxon\n a trading voyage up the Potomac, and\n heard that Poctihontas was in the\n neighborhood. He invited her to come\n on board his vessel, and she came. He\n then detained her, and carried her to\n Jamestown. He knew that Pov/hatan\n \u2018oved his daughter, and thought, while\n flic was ill the ])Ossession of the Eng-\n lish, that he v/ould be afraid to do them\n mischief.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

This was fol-\n lowed by peace between the colony and\n all the tribes subject to Powhatan.\n Soon after, Rolfe visited England with\n his bride. She was received by the\n king and queen, with the respect due\n to her virtues as a woman, and her rank\n as a princess. When she was about to\n return to America, she died, leaving one\n child, from Avhom some of the most re-\n spectable families in Virginia have\n descended.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. New settlers now frequently ar-\n rived, and the colony rapidly increased.\n In 1619, a Dutch vessel came to James-\n town, bringing twenty Africans, who\n were purchased by the people. These\n were the first slaves brought into our\n country, and thus the foundation was\n unhappily laid for that system of slave-\n ry, which now pervades the Southern\n States.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. In 1622, in the midst of appar-\n ent peace and prosperity, the colony\n was on the point of annihilation. Pow-\n hatan, the friend of the English, was\n dead. His successor, Opecancaiiough,\n vras a chief of great talent, but he se-\n crelly liatcd the English, and formed\n a sclieme for their destruction.

It is impossible in this little book\n to tell you everything in the history of\n Virginia that is interesting. Under a\n succession of governors, some good,\n and some bad, the colony was at one\n time in prosperity, at another in adver-\n sity. When Cromwell usurped the\n government of England in 1660, the\n Virginians remained true to the king,\n but were afterwards obliged to submit\n to Cromwell\u2019s authority. At the resto-\n ration of Charles the Second, in 1666,\n they were among the first to greet his\n return.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. In 1676, the colony experienced\n all the miseries of civil war.

Notwithstanding these troubles,\n Virginia continued to flourish, and in\n 16S8, contained 60,000 inhabitants.\n From that period, till about the year\n 1756, nothing occurred which I think\n would amuse you.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAP.

In travelling\n over the State, we shall observe that,\n like Virginia, it is divided into three\n parts ; the level, sandy region towards\n the sea, and occupying nearly one half\n of the State ; the hilly country in the\n middle ; and the mountainous districts,\n in the western portion.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. We shall remark that the labor\n of the field is performed by negro slaves.\n We shall see a great many plantations\n of tobacco, cotton, and rice. We shall\n meet with great forests of pine, in the\n eastern part of the State. Many of\n these trees are cut down by the people,\n made into boards, and sent to foreign\n markets. Great quantities of pitch and\n tar are also extracted from the pine\n trees, put into casks, and sent away.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

A great part of the\n tobacco, rice, and cotton, raised in this\n State, are sent to Charleston in South\n Carolina, and are thence distributed to\n all parts of the world. A great deal of\n the cotton is taken in large bags to\n New England, where it is worked up\n into cloth.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The tobacco is taken to various\n countries. Some of it is made into\n snuff, some into cigars, and some of it\n is chewed. If you should ever go to\n Europe, you will see a great many of\n the people constantly snuffing and puf-\n fing ; and you may be pretty sure that\n they are indebted to iNorth or South\n Carolina for the pleasure they take in\n these things.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. North Carolina was first settled\n about the year 1C50. The settlers of\n Virginia were not Puritans, but Church-\n men, or Episcopalians. They were,\n however, almost as intolerant as the\n New England fathers, and persecuted\n those who did not believe with them\n in matters of religion.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. Several persons distressed by\n these persecutions, left the colony, and\n proceeding to the north side of Albe-\n marle Sound, settled along the shore,\n about the time abovementioned. Here,\n in the w ilderness, they found peace and\n plenty. The soil was fertile, and the\n climate soft and gentle.

In 1663, the territory of North\n and South Carolina, was granted by\n the King of England, to Lord Claren-\n don, and others.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. To induce people to settle here,\n they gave public i^otice, that the inhab-\n itants should enjoy perfect religious\n freedom, and have an assembly of their\n own choosing, to make laws for them.\n Accordingly, a good many persons\n came, and Mr Drummond was made\n governor of the colony.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. In 1670, William Sayle made a\n settlement at a place then called Port\n Royal. The next year he removed to\n a neck of land betw ' een two rivers, call-\n ed Cooper and Ashley. The settle-\n ment he called Charleston, in honor of\n the King of England, Charles the Se-\n cond, then on the throne. This place\n grew very rapidly, and being at a great\n distance from Albemarle Sound, it had\n a distinct government to superintend\n its affairs. Hence arose the two names\n of North and South Carolina.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. In 1707, some French people,\n forced from their homes by persecution,\n settled on the ' river Trent, near Pamlico\n Sound. In 1710, some Germans, dri-\n ven by the same cause from their na-\n tive land, took refuge near the same\n spot.

Perhaps my reader is tired of\n travelling. I therefore propose that we\n go to South Carolina by water. We\n will enter a ship at New York, and in\n a few hours we shall be upon the broad\n sea. The hills will sink behind the\n blue waves, and we shall see nothing but\n the sky above, and the ocean around us.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. It is a delightful thing to sail up-\n on the water with a fresh breeze ; \u2014 but\n by and by the clouds grow dark, the\n wind howls through the rigging of the\n ship, and the waves are thrown into\n the most violent agitation. The vessel\n now leans down on one side towards\n the water, the timbers creak, the ropes\n rattle, the captain shouts aloud to tJie\n men, the waves strike the ship, and she\n staggers like a drunken man.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. At such a time one who has\n never been at sea before is likely to be\n frightened; but the \u00a7kilful captain\n and the fearless sailors watch every\n sail and rope and spar, every wave, and\n every breath of the gale, and the gallant\n ship, like a bird on the water, rides\n safely amidst the storm.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. At length the clouds break away,\n the sun shines down upon the sea, and\n the troubled waters sink to repose ; a\n deep calm settles upon the ocean, and\n its bosom is as smooth as a mirror.\n By and by a breeze springs up, the\n sails are filled, and the ship, speeding\n on her way, soon reaches the port to\n wliich she is bound.

Large numbers\n of French Protestants, driven into exile\n by the cruelty of their government,\n sought an asylum there. From all these\n sources, the population of South Caro-\n lina increased with great rapidity.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. I have told you, that until 1720,\n</p>\n<p>\n North and South Carolina were consid-\n ered one colony.

They also\n desired to furnish an asylum, where\n the persecuted and oppressed of all na-\n tions might go and be at peace.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. Such were the noble views\n which led to the settlement of this col-\n ony. The proprietors wishing to secure\n the happiness of the people, forbade\n slavery and the use of rum. Unfortu-\n nately, these good rules were soon dis-\n regarded.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. In 1733, five hundred poor peo-\n ple emigrated from England to Georgia,\n and in 1735, four hundred settlers came i\n from Germany, Switzerland, and Scot- 1\n land. Thus the number of inhabitants j\n increased rapidly; but still the colony\n did not flourish.

In the year 1740, there was war\n between England and Spain. Now the\n latter government possessed Florida,\n and had several settlements there.

So he took witii him two thou-\n sand men, a part of them from Virginia\n and South Carolina, and proceeded\n against St Augustine.

Their intention was to take pos-\n session of Georgia first, and the two\n Carolinas afterwards.\n</p>\n<p>\n 16. Gen. Oglethorpe had but seven\n hundred men and a small body of In-\n dians under his command. Accord-\n ingly he sent to South Carolina for as-\n sistance, but the people would Jtot send\n him any. So he and his little band\n were left to defend themselves, as well\n as they could, against four times their\n number.\n</p>\n<p>\n 17. Oglethorpe knew his danger,\n and determined to scare the Spaniards\n away, if possible. He therefore contri-\n ved to make them believe that he had\n more men than he actually had, and\n that a great body of English soldiers\n were coming to help him.\n</p>\n<p>\n 18. One day, the Spaniards saw\n three vessels of war, off the coast ; sup-\n posing that these had brought the rein-\n forcements, they became very much\n alarmed, ran aboard their ships as fast\n as possible, and sailed away. Thus\n Oglethorpe got rid of his troublesome\n visiters.\n</p>\n<p>\n 19. In 1754, the proprietors gave\n up the colony to the king, and after that\n time it prospered very much.

Their chief productions are cot-\n ton, tobacco, and rice. The climate is\n hot, and in summer it is unhealthy, in\n the low country. The land is chiefly\n divided into large plantations.

The slaves are generally well\n treated ; that is, they have enough to\n eat, drink, and wear, and are not re\u00ab\n quired to labor beyond their strength.\n But yet these poor negroes have no ed-\n ucation, they have no property, no lib-\n erty, no right to consult their own\n wishes, or, like the rest of mankind, pur-\n sue happiness in their own way. They\n have little knowledge of religion, and\n sink into their graves almost as igno-\n nant of the destiny that awaits them,\n as the brutes that perish.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Beside all this, when a planter\n dies, his slaves arc often sold ; some to\n one person and some to another.

Thus the family is sepa-\n rated, and very often they never see\n each other again.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. A gentleman who was in Georgia,\n two or three years ago, told me he once\n witnessed a public sale of negroes there.\n They were put up at auction, and many\n gentlemen came to bid for them. The\n slaves consisted of men, women, and\n children. The bidders examined them,\n turned them round, and made them walk\n back and forth, as if they had been\n cattle or horses.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. At length, the sale was finished\n One of the negro women had three\n children ; a daughter about fourteen\n years old, and two boys about eight or\n ten years old. It ha])pened that the\n children were bought by one person,\n and the mother by another. They\n were now to be separated, and never\n expected to see each other more.

Such are some of the evils of\n slavery. It is a bad system altogether,\n and all good people believe that it is\n wrong. I hope the time will soon\n come, when there will be no slaves in\n our country. A benevolent society has\n been formed for the purpose of setting\n these negroes free, and for sending them\n to Africa. They have already establish-\n ed a colony there, consisting entirely\n of blacks, called Liberia. Several hun-\n dred have already gone there ; and the\n colony is likely to prosper. I sincere-\n ly hope that the slaves in the United\n States may be gradually liberated, and\n that they may enjoy happiness and free-\n dom in the native land of the negro race.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. I have already told you that the\n first slaves brought to this country,\n arrived at Virginia in 1619. For about\n fifty years before the settlement of this\n colony, the merchants of England had\n been engaged in the slave trade. They\n used to send large ships to the western\n coast of Africa; these were then loaded\n with negroes, which were taken to the\n West Indies, to South America, and\n various other places, and sold. Some-\n times the slaves were bought in Africa,\n of those who had taken them in war,\n and sometimes the sailors went ashore,\n stole men, women, and children, and\n forced them on board their ships.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. These poor creatures were crowd-\n ed into the vessels, and used in the most\n barbarous manner. Many of them ex-\n pired for want of fresh air; some be-\n</p>\n<p>\n a sale of negroes t 7.

Such were some of the horrors\n attending the slave trade. Yet it con-\n tinued to be carried on, and very soon\n there were a great many slaves in all\n the colonies. There were more in the\n Southern than in the Northern States;\n but still in Pennsylvania, New York,\n and New England, there were several\n thousands.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. But at length, the people be-\n came convinced that slavery was wrong,\n and, in all the States north of Maryland,\n it was abolished. The Southern States\n still permit it ; but I hope they, too,\n will, ere long, prohibit it.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAP. XLIII.\n</p>\n<p>\n ALABAMA, MISSISSIPPI, and LOUISIANA.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1.

This territory was a mere hunt-\n ing ground for the Indians long after\n the settlement cff other parts of our\n country. After the revolutionary war,\n it was claimed hy Georgia, and the\n United States purcliased it for 1,250,-\n 000 dollars. By and by it began to\n he settled, and soon there were several\n thousand people there. In 1819, it be-\n came one of the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. I will now tell you about the\n State of Mississippi. The land here is\n generally level, with some ranges of\n hills. A large portion of the country is\n still covered with thick pine forests, in\n which there are a great many wild deer.\n Toward the southern part there are\n swamps and marshes filled with alliga-\n tors.

The planters send a great deal\n i of cotton to this place, which is taken\n . down the river, to New Orleans.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. As early as the year 1539, a\n - Spaniard, named Ferdinand de Soto,\n i came to this country with nine hundred\n ; persons. They spent three years in\n i searching for gold, but at length de\n ; Soto died, and his companions went\n i away. In 1083, a Frenchman named\n i de Salle, came down the river and\n I named the country Louisiana, in honor\n ! of his king Louis XIV.\n</p>\n<p>\n i 5. From this the French claimed\n I the territory, and, in 1716, made asettle-\n i mcnt Avhere Natchez now stands, called\n Fort Rosalie.

Louisiana is the most level of\n the twentyfour States. There are very\n extensive marshes lying along the Gull\n of Mexico, and there is much low lana\n bordering on the Mississippi. In the\n spring of the year, when this mighty\n river is swollen by rains, it sometimes\n rises above its banks, and spreads a\n vast flood of waters over the country\n in Louisiana.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The people of this State are\n \\!hiefly employed in raising cottom\n There are also many plantations of\n sugar-cane. This plant resembles our\n Indian corn in appearance. The stalks\n contain a sweet juice, from which su-\n gar and molasses are made. A large\n part of the sugar and molasses, which\n we use, is produced in Louisiana.\n</p>\n<p>\n I 8.

I have told you of a famous bah\n tie which took place near Baltimore in\n 1814. During the same war, a still\n more famous engagement occurred at\n New Orleans. On the 8th January,\n 1815, 12,000 British troops came against\n tliat city. Gen. Jackson was there\n with 3000 American soldiers.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. He knew that the enemy were\n coming; so he prepared to receive\n them. He had a long breast-work\n made of bags of cotton, heaped one\n upon another. Then he placed twelve\n cannon along the line, and the Ameri-\n cans got behind the breast-work. All\n things were now ready, and the British\n troops, led by Gen. Packenham, began\n to advance.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. It was truly a noble display, as\n they came on. The officers were richly\n dressed, in red coats, with shining\n epaulets. They had feathers of many\n colors in their hats, and they were\n armed with swords and pistols, which\n glittered in the morning light.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. Then came the soldiers with\n their bright guns, and sharp bayonets.\n They marched in straight lines, and\n covered the ground almost as far as the |\n eye could reach. There was a fine\n band of music, too, and the air rung\n with sounds of the drum and fife. Thus\n the British came on, marching over the\n</p>\n<p>\n leans ' ? 9. Vessels ' ? 10.

Jackson do ' ? Wlio\n</p>\n<p>\n level ground toward the American\n breast-work.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15. For a long time the Americans\n were still, and let the British come\n close upon them. Then suddenly the\n men put their lighted matches to the\n cannon ; the balls were hurled amid the\n British ranks, and the soldiers fell by\n hundreds. Then, too, the Americans\n pointed their guns over the breast-work,\n and sent their bullets in the faces of\n the enemy. A living sheet of fire con-\n tinued to blaze along the American\n line, and the ground far and near was\n shaken with the thunder of the battle.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. The British were brave men,\n and they were led by a brave general ;\n but they could not withstand the deadly\n fire of the Americans. Tliey were\n driven back, leaving the ground strewed\n with hundreds of the dead and dying.\n Twice indeed they rallied, and a few of\n them, as if seeking death, rushed close\n up to the breast-work. One daring of-\n ficer, at the head of his men, ascended\n to the top of it, and shouted to his fol-\n lowers to come on. But ere the words\n had parted from his lips, he fell into\n the ditch below, pierced through and\n through by a dozen bullets.\n</p>\n<p>\n 17. In one hour after the battle be-\n gan, it vras all over. The British were\n totally defeated, and marched sullenly\n away. Gen. Packenham was killed,\n seven hundred of his brave soldiers lay\n dead on the field, one thousand four\n hundred were wounded, and five hun-\n dred were taken prisoners. Thus the\n British lost twentysix hundred men,\n while the Americans had only seven\n killed, and six wounded.\n</p>\n<p>\n 18.

XLV.\n</p>\n<p>\n WESTERN STATES.^continued.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. I will now tell you something of\n the history of the Western States. 1\n will begin first with Tennessee. This\n State derives its name from its princi-\n pal river. The Indians imagined this\n river to bend like a spoon ; so they call-\n ed it Tennessee, which, in their lan-\n guage, is the name of a spoon.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. This country was included with\n the two Carolinas, in the grant made\n by Charles the Second, to the Earl of\n Clarendon, in 1664. When North and\n South Carolina were separated in 1729,\n Tennessee continued to be a part of the\n</p>\n<p>\n pedition \" ? 10. What do the hunters sometimes\n</p>\n<p>\n meet with 1 11.

In 1796, it became a member\n of the Union.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The first settlement in Tennes-\n see was made about the year 1754, by\n fifty families, who established them-\n selves where Nashville now stands.\n These were attacked by the Indians,\n and were soon obliged to return to\n North Carolina. In 1765, some people\n came to the eastern part of the terri-\n tory, and formed the first permanent\n white settlement in Tennessee. In\n 1780, Nashville was founded, and from\n this period the population rapidly in-\n creased.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Kentucky belonged to Virginia\n till the year 1786, when it became a\n separate district. It was received into\n the Union in 1792. Long after Vir-\n ginia was settled, Kentucky remained\n in the possession of the Indians. Some\n white people went there occasionally to\n trade with the natives, and they brought\n back very favorable accounts of the\n soil and climate. In 1769, Colonel\n Daniel Boone and some others, went\n \u2022to see the country.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. This party w^as attacked and\n plundered by the Indians, and all of\n them were killed except Boone. He\n remained in the wilderness for near two\n years, and then returned to his family,\n who lived on the Yadkin river in North\n Carolina.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6.

They were severely punish-\n ed, however, in 1T78, by Gen. Clarke,\n W ' ho marched against them with a body\n of soldiers, and laid their country waste.\n From this time they became less hos-\n tile, and the w ' hite people lived in great-\n er security.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. After this, the settlements flour-\n ished ; the fruitful soil, the mild cli-\n mate, and beautiful rivers of this region,\n drew people to it from all parts of the\n country. Col. Boone himself, retain-\n ing his love for the wilderness, retired\n as civilization advanced. He spent\n much of his time alone in the woods,\n subsisting upon wild deer, which he\n killed with his sure rifle. He lived to\n a great age, and when a grey haired\n old man, was still attached to the mode\n of life which he had preferred in ear-\n lier days.\n</p>\n<p>\n Col.

As\n late as the year 17S7, almost all this\n country w^as in the possession of the\n Indians. A few scattered inliabitants\n had established themselves within the\n territory. In 178S, Gen. Rufus Put-\n nam, with a party from New England,\n planted a little colony at the mouth of\n</p>\n<p>\n I the Muskingum, where Marietta now\n j stands; thus forming the first regular\n settlement in Ohio.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. From this time, the population in-\n creased, though it w ' as considerably\n checked by an unhappy war with the\n Indians, which lasted till 1795. In\n August of that year, Gen. Vv^aync made\n a treaty of peace wdth the savages, and\n thus hostilities ceased.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. Emigrants now began to flock\n to Ohio from various parts of the coun-\n try ; a great many went from New Eng-\n land, and liking the country, they in-\n vited their friends to come and join\n them. At length, so numerous were\n tlie emigrations, that every day, one\n might see, in the Eastern States, wagon-\n</p>\n<p>\n I loads of men, women, and children,\n moving to this Wc.5tcrn Country.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. The summer of 181G was very\n cold; and in New England the crops\n of corn were cut off, other kinds of\n grain w^ere nearly destroyed, and there\n was not grass enough produced to sup-\n port the cattle. The winter that fol-\n lowed, was severe, and many of them\n died from hunger. There w\u2019as a good\n deal of suffering, too, among the people.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13.

At the southeastern corner of\n the United States, is Florida, a broad\n strip of land shooting into the sea be-\n tween the Atlantic Ocean and the Gulf\n of Mexico. It was discovered at a very\n early period, by the Spaniards, and re-\n ceived its name from the abundance of\n wild flowers, that flourished upon its\n soil. In 1562, a little band of French\n Protestants fled from persecution, and\n settled near where the present town\n of St Augustine stands. Here it would\n seem they might have lived in peace ;\n but the cruelty which had driven them\n from home, pursued them to their lone-\n ly retreat.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. A Spanish oflicer, named Melen-\n dez, discovered the settlement, and\n finding that the people were not Cath-\n olics, but Protestants, he and his sol-\n diers put them to death, in the most\n cruel manner. But this wicked act did\n not go unavenged. A few years after-\n wards a Frenchman, ' named De Gour-\n guGS, visited the country with some\n soldiers, attacked the Spaniards who\n were settled near, and killed many of\n them.

Michigan Territory was original-\n ly inhabited by a numerous and power-\n ful tribe of Indians, called Hurons.\n About the year 1748, some Catholic\n priests from Canada, went among these\n savages, and converted the greater part\n of them to the Catholic religion. About\n t\\venty years after, the Six Nations, wh <\n hated the Hurons, called together their\n warriors, and sent them against the\n latter tribe.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6.

When a territory has 4d,000\n people, they may petition Congress to\n be admitted into the Union ; when\n their petition is granted, it becomes a\n State. It is in this way, that all the\n Western, and three of the Southern\n States, have become members of the\n Uiiion, within a little more than thirty\n years.

At that period the country now\n occupied by New England, the five Mid-\n dle States, and the four Southern States\n lying along the Atlantic, embraced thir-\n teen colonies, all belonging to Great\n Britain, and all acknowledging the gov-\n ernment of that country. My reader\n will recollect that none of the country\n lying west of the States above mentioned,\n was then occupied by English settlers.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2 . The French had settlements in\n Canada, extending from the mouth of\n the St Lawrence, to Lake Ontario.\n Along the shores of that lake, they had\n established several forts, and trading\n houses, to promote their trade with the\n Indians, which was now esteemed a\n matter of great consequence. They\n had also planted New Orleans near the\n mouth of the Mississippi, and having\n ascended that river, laid claim to the\n beautiful and fertile valley, through\n which it flows.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. They had also built trading hou-\n ses on the River Ohio, and finally de-\n termined to connect their northern and\n southern settlements, by a chain efforts,\n extending from Lake Ontario to their\n establishments on the Ohio, and thence\n</p>\n<p>\n Questions on the Map of the United States.\n \u2014 Describe the river St Lawrence, Lake Ontario,\n the Mississippi, Oliio.

While the French Avere busy in\n carrying this project into effect, some\n English people from Virginia establish-\n ed themselves on the Ohio River not\n far from the French settlements. As\n the French now claimed the country,\n they seized some of these settlers, and\n carried them prisoners to Canada.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Now the land in question was\n considered as a part of the colony of\n Virginia by tlie English, and it was sup-\n posed to belong to certain English peo^\n pie to Avhom it had been granted.\n These persons, regardingthcconduct of\n the French as very Avrong, ap])lied to\n Gov. Dinwiddle, of Virginia, for redress.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. The governor thought it best in\n the first place to send a messenger to\n the commander of the French forces, on\n the Ohio, and require him to march his\n troops aAvay, and thus quit the country.\n The person chosen for this purpose was\n George Washington, then but twenty-\n one years old. At this early age, he\n began that public career which has en-\n deared his name to every American,\n and rendered it illustrious throughout\n the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.

This answer did not satisfy Gov.\n Dinwiddie ; so he raised four hundred\n troops, and sent them under the\n command of Washington against the\n French, in the spring of 1754. They\n proceeded through the woods, and over\n the mountains till they came near Fort\n Du Quesne, where Pittsburg in Penn-\n sylvania now stands.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. When Washington had nearly\n reached this fort, about nine hundred\n French soldiers came out to attack him.\n He had scarcely time to throw up\n some hasty works for defence, before\n the French came upon him. The num-\n ber of the French was more than dou-\n ble that of the English, but Washing-\n ton did not mind that ; he cheered his\n men, and they fought very bravely.\n By and by, the French were tired of\n the battle, and so they made an agree-\n ment with Washington, that he and his\n men should return to Virginia, which\n they did accordingly.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. Being informed of all these\n things, the British government perceived\n that they must either drive the French\n away by force, or relintpiish the whole\n Valley of the Mississippi. They deter-\n mined to do the former, and sent out a\n great many troops to America to accom-\n plish this object. In the spring of 1 755,\n Gen. Braddock, an English oflicer,\n began to make preparations in Virginia,\n to proceed with a large army against\n Fort Du Quesne.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. Now 1 must tell you that it is\n necessary for an army that is going on\n a march, to have a great number of\n</p>\n<p>\n mander send to Gov. Dinwiddie 1 8.

It was found very difficult to\n procure enough of these ; and Gen.\n Braddock, becoming impatient, deter-\n mined to set out with a part of the army\n only. Accordingly he proceeded with\n twelve hundred men, leaving Col. Dun-\n bar to come on with the rest of the\n troops, as soon as the preparations were\n ready. Gen. Braddock was a brave\n man, and knew very well how to man-\n age a battle with regular soldiers, but\n he knew nothing of the Indian method\n of skulking behind trees, and rocks,\n and thickets, and shooting down men\n like so many squirrels.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. So lie proceeded on through the\n woods, trusting in his own skill, and\n fearing nothing. He W ' as advised to\n be on his guard, lest the sly savages\n should surprise him. But he treated\n this counsel with scorn. On the 9th of\n July, the English troops had approach-\n ed within a few miles of Fort Du Quesne.\n At length they came to a narrow valley,\n with high rocks on each side. It was\n midsummer, and the trees were cover-\n ed with a thick mantle of leaves. All\n</p>\n<p>\n || was peaceful and quiet around, and the\n j troops marched on, never dreaming\n that behind every bush, and rock, and\n tree around, lay a lurking savage taking\n a sure aim, and ready to send a fatal\n bullet to the heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13.

In the next year, 1759, several\n important places were taken by the\n English. A.mong these were the forts\n of Niagara, Ticonderoga, and Crown\n Point; but the most important event\n was the capture of Quebec.\n</p>\n<p>\n 16. This place, situated on the North-\n west side of the St Lawrence, was\n deemed one of the strongest in the\n world. It was defended by a great\n many cannon, placed in several forts,\n built upon high rocks. It was thought\n impossible for soldiers in any way to\n climb up these rocks, or to get posses-\n sion of the fortifications.\n</p>\n<p>\n 17. But William Pitt believed that\n the place might be taken ; so he sent a\n large and powerful army against it,\n commanded by Gen. Wolfe. This ofii-\n cer was a young man, full of bold and\n daring thoughts. Three oflicers, Monc-\n ton, Townshend, and Murray, all young\n and brave like himself, were associated\n with him.\n</p>\n<p>\n 18. It v/as toward the last of June,\n that the English army landed on the\n island of Orleans, a few miles below\n Quebec. Elere Wolfe had an opportu-\n nity to examine the difficulties he had\n to overcome. He perceived that they\n were very great, but declared to his\n friends, that he would either take the\n city, or die in the attempt. He devised\n various schemes, and made several ef-\n forts, but without success. Montcalm,\n the French commander, was exceeding-\n ly vigilant, and even the confident spirit\n of Wolfe began to be dejected.\n</p>\n<p>\n 19. But at length a narrow path\n was discovered, by which the soldiers\n</p>\n<p>\n 15 . What of 1759 ' ? What forts were taken ' ?\n Situation of Quebec ?

Wolfe knew that if he could get\n possession of these heights, he should\n obtain a great advantage. Accordingly,\n he resolved to make the attempt. But\n it was necessary that the enterprise\n should be conducted with the greatest\n secrecy.\n</p>\n<p>\n 20. In the stillness of night a part\n of the army landed at the foot of the\n cliff, which overhung the river. They\n were ready to climb the rocks by day\n break. Wolfe was himself among them,\n and they began their difficult task.\n Clambering uj) the steep, they canght\n hold of roots, bushes and angles of the\n rocks, and at length stood safe upon\n the plain above. Before sunrise, the\n whole army had gained the heights,\n and were all arranged under their se-\n veral leaders.\n</p>\n<p>\n 21. When Montcalm heard of all\n this, he thought it impossible, and\n would not believe the story ; but he\n soon found it to be true. Knowing\n that he must now come to battle, he\n drew out his men upon the plain in\n front of the English army. When all\n was ready, the French advanced brisk-\n ly. The English stood still, and receiv-\n ed them with a dreadful fire.

We are now coming to events of\n great interest, and great importance.\n iSoon after the French war, the king and\n parliament of Great Britain began to\n treat the colonies in a very unjust man-\n ner. They had never conducted gen-\n erously to them ; on the contrary, their\n proceedings had generally shown a de-\n sire to make them profitable to Eng-\n land, rather than prosperous and happy\n among themselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Yet the people in this country\n loved England so well, that they easily\n forgot these things, and it is probable\n that all might have gone on in harmo-\n ny for many years, if the British gov-\n ernment had not attempted to oppress\n and enslave the people.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. It is hardly necessary to tell you\n of all the difficulties which preceded\n the war; but I will endeavor to make\n you understand the principal one. The\n British government, being very much\n in debt, wanted to raise large sums of\n money, and so determined to get a part\n of it by taxing the Americans. Now\n the latter maintained that England had\n no right to tax them. They thought\n it very hard and very unjiist, that Par-\n liament, consisting of men who lived\n in England, at a distance of 3000 miles,\n should take away the money of the\n people here, just because they happen ' -\n ed to want it.

In opposing this, the Ameri-\n cans were perfectly right; but still\n parliament passed laws, imposing du-\n ties upon various articles of mer-\n chandise, brought into the country.\n These acts produced a great ferment\n throughout the colonies. The people\n in Boston were particularly excited ;\n and fearing rebellion, Gen. Gage, the\n British commander, assembled two reg-\n iments of soldiers, to keep them in aAve.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.

Such was the state of irritation\n in Boston in the spring of 1770, that\n quarrels occurred almost every day,\n between the soldiers and the popu-\n lace. On the second of March, as\n one of the British soldiers was going\n by the shop of one Gray, a rope-maker,\n he was beaten severely. He ran off,\n but returned with some of his com-\n rades, and the soldiers and rope-ma-\n kers fell together by the ears in good\n earnest. The latter got the worst of\n it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8.

In March, 1771, the English Par-\n ! liament concluded to repeal tlie duties\n jupon glass, paint, & .C., but retained a\n ! tax of threejtence a pound upon tea.\n jT ' his was a sad mistake. If Parlia-\n ! ment had reppuled all, and said no more\n about taxes, the Americans might still\n have been satisfied. As it was, they\n began to buv the goods of the English\n merchants again, tea alone excepted ;\n this they would have nothing to do\n with.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. So matters went on, during the\n year 1771. The ofllcers of the revenue\n were everywhere despised. In Boston,\n one of them undertook to seize upon a\n vessel, for some violation of the law.\n He was seized upon himself by the peo-\n ple, for what they thought a violation\n of the law, stripped, carted through the\n town, besmeared with tar, and plastered\n over with a coat of feathers, so that he\n looked more like an ostrich than a\n pnan.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

In 1773, large ships, loaded with\n immerse cargoes of tea, were sent out\n to America, by some merchants in Eng-\n land. But the colonists had made up\n their minds what to do. In Philadel-\n phia and New York, not a man could\n be found to receive the English tea,\n or have anything to do with it. A few\n chests, which one Captain Chambers\n had brought to Philadelphia, were let\n down very quietly to the bottom of the\n river, by some people, who went slyly\n on board the ship. Iiir Charleston, it\n was landed and lodged in cellars so\n damp, that it was soon spoiled.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The people of Boston took a keen\n interest in this business. The English\n agents there, when the tea was lirst\n known to be coming, were required by\n the people to give up all concern with\n it. They made no answer, but with-\n drew as fast as convenient into the for- j\n tress. Captain Hall soon arrived in\n port with one hundred chests of tea.\n The people collected in great fury, or-\n dered him to keep it on board, as he\n valued his life, and placed a guard, and\n < t strict watch close by the vessel, upon\n GrilFin\u2019s Wharf.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Two other vessels having arriv-\n ed, they were obliged to anchor by the\n side of Hall\u2019s ship. A town meeting,\n meanwhile, was summoned ; and the\n people agreed to call upon the governor,\n and request him to have the ships sent\n off. But the governor would do no\n such tiling. A great uproar now began.\n</p>\n<p>\n in 1772 1 What of the Americans 1 4, What\n</p>\n<p>\n was done in 1773 1 New York and Philadelphia 1\n Cantain Chambers and his tea 1 What was done\n in Charleston! 5.

The meeting was dissolved in the\n twinkling of an eye, and the multitude\n rushed to Griffin\u2019s Wharf. Here were\n seventeen sea captains, carpenters, and\n others, disguised as Indians. It was\n night, and these persons went on board\n the three vessels, and, in less than two\n hours, three hundred and forty chests\n were staved and emptied into the sea.\n</p>\n<p>\n I This done, they went quietly home ;\n</p>\n<p>\n ' and the crowd dispersed, very well sat-\n isfied.\n</p>\n<p>\n S. Early in 1774, an account of these\n disturbances having reached England,,\n tlie government then determined, by way\n of punishing the people of Boston, to\n destroy the trade of that town, by for-\n bidding all manner of goods to be land-\n ed there. Accordingly, the Boston\n Port Bill was passed in Parliament,\n March 14th, and the news was received\n in Boston, May 10th. Like other unjust\n laws, tills also did more hurt than good.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. In a few days after the Port Bill\n was passed, other laws were made,\n still more severe. They were opposed\n in England, by some persons, but a\n large part, both of the parliament and\n people, supposed, if the Americans\n were punished and frightened pretty\n well, tliey would, by and by, be more\n submissive to the mother country. This\n was anotlier sad mistake.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. Not only the people of Boston,\n blit the whole people of America,\n North, South, East, and West, were more\n indignant than ever. Town meetings\n were held, days of fastings appointed,\n and news of the Port Bill spread over\n the wliole country.

At .midday, all\n business ceased in the custom hoifee ; no\n vessel was sufiered to enter the harbor.\n Very little was now done, for the rich\n had no money to spare, and the poor\n liad no employment.

Serious preparations began to\n be made for war. People provided\n themselves with arms, formed compa-\n nies, and learned, as fast as possible,\n the business of soldiers. Being most\n of them used to hunting, they were\n good marksmen. In all places, nothing\n was heard but the noise of drums and\n fifes. Fathers and sons, young and old,\n became soldiers ; and even women and\n girls set about casting balls and making\n cartridges.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15.

During the winter, before the\n Port Bill passed, the boys were in the\n habit of building hills of snow on the\n Common, and sliding down upon them to\n the Pond. The English troops beat down\n these hills, merely to provoke them.\n The boys complained of the injury, and\n set about repairing it. However, when\n they returned from school, they found\n the snow hills beat down again.\n</p>\n<p>\n 16. Several of the boys now waited\n upon the British captain, and informed\n him of the conduct of his soldiers ; but\n he would have nothing to say to them,\n and the soldiers were more impudent\n than ever. At last, they called a meet-\n ing of the largest boys, and sent them\n to General Gage, Commander in Chief.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 7. He asked why so many children\n had called upon him. \u2018We came, sir,\u2019\n said the tallest boy, \u2018 to demand satis-\n faction.\u2019 \u2018 What,\u2019 said the General, \u2018 have\n your fathers been teaching you rebel-\n lion, and sent you to show it here?\u2019\n \u2018 Nobody sent us, sir,\u2019 answered the boy,\n while his cheek reddened, and his eye\n flashed; \u2018we have never injured, nor\n insulted your troops; but they have\n trodden down our snow hills, and broken\n the ice on our skating ground. We\n complained, and they called us young\n rebels, and told us to help ourselves if\n we could. We told the captain of thre,\n and he laughed at us.

I have now told you something\n which preceded the Revolutionary War.\n You see by what I have told you, that\n the people in all parts of the country\n were resolved to resist the oppression\n of the British government. Slowly\n and reluctantly had they come to the\n decision ; but now that the spirit of the\n nation was roused, they were ready to\n go into the field, and shed their blood\n in the sacred cause of liberty.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. In this state of things, nothing\n was wanting but some occasion which\n might call the feelings of the people\n into action; and this was not long de-\n layed. There were some military\n stores at Concord, about 18 miles from\n Boston, belonffincf to the Americans.\n These Gen. Gage Mushed to destroy ;\n and for this purpose he sent about 800\n grenadiers and light infantry from Bos-\n ton, at eleven o\u2019clock in the evening of\n the 18th of April, 1775.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Notice of this was immediately\n carried into the country. By two\n o\u2019clock in the morning, 130 of the Lex-\n ington militia had assembled on the\n green, at the meeting-house, to oppose\n them. They were dismissed, but col-\n lected again between four and five, at\n the beat of the drum. By and by the\n 800 British troops come marching up\n the road.

He now\n rode forward, discharged his pistol,\n brandished his sword, and ordered his\n soldiers to fire. They did so, and three\n or four of the Americans were killed.\n The soldiers shouted, fired again, and\n then proceeded toward Concord.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. At Concord, they disabled two\n cannon, threw 500 pounds of ball into\n the wells, and staved about 60 barrels\n of flour. They fired upon the Concord\n militia, under Major Batterick\u2019s com-\n mand. Two men were killed; a skir-\n mish followed ; and the English retreat-\n ed, as fast as possible, to Lexington.\n By this time, the people Avere coming\n upon them from all parts of the country.\n The British were fired upon on all sides,\n from sheds, houses, and fences.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. At Lexington, where they halted\n to rest, they were joined by 900 more\n troops, sent out from Boston, under\n Lord Percy.

Soon the clergyman was\n among them, and they were all told,\n that some of their countrymen had\n been shot by the British soldiers, at\n Lexington. The faces of the men, as\n they heard it, were pale, but not from\n fear; it was immediately resolved, that\n thirty persons should be equipped, and\n set out for Boston. Those who could\n best go, were selected, and went home\n to make preparations.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. At noon, they had all returned\n to the little lawn in front of the meet-\n ing-house. There was a crowd of peo-\n ple around. There were friends, and\n acquaintances, and wives and children.\n Such as were not well supplied with\n clothes, and equipments, were immedi-\n ately furnished by their neighbors.\n Among the crowd, there was one re-\n markable individual. This was a rich\n old miser, who was never known to\n part with his money, but with extreme\n reluctance. On the present occasion,\n his nature seemed changed. He took\n several of the soldiers apart, whom he\n supposed likely to be destitute, and put\n into their hands, about thirty dollars of\n hard cash ; at the same time saying, in\n a low voice, \u2018Beat the rascals! beat\n them ! If you come back, perhaps you\n will pay me; if not, God bless you!\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. After all the arrangements were\n made, the soldiers entered the broad\n aisle of the church.

I will now tell you about General\n Putnam. He was a brave man, and\n lived at Brooklyn, in Connecticut. He\n was a farmer, and was ploughing in the\n field, when the tidings from Lexington\n were brought to him. He did not stay\n even to unharness his cattle ; but\n leaving the plough in the unfinished\n furrow, he went to his house, gave\n some hasty directions respecting his\n affairs, mounted his horse, and with a\n rapid pace proceeded to Boston.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. In the course of a few weeks,\n 30,000 men had arrived from various\n parts of the country. They were indeed\n poorly armed, but they were full of\n resolution. Most of them were farmers\n and mechanics, who had spent their\n lives in peace, and knew nothing of war.\n But the blood of their countrymen had\n been spilled, and they had come to\n avenge their death. They had no can-\n non, no leaders, but little ammunition,\n and many of them had no guns. But\n in spite of these deficiences, they were\n full of courage, and ready, as soon as an\n opportunity offered, to meet the British\n troops in open battle.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAP. LHI.\n</p>\n<p>\n REVOLUTION. \u2014 continued.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. I must beg my readers to pause\n here a moment, and consider the state\n of the country at this point of our story. |\n It was not then, as now, full of wealth, 1\n and covered with large towns and cities, j\n</p>\n<p>\n necticut 1 13.

New York,\n Philadelphia, and other large places,\n were then comparatively small. The\n country was poor, and the whole num-\n ber of inhabitants, throughout the thir-\n teen colonies was scarcely 3,000,000 ;\n yet they were about to engage in a\n strife with Great Britain, the most pow-\n erful nation on the earth.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. She had nearly one thousand\n ships of war, and the Americans had\n none. She had powerful armies, skil-\n ful generals, and an abundance of all\n the materials for making war. Such\n was indeed the poverty and apparent\n weakness of America, such the mighty\n power of England, that in Europe, it\n was generally believed that the Ameri-\n cans must be crushed in the struggle.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. But our brave fathers thought\n not so. They knew the power of Eng-\n land, but they knew also that the race\n is not always to the swift, nor the bat-\n tle to the strong. Placing their confi-\n dence in Heaven and the justice of\n their cause, they entered boldly into\n the contest, and, as we shall see in the\n end, triumphed over their oppressors.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The war having been opened\n by the battle of Lexington, the Ameri-\n cans determined to prosecute it on their\n part with vigor. They sent some sol-\n diers against two British forts, Ticon-\n deroga and Crown Point, both of which\n were easily captured.

To prevent this\n the Americans sent a thousand men by\n night to occupy Bunker Hill. By mis-\n take they went to Breed\u2019s Hill, situated\n in Charlestown, and very near to Bos-\n ton.

It is scarcely possible\n for us to conceive of the sufferings of\n the country during this struggle of\n eight years. Thousands of people\n were killed ; towns were burnt down ;\n the lands lay uncultivated ; many of\n the churches had ceased to be places\n of worship, and become barracks for\n soldiers. Hundreds of families had\n been broken up ; thousands had been\n reduced from wealth to poverty ; widows\n v/ere mourning for their husbands who\n were slain ; children were thrown upon\n the world without protection ; and so^\n ciety, having lost its character for pure\n morality, was stained with profliga-\n cy and vice.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Beside all this, though our coun >\n try had gained peace and independence,\n it was still without a regular govern-\n ment. Happily, we had wise and good\n men at this time, as well as brave ones\n during the war. These, seeing the ne-\n cessities of the country, devised an ex-\n cellent government, which went into\n operation in the year 1789, as I have\n told you. The rules and principles of\n this government are called the Consti-\n</p>\n<p>\n October \u201d? 12. The British government \" ? What\n</p>\n<p>\n took place in 17S3 ?

He\n died in 1799, as I have before told you.\n j He was one of the greatest and best\n I men that ever lived : his memory is\n cherished by the American people as\n that of a father, and venerated throughout\n the world. He not only saved his coun-\n try by his bravery, skill, and prudence,\n but he has done, and will do more good\n to mankind by his example, than any\n other man that ever existed.

He became the intimate\n friend of Washington, and his noble\n heart was deeply imbued with th*\n lofty and pure sentiments of that great\n man.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. After our war was done, he re-\n turned to his own country. The spirit of\n liberty was soon after kindled in France.\n True to his principles. La Fayette stood\n forth as the friend of freedom, justice\n and humanity. But ambitious men\n arose, and a horrible scene of strife,\n bloodshed, and anarchy spread over the\n land. Then Bonaparte came. In his\n attempts to conquer the world, millions\n of human beings v/ere slain.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. During all this time. La Fayette\n was banished or in prison. But at\n length, Bonaparte was dead. The self-\n ish and the bloodthirsty had perished,\n and their schemes had perished with\n them. Again the spirit of liberty visit-\n ed France, and now again La Fayette\n appears as the friend of his country\n and mankind.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Though he is old, yet his heart is\n warm and true. Amidst the turmoil of\n angry passions, he is calm and stead-\n fast. The example of Washington is\n ever before him. His countrymen have\n discovered his sincerity, and they have\n placed their destiny in his hands. At\n the age of near eighty years, he is the\n admiration of the world.

In 1797, John Adams, of Massa-\n chusetts, was chosen President. He\n was a member of the old Congress,\n who sat at Philadeljdha during the war,\n and brought the country safely through\n that trying period. He was a man of\n great elocjuence. His heart was full\n of patriotic feelings, and he had the art\n of uttering them with such force, as to\n awaken similar feelings in the breasts of\n others. He lifted his voice against the\n tyranny of Britain, and pleaded earnest-\n ly for the cause of liberty. In this\n way he produced great effect; and, in\n gratitude for these things, the people\n chose him President.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. During his administration, the\n city of Washington became the seat of\n government. In 1800, Congress, which\n before had sat at Philadelphia, removed\n to this place, and have ever since held\n</p>\n<p>\n their sessions there. It has now grown\n up to be quite a large city. It is situ-\n ated in the district of Columbia, which\n is a tract of land ten miles s(juarc, and\n the people are under the government\n of Congress. It was ceded to the Uni-\n ted States in 1790, and has now 39,870\n inhabitants.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. In 1801, Thomas Jefferson, of\n Virginia, was elected President of the\n United States. He too was an ardent\n friend of liberty, and exerted himself\n during the Revolution to save the coun-\n try. in 1803, he purchased Louisiana\n of the French for the United States,\n an immense tract of land, lying be-\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 tween the Mississippi and the Pacific\n Ocean. Of this I have told you in the\n history of Louisiana.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. in 1805, Mr Jefferson was elect-\n ed President a second time. In 1809,\n James Madison, of Virginia, was elected\n President. In 1812, our country de-\n clared war against Great Britain. The\n principal cause of this was, that the\n ships of that nation frequently met our\n vessels upon the sea, and their officers\n behaved in a very improper manner.\n They took the liberty to search our\n vessels, and if they found any English\n sailors on board, they took them forci-\n bly av/ay. Sometimes they mistook\n American for English sailors, and thus\n many of our countrymen were forced\n into the British navy, and there obli-\n ged to fight the battles of the English.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13.

Greenland has been longer known\n to Europeans, than any other part of\n America, except Iceland. More than\n eight hundred years ago, some white\n people went from Iceland, and settled\n on the eastern coast. They found the\n country inhabited by the same race of\n short swarthy seal-catchers who inhabit\n Greenland now. A few years after, a\n good many people went from Norway,\n and joined the settlers, and in 1023\n they all became subject to^enmark.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. In 1350, a dreadful pestilence,\n called the Black Deatl^Aprevailed in\n Europe, and extended \u00ab ravages to\n Iceland and Greenland. This not only\n destroyed the lives of many of the peo-\n ple, but the plants perished, and the\n whole land was left blasted and desolate.\n About a hundred years after this, vast\n masses of ice accumulated along the\n eastern shore of Greenland, and ships\n from Europe could never afterwards\n visit these settlements.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. Thus cut off from all intercourse\n with the rest of the world, the whole\n colony perished. In 1 721 , some people\n from Denmark went to Greenland and\n settled there. From year to year, oth-\n er settlers came, and, intermarrying with\n the natives, established a permanent\n colony there. They are still subject\n to Denmark, and the whole number of\n the people is supposed to be 20,000.\n</p>\n<p>\n land 1 What took place more than 800 years ago 1\n What did the settlers find ' ?

I will now tell you of Iceland.\n This is a large island, upon the eastern\n coast of Greenland, and but little more\n than one hundred miles distant from it\n In extent, it is nearly equal to the State\n of New York. It is covered with moun\n tains, and is a wild, desolate region,\n yet the inhabitants have a proverb which\n says, that \u2018 Iceland is the best land on\n which the sun shines.\u2019 These people\n came originally from Norway, and are\n a pious, contented and happy race.\n They are very intelligent, and, being\n deprived of almost all intercourse with\n the rest of mankind, they spend a great\n part of their leisure in reading, telling\n stories, and reciting poetry to each\n oth^.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. In February, these people flock to\n the southern and western shores of the\n island, and spend three months in fish-\n ing. At this time, their dresses are\n made of skins. Their food is butter\n and fish, which they eat early in the\n morning and late at night, the day\n being spent at sea. Nine or ten men\n go in a boat, and fearlessly venture out\n to a great distance upon the water.\n The fish they catch are principally\n cod.\n</p>\n<p>\n .3. When the snow leaves the ground,\n they return to their villages, and the\n men collect trees for fuel, and to cover\n the roofs of their houses. The young\n cattle are then driven to the mountains,\n and the women take care of the cows\n and tlie dairy. About the middle of\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. Where is Iceland ' ? Extent 1 What of\n Iceland ' ?

CONTINUED\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. I have told you that Mexico is a\n vast country, containing 8,000,000 of\n inhabitants. Some of these are nearly\n white, like the people of the United\n States, and are descended from Spanish\n emigrants, who settled in the country\n</p>\n<p>\n I many years ago. There are many ne-\n i groes also, who are slaves brought\n originally from Africa. A large part\n of the population are Indians, whose\n falthers once possessed the country, as\n the Indians possessed the land in the\n United States, before the Europeans\n came, and took it from them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. I know of no history more inter-\n esting than that of Mexico. I have\n not room to tell the whole story, but 1\n Avill relate a part of it. A little more\n than three hundred years ago, Mexico\n was inhabited only by Indians. But\n they were not savages, living in the\n woods, and subsisting upon wild beasts,\n</p>\n<p>\n ! as those I have told you of in the his-\n ' tory of our own country. On the con-\n trary, they had large towns, splendid\n buildings, and an established govern-\n i ihent.\n</p>\n<p>\n I 3. The king resided at the city of\n 1 Mexico, then called Tenuchtitlan. It\n i was a magnificent city, filled with tern-\n I pies, towers, and palaces. It surpassed\n j everything else in richness and gran-\n deur that then existed in America. It\n was in the year 1518, that the Span-\n iards first heard of this great kingdom.\n Expecting to get a great deal of gold\n and silver, they determined to send\n some men to conquer it.

About (his time, some of the\n Spanish soldiers had become weary of\n their toils, and foreseeing the dangers\n to which they would be exposed, deter-\n mined to seize the ships, and return to\n Cuba. Cortez discovered the plot, and\n by his artful management, diverted the\n men from their purpose.

After a little while, Cortez set\n out, with six thousand Tlascalan war-\n riors, to pursue his march toward the\n capital of Mexico. He was soon met I\n by messengers from Montezuma, re-\n questing him to come by the way of Cho-\n lula. Accordingly the army marched to\n that city. But it was soon discovered,\n that a plot had been formed to destroy\n Cortez and his army ; the chiefs of Cho-\n lula were therefore seized, and the\n town given up to plunder. For two\n whole days the six hundred Spanish\n soldiers, and the six tho ' usand Tlasca-\n lans went through the city, slaughter-\n ing men, women, and children. Tears\n and cries obtained no mercy. The houses\n and streets were everywhere stained\n with blood; and finally a large temple,\n to which hundreds of the people had\n fled for safety, was set on fire, and all\n the miserable people in it were con-\n sumed. Such was the awful vengeance\n of Cortez toward his enemies !\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Strange as it may seem, Cortez |\n</p>\n<p>\n had the address to make friends of the i\n people of Cholula who had \u2019escaped the\n massacre. They became his allies,\n and he marched on toward Tenuchtit-\n lan. After proceeding several days, he\n reached a large city called Tezcuco.\n The Cacique received him kindly, and\n everywhere the people manifested a\n desire to be released from the harsh\n government of Montezuma. Leaving\n this place, the army proceeded, and after\n crossing some mountains, a beautiful\n valley of great extent was presented to\n their viev/.

I must now tell my readers that\n the Mexicans knew nothing of tlie Bib.le,\n and had never heard of Jesus Christ.\n They had many absurd notions of re-\n ligion, and paid their worship to a multi-\n tude of idols. They erected splendid\n temples in honor of these gods, and en-\n tertained for them the most profound\n reverence. Multitudes of priests at-\n tended the temples, and sacrificed\n thousands of human beings to their dei-\n ties. These consisted chiefly of prison-\n ers taken in war. The lives of their\n captives were generally preserved, that\n their blood might be shed by the priests\n in honor of the gods.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Now Cortez was a Catholic, and\n these things shocked him very much.\n He could make war upon a defenceless\n people, slay .tliem by thousands, plot\n the destruction of their governmenl,\n and pursim his schemes by falsehood,\n</p>\n<p>\n city T What place was assigned to Cortez and his\n U-oops I\n</p>\n<p>\n 1.

All these\n things were consistent witli his notions\n of relitrion, but the sacrifice of human\n victims to idols, appeared to liim very\n wicked and absurd. It may seem to us\n very strange, that the Mexicans could\n imagine the horrid practices of their\n religion were right, but it is still more\n strange, that Cortez could believe his\n conduct was agreeable to the peaceful\n doctrines of Christianity. We can only\n account for it on the supposition, that\n he had never read the scriptures, and\n knew nothing of the religion he pro-\n fessed, but its rites, and ceremonies.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Montezuma supposed that the\n strangers would be very much gratified\n to see the Ptlexican temples. So he\n went with them, showed them the idols,\n and explained everything. After Cor-\n tez had seen it all, he told the king,\n that the Mexican religion was false and\n wicked. He also told him something\n about the Christian religion. Monte-\n zuma was very much shocked, and he\n told Cortez, that he must not speak ir-\n reverently of the Mexican Gods.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The king was evidently angry,\n and he began secretly to take measures\n for killing the Spaniards. But nothing\n escaped the vigilance of Cortez. He\n (piickly discovered the plot, and resort-\n ed to a very bold measure for defeating\n it. He went, with about thirty of his\n bravest men, to the palace of the king.\n They were admitted, and received by\n Montezuma with apparent friendship.\n After some conversation, Cortez told\n the king he must go with him to his\n quarters.

One day, some of these\n arrived from the coast, with pictures\n of eighteen European vessels, that had\n just come there.

The city of Guatimala was founded\n in the year 1524, and gradually rose\n to be a rich and beautiful place. The\n Spanish governor resided there, and\n many wealthy families lived there in\n very splendid houses. But it was built\n on the slope of a mountain whose top\n was a volcano. In the year 1751, a\n dreadful earthquake shook down many\n of the houses, and the volcano sent\n forth a torrent of lava, which rolled\n down upon the town. In this way, a\n great part of the city was destroyed;\n but the people rebuilt it, and again it\n was a flourishing and beautiful place.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.

While the Spaniards were\n employed in conquering Mexico, they\n heard of a great Indian empire In South\n America, called Peru. Accordingly Pi-\n zarro set out, in the year 1631, to con-\n quer that country. While he w^as en-\n gaged in this great enterprise, he sent\n some generals to subdue the Indians at\n the north. They consisted chiefly of\n small tribes living in a savage state, and\n ofiered little resistance to the Spanish\n arms.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. But there were two or three na-\n tions which had made some advances\n in civilization, and which were formi-\n dable from their numbers and warlike\n character. The chief of these were\n called Moscas, and inhabited the coun-\n try in the vicinity of Santa Fe: their\n capital was built where that city now\n stands. The king was both priest, and\n monarch, and the people had such a\n reverence for him, that whenever he\n went abroad they strewed flowers in his\n path, and turned their eyes away, lest\n</p>\n<p>\n Pampas 1 8.

When the Spanish general, Gon*\n zala de Ximenes, came to this country,\n in 1536, the reigning king was called\n Bogota. He was a famous chief, and\n he drew out his men to flght with the\n Spaniards. A great battle was fought,\n but the Indians were defeated, and the\n Spaniards were soon able to get pos-\n session of the country, on both sides\n of the mountains.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. This whole region thus fell into\n their hands, and was erected into a\n province, under the name of New Gre-\n nada. It occupied nearly all the Ter-\n ritory within the present limiis of Co-\n lombia, excepting the province of Ve-\n nezuela. It was rapidly settled by Span-\n iards, who married Indian women, and\n devoted themselves to the cultivation\n of the soil. For 250 years, the people\n lived in peace, no war having taken\n place during this long period.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. The coast of Venezuela was dis-\n covered by Columbus, in 1498. Some\n other Spanish navigators followed him,\n and on their return, gave very favora-\n ble accounts of the country. This led\n a good many people from Spain to come\n and settle there. They came under the\n direction of priests, who exerted them-\n selves to convert the Indians, but with-\n out success. The settlements did not\n flourish, and it was thought best to sub-\n due the Indians by force. Seme troops\n</p>\n<p>\n , were sent ajjainst them, and after a\n great deal of bloodshed, the savages\n were partly subdued.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6.

The whole\n country was thrown into confusion, and\n the American colonies, finding them-\n selves neglected, thought it necessary\n to take care of themselves. The in-\n habitants of Venezuela, then called\n Caraccas, declared themselves inde-\n pendent, in 1811; and the first Con-\n gress assembled under the new Consti-\n tution, in 1812.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. In New Grenada many of the\n people were in favor of independence,\n while others adhered to the govern-\n ment of Spain. These two parties\n became very much excited, and dread-\n ful conflicts ensued. The Catholic\n priests joined the royal cause, and many\n of them became soldiers and officers in\n the army. The most dreadful outrages\n were committed upon the inhabitants,\n tinder the sanction of these priests. In\n 1812, one fifth of the inhabitants of\n Quito were murdered by troops, who\n were commanded by a Catholic bishop.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9.

The\n new government had gone into opera-\n tion, and the prospects of the country\n were very fair. But suddenly the city\n of Caraccas, then the capital, was over-\n whelmed by an earthquake. A great\n part of the houses were shaken down,\n and 12,000 of the people perished.\n Other towns also felt the shock, and\n thousands of the inhabitants were killed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. \u2019 The priests now declared this\n to be a visitation from Heaven, for the\n sins of the nation in deserting the cause\n of their king. The superstitious peo-\n ple were filled witli terror, and desert-\n ing the cause of their country, flocked\n by thousands to the royal standard.\n The few patriots who remained true to\n their principles, fought bravely, but\n they were defeated, and the cause of\n tyranny again triumphed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. Soon after this, a very extraor-\n dinary man appeared on the side of the\n patriots. This was Simon Bolivar, a\n native of Caraccas. He perceived the\n necessity of freedom, for the happiness\n of his country, and he resolved if pos-\n sible to achieve it. He was very rich,\n and had a thousand slaves. But these\n he set free, and used his fortune in\n raising troops to fight the enemies of\n freedom. I cannot tell you the whole\n story of this remarkable man. He\n fought a great many battles; sometimes\n with success, and sometimes experi-\n encing defeat.

About three hundred and fifty\n years ago, there ' lived in Spain an ob-\n scure boy, named Francis Pizarro. Ilis\n occupation was feeding hogs; but having\n a bold spirit, he forsook this emplo5^-\n ment, and became a soldier. He came\n to America with other adventurers, and\n was at length so famous, as to be en-\n trusted with the command of an expe-\n dition, for the discovery and conquest\n of Peru. While Cortez was employed\n in subduing Mexico, the fame of this\n great \u2018empire of South America had\n reached the ears of the Spaniards.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Dreaming now only of conquest,\n and amassing heaps of silver and gold,\n they resolved immediately to send an\n expedition against it. This, as I have\n said, was entrusted to Pizarro, who set\n out in a leaky vessel with one hundred\n and twenty men, in the year 1525. He\n sailed from the Bay of -Panama, and\n after various adventures,* and having\n received a small addition to his forces,\n he reached the coast of Peru.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The gentle and unsuspecting in-\n habitants came down to the water, and\n looked with strange wonder upon the\n vessels and the white men who had\n come to visit them. They then went\n</p>\n<p>\n Guanca Velica ' ? 4. Cusco 1 People 1 Ruins !\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. Francis Pizarro 1 What expedition was he\n entrusted with 1 Peruvian empire t 6. Span-\n iards ' ? When and how did Pizarro set out?\n</p>\n<p>\n away, and brought provisions, which\n they gave to Pizarro. He and his men\n now landed, and the Cacique treated\n them with great kindness. Such was\n the friendly reception, given by the\n Peruvians to the white men, whose\n purpose was to rob and murder them!\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. Pizarro found the people to be\n of a copper color, like other Indians.\n They were clothed in garments of cot-\n ton and woollen cloth ; the latter being\n made from the wool of the lama. Their\n persons were all decorated with gold\n and silver ornaments, and he noticed\n about the houses various utensils made\n of these precious metals. He therefore\n formed a high idea of the riches of the\n country, and became more eager in his\n desire to conquer it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. But I must tell you a little more\n about these Peruvians. Pizarro had\n with him a negro man, whose black\n skin and woolly head excited their won-\n der. They supposed he was painted,\n and therefore gave him a good scrubbing,\n but finding the color would not come ofii\n their amazement was unbounded.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. One day, the Cacique saw a\n Spaniard have a gun, and so he asked\n him the use of it. The Spaniard raised\n the piece to his eye, and fired the bullet\n through a board which was near. The\n Peruvians all around fell on their faces\n in fear, and the Cacique himself trem-\n bled very rnucli. He then gave the\n man some strange drink, saying, \u2018 Drink,\n my friend, of this, for truly thou makest\n a big noise, and scemest to me like the\n thunder r of the heavens.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n 11.

About four hundred years\n previous to the arrival of Pizarro, the\n empire is supposed to have been found-\n ed by Manco Kapac and his wife Mama\n Ozello. 7\u2019hese two persons were said\n to be white, and came from some un-\n known country.

The inhabitants submitted to\n their direction. Manco taught them to\n cultivate the land, to manufacture cloth-\n ing, and to erect huts. Ozello taught\n the women to spin, and gave them a\n taste for domestic duties.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. These persons also persuaded\n the Indians to abolish the custom of\n sacrificing human victims to their idols,\n and taught them to worship one God,\n whose image or emblem was the sun\n Under the influence of these sovereigns\n the Peruvinns ceased to be savages,\n and became at length a great nation.\n The descendants of Manco continued\n to reign over the country, and for near\n four hundred years, it enjoyed peace\n and prosperity. The inhabitants increas-\n ed, and many towns were built. These\n Avere filled Avith temples, Avhere the\n Avorship of the sun Avas conducted Avith\n great pomp.

We must recollect also, that all\n i these things were done by Pizarro\n j and his men, by the sanction of the\n i catholic religion, and under the pre-\n tence of serving the cause of Christian-\n ; ity.

It will be suffi-\n cient to say, that Paula, a brother of\n Atahualpa, succeeded him as Inca ; he\n was defeated however by Pizarro, who\n soon after entered the city of Cusco\n ivith his army. Quito was next taken,\n and soon the conquest of the whole\n country was completed. The story ot\n the awful cruelties committed by the\n Spaniards in subduing the country,\n would till a book. In 1533, Pizarro, who\n had amassed immense wealth, found-\n ed the city of Lima, where he built him-\n self a magnificent palace, and lived in\n great splendor. He was governor of\n the country, but his cruelty raised up\n</p>\n<p>\n His trial and execution 1 .3.

From this time, the whole of\n Peru, then including Bolivia, continued\n to be a Spanish province, ruled by a\n viceroy, appointed by the king of Spain.\n In 1747, Lima was destroyed by a ter-\n rible earthquake. It began about ten\n o\u2019clock at night with a sudden noise, and\n a frightful shaking of the earth. In\n three minutes the whole city was a\n heap of ruins. Houses, churches, pal-\n aces, were all tumbled to the ground,\n and 1300 persons were crushed to death\n beneath them. Callao experienced a\n still more dreadful fate. Of 4000 peo-\n ple in the town, 200 only escaped, and\n of twentythree vessels in the harbor,\n nineteen were swallowed up.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. While Colombia and Mexico\n were agitated by a revolution, Peru re-\n mained quiet. But in 1S21, Gen. San\n Martin raised an army of 6000 men,\n drove the royalist forces from Lima,\n and took possession of that city. The\n country was then declared independent.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. But after this, the people became\n dissatisfied with the change, and every-\n thing was thrown into confusion. The\n royalist forces returned to Lima, and\n for a time the spirit of liberty was put\n down. Soon after this, Bolivar march-\n ed into the interior from Colombia,\n with a considerable army, and drove\n the S])anish troops back into the coun-\n try. They were finally defeated by\n the patriots, under General \" Sucre, and\n from this time all resistance ceased. A\n constitution was now formed similar to\n that of Colombia, and in 1825 the new\n government went into operation.\n</p>\n<p>\n slain 1 5.

If we continue our travels to the\n south, from Peru, we shall soon reach\n Bolivia ; a coimtry remarkable for its\n great elevation, and for its fertile val-\n leys and plains. The great chain of\n the Andes passes through it from north\n to south, and here, as in other parts of\n South America, their peaks are cover-\n ed with perpetual snow. The country\n has rich mines of silver, though they\n are less productive than formerly.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Every new place presents some-\n thing interesting to a traveller, and in\n these regions, we shall constantly find\n objects to excite our attention. The\n lofty mountains, with peaks glittering\n in the sun, the deep valleys, the roaring\n waterfalls, the strange wild animals, and\n the singular people, will not fail to\n atibrd constant themes of amusement.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. We must be particular to visit j\n Potosi. It is now a decayed to^vn, but\n once contained 160,000 inhabitants.\n Tlie mines were then the richest in\n South America, and are said to have\n been discovered in a very singular\n manner. Soon after the country was\n conquered by the Spaniards, an Indian\n who was climbing the mountain in pur-\n suit of a deer, laid hold of a shrub\n which came up by the roots. To his\n great surprise, he saw a large mass of\n silver beneath where it grew. He told\n the secret to a friend of his, who dis-\n closed it to otliers.

It remained\n attached to Peru, until the year 1824.\n At that time, a patriot army under\n General Sucre defeated the royalists,\n and on the 6th of July, 1825, the coun-\n try was declared independent.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. In August of the same year, the\n Congress met, and adopted a constitu-\n tion, the plan of which was furnished\n by Bolivar.

If we\n are in search of adventures, we may\n visit the Araucanians, a tribe of In-\n</p>\n<p>\n dians, who inhabit the mountains in\n the southern part of Chili. They are\n a bold race of men, Avho love to be\n free, and the Spaniards have attempted\n in vain to conquer them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. About the year 1538, while Pi-\n zarro was engaged in the conquest of\n Peru, he sent one of his generals, and\n a small body of men, to subdue the In-\n dian tribes then living in Chili. This\n general, whose name was Almagro, was\n at first well received by the natives.\n But perceiving that the Spaniards only\n came to enslave them, they fought Al-\n magro and his army, and obliged them\n to quit the country.\n</p>\n<p>\n 0. In 1540, another army was sent\n to Chili, under Valdivia. He overcame\n all resistance, and founded a number of\n cities both at the north and south. In\n the year 1543, the chief of the Arauca-\n nians collected his warriors, and went\n against Valdivia, who was then at San-\n tiago. A fierce engagement followed,\n and the Spaniards were cut to pieces.\n Valdivia himself was taken and after-\n wards killed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. For more than a century after\n this, the Araucanians continued at in-\n tervals to annoy the Spanish settlements,\n and to this day they entertain a strong\n aversion to the wh4e people. From\n the conquest of Chili by Valdivia, to\n the year 1810, it was a Spanish province.\n At that date, revolutionary movements\n began. \u2014 After many vicissitudes, the\n independence of the country was secur-\n ed, by the decisive victory gained by\n San Martin over the royalists, in 1817.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8.

It is very probable that we shall\n meet with some jaguars, cougars and\n other wild animals on our journey.\n We shall also frequently see some la-\n zy, hateful looking birds called con-\n dors.

After leaving the mountains, we\n shall pass through some fertile districts,\n and at length reach the Pampas.

This part of America was first\n discovered by Juan Dios de Solis, in\n 1510. He entered the river La Plata,\n and sailed along the northern coast in\n a boat. Here he saw some Indians, I\n who seemed by their gestures to invite j\n him to land. Taking a part of his men!\n with him, he accordingly went ashore;\n but in a little while, the savages sur-\n rounded them, and killed and devoured\n them in sight of their companions in\n the boat, who found it impossible to\n render them any assistance.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. In 1520, Sebastian Cabot ex-\n plored the La Plata, and gave it its !\n name, which signifies the river of silver. I\n In the year 1535, Don Pedro de Men-j\n doza, came to the country with 2500\n Spaniards, and founded the city of Bue-\n nos Ayres. They found the country\n inhabited by many tribes of Indians,\n who brought them provisions, and at\n first treated them kindly. But they\n soon became hostile, attacked the city, |\n killed thirty of the settlers, and burnt\n almost all the houses.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. After this, the colonists were\n</p>\n<p>\n distressed by famine, and most of them\n died. The remainder left Buenos\n Ayres, and went to Assumption, which\n had already been founded. In a short\n time, more adventurers came from\n Spain. But the colony did not flourish\n till about the year 1540, when Don Al-\n varez became governor. He secured\n the friendship of the Indians, and con-\n j verted many of them to the Christian\n ! faith. Under his auspices, the colony\n flourished, and several towns were\n founded.\n</p>\n<p>\n 14. The story of the immense\n wealth found by Pizarro in Peru, had\n now been spread over all Europe, and\n everybody was inflamed with a desire\n to share in the golden harvest. Alva-\n rez determined to cross the country to\n Peru, though the distance was very\n great, and the wilderness filled with\n savages.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15. Accordingly, he set out with\n 300 men, and after meeting with strange\n adventures, he finally came to an In-\n dian town, consisting of 8000 houses.\n In the centre of it was a lofty tower of\n wood, containing a monstrous serpent,\n which the people worshipped. Alva-\n rez attacked this town, which he cap-\n tured ; destroyed the tower, and being\n unable to proceed farther; returned to\n the settlements on the La Plata.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1(). In the year 1586, some Jesuits\n came to the country, and undertook to\n convert the Indians. These men went\n fearlessly among the savages, followed\n them into the wilderness, and conducted\n with such a mixture of mildness and\n courage, as to gain their favor.

He landed on\n the coast, erected a cross under a spread-\n ing tree, and there performed the cath-\n olic ceremony of mass, amid bursts of\n music, and peals of cannon.

From this period the colony\n continued to flourish, and soon attract-\n ed the attention of the various govern-\n ments of Europe. The Dutch became\n eager to possess a part of the country,\n and made various attempts to eflect that!\n object. Butin 16(31, they relinquished\n their design, for eight tons of gold,\n which the king of Portugal gave them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. From this date, till the year\n 1806, the country remained in quiet\n possession of the king of Portugal.\n But at that time, Portugal being invaded\n by the French, the royal flimily left\n their country, and embarked for Brazil.\n In 1821, the King, John VI., returned\n to Lisbon, leaving the government in\n the charge of his son, Don Pedro. In\n 1823, Brazil became independent, and\n since that time has remained under\n the government of Don Pedro, who is\n still emperor.

The country along the coast i\n so low and flat, as to appear, when ap-\n proached from the water, like a forest\n growing out of the sea. Yet these low\n lands are exceedingly fertile, abound-\n ing with every variety of delicious fruit.\n The air is always mild and balmy, and\n at all seasons, the trees are adorned\n with the open blossom and the ripe\n fruit. The climate seems to present a\n delightful union of spring and summer.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The European settlers principal-\n ly live along the coast. The interior\n is inhabited by Indians, and has not\n been much explored. It api)ears to\n consist of hills and mountains, with\n valleys between, through which rivers\n flow to the sea. The country is cov-\n ered with woods ; and in some places\n the trees are so thick, and so woven\n together by creeping plants, as to form\n an impenetrable shade.

He left the\n town of Stabroek in 1812, and proceed-\n ed up the river Demarara in a boat, in\n a southerly direction.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. He soon passed the limits of the\n white population, and entered the coun-\n try of the Indians. The weather here\n is always hot, and these people go al-\n most naked. They live in small huts, and\n \u20acubsist chiefly upon birds and animals,\n which they kill in a very singular man-\n ner. They have a long tube, made of\n a reed ; into this they put an arrow,\n the sharp point of which is dipped in\n wourali poison. They then blow the\n arrow out with great force ; it flies\n through the air, and being well aimed,\n strikes the animal toward which it is\n directed. The poison is very active,\n and in a few minutes, the creature struck\n with the arrow, is dead. It is then\n taken and eaten, the flesh not being at\n all injured by the poison.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. I must tell you something now\n about this strange poison. It is made\n by these Indians from a vine found in\n the woods, called wourali. They mix\n</p>\n<p>\n Indian ehooling a poisoned Arrow at a Peccary.\n</p>\n<p>\n with this vine some other plants, the\n fangs of serpents, two kinds of poison-\n ous ants, and a good deal of pepper.\n These are all boiled together in water,\n</p>\n<p>\n and the liquor thus obtained, is the fa-\n mous wourali poison. The Indians\n prepare the mixture with magical cere-\n monies and solemn incantations. They\n appear to have a great deal of supersti-\n tion about it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Mr Watcrton met with abun-\n dance of peccaries, which are a kind of\n pig. He saw droves of two or three\n hundred. The Indians shoot a great\n many of them with their arrows, and\n find them excellent eating. He saw\n animals resembling tigers, whole troops\n of monkeys, armadillos, ant-bears, poi\n cupines, and a very singular animal\n called the sloth. This creature is only\n at home on the trees. If he happens\n to get upon the ground, he cries in a\n piteous manner, and appears to be as\n unhappy as a fish upon the land.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. Mr Waterton also saw alligators\n in the river, and flocks of parrots, par-\n roquets, and other birds among the\n trees. He also saw serpents called\n camoudies^ which are of monstrous size,\n and crush animals to death, by coiling\n around tlieir bodies. He met with\n many other serpents, some harmless,\n and some poisonous.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. Our traveller went a great many\n miles into the wilderness, and often\n slept at night upon the banks of the\n river. But myriads of fire-flies illu-\n mined the darkness, and birds and beasts\n filled the solitude with their strange\n voices. A multitude of owls screeched\n and hooted in the most doleful manner;\n whippoorwills repeated their songs ;\n and other birds kept chanting \u2018 \\V ' \u2019iily-\n come-go, \\Yilly-come-go \u2019 for hours to-\n gether.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10.

He first came to this island\n in 1492, immediately after discovering\n Cuba. He reached it in Dec. and call-\n ed it Hispaniola, a name which it re-\n tained for many years.

One day, as Columbus ^vas\n sailing along the coast, his vessel struck\n upon a rock, and began to go to pieces.\n The natives put off from the shore in\n their canoes, and carried all the Span-\n iards safely to the land. They then\n took out everything that was valuable\n from the ship, and carried it ashore.\n These articles were carefully guarded\n by the Cacique, who restored them to\n Columbus, and kindly endeavored to\n console him for his^ misfortune.

It originally contained\n</p>\n<p>\n 100.000 native Indians ; but in a short\n period, the whole race had ceased to\n exist. The greater part of them were\n killed, by their bloody invaders.

The West Indies have some-\n times been visited by earthquakes ; in\n tlie year 1692, a terrible earthquake\n happened in Jamaica. Distant hills\n were driven together ; mountains were\n divided, and failing into the valleys,\n overwhelmed the inhabitants.

When they .were\n discovered, the inhabitants were numer- 1\n ous \u2018as ants upon anthills.\u2019 It is supposed j\n that the whole number exceeded 3,000 ,- 1\n 000. They were a cheerful and happy\n people ; the fertile soil afforded them\n abundance of food, with very little labor ;\n and the climate was so mild, that\n houses covered with palm leaves we e\n a sufficient shelter.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Thus placed beyond the reach of\n want and care, they spent much of\n their time in amusement. They often !\n g\u2019lided forth in their canoes upon the\n waters that surrounded their green j\n islands, and at night, in the breath of I\n the cool sea breezes, they collected upon I\n the lawns, and slopes, and spent their;\n time in dancing. Sometimes 50,000 ;\n were assembled, the greater part of\n whom, were engaged in this pastime.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The peoj)le were governed by\n</p>\n<p>\n 1.

When one\n of these died, it was the custom of the\n people to preserve the body by baking\n it in an oven. They believed in a fu-\n ture state of rewards and punishments ;\n and it is said, that an old man of Cuba\n addressed Columbus, on his arrival\n there, in the following words : \u2018We\n know not whether you are men, or\n beings of a superior order. You have\n come with a force that we cannot re-\n sist, and have therefore only to submit.\n But if you are men, you must be aware\n that after this life, there is another, in\n which good and bad men are rewarded\n according to their works.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. These people supposed that after\n death, the spirits of the good were con-\n veyed to a pleasant valley, called Coya-\n ba, a place of ease and tranquillity,\n abounding in delicious fruits, cool\n shades, and murmuring rivulets; a coun-\n try where thirst never raged, and the\n hurricane was unknown. Here they\n believed they should enjoy the com-\n pany of their friends and forefathers,\n and thus live in eternal bliss.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Such Mmre the inhabitants ot\n these four islands, whom the Spaniards\n thought fit to exterminate by fire and\n sword. I should be glad to spare my\n young readers the pain of listening to\n the cruelties practised on these gentle\n islanders. But the facts are before the\n world, and they cannot be disguised.\n After they got possession of the islands,\n they made slaves of many of the natives,\n and compelled them to work in the\n mines.

These\n Catholics were far from believing such\n things contrary to their religion ; ma-\n ny of them took vows to destroy a cer-\n tain number every day, in honor of\n Christ, and the twelve apostles. So\n thoroughly was this work of destruction\n executed, that in a few years after their\n discovery, all the natives of these islands\n were swept away, and for many years\n not a vestige of them has remained.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. So far indeed as this portion of\n the West Indies is concerned, it would\n have been better if the discovery of\n Columbus had never been made. The\n 3,0d0,0J0 of native Indians undoubtedly\n enjoyed a greater amount of happi-\n ness, than the much smaller number of\n individuals who at present inhabit it,\n the greater part of whom are slaves.\n Beside, these islands have been, since\n their discovery, the constant theatres\n of wickedness and crime.

I will now tell you of the Baha-\n ma Islands. These are about 100 in\n nmnber; but the greater part of them\n are small, barren, and uninhabited.\n I ' hose of most importance are Bahama,\n Abaco and Providence. The Bahamas\n belong to the English, and contain\n about 14,000 people, 1 1,000 of whom are\n negroes. The exports are dye w\u2019oods,\n cotton, salt, and liv^e turtles.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. One of these islands, now called Cat i\n</p>\n<p>\n Island, was the first land discovered by\n Columbus. It was inhabited by Indians,\n vyho called it Guanahani ; but he called\n it St Salvador. The Spaniards made\n some settlements upon the Bahamas,\n but in 1672, they were entirely unin-\n habited. At that time Providence was\n taken possession of by the British, and\n a regular settlement made by them in\n 1720. Since that time, they have re-\n mained in their possession.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. The group of islands, lying to the\n south east of Cuba, are called the Carib-\n bee Islands. The most important are\n Antigua, Dominica, Trinidad, Tobago,\n and Barbadoes, belonging to Great\n Britain ; and Guadaloupe, and Martini-\n co belonging to France. These are in\n general level and very fertile; they\n produce a great deal of sugar, coffee, rum,\n indigo, and cotton. A multitude of ves-\n sels are constantly employed in carry-\n ing on the trade between these islands,\n and the rest of the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. Several of these islands were\n discovered by Columbus on his second\n voyage, in 1494. Some of them were\n settled by the Spanish, some by the\n French, and some by the English. They\n have frequently changed masters, hav-\n ing been sometimes subject to one gov-\n ernment, and sometimes to another. It\n would be tedious to tell you of all these\n things ; but I must give you some ac-\n count of the Caribs, the native Indians,\n found here on the discovery of the\n islands.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12.

LXXXI.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE BUCCANEERS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. The history of the West Indies\n would be incomplete if it did not in-\n clude an account of a very extraordina-\n ry set of men, called Buccaneers, who\n lived by robbery upon the land and\n sea, between the year 1630 and 1700.\n They at first inhabited the island of\n Tortuga and a part of Hispaniola.\n Some remained at home to cultivate the\n land, and hunt wild animals; while the\n rest put to sea, and captured such ves-\n sels as they fell in with.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The origin of this strange society\n was this. When the other nations of\n Europe found that the Spaniards were\n getting immense quantities of gold and\n silver in America, they all became\n anxious to sliare in the rich harvest.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. Buccaneers ' ? What islands did the Bucca-\n neers at first inhabit \" I What did they do \" ? 2.\n</p>\n<p>\n The English, French, Dutch, and Por-\n tuguese sent out expeditions to the\n New World, as it was called, for the\n purpose of making discoveries, founding\n colonies, and getting quantities of the\n precious metals.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The Spaniards thought that all\n America belonged to them, because\n Columbus had first discovered and\n taken possession of it, in the name of\n their king. Accordingly, they looked\n with an evil eye upon all the expedi-\n tions sent by other nations : they cap-\n tured their vessels, murdered tlie set-\n tlers, and visited with fire and slaugh-\n ter, all who sought to share in the\n spoil.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Well! Some French people had\n settled in the little island of St Chris-\n tophers, and the colony was advancing\n rapidly, when the Spaniards came up-\n on them, killed a great many of the\n men, and drove the rest away. Burn-\n ing with revenge, those who escaped\n entered some Dutch vessels which\n were cruising against the Spaniards.\n These were very successful, and loaded\n their ships with gold and silver, which\n they took from Spanish ships.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Some merchants in France heard\n of all this, and determined to make a\n regular business of cruising against\n \u2018he Spaniards. Accordingly, they sent\n out a number of people for this pur-\n pose, who established themselves at\n Tortuga and Hispaniola, as I have\n mentioned before. This took place\n about the year 1632. They were call-\n ed Buccaneers, because they roasted\n animals for food in the same manner\n that the Indians of the Caribbee Islands\n roasted their prisoners ; a process which\n the latter called houcaner.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6 For near fifty years, these Bur.\n cane(\u2018rs continued to live upon the\n</p>\n<p>\n Origin of the buccaneers 1 5.

You must\n know that at this time there were no\n large ships, and people were not accus-\n tomed to sail out fearlessly upon the\n broad ocean as now;, nobody had ever\n crossed the great Atlantic, and the peo-\n ple of Europe, who had only sailed\n timidly along the shores, did not know\n that such a country as America existed,\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. The shape of the earth was at this\n time unknown ; some persons supposed\n it flat, but nobody knew that it was\n round. But the art of navigation was\n rapidly advancing; the seamen were\n venturing farther into the deep, and an\n ardent desire to explore the unknown\n ocean was kindled. This curiosity had\n been greatly stimulated by the discove-\n ry, by the Portuguese, of Madeira and\n Porto Santa, lying to the northwest of\n Africa. It was at this point of time,\n that Columbus reached Lisbon, where\n he soon after married the daughter of a\n celebrated navigator, who was one of\n the discoverers of the islands above\n mentioned.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. His imagination was captivated\n with the idea of seeing these places, and\n accordingly he went there. For seve-\n ral years, after this, he was engaged in\n carrying on a profitable trade from Ma-\n deira to the coast of Africa, the Azores,\n and Canaries. But during all this time,\n his mind was active and increasing in\n knowledge.

By the same route goods were\n returned to Europe.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. This method of conducting com-\n merce, was expensive and tedious ; the\n people therefore were very anxious to\n find some way of going to India by sea.\n This great subject occupied the atten-\n tion of all Europe, and Columbus, in\n particular, dwelt upon it with the most\n intense interest. He studied books, he\n consulted maps, and often while his\n little vessel was ploughing the sea, he\n would revolve in his mind all the facts\n which he had collected, relating to it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. At night, when the stars shone\n down upon his ship, floating like a\n speck on the bosom of the mighty\n ocean, he looked up, and mused with\n curious wonder upon the heavenly\n bodies. From these contemplations,\n his mind descended to the earth, and\n strove to solve the mysteries that invol-\n ved it. Was it a vast plain, stretching\n out to a boundless extent ? Or was it a\n globe, swung in the heavens, and re-\n volving like a planet around the sun?\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. After a great deal of reflection,\n Columbus adopted this latter idea, and\n applying it to the question of reaching\n India by water, he concluded, that if he\n sailed across the Atlantic in a westerly\n direction, he should at length come to\n</p>\n<p>\n years 1 9.

Full of this notion, he\n went to a learned physician in Florence,\n and consulted him upon the subject.\n This man perceived the force of his\n reasoning, and believing his views to\n be right, exhorted him to make a voyage\n for the purpose of ascertaining the fact.\n Strengthened by this counsel, Colum-\n bus resolved to enter upon his grand\n scheme, of sailing westward upon the\n Atlantic, to discover what might lie be-\n yond it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13. He immediately offered his plan\n to the government of Genoa, with a re-\n quest that they would fit out a small\n fleet, in which he might make the desir-\n ed voyage.

They soon lost sight of\n land, and nothing could be seen but the\n skies above, and the level water spread\n out around them. Th./ were going\n where no human being had ever been;\n they knew not what was before them.\n A solemn mystery hung over the sea,\n and as they advanced in their voyage,\n they could not tell what dangers they\n might meet with.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15.

To a bold man, like Columbus,\n these things rendered the voyage in\n the highest degree interesting. But\n most of the sailors were ignorant and\n superstitious, and they began soon to\n be very much afraid. But Columbus\n reasoned with them, and persuaded them\n to continue the voyage.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Thus they proceeded for several\n weeks, constantly sailing in a westerly\n direction ; but Columbus had great dif-\n ficulty with his men. They were ex-\n ceedingly alarmed at the idea of being\n at such a vast distance from home,\n upon the bosom of the sea ; and he was\n obliged to use various arts to prevent\n their setting out to return. At length,\n their fears were so much excited, that\n both officers and men, on board the three\n vessels, positively refused to go any\n farther. They even thought of throw-\n ing Columbus overboard, and perhaps\n they would have executed this design,\n if he had not found means to pacify\n them. He proposed that they should go\n on for three days more, and if, by that\n time, they did not discover land, he\n promised to return. This was deemed\n a reasonable proposition, and they all\n agreed to it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Accordingly they proceeded, and\n very soon they met with floating sea-\n weed, and saw birds in the air. Some\n of these appeared to be weary, and set-\n tled upon the masts of the vessels.\n Here they remained all night, but in\n the morning they departed, and flew to\n the west. All these things made the\n sailors believe that land was near; and\n their hopes and expectations were soon\n raised to the highest pitch.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.

LXXXIV.\n</p>\n<p>\n GENERAL VIEW OF AMERICA.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. It is now time for us to return to our native coun-\n try. We have taken a survey of Uie several nations of\n America, yet we have seen no place so aiireeahle as our\n own Inune. In Uie United ii^tates, the peope are certain-\n ly happier than in any oti.er part of this V\\ estern Hem-\n isphere. Tliey are nioie iMteIli,etit, have more liberty,\n possess more oftiie comforts of life, and are more virtu-\n ous than in any of the conni lies we have seen.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. liefore we part, I wish to direct your attention to a\n</p>\n<p>\n few interesting topics. If you wKl look at tlie frontis-\n piece of this hook, y* u will see a picture which repre-\n sents one half of the glohe. The greater part of its .sur-\n face iscovere * > v A ater, upv* ' vessels are sa ling\n</p>\n<p>\n in various directions. In the middle you will ohserve\n tlie Continent of Ameiica. Its lenglh from Melville\n Inland to Cape Horn, is near OuGO milei, and if contains\n About 15.,000,U00 of square milei=!. 1 he tinited States i c-\n cupy more tiian one eighth part ilie whole America\n occufiies one tentJi p^d ' f Min ? if f y\u2019obe, and\n nearly one third i a. 1 all iUo .ivod on tne globe.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3 M ' his C4.^nrine2Ui3 reniaikable for its lakes, ifsrivei-s\n and ils nioiintains. Lake Supeii.*r is the large-t lake of\n fresh water in the world. The St, Lawrence, the Mis-\n nssippijthe Orinoco, ihe Ania/,on, and tlie Ua Plata, are\n ill of them mighty rivers, and several of them surpass\n ill the rivers of the Eastern Continent. I\u2019he Amazmi\n ilone, with its brandies, spreads over a country equal to\n Euroiie in extent. .\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. The Andes, with the Cordillei-as and Rocky\n Mountains, constitute tlie longest chain of mountains in\n he universe^ being neaily 11,0)0 miles in length, incln-\n ling its windings. Many of tlieir tops are gl ttering\n .vith mantles of snow; s une of them pour forth torrents\n if fire and melted lava ; and d ep in their bowels are\n hunense treasures of Id, silver an I other metals. Ihe\n lopulaiion of America is small, Compared wi h its exli-nt;\n [ suppose it is not more ih ni ' 10,000, 00. ' i ' hese are but\n about onetvventieth p irt < \u00bbf the inhabitants on tlieg\u2019obe;\n the empire of Hus ia aime, conta n-as muiy people;\n and Great Britain has more than half as many.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. It is not 350 ^eiirs since the pe pie of Europe,\n Asia and Africa, were totally ignorant of the existence\n of tiiis vast Continent, Vet Hie lakes, the mountains,\n the rivers, and the plains had existed for ages. O ' lie sun\n had shone upon them by day, and the moon by niiiht;\n summer bail visited the land witji dowers and fruits, and\n winter had covered it with siunv. The earthquake had\n shaken the hills, and tlie whirlwind had rent the forest;\n and all the great works of natnie had gone on from the\n Creation, tliongli man was not there to witness them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. At what lime, or from wiiat quarter, the Indians\n came to America it is impossible to tell. It is ireneraliy\n supposed, that two or thrive thousand years atm, .some\n small tribes came from the nortli of Asia across Biierinii\u2019s\n Straits, and thus gradually peopled the whole continent.\n</p>\n<p>\n But this is mere conjecture; and their entire history from\n their first arrival in the country, down to the dii^very\n of America is involved in mystery.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. In various parts of the country, there are mounds\n evidently raised by men many bundled years ago. It\n</p>\n<p>\n I is certain they were not constructed by the wandering\n tribes who inhabited the country wdien onr forefathers\n came here; but who raised tliem, how long they have\n existed, and what is their story, we cannot tell. It is\n proliable that great events have hajipened \u2014 that empires\n have risen, fioun > hed and gone to decay, \u2014 during the\n many ages over whicJi time has thrown an everlastmg\n oblivion, *\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. It appears that whole races of animals have\n lived in America, of wliicli nothing remains but their\n bones. The gigantic Mastodon whicii was four times as\n large as an Elephant, once roamed in great numbers,\n through tlie forests, and other animals, as well as trees\n and plants now unknown, were common in the country.\n VVe must recollect, that from the creation, to the year\n 1492, a period of inoie iJian 5090 years, all that took\n place upon th s vast continent is hidden from the view,\n and only known to that Being who made it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. Vi*u will recollect from the. account I have given\n you, that tl:e Spaniards were not only the first discover-\n ers of America, Imt that they first planted colonies here.\n The Pope grantv d to tfem all lands they might discover\n in the new cemtinent, and liy virtue cT this grant, they\n loc k possession of whatever they wanted. Either dis-\n regarding the rights of the Indians, or supposing they\n had none, they made war upon them, slew ' them by\n millions, reduced the survivors to slaveiy, took posses-\n sion of their lands, sell led upon them, and claimed them\n as their own. In this way Mexico, Guatiniala, Colom-\n bia, Peru, Bc.livia, ( hili, the United Provinces and sev-\n eral of the IVest India islands were subdued and peo-\n pled by tlie Spaniards; in all these cemutries, the Spanish\n language is now ' chiefly spt.ken, and the manners anti\n customs efthe people resemble those of Spain.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. Brazil, you will recollect, was settled by the Por-\n</p>\n<p>\n tuguese, who conducted toward the natives nearly in\n the same way, as the Spaniards had done. The com-\n mon language in Brazil, is Portuguese, ami the customs\n of the people are sitndar to those of Portugal. The\n Catliolic religion prevails througliout all the countries\n settled by the Spaniaids and Pmtuiuese, and here there\n aie mnltitmles of negro slaves heloi.ging to the white\n peojile, and many Indians, who cuU^aje the land and\n submit to the government. #\n</p>\n<p>\n 11. It was about lUO years after the Spaniards had\n</p>\n<p>\n estaiilished colonies in Ameiira\u2019 that the Englisli began\n to make settlements In re. These weie made by pri-\n vate adventurers on their own account, and not hy the\n aid or authority of the government, as was the case Wiili\n the Spanish colonies, English (adonists did not\n</p>\n<p>\n proceed to conquer the savages; on the contrary, they\n bought their lands, made treaties with them, and never\n presumed to make war upm tfem, hut for the jiurpose\n of self defence. It is remarkable however, that the na\n lives always disappeared as the English settlements ad-\n vanced ; uliile in the Spanish and Poitugnese colonies,\n tlie white people intemiairied witli tl cm and tlie two\n races thus became mixed. Many of the Indians too, re-\n mained, and adtipied the habits of civilised life.\n</p>\n<p>\n 12. The Frem h were less enterprising, than either\n</p>\n<p>\n the English, Poitugnese, or Spanisli. ' J ' lieir settlements\n were begun at a late date, and were chiefly confined to\n tJie b rdets of the 8t. Lawrence, the Gieat Lakes, and\n the Mississippi. Mo < t of tiiese th^ were com|ielIed to\n relinquish to the English, in 1763. Britain lost the\n</p>\n<p>\n best of her American cohuiies twent^ears after; and\n ?pain and Portugal within the last twentv years, have\n parted with all their territories on this Continent.\n</p>\n<p>\n many voyages did CoIuii\u00bbbu\u00ab make ?
