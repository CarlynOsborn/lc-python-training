experience,\n and believing the perusal of her written thoughts\n would be a satisfaction to her friends and perhaps\n unto others, and the experience of her life prove\n beneficial to many minds, I have prepared this lit-\n tle volume, composed of extracts from her diary\n and correspondence. From her eleventh year she\n kept a record of her daily life, \u2014 noting down the\n deep thoughts of her heart. Her outward exist-\n ence had in it but little variety, being from early\n years much afflicted : she seldom went from home,\n and was deprived of many of the enjoyments of\n youth. Perhaps it was the hand of affliction that\n so purified her spirit and directed her thoughts to\n Divine things.

One thing he spoke of last night\n concerning futurity I was thankful to hear: he\n said he held Universalist opinions, I think, partly,\n \u2014 that, as we believed God to be all goodness, a\n merciful and gracious being, and making us liable\n to sin, it seemed unreasonable to believe He would\n punish us indefinitely for a finite deed after suffer-\n ing for it all our natural life, as we do for sinful-\n ness, and much more that I cannot write (I think\n I never heard any one except H. J. Hallock ex-\n press such views), and said he thought these were\n the views of Friends, but I never gathered it from\n any of their writings or ministry. This has puz-\n zled and perplexed me much, but, believing in God\n as I do, I am willing to leave such subjects trust-\n ingly to Him, and, as so much is made clear that\n I am convinced it is my duty to attend unto, in\n His own good time, perhaps, more will be made\n plain.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ar:yl:et:te:rs:of:ph:00:ir:is:diarylettersofph00iris:diarylettersofph00iris_0142/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 229, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 375}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ar:yl:et:te:rs:of:ph:00:ir:is:diarylettersofph00iris:diarylettersofph00iris_0142/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 459, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 751}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ar:yl:et:te:rs:of:ph:00:ir:is:diarylettersofph00iris:diarylettersofph00iris_0142/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 918, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1502}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ar:yl:et:te:rs:of:ph:00:ir:is:diarylettersofph00iris:diarylettersofph00iris_0142/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1836, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3005}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ar:yl:et:te:rs:of:ph:00:ir:is:diarylettersofph00iris:diarylettersofph00iris_0142/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/di/ar/yl/et/te/rs/of/ph/00/ir/is/diarylettersofph00iris/diarylettersofph00iris_0142.jp2", "height": 3005, "width": 1836, "levels": 6, "size": 354599}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"142\">\n<p>\n 132\n</p>\n<p>\n DIARY AND LETTERS OF\n</p>\n<p>\n Fourth month 28th . \u2014 I greatly desire that no-\n thing may draw me astray \u201c through philosophy\n and vain deceit, after the traditions of men, after\n the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ.\u201d\n (See Col. ii. 8.)
