The judicious and worthy author of\n the following excellent Lectures, has expressed an\n Opinion that the consecration of one day in seven to\n rest from bodily labor, and to the service of God,\n may be traced back very distinctly to the close of\n the work of creation. The reasons which he offers\n in support of this opinion will not here be repeated.\n They will probably be deemed sufficiently solid by\n most readers. From the moment there was a man\n upon the earth, it seems to have been the will of God\n that a seventh part of time should be consecrated to\n his service. It is quite certain that much, very much,\n is made of the Sabbath throughout the whole of the\n Old Testament, and, especially, that the Prophets,\n in all their reflections on the melancholy past, and\n .n all their anticipations of the portentous future,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:nu:al:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ag:ne:_0:manualonchristia00agne_0:manualonchristia00agne_0_0010/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 352}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:nu:al:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ag:ne:_0:manualonchristia00agne_0:manualonchristia00agne_0_0010/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 409, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 705}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:nu:al:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ag:ne:_0:manualonchristia00agne_0:manualonchristia00agne_0_0010/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 818, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1411}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:nu:al:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ag:ne:_0:manualonchristia00agne_0:manualonchristia00agne_0_0010/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1636, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2822}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:nu:al:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ag:ne:_0:manualonchristia00agne_0:manualonchristia00agne_0_0010/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ma/nu/al/on/ch/ri/st/ia/00/ag/ne/_0/manualonchristia00agne_0/manualonchristia00agne_0_0010.jp2", "height": 2822, "width": 1636, "levels": 6, "size": 303172}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"10\">\n<p>\n iv INTRODUCTORY ESSAY.\n</p>\n<p>\n represent the sanctification of the Sabbath as lying\n at the foundation of all temporal as well as spiritual\n prosperity, and the neglect of this divine institution\n as most certainly drawing down the destroying judg\u00ac\n ments of God on those who indulged it.

And when\n they were called to distinguish between this day\n and the Jewish Sabbath, which they also kept, but\n with less solemnity, they called it by any of the\n names before mentioned, but more commonly than\n otherwise by that of the \u201c Lord\u2019s-day.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:nu:al:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ag:ne:_0:manualonchristia00agne_0:manualonchristia00agne_0_0052/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 352}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:nu:al:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ag:ne:_0:manualonchristia00agne_0:manualonchristia00agne_0_0052/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 409, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 705}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:nu:al:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ag:ne:_0:manualonchristia00agne_0:manualonchristia00agne_0_0052/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 818, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1411}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:nu:al:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ag:ne:_0:manualonchristia00agne_0:manualonchristia00agne_0_0052/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1636, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2822}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:nu:al:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ag:ne:_0:manualonchristia00agne_0:manualonchristia00agne_0_0052/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ma/nu/al/on/ch/ri/st/ia/00/ag/ne/_0/manualonchristia00agne_0/manualonchristia00agne_0_0052.jp2", "height": 2822, "width": 1636, "levels": 6, "size": 307159}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"52\">\n<p>\n Xlvi INTRODUCTORY ESSAY.\n</p>\n<p>\n If it be asked what title ought to be given to this\n season gf sacred rest, by us, at the present day, I\n answer, the name is of small importance, provided\n it be distinctly understood.

Some contending\n that its origin is to be dated from the time when the\n manna was given to the children of Israel from\n heaven, which they were forbidden to gather on the\n seventh day. Others find its origin recorded in the\n second chapter of Genesis, and date its institution\n from the cessation of God\u2019s work in creating the\n heavens and the earth.

What is understood by the Lord\u2019s Supper ?\n Is it not that he has consecrated it as a memorial of\n his death, has sanctified it, or set it apart from a\n common to a sacred purpose ? Then the Lord\u2019s-day\n is so, because he hath consecrated it to be a memo\u00ac\n rial of his resting from his new creation, of his\n accomplishment of a work, which more than any\n other will to all eternity magnify the perfections ot*\n Jehovah.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:nu:al:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ag:ne:_0:manualonchristia00agne_0:manualonchristia00agne_0_0115/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 352}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:nu:al:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ag:ne:_0:manualonchristia00agne_0:manualonchristia00agne_0_0115/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 409, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 705}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:nu:al:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ag:ne:_0:manualonchristia00agne_0:manualonchristia00agne_0_0115/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 818, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1411}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:nu:al:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ag:ne:_0:manualonchristia00agne_0:manualonchristia00agne_0_0115/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1636, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2822}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:nu:al:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ag:ne:_0:manualonchristia00agne_0:manualonchristia00agne_0_0115/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ma/nu/al/on/ch/ri/st/ia/00/ag/ne/_0/manualonchristia00agne_0/manualonchristia00agne_0_0115.jp2", "height": 2822, "width": 1636, "levels": 6, "size": 302332}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"115\">\n<p>\n CHANGE OF DAY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 109\n</p>\n<p>\n On this day, as the ancient Fathers of the first\n and second centuries testify,* the Christian church\n kept their Sabbath, and attended to those private\n meditations, and public observances which belonged\n to it as a holy rest.

The abuses are chiefly\n manifested in labor and dissipation. The use, medi\u00ac\n cally speaking, is that of a day of rest. In a\n theological sense, it is a holy rest, providing for the\n introduction of new and sublimer ideas into the\n mind of man, preparing him for his future state.\n As a day of rest, I view it as a day of compensation\n for the inadequate restorative power of the body '\n under continued labor and excitement. A physician\n always has respect to the preservation of the restora\u00ac\n tive power, because if once this be lost, his healing\n office is at an end. If I show you, from the phy\u00ac\n siological view of the question, that there are provi\u00ac\n sions in the laws of nature which correspond with\n the Divine commandment, you will see from the\n analogy, that \u201c the Sabbath was made for man,\u201d as\n a necessary appointment. A physician is anxious\n to preserve the balance of circulation, as necessary\n to the restorative power of the body. The ordinary\n exertions of man run down the circulation every\n day of his life; and the first general law of nature\n by which God (who is not only the giver, but also\n the preserver and sustainer of life) prevents man\n from destroying himself, is the alternating of day\n with night, that repose may succeed action. But\n although the night apparently equalizes the cir\u00ac\n culation well, yet it does not sufficiently restore its\n balance for the attainment of a long life. Hence\n one day in seven, by the bounty of Providence, is\n thrown in as a day of compensation, to perfect by\n its repose the animal system.

I find this was by no means the case; in\n reality, the change was so gradual, and in some\n respects so imperfect, that at so late a period as the\n year 1574, about three years after the death of\n Knox, the practice of performing comedies on the\n Sabbath had not been altogether discontinued, and\n it was occasionally allowed to proceed, under the\n countenance and approbation of some of those\n Church Courts that might have been expected to be\n the most rigid in refusing to allow any encroachment\n on the sanctity of the Lord\u2019s day.

But\n on this head I must observe, that this decreasing at\u00ac\n tention must not always be considered as having been\n the fault of the ministers. It was found that persons\n of higher station, in many districts of the country,\n were often of a different creed from the established\n church, and therefore they were not so accessible to\n the ministers as their predecessors had generally\n been in former times; at the same time many of the\n laboring classes in populous districts had seceded\n from the church, not only in consequence of dissat\u00ac\n isfaction with the ministrations of the established\n clergy, or in consequence of a conviction that the\n church had degenerated, but very much because they\n had not sufficient accommodation in the parish\n churches, a circumstance to which I shall advert un\u00ac\n der another head. When so great a proportion both\n of the higher and of the lower ranks, ceased to be\n members of the establishment, it is natural to sup\u00ac\n pose that the visits of the ministers, though not al\u00ac\n together discontinued, would be less efficacious. I\n may add, that at about the period to which I refer,\n a great change took place in the distribution of\n the population of Scotland, partly in consequence\n of the enlargement of farms, and partly from the\n introduction of machinery both in the operations of\n agriculture and the other arts. In connexion with\n this, I beg to advert to the neglect, as I must con\u00ac\n sider it, of the government of the country, to pro\u00ac\n vide sufficient accommodation in churches for the\n rapidly increasing population, and also to provide\n adequately for the education of the poor.

Not having antici\u00ac\n pated any inquiries on this subject, I cannot be very\n exact in point of dates; but in looking lately at the\n Acts of the General Assembly, about the year 1759,\n I noticed that there had been strong remonstrances\n against the travelling of the post in Scotland, when\n it was first introduced; and I have also learnt from\n some of the magazines, that petitions against that\n innovation were sent to government from many\n places, and particularly from Glasgow, the greatest\n commercial town in Scotland.

The sound is from the first moment a ve\u00ac\n hicle of important truth. Good principles are thus\n associated with the very dawn of tuition. With chil\u00ac\n dren who are thus taught, reading is not merely the\n preparation for acquiring future instruction through\n the medium of letters, it is all along the direct means\n of communicating sound and saving instruction, with\u00ac\n out any alloy of error.
