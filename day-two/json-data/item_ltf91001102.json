constant use that they may\n be said to form the primary stock-in-trade of every con-\n juror. These are \u2014 a short wand, a specially adapted\n table, and certain secret pockets in the magician\u2019s dress.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE MAGIC WAND.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is a light rod, twelve to fifteen inches in length,\n and about three-quarters of an inch in diameter. To the\n uninitiated its use may appear a mere affectation, but\n such is by no means the case. Apart from the prestige de-\n rived from the traditional properties of the wand, it\n affords a plausible pretext for many necessary move-\n ments, which would otherwise appear awkward and un-\n natural. Thus, if the performer desires to hold anything\n concealed in his hand, by holding the wand in the same\n hand he is able to keep it closed without exciting sus-\n picion. If it is necessary, as frequently happens, to turn\n his back upon the audience for an instant, the momentary\n turn to the table, in order to take up or lay down the\n wand, affords the required opportunity.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE MAGICIAN ' S TABLE.\n</p>\n<p>\n The first necessity of the amateur aspiring to amuse\n his friends with a pre-arranged seance , is a proper table.\n The table necessary for an average drawing-room exhibi-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0006/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 426}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0006/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 852}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0006/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1704}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0006/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3409}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0006/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ma/gi/ci/an/sb/oo/ko/fc/00/un/se/magiciansbookofc00unse/magiciansbookofc00unse_0006.jp2", "height": 3409, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 598610}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"6\">\n<p>\n 2\n</p>\n<p>\n INTRODUCTION.\n</p>\n<p>\n tion differs from an ordinary table in two points only: its\n height, which is about six inches greater than usual ; and\n the addition of a hidden shelf or ledge at the back.

You do not know, until the domino is turned\n up, what that number actually was, but you must by no\n means let the audience suspect this. You must boldly\n assume to know the number, and from that knowledge,\n aided by some clairvoyant faculty, to have selected a\n domino whose points shall represent that number. Thus,\n having selected the proper domino, you call upon the\n audience to state the number moved, after which the\n turning up of the selected domino is regarded by the\n audience merely as a proof that you were correct in the\n previous knowledge for which they, without the smallest\n foundation, give you credit. After this domino has been\n turned up, it is easy, knowing the original order of the\n thirteen of which it forms one, to name two or three on\n either side of it. In most instances you will only know\n the total figure of a given domino, as two or three differ-\n ent combination of points will give the same total.

Being accustomed to\n use balls of a larger size than those above described, and\n therefore too bulky to palm\n by the first method, he used\n to hold them by means of a\n slight contraction of the little\n finger.

If ac-\n cording to the first or third method, the ball is simply\n rolled back to the finger-tips with the ball of the thumb,\n exactly reversing the process by which it was palmed.\n But if the ball was palmed by the second method, it is,\n for the time being, not get-at-able by the ball of the\n thumb. In this case, the first step is to close the third\n and fourth fingers upon\n the ball (see Fig. 8),\n and therewith roll it to\n the position shown in\n Fig. 7, when the thumb\n is enabled to reach it,\n and to roll it to the\n finger-tips in the manner\n just described.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

This should be done with the hand spread almost\n flat upon the table, and grasping the cup, as low down\n as possible, between the thumb and the lowest joint of\n the forefinger.

Now I maintain, on the contrary, that any object\n may be in several places at the same moment, and that it\n is equally possible that it may be nowhere at all.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c I must beg you to observe, in the first place, that I\n have nothing in my hands \u2014 except my fingers ; and that\n between my fingers there is nothing save a few atoms of\n the mysterious fluid which we call the atmosphere, and\n through which our jolly old Earth spins so merrily along.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0023/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 422}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0023/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 844}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0023/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1688}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0023/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3376}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0023/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ma/gi/ci/an/sb/oo/ko/fc/00/un/se/magiciansbookofc00unse/magiciansbookofc00unse_0023.jp2", "height": 3376, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 514780}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"23\">\n<p>\n THE CUPS AND BALLS .\n</p>\n<p>\n 19\n</p>\n<p>\n But we must leave the common-place regions of astron-\n omy, and return to the mysteries of hermetic science.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c I have before me, as you will have noticed, three little\n cups or goblets.

If this is done\n neatly, the eyes of the spectators will instinctively travel\n in the same direction, and the effect to them will be as if\n the ball vanished at the highest point of its upward flight,\n instead of disappearing, as it really does, at the moment\n of reaching the hands in its fall.

Thus, if the shell be\n black, you must be provided with a solid ball of the same\n color, and two red balls.

Borrowed\n hats have been used in the course of many of the tricks\n already described, but the part played by the hat has been\n of an incidental and subordinate character. In the tricks\n next following the hat is the principal article employed.\n</p>\n<p>\n The majority of hat tricks are different modifications of\n the same broad idea, viz., the production from a borrowed\n and apparently empty hat of various articles, in size and\n number much exceeding what any hat could in the natural\n way contain. One of the best is that of\n</p>\n<p>\n The Cannon-balls in the Hat. \u2014 The earliest and\n simplest form of this trick is limited to the production of\n a solid wooden globe, blacked to resemble a cannon-ball.\n The introduction of the ball into the hat is effected as\n follows : \u2014 The ball, which has a hole of about two inches\n in depth by one in diameter bored in it towards its center,\n is placed on the servante of the performer\u2019s table in such\n manner that the hole, above-mentioned shall slant upwards\n and outwards, at an angle of about 45\u00b0. To keep the ball\n steady, and to prevent its rolling off, some performers\n have a slight circular hollow scooped in the surface of the\n servante itself. A more convenient plan, however, is to\n use an india-rubber ring (such as is given to infants teeth-\n ing). This may be placed on any part of the servante,\n and makes a capital rest or bed for the ball. A bit of half-\n inch rope, with the ends joined so as to form a ring, will\n answer the same purpose.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the performer desires to introduce the ball into\n the hat, which we will suppose to have been borrowed\n for the purpose of some previous trick just completed, he\n takes the hat with his thumb outside and his fingers inside\n the brim, and holds it up with its mouth towards the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0049/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 422}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0049/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 844}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0049/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1688}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0049/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3376}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0049/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ma/gi/ci/an/sb/oo/ko/fc/00/un/se/magiciansbookofc00unse/magiciansbookofc00unse_0049.jp2", "height": 3376, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 631225}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"49\">\n<p>\n CANNON-BALLS FROM A HAT .\n</p>\n<p>\n 45\n</p>\n<p>\n spectators, so as to show indirectly that it is empty\n ( see Fig. 19).

In the larger end of the latter\n is placed a hot cake or pudding, and in this\n condition it is placed on the servante of the\n table, projecting a little over the edge. The\n performer borrows a hat, and in passing\n behind his table, tips cake and tin together\n into it. The chances are that the tin will\n fall small end upwards (the opposite end\n being the heaviest) ; but if not, the per-\n former turns the tin, so as to bring it into\n that position. Placing the hat mouth up-\n wards upon the table, he announces his intention of mak-\n ing a cake in it ; for which purpose he takes, one by one,\n and mixes in the tin b , a quantity of flour, raisins, eggs,\n sugar, and the other ingredients for a cake, adding water\n enough to make the mixture into a thick batter. This he\n pours into the hat, holding the tin with both hands, at\n first high above it, but gradually bringing it lower and\n lower, till at last, as if draining the last drop of the\n mixture, he lowers the mouth of the tin right into the\n hat, and brings it well down over the smaller tin. On\n being again raised, it brings away with it the . smaller\n tin and its liquid contents, the cake being left in the hat.\n He next proceeds to bake the cake, by moving the hat\n</p>\n<p>\n a horizontal\n</p>\n<p>\n FiG. 34.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0057/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 422}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0057/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 844}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0057/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1688}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0057/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3376}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ma:gi:ci:an:sb:oo:ko:fc:00:un:se:magiciansbookofc00unse:magiciansbookofc00unse_0057/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ma/gi/ci/an/sb/oo/ko/fc/00/un/se/magiciansbookofc00unse/magiciansbookofc00unse_0057.jp2", "height": 3376, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 614126}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"57\">\n<p>\n THE WELSH RABBIT .\n</p>\n<p>\n 53\n</p>\n<p>\n backwards and forwards at a short distance over the\n flame of a candle, and, after a sufficient interval, exhibits\n the result, which is cut up and handed round to the com-\n pany for their approval.\n</p>\n<p>\n As the batter round the sides of b is apt to cause a to\n stick pretty tightly into it, a folding ring is generally\n fixed inside a, in order to facilitate its removal after the\n r close of the trick.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00a3 The Welsh Rabbit. \u2014 This is a trick of a comic char-\n j| acter, and in the hands of a spirited performer is sure to\n be received with applause, particularly by the younger\n members of the audience.

For a moment he is\n at a loss for a fire, but this difficulty is quickly conquered.\n Borrowing a gentleman\u2019s hat, and a lady\u2019s pocket-hand-\n kerchief, he requests permission to use them for the pur-\n pose of the experiment.
