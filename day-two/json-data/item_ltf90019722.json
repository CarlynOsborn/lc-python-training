What is the duty of the State with regard to the teach\u00ac\n ing of Religion in its schools and public institutions?\n</p>\n<p>\n I reply. The duty of the State is to have nothing to do\n with the teaching of Religion. The duty of the State with\n regard to the management of its public schools and institutions, is\n wholly secular ; the public, schools, normal schools or universities,\n cannot be regarded as Churches, Synagogues, or Theological Sem\u00ac\n inaries, in any sense whatever, however modified. A part of this\n secular duty is undoubtedly to inculcate what may be called \u201cSchool\u201d\n morals: such as patience, diligence, industry, respect for authority,\n cleanliness, self-control, truthfulness, honesty, regard for rights, and\n the like\u2014\u201cthose virtues which belong to man as man.\u201d (Spear.)\n This is secular teaching, and belongs to the duty of a democratic State.\n Those who call it \u201cgodless\u201d and \u201cirreligious,\u201d do not understand\n the true meaning of those words. The teaching of reading, writ\u00ac\n ing, arithmetic, general history, & c., is neither religious nor irrelig\u00ac\n ious, it is simply removed from the region of thought implied by\n those terms.\n</p>\n<p>\n We should not think of calling a bootmaker a \u201cgodless\u201d man, be\u00ac\n cause he did not accompany the purchase of each pair of boots with\n a theological tract. We simply say \u2018give me boots, when I come\n to you, I will go to my church for theological tracts.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n Still, the exclusion of religious exercise, as such, and religious\n teaching, as such, from Public School Education; does not exclude\n morality. Take the case of the bootmaker again, we ask him to\n give us honest boots, and clean boots, and make change for our bill\n in lawful and honest money, and so forth. We expect any man\n who sets up a store to conduct it on moral principles. The morality\n that is embodied in our laws,\u2014a morality that requires honesty,\n chastity, cleanliness, industry, frugality, decency of speech, truthful\u00ac\n ness & c., is just a morality based upon the very structure of civil so\u00ac\n ciety, and would retain its hold upon human life if all theology were\n abolished.

For exam\u00ac\n ple: there is an infinite difference between a religion that regards\n Jesus of Nazareth as the Eternal Son of God, and the Divine Re\u00ac\n deemer of the world; and one that thinks him the son of the carpen\u00ac\n ter and the founder of a sect. There is an unthinkable distinction\n between those who regard the Bible as the Infallible word of the\n Living God, and those who think of it as a good book, or as, even,\n the best of books. There is a gulf, which can never be spanned,\n between those who think of Revelation, as a supernatural gift of\n grace, and those who hold truth to be the outcome of the insight of\n man.\n</p>\n<p>\n What suits the Catholic ought not to suit the Protestant, what is\n religion to the Presbyterian cannot be so to the Israelite or the\n Unitarian. Yet, if the State teaches any religion, or uses any relig\u00ac\n ious book, it must choose, and in choosing, the State becomes the\n promulgator of one form of religion, to the detriment of those who\n hold other beliefs. The State, by the very nature of the case,\n must abstain from all connection with the teaching of religion,\n simply because it cannot decide which form to use as the base of\n its teaching.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:at:is:re:la:ti:on:of:00:go:rd:whatisrelationof00gord:whatisrelationof00gord_0025/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 153, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 261}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:at:is:re:la:ti:on:of:00:go:rd:whatisrelationof00gord:whatisrelationof00gord_0025/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 306, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 522}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:at:is:re:la:ti:on:of:00:go:rd:whatisrelationof00gord:whatisrelationof00gord_0025/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 612, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1044}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:at:is:re:la:ti:on:of:00:go:rd:whatisrelationof00gord:whatisrelationof00gord_0025/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1224, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2089}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:at:is:re:la:ti:on:of:00:go:rd:whatisrelationof00gord:whatisrelationof00gord_0025/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2449, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4178}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:at:is:re:la:ti:on:of:00:go:rd:whatisrelationof00gord:whatisrelationof00gord_0025/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/wh/at/is/re/la/ti/on/of/00/go/rd/whatisrelationof00gord/whatisrelationof00gord_0025.jp2", "height": 4178, "width": 2449, "levels": 6, "size": 508957}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"25\">\n<p>\n 2 3\n</p>\n<p>\n It may be said that the State could teach, or use, unsectarian\n religion.
