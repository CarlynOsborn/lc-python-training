To select from a large amount of\n material gathered during a busy life that which shall best\n represent a man\u2019s growth, requires a knowledge of the\n man outside of his written utterances. My purpose has\n been to catch the developing thought of an active man in\n the midst of his activity. It is like taking a photograph\n of a person when he is unconscious of the fact. Every\n position of the body, every lineament of the face is on\n the alert, uncomposed for a sitting. So here. These\n writings were not prepared for publication. If they had\n been, they might have sometimes been more technically\n artistic, but then they would have been less vitally life\u00ac\n like.

And all the\n while he does not suspect that we are looking on and tak\u00ac\n ing note of the work, and the growth as well. And yet I\n have somehow felt, as I have been preparing this \u201cmemo\u00ac\n rial of love,\u201d that his spirit has frequently hovered near\n and prompted the work with his unique \u201c timely sugges\u00ac\n tions.\u201d It is delightful to believe that the \u201c loved ones\n gone before \u201d still retain a loving knowledge of and care\n for those of us who remain.

S. G. Buckingham, D.D.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Gaylords were a typical New England family.\n They lived in one of the farming towns of Eastern\n Connecticut, where nobody had much property fifty\n years ago, but where all were industrious, frugal,\n moral, and they were as well off as their neighbors.\n The whole town of Ashford contained perhaps 1,200\n inhabitants, and the little parish of Ashford Hill, only\n 250 of them.

The\n stimulus of a worthy object, the ardor of youth, the\n challenge of opposition, together with the conscious\u00ac\n ness of being in the right, did not betray him into\n sympathy with lawless measures, or the use of unwor\u00ac\n thy means for the accomplishment of good ends; and\n this golden principle of rectitude, to his praise be it\n said, characterized his whole career.\n</p>\n<p>\n At the age of sixteen he became a Christian. His\n conversion was not sudden. He thought along while,\n then solemnly and deliberately avowed himself on the\n Lord\u2019s side. This early habit of thoughtfulness was\n also characteristic of the man. With him religion was\n not so much an impulse as a deep principle. During\n his attendance at the old academy in Ashford, he dis\u00ac\n covered those powers of mind which gave promise of\n the future. The principal, Rev. E. B. Huntington,\n did not confine his influence to the school-room, but\n inspired his pupils with noble impulses and lofty aims.\n * In the village lyceum the ablest disputants found in\n this youth a foe worthy of their steel, and in these\n societies, as president, he acquired that knowledge of\n the duties of a presiding officer which we have seen\n him display with signed ability and dignity.\n</p>\n<p>\n But a crisis was approaching.

Several published\n sermons and valuable articles fully justify this estimate\n of his powers as a preacher and writer.\n</p>\n<p>\n AS A PASTOR.\n</p>\n<p>\n He was greatly beloved as a pastor and friend. He\n will long be remembered as a wise counselor and a\n peace-maker. He was benevolent beyond his means.\n A poor woman lamenting his death, says, \u201c the last\n time he was at my house, when he shook hands to say\n good bye, he slipped four dollars into my hand and\n before I could thank him, he was gone.\u201d During his\n ministry he received ten pastoral calls, most of them\n to prominent churches.

There\n has been, in all these years, no smile of welcome, no\n kiss of parting, no word of fondness, no utterance of\n those old familiar phrases which won the early love,\n no sweet surprise of pleasure contrived far off by\n thoughtful regard, no watchful hand outstretched to\n lighten cares and labors grown heavier with advanc\u00ac\n ing years. A hard nature may contemn such small\n attentions as beneath its notice. A careless or\n absorbed nature may see no harm in such neglects.\n But a Christian nature will cherish these tokens of\n endearment, sacred as a marriage vow. It will suffer\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0078/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 248, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0078/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 496, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 869}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0078/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 992, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1739}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0078/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1984, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3478}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0078/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/se/rm/on/so/th/er/pa/pe/00/ga/yl/sermonsotherpape00gayl/sermonsotherpape00gayl_0078.jp2", "height": 3478, "width": 1984, "levels": 6, "size": 264999}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"78\">\n<p>\n 72\n</p>\n<p>\n no-blast of earthly care to blight these simple kind\u00ac\n nesses.

It may be a violation of\n rhetorical rules, but it is the fulfillment of a rich\n imagination thus to commingle figures ; for no one\n who is apt to see things in .symbols and by pictures,\n but knows that for the same thought there will often\n rise several distinct figures striving to represent it,\n and that the mind will, in its more fervid moods, take\n both figures or many of them in part. Thus in\n another place the Apostle speaks of being rooted and\n grounded in love ; but a tree stands on its root, and a\n house stands on its foundation, and both figures\n suggest to the mind the same idea. The hypocritic\n may say that a man cannot be a root and at the same\n time a foundation ; but he can be that which root and\n foundation alike signify\u2014i. e., established, stable,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0139/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 252, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 436}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0139/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 504, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 872}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0139/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1008, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1744}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0139/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2016, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3488}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0139/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/se/rm/on/so/th/er/pa/pe/00/ga/yl/sermonsotherpape00gayl/sermonsotherpape00gayl_0139.jp2", "height": 3488, "width": 2016, "levels": 6, "size": 367362}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"139\">\n<p>\n 133\n</p>\n<p>\n unmovable.

If you have a hope\n that is good when you are young, when you are pros\u00ac\n perous, and when you are happy, but does not hold\n you when you are sick, when you are cast out, when\n you are bereaved and discouraged, when life is taken\n away from you, if you have no hope that holds you\n then, you have nothing that is worth having. An\n anchor that only deceives men with the appearance\n of safety, but that gives away in the hour of danger,\n is worse than none at all. It is a hope that holds a\n man when he does not need holding, and breaks\n when he most needs its security. I beseech you,\n therefore, now take such a thought of God; now\n enter by faith into such communion with Christ;\n now so center and plant yourself in the life of God,\n that when these times of trial come, you shall not only\n be sustained, but sustained with such abundance\n of consolation that with the apostle you will be able\n to testify : \u201c I glory in my infirmities. I count it all\n joy when I fall into divers trials.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n There is a cup that everybody must drink ; there\n is darkness for every one ; there is a Gethsemane for\n every human creature with or without Christ; there\n is a night, a period of sadness and sorrow.

It is that we shall see the angels in heaven.\n We are taught in the word of God that there are\n angelic as well as divine beings in the heavenly world.\n It is not needful to attempt an argument now, in\n support of this position. The frequent mention made\n in the scriptures of their existence, their character,\n and their offices, is sufficient to show that they are\n holy beings whose employment is the willing service\n of God in carrying out his designs of love to his\n universe. Like obedient children in their father\u2019s\n house, they love what he loves, and poise on waiting\n wing to do whatever he desires to have done. They\n are spoken of as \u201c ministering spirits, sent to minister\n unto them that are the heirs of salvation,\u201d as a convoy\n of waiting attendants to bear a poor beggar to\n Abraham\u2019s bosom, as standing to guard the gates of\n the New Jerusalem, as waiting around the throne of\n God singing \u201c Worthy the Lamb that was slain ; \u201d and\n as the \u201c innumerable company \u201d which Paul describes\n as receiving the saints on Mount Sion, in the city of\n the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem.\n</p>\n<p>\n V. But the chief attraction of heaven, and that\n which should cause in the Christian the most earnest\n longing to see the celestial country, is that we shall\n see Christ there.

Unfortunately\n there are many men and women to whom these state\u00ac\n ments will sound as an unknown language ; who are\n so outward and childish, so frivolously content with\n the glitter and flutter of society, that in all their life,\n they have never yet become aware that there are any\n deeps. The whole universe is one great shallow to\n them. This blankness of ignorance, this stolid com\u00ac\n placency, dancing over the magazine of destiny while\n the slow-matches of time and death are burning on,\n is the worst misfortune of all. The defect next in\n seriousness, the great common error of men, is that\n when they do become conscious of the deeps, it is\n only for a moment.

Looking now towards earth and at men, we\n instinctively ask : Why has the assassinating hand\n sought the life of James A. Garfield ? Why\u2018was the\n President of these United States marked for death ?\n The answer is a plain one. It consists in the fact\n that he was the President, officially intrusted with the\n executive duty of administering the power of this\n government for the maintenance of law and of the\n constituted forms of authority. This was Mr. Gar\u00ac\n field\u2019s sole offence. The poor, miserable, murderous\n wretch who is made conspicuous only by the dastardly\n character of his cruel deed, did not aim his weapon at\n his victim as a man , but as the President of these\n United States, as God\u2019s minister for the punishment\n of evil doers, and the praise of them that do well.\n It was therefore aimed at you and at me, at every\n man, woman, and child living under the protection of\n this government; at public order; at the sanctity of\n law; at the purity of the public service, and at the\n God who commands our subjection to the powers that\n be. This is the true interpretation of the blow\n sought to be struck ; and this it is that gives signifi\u00ac\n cance to the act. We look upon Mr. Garfield as a\n murdered President, and not as a man falling in the\n private walks of life, the victim of a purely personal\n vengeance. The life-blood that flowed from his lacer\u00ac\n ated wound, was, in the circumstances, official blood.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0220/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 248, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0220/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 496, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 869}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0220/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 992, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1739}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0220/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1984, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3478}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0220/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/se/rm/on/so/th/er/pa/pe/00/ga/yl/sermonsotherpape00gayl/sermonsotherpape00gayl_0220.jp2", "height": 3478, "width": 1984, "levels": 6, "size": 392152}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"220\">\n<p>\n 214\n</p>\n<p>\n The pistol shot that hurried him to his doom, was\n fired into the heart of the nation.

At the\n call of his State, and urgently constrained by the\n lamented Lincoln, he left the camp and the battle\u00ac\n field for the halls of Congress in 1863, and there\n remained in the very front rank of large-minded and\n patriotic American statesmen, until the nation, with\u00ac\n out seeking of his own, summoned him to the highest\n office in its gift, the highest office in the world.\n Four months of wearying work in his new position,\n he was permitted to perform, and then was preparing\n to start on a brief pleasure trip, for well-earned rest\n and recreation, when he was shot in the back by a\n cowardly assassin. The details of his lingering and\n heroic suffering are too painful to be narrated. They\n are o\u00a3 thrilling interest, more than anything else, for\n the example of the heroic endurance and conquering\n faith which he made conspicuous to the end; and\n likewise for the inexpressible charm, beauty, and\n sweetness, of the sublime fortitude and devotion, of\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0226/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 248, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0226/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 496, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 869}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0226/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 992, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1739}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0226/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1984, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3478}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0226/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/se/rm/on/so/th/er/pa/pe/00/ga/yl/sermonsotherpape00gayl/sermonsotherpape00gayl_0226.jp2", "height": 3478, "width": 1984, "levels": 6, "size": 370102}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"226\">\n<p>\n 220\n</p>\n<p>\n the truest, noblest type of womanhood that God ever\n permitted to bless with her faith and love the man of\n whom with her, He had said, \u201c They twain shall be\n one.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Garlands upon his grave,\n</p>\n<p>\n And flowers upon his hearse,\n</p>\n<p>\n And to the tender heart and brave\n The tribute of this verse.\n</p>\n<p>\n Were a star quenched on high,\n</p>\n<p>\n For ages would its light,\n</p>\n<p>\n Still traveling downward from the sky,\n</p>\n<p>\n Shine on our mortal sight.\n</p>\n<p>\n So, when a good man dies,\n</p>\n<p>\n For years beyond our ken,\n</p>\n<p>\n The light he leaves behind him lies\n Upon the paths of men.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let me now speak to you a few words as to his\n character.

Now (my brother), that\n is a hard thing for a man whose every pulse beats in\n sympathy and love with social life to say, but it is true ,\n and not only true, but a truth the utterance of which\n 21 *\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0252/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 248, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0252/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 496, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 869}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0252/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 992, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1739}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0252/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1984, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3478}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0252/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/se/rm/on/so/th/er/pa/pe/00/ga/yl/sermonsotherpape00gayl/sermonsotherpape00gayl_0252.jp2", "height": 3478, "width": 1984, "levels": 6, "size": 445958}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"252\">\n<p>\n 246\n</p>\n<p>\n is imperatively demanded in view of the perils which\n threaten our young ministers.

Breaching the Word. My brother: I am\n brought to the final topic in this meditation, as I\n dwell for a moment upon that part of your work\n which stands paramount to any and all others. For,\n I pray you, never lose sight of the fact that you are\n now under commission to preach the word , as you are\n commissioned for no other work. The dignity and\n importance of preaching cannot be overstated. The\n spoken truth is ever more living and potential than\n the written truth. Preaching is a mystery\u2014\u201c a mys\u00ac\n tery, as to its action and its effects, a mystery of\n reprobation and salvation.\u201d It must, then, be an\n object of greatest moment to bring into fullest exer\u00ac\n cise such a function as this\u2014to clothe it with every\n rightful power and to guard it against every known\n weakness. We shall not gain any essential advant\u00ac\n age by an attempt to institute a comparison between\n the preaching of the present day and of those that\n have preceded it. It may be better than the preach\u00ac\n ing of Origen, vitiated by allegories, or it may be\n inferior to the preaching of St. Basil and St. Chry\u00ac\n sostom, whose fervid grandeur, impetuous energy,\n and Scriptural simplicity, redeemed the weakness of\n a preceding age, and made Constantinople and Antioch\n the classic grounds of Christian eloquence. It may\n be better than ' the preaching of the Mediaeval Church,\n when, with worship, doctrine, discipline, and priest\u00ac\n hood, it suffered a common petrifaction.

The system of God\u2019s\n truth is so large that the human mind cannot compass\n it. We are obliged to look at it in portions. It is\n true, as the Apostle said, that now we know but in\n part. We see through a glass darkly. But when we\n come to that world in which love predominates, then\n we shall be men, and shall put away the childish\n systems which belong to this mortal sphere.\n</p>\n<p>\n The union which Christ meant is moral, not intel\u00ac\n lectual, except as incidental to the moral. It is affec-\n tional. It lies in the temper, in the disposition, in\n the heart, and not \u2018in creeds. It does not reject\n creeds ; it does not disdain them ; it seeks as far as\n may be, to bring men together in ideas ; but it is\n essentially a union of the disposition and heart.

In all work\n that is worth anything, from the lowest to the highest,\n from sweeping the room to studying a lesson, there\n must be what has been called \u201cthe instinct of perfec\u00ac\n tion,\u201d of desire to do our best; not merely what will\n pay, what will satisfy imperfect human judgment, what\n will pass muster, and look for a time what it is not.\n If there be no pride in good work as such there can\n be no good labor in the field, no good workmanship\n 29\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0344/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 248, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0344/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 496, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 869}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0344/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 992, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1739}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0344/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1984, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3478}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0344/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/se/rm/on/so/th/er/pa/pe/00/ga/yl/sermonsotherpape00gayl/sermonsotherpape00gayl_0344.jp2", "height": 3478, "width": 1984, "levels": 6, "size": 412537}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"344\">\n<p>\n 33^\n</p>\n<p>\n and no good manufacture, and as for the higher profes\u00ac\n sions they cannot for a moment deserve their name.\n</p>\n<p>\n And yet what is to sustain the \u201c instinct of perfec\u00ac\n tion \u201d in all the dull wear and tear of comm on life, in\n the fierce temptations of competition and the law of\n public opinion ?

It follows, then, that\n if this work of pastoral visitation is to be made a help\u00ac\n ful and profitable part of your pastor\u2019s labors in this\n field, you must see to it, not only that you give him\n 3 1\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0368/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 248, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0368/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 496, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 869}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0368/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 992, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1739}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0368/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1984, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3478}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:se:rm:on:so:th:er:pa:pe:00:ga:yl:sermonsotherpape00gayl:sermonsotherpape00gayl_0368/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/se/rm/on/so/th/er/pa/pe/00/ga/yl/sermonsotherpape00gayl/sermonsotherpape00gayl_0368.jp2", "height": 3478, "width": 1984, "levels": 6, "size": 428247}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"368\">\n<p>\n 362\n</p>\n<p>\n cordial welcome to your houses, but that you expect\n him, and aid him, to make his going among you from\n house to house a means of spiritual stimulus to him\u00ac\n self, and an opportunity for such efforts as will\n reinforce and make more practical the preaching of\n the word on the Sabbath.\n</p>\n<p>\n I am led from this point to a further remark upon\n this matter I have referred to as \u201cthe care of souls.\u201d\n I wish to speak of it as involving a mutual responsibility\n on the part of a church and its pastor.

We remember the ocean burial, where the\n wild tumult of the sea chants forever the requiem of\n the brave. We remember the graves, here and there,\n of those who fell by the way, returning, and the\n burial of others at home with kindred dust. And\n these are the noble men whose memory we honor\n to-day.
