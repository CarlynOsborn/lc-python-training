Sometimes these instrumentalities have been idolized,\n while the end, for the accomplishment of which they are appointed,\n has been overlooked. And then again, on the other hand, they have\n been undervalued and neglected. 1 propose, therefore, at this time, to\n occupy your attention by an endeavor to point out what is ultimate and\n final in religion, to mark the distinction between the end to be sought,\n and the instrumentalities appointed for its attainment, and to show in\n what way these instrumentalities are subsidiary and efficient.\n</p>\n<p>\n What then is ultimate and final in Teligion ? In other words what is\n the ultimate object, at which we should aim in regard to ourselves as\n individuals, in our endeavors to accomplish in our own hearts and lives\n the true purposes of the Gospel; and what is the state into which we\n should seek to bring the community, in order that it may be in reality\n and in all respects truly a Christian community ? In regard to our\u00ac\n selves, I answer that we should seek to bring our souls into a childlike\n frame, into a state of entire consecration to the service of God, and of\n perfect oneness of feeling and affection with his holy will, into a state\n of conscious, sincere loyalty to the Supreme Jehovah, into a state of\n perfect love, of perfect faith, and of perfect devotion of heart and of\n life. I sincerely believe that a higher and richer experience of the\n power and of the joy of religion than most men imagine or desire,\n which should be sought by every true Christian, and which, if sought\n with the same diligence, earnestness and perseverance with which men\n seek for the treasures of earth, may, through God\u2019s blessing, be at\u00ac\n tained. It is a state of entire subordination of our own wishes, plans\n and purposes to the will of God; in which we shall feel that God is all\n in all, and that we are only instruments in his hand; and in which we\n shall desire only to be instruments for the accomplishment of his wise\n and holy purposes.

I answer that communities are composed of individu\u00ac\n als, and that the Gospel deals with communities, and accomplishes its\n purposes in regard to them, only as it exerts its controlling and trans\u00ac\n forming influence upon the affections, the principles and the conduct of\n individuals. If then, the ultimate purposes of the Gospel are accom\u00ac\n plished in regard to the separate members of communities, as individ\u00ac\n uals, they will be in regard to the community itself, considered as a\n whole. The truth of this inference would seem, at first thought, toJbe\n perfectly obvious. And yet there are striking facts, evident upon the\n very surface of society, which seem to contradict its truth. There are\n professedly Christian communities, the members of which, in their in\u00ac\n dividual capacity, and in the devotional aspect of their characters, seem\n to be truly Christian, while yet there are prevalent in these same com\u00ac\n munities many unchristian notions, practices, customs and institutions.\n There are nations, for example, which profess to regard themselves as\n the followers of the Prince of Peace, and among the members of which\n the Scriptures of the New Testament containing the instructions of the\n Saviour are freely circulated, in which they read his injunctions incul\u00ac\n cating upon all his followers a spirit of long-suflfering, forbearance un\u00ac\n der ill-treatment, and of forgiveness of enemies, while yet these na\u00ac\n tions engage in destructive wars with each other, and often too, upon\n the most frivolous pretences. Nay, more. They cherish, in various\n ways, and openly avow, and distinctly manifest the unchristian spirit of\n revenge. Then too, there are communities nominally Christian ; and\n among the members of which there is undoubtedly much devotional\n feeling ; in whose ears are often read the precepts of the Saviour, re\u00ac\n quiring his disciples to love their neighbors as themselves, and to do in\n all things to others, as they would have others do to them, while yet\n they seize upon their more ignorant and defenceless fellow-men, and\n call them property^ buy them and sell them as they do their horses and\n their mules; beat them, and often maim them ; deprive them of the\n means of knowledge ; close against them the Volume of God\u2019s Holy\n Word, and compel them to contract that most holy of all earthly rela\u00ac\n tions, the marriage union, without regard to the affectionate attachment\n upon which it should ever be based, or to dissolve it simply at the arbi\u00ac\n trary command of another, or as fluctuations ' in business, or changes in\n property may determine. Then, still further, there are those, even in\n our own beloved New-England, w ' ho encourage by their indulgences,\n or sustain by their pursuits; customs and fashions fraught with the direst\n evils to the community. There are those who still continue the traffic\n in intoxicating drinks, by w-hich their fellow men are reduced to a con\u00ac\n dition ten-fold worse than death; and others who by their invitations\n and their example, by their social drinking of wine, or their moderate\n indulgence in ardent spirits, are lending their influence to the encour\u00ac\n agement, support and countenance of intemperance in our midst, while\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ch:ri:st:ia:na:im:si:ns:00:wh:it:christianaimsins00whit:christianaimsins00whit_0007/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 295, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 501}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ch:ri:st:ia:na:im:si:ns:00:wh:it:christianaimsins00whit:christianaimsins00whit_0007/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 591, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1003}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ch:ri:st:ia:na:im:si:ns:00:wh:it:christianaimsins00whit:christianaimsins00whit_0007/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1182, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2007}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ch:ri:st:ia:na:im:si:ns:00:wh:it:christianaimsins00whit:christianaimsins00whit_0007/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2365, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4015}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ch:ri:st:ia:na:im:si:ns:00:wh:it:christianaimsins00whit:christianaimsins00whit_0007/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ch/ri/st/ia/na/im/si/ns/00/wh/it/christianaimsins00whit/christianaimsins00whit_0007.jp2", "height": 4015, "width": 2365, "levels": 6, "size": 578195}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"7\">\n<p>\n 7\n</p>\n<p>\n yet they claim to be regarded as Christians.

There are\n those, who, if we may judge by their conduct, seem to think that a\n man may be a very good Christian, and yet neglect, entirely, to carry\n his Christian principles and Christian spirit into his business transac\u00ac\n tions, his political efforts, or his ofRcial acts. The idea seems to be\n prevalent with some, that business is one thing and religion another, and\n a different thing; that a political caucus and a social prayer meeting\n are so very different, the one from the other, as to authorize, if not re\u00ac\n quire entirely different principles of conduct, and an entirely different\n spirit. It seems to be thought that as a Christian, and in all Christian\n efforts, a man is bound to speak the truth, but that as a politician, and\n to promote the interests of his political party, he may be permitted to\n exaggerate, misrepresent and deceive ; that as a Christian, he must do\n to others as he would have others do to him ; but that as a man of busi?\n ness he may look safely to his own interests, and may take the advan\u00ac\n tage, whenever he can, of the ignorance and of the necessities of his\n brethren. It is by many considered as altogether unchristian for a man\n to meet his fellow-man in the deadly conflict of the duel, but not urn\n Christian for the same man to use all his influence as a ruler to plunge\n his nation into war with a neighboring nation *, as a general to lead his\n army to battle; or as a soldier to plunge his sword into the heart of his\n fellow-man. Christian principle, it seems to be thought by some, must\n not be applied to these positions, acts and pursuits ; or if applied to\n them at all, it must be in some peculiar way. Indeed, attempts are\n made to palliate, excuse and even justify these things, and show that\n they are consistent with the requirements of the Gospel.\n</p>\n<p>\n Since then there are prevalent in Christian communities many social\n evils and public wrongs, which seem to be inconsistent with the highest\n and holiest manifestations of Christian influences; something more is\n necessary than simply to interest individuals in their individual capacity\n in the claims and requirements of the Gospel. Efibrts must be put\n forth for the especial purpose of reforming Christian communities, and\n banishing from them all unchristian ideas, customs, fashions and insti\u00ac\n tutions. For Christianity wages a war, a war of love it is true, but at\n the same time, a war of uncompromising hostility, and of utter exter\u00ac\n mination against all sin, whether personal or organic, whether in the\n individual or in the body politic.

Indeed, Christianity wages a\n war not only against the prevalent sins of a community, but also against\n all manifestation of an unchristian spirit, and all pursuit of unchristian\n measures, even in efforts to remove sin from the world. What, then,\n the question returns upon us, what are we to seek to accomplish in re\u00ac\n gard to any community, in order that it may be in reality and in all\n respects a truly Christian community ? I answer that, by Christian in\u00ac\n strumentalities, and in the exercise of a Christian spirit we are to seek\n to bring the community, in its associated capacity, into subjection to\n Christian principles, and to the manifestation of the Christian spirit in\n all its social efforts and public acts. We are to strive to bring about\n that period, when the acts of every legislative assembly shall be based\n upon Christian principles, shall be marked by a Christian spirit, and\n shall aini at Christian results; that period when the same regard for\n Christian principle, and the same manifestation of the Christian spirit\n shall characterize all political consultations and exertions, all business\n transactions, and all social intercourse. In short, we are to strive to\n hasten on that glorious period, hinted at in the prophecies of old, when\n men \u201c shall beat their swords into ploughshares, and their spears into\n pruning-hooks; when nation shall not lift up sword against nation, nei\u00ac\n ther shall they learn war any more; that period when they shall not\n hurt nor destroy in all the holy mountain of the Lord, when the earth\n shall be full of the knowledge of the Lord as the waters cover the\n seas.\u201d When any community is brought into this state, then may we\n feel that the ultimate purposes of the Gospel in regard to it are accom\u00ac\n plished, and that it is in reality and in all respects truly a Christian\n community.\n</p>\n<p>\n You will have observed in the remarks which have been offered upon\n the ultimate objects and final purposes of the Gospel, that the question,\n whether they are accomplished in regard to any individual or any com\u00ac\n munity, will not be satisfactorily answered by the statement that cer\u00ac\n tain doctrines have been embraced, certain forms of worship observed,\n or certain modes of Christian effort adopted.

Perhaps I\n may differ from others in the view I take of moral conduct as instru\u00ac\n mental of spiritual growth. But it seems to me a very important view^\n tending to enhance the value and importance of correct moral conduct,,\n and to expose an error which sometimes prevails in regard to it. P ' or\n surely when it is considered that every instance of correct moral de\u00ac\n portment exerts an influence for good, and every instance of moral\n delinquency exerts an influence for evil, upon the spiritual and immor\u00ac\n tal nature, the importance of pursuing the one and avoiding the other,\n will be enhanced in our estimation. Correct moral conduct will be\n valued, not merely for what it is in itself, and in its influence upon\n standing and reputation in the community, but, more especially, for\n what it is in its influence upon the soul itself, in advancing its prepara\u00ac\n tion for the enjoyment of God\u2019s presence. Then too there is an error\n abroad in regard to the sufficiency of correct moral conduct in securing\n eternal bliss. The question is often asked, \u201c if a man be a correct\n moral man, is not that sufficient ? What matter if he be not a devout,\n holy, spiritually-minded man.?\u201d To the community it may not matter;\n for devoutness of affections, holiness of heart, spirituality of mind lie\n beyond the cognizance of the community. But to the individual him\u00ac\n self it will be a matter of the utmost importance, since the true value\n of his correctness of moral conduct in the sight of God, and its benefi\u00ac\n cial effect upon his own soul will depend upon the motives by which it\n is prompted, upon its being based upon and proceeding from high,\n holy, spiritual feelings and principles. The honesty of the truly reli\u00ac\n gious man may not be of more value to the community than the hon\u00ac\n esty of the irreligious man, excepting as it is based upon a more fixed\n principle, and is therefore more to be depended upon. But to the indi\u00ac\n vidual himself, a simple act of honesty proceeding from religious prin\u00ac\n ciple, is of tenfold more value, is vastly more beneficial in its reflex\n influence upon his own soul, than the same act of honesty performed\n under the influence of a lower, a worldly motive. It seems to me im\u00ac\n portant, then, that we should look upon even outward moral conduct as\n instrumental in its relation to the soul, and the soul\u2019s best welfare.\n</p>\n<p>\n The views which I have in this discourse advanced, I believe to be\n of the utmost importance in their practical bearings. There is, with\n many, a tendency to idolize means and instrumentalities, and to rest\n satisfied with an outward attention to them, without even inquiring\n whether they have exerted or are exerting their appropriate influence\n upon the heart and life.

It is important, then, that we should have a\n clear conception of the precise objects we are to seek, in our attention\n to religious instrumentalities, both in regard to ourselves, and in regard\n to the community around us. Then shall w ' e understand in what way\n all these instrumentalities are to be employed and improved. The\n doctrines we embrace will no longer remain mere intellectual abstrac\u00ac\n tions, they will become living principles of action, and their influence\n upon the heart and the life will be distinctly manifested in the daily\n walk and conversation. Our forms of worship and our observance of\n the ordinances of religion will cease to be mere formalities. They\n w ' ill become occasions of holy communion with God and of spiritual\n fellowship with Christ, and with one another, seasons of refreshment\n from the Lord, when Christian principles are strengthened, religious\n feelings deepened, and heavenward aspirations rendered more ardent.\n And our correctness of moral deportment will cease to be a mere con\u00ac\n formity with outward rules of j)ropriety, and will become the manifes\u00ac\n tation and the exercise of our fixed principles of devotion to God and\n of benevolence to man. It will no longer be a matter of mere worldly\n policy, it w ' ill become a matter of conscience and of duty, instrumental\n of the soul\u2019s developement and growth in all that is pure, lovely and of\n good report.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then again there is a tendency, with some, to undervalue the doc\u00ac\n trines of the Gospel, the exercises of worship, the ordinances of reli\u00ac\n gion. If an individual have love to man and love to God, what matter,\n :say some, whether he embrace one system of doctrines or another, or\n whether he have any religious belief at all, what matter whether he\n pray or neglect prayer, whether he seat himself at the table of remem\u00ac\n brance or turn away from it.? In this query it is forgotten that these\n things, truths believed, worship offered, ordinances observed, are the\n means, the instruments of holiness. The views I have advanced, if\n true, will serve to enhance in our estimation the value of all these.\n We shall regard them, not merely as they are in themselves, but as\n they are in relation to spiritual growth and eternal happiness. The\n more we value these, the more ardent our desire for spiritual improve\u00ac\n ment and eternal bliss, the more earnestly shall we seek for a pure\n</p>\n<p>\n observance of the ordinances.

It is sometimes\n asked if the soul is sustained upon the bed of death by a belief in the\n miraculous origin of our religion, rather than by its own holy union\n with God through the power of faith and love. The proper answer to\n this question is, that a belief in the miraculous origin and divine au\u00ac\n thority of our religion, has been the instrument of bringing the soul\n into this holy union. What may perhaps with truth be regarded as in\n itself transient becomes of vast importance and of permanent value\n from its connection with what is ultimate and absolute. And then too,\n that which is transient with the individual becomes permanent with the\n community and the race. It is with the individual an instrumentality\n to a permanent end. As an instrumentality, it is needed by all other\n members of the community, who have not enjoyed it, and will be as\n important to them as it has been to those who have already experienced\n its beneficial influences. As an instrumentality, it will be as important\n to all succeeding generations, as it has been to those which have gone\n before. It is then only from the vast and unspeakable importance of\n the ends they are intended to accomplish, that the true value of all re\u00ac\n ligious instrumentalities is to be learned. While therefore we should\n ever assign them their true place, as instrumerdaliLies^ we should also\n assign them their true value, enhanced as it is by their relation to the\n spiritual growth and eternal welfare of the soul.\n</p>\n<p>\n My friends of this religious society, I have supposed that the subject\n of my discourse, and the remarks which I have ofTered might not be-\n inappropriate to this occasion. As my brother, this day, takes upon '\n him, more formally, the vows of that ministry among you, to which\n you have invited him, you will perceive that in his labors, you are\n henceforth to enjoy an important religious instrumentality. But re\u00ac\n member, I beseech you, that it depends much upon the light in which*\n you may regard that instrumentality, and the manner in which you may\n improve it, whether its influence upon you shall be for your good or for\u2019\n your hurt; that the word preached will not profit unless it be mixed\n with faith in the hearers. You will bear it in mind that your pastor\n comes among you, not that he may be religious in your stead, but that,-\n under God\u2019s guidance and with God\u2019s blessing, he may aid you in your\n endeavors to work out your own salvation. He comes, not that he\n may stand between you and your God, between you and your Saviour,\n but that he may conduct you, in your own persons, to a near, in\u00ac\n timate and holy union of heart with your Saviour and your God. Re--\n ceive, then, your pastor to your hearts. Give him your confidence,-\n and your affections.

With these views I extend\n to you this right hand of Christian fellowship, and, in the name of our\n common Christianity, bid you welcome to this part of our Lord\u2019s vine\u00ac\n yard on the earth. You come among this people, not that you may\n preach yourself, but that you may preach \u201cChrist and him crucified\n not to make your hearers proselytes to your own peculiar opinions, but\n that you may lead them to your Master, that they may learn of him.\n You come among them not that you may display your learning or tal\u00ac\n ents, but that, consecrating them to God and to Christ as instrumentali\u00ac\n ties for ihe advancement of the Redeemer\u2019s kingdom, they may be all\n employed in setting forth the riches of the Gospel of God\u2019s grace.\n Having been led by God\u2019s grace to desire a part in this ministry, to\n share in this instrumentality for the good of your fellow-men, and hav\u00ac\n ing been guided by God\u2019s Providence to this field of labor, I would\n renewedly welcome you to all the hopes and joys, to all the labors and\n results of your ministry here.
