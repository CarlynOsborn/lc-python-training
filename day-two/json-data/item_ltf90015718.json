You stand on, or near, the line, which will soon\n separate you from the parents or friends, who have nurtured\n you in your infancy, led you through that incipient state of\n learning, that, qualifying you for collegiate study, stores the\n mind with useful, practical knowledge, and enables you to\n assume a station for yourselves, wherein to develope and em-\n ploy the faculties given you by nature, as they have been im-\n proved by culture; or you are about returning to the scenes\n and companions of vour youth, and parting from the cherish-\n ed associations of your riper years, and the kind instructors,\n who have zealously endeavored to teach you the road to use-\n fulness and happiness, by storing your minds with the guides\n of religion and morality, and the principles of science.

Others, when the time arrives, think it comes too\n soon \u2014 ;that too much remains to be learned \u2014 and feel reluc-\n tant to take what seems a premature, perilous leap into the\n unknown, unexplored scenes of the bustling world.

Nor are you warranted in looking on\n me as a stranger in interest to the institution, to which you\n have been, or may remain attached, or to those who have re-\n ceived their education within it. To find a flourishing col-\n lege, where but a declining school once existed; to see a seat\n of learning, where, within the memory of some now present,\n the savage roamed for prey; to feel assured that those, who\n have been the means of its resuscitation, will save it from\n further relapse, and that the character of the youth who leave\n it, will greatly tend to the continuance and increase of its\n prosperous condition, is as cheering to mo as to any one who\n hears me. Could I be insensible to these considerations,\n there is another which could not fail to be impressive; by the\n kindness of those to whom the superintendence of the institu-\n tion is entrusted, its highest honors have been awarded to me;\n they were gratefully accepted, and the more cherished by a\n reference to those by whom the award was made. The old\n friends of other days, their descendants, and the members of\n a religious society, whose pious zeal in the cause of learning,\n has not only revived our own college, but in another part of\n the state, has restored more than its ancient splendor to one of\n the oldest literary institutions among us, after successive re-\n trogressions. Such an honor, flowing from those near and\n dear to me, is the more valued as its source is the nearer\n home; and in looking at every thing around me, with a retro-\n spect to the last forty years, I may safely say that could the\n same recollections crowd on your mind, as do on mine, you\n would assuredly be convinced that this occasion and this pres-\n ence are impressed upon me with no ordinary emotions.\n</p>\n<p>\n In reminding you of your duties for accomplishing the pur-\n poses of your education, there can be no place more appro-\n priate than this, and, by recurring to the past condition of the\n country around us, in contrast with what it now is, you will\n be reminded of what are the good effects of the enterprise,\n courage and industry of a few men, who redeemed it from its\n savage state.

So we see that fact of nature, (esteemed one of\n the great mysteries,) of the turning of iron, toucht with a load-\n stone, towards the poles, was found out in needles of iron, not\n in bars of iron . 57 So in Holy Writ, we are taught to look to\n small things as composing the greatest; even the kingdom of\n heaven is compared to a grain of mustard seed, not to an acorn\n or nut, but to the least of grain; but it hath in it the property\n and spirit hastily to get up and spread, and it may not be\n irreverently taken as a lesson in all things to man, to resort\n to means however small or insignificant at first view, in\n performing his obligations. Take those which are best cal-\n culati d, in their known effects and operation, to spring up the\n soonest, grow the fastest, spread the widest, multiply the most,\n and best fructify the field you cultivate, whether by the labors\n of the mind or the body. Look well to the small grains of\n human happiness, the aggregate will make up itself, as the\n old maxim well teaches us, take care of the penny, the pound\n will take care of itself. All great things have small begin-\n nings. Families enlarge to villages \u2014 thence grow towns,\n cities, states, nations; would you truly understand the policy\n of swelling them from the one to the other, trace them to the\n germ, the root; would you know the laws of nature, trace\n them back from their most splendid developements, to their\n primary movements, and if you find truth there, \u201cthe voice\n of nature will cry it up, though the voice of man should cry\n it down . 77 It^better suits and gratifies the pride of man, to\n rather incline from the path of nature than to follow it, to en-\n deavor rather to ascribe an act, an invention, or discovery, to\n his own genius, than to the law or the light of nature and its\n works; hence it ever has been, yet is, and ever will be, a but\n too common endeavor to substitute in their place, the specula-\n tions of theorists. But \u201c-that which is referred to truth, is\n more than that which is referred to opinion , 77 hence \u201cerror\n both proceeded from too great a reverence, and a kind of\n adoration of the mind and understanding of man, by means\n whereof, men have withdrawn too much from the contempla-\n tion of nature and the observations of experience; and have\n tumbled up and down in their own speculations and conceits,\n but of these surpassing opinionators and intellectualists, who\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:ba:ld:addressdelivered00bald:addressdelivered00bald_0014/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 471}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:ba:ld:addressdelivered00bald:addressdelivered00bald_0014/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 942}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:ba:ld:addressdelivered00bald:addressdelivered00bald_0014/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1885}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:ba:ld:addressdelivered00bald:addressdelivered00bald_0014/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3770}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:ba:ld:addressdelivered00bald:addressdelivered00bald_0014/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ad/dr/es/sd/el/iv/er/ed/00/ba/ld/addressdelivered00bald/addressdelivered00bald_0014.jp2", "height": 3770, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 744535}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"14\">\n<p>\n 12\n</p>\n<p>\n are notwithstanding taken for the most sublime and divine\n Philosophers, it was justly said, \u201cMen seek truth in their\n own little world, and not the great common world, for they\n disdain the alphabet of nature, and the prime book of divine\n works, which if they did not, they might perchance by de-\n grees and leisure, after the knowledge of simple letters and\n spelling of syllables, come at last to read perfectly the text\n and volume of the creation.
