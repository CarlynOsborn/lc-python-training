The progress of the physical\n sciences during this period has been truly phenomenal, while other\n branches of learning, such as the mental and moral sciences, history,\n theology, etc., have been comparatively at a stand-still. The reasons\n for this are apparent. The physical sciences are based upon the postu\u00ac\n late of the continuity of law. All ideas of chance, or even of super\u00ac\n natural interference, have been rigidly excluded. This continuity\n of law, founded upon an induction as wide as the range of facts with\u00ac\n in the observation of man, has been the key with which science has\n opened many a door in the arcana of the universe. By it the observ\u00ac\n er is required to classify every phenomenon, and this classification\n is science. But theology, history, and cognate branches have not\n enjoyed hitherto the privileges of the inductive methods. Their\n conclusions have been reached by the natural process of deduction,\n and hence they have watched with jealous eye the advances of the\n opposite method. Viewed in this light, these sciences have been\n comparatively stationary for the want of new revelations or facts in\n order to institute new deductions. Theology in particular has al\u00ac\n ways been rather shy of the advances of science. Science would fain\n form a coalition with her, and hand in hand set out for the discov\u00ac\n ery of even the \u201c hidden things of God.\u201d But theology has always\n treated these advances with distrust, and shown a positive unwilling\u00ac\n ness to acknowledge any obligations to the so-called discoveries of\n the human intellect. But, happily for us, the light is now becoming\n so strong that even the blind may see. The generalizations of science\n are throwing light even upon revelation, so that \u2018\u2018 invisible things of\n Him from the creation of the world are clearly seen, being under-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0010/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 261, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 432}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0010/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 522, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 864}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0010/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1045, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1728}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0010/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2091, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3456}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0010/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/mo/rt/al/it/yo/fs/ou/00/al/le/immortalityofsou00alle/immortalityofsou00alle_0010.jp2", "height": 3456, "width": 2091, "levels": 6, "size": 554598}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"10\">\n<p>\n 4 Introductory Note.\n</p>\n<p>\n stood by the things that are made, even his eternal power and God\u00ac\n head.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n We regard the present age as the dawning of a new era in the\n science of theology. Men no longer seek for truth in musty tomes.\n The voice of antiquity is becoming too distant to be heard clearly\n amid the bustle and activity of a progressive age. Authority itself\n must give a reason for its dicta , or show that they are in harmony\n with established law. This is as it should be. Theology has no\n reason to fear the pride of human intellect. Let it but keep abreast\n of the spirit of the age, and it will command the respect of every\n thinking mind. It is only when theology lags behind, in company\n with ignorance and blind superstition, that it provokes the contempt\n of science. It has long been the complaint of theologians that sci\u00ac\n ence seeks to reduce every thing to the crucible of experiment. This\n \u201ccrucible of experiment \u201d is a very indefinite phrase; but if it is\n meant that all facts or truths should be subjected to a thorough ex\u00ac\n amination to demonstrate the presence or absence of law, then give\n us the \u201c crucible \u201d all the time.\n</p>\n<p>\n He who is accustomed to observing the \u201c signs of the times \u201d has\n not failed to note the fact that after so long and bitter oppression\n theology is at last availing itself of the postulates of science in the\n demonstration even of fundamental truths. We might adduce the\n works of the Duke of Argyll, Henry Drummond, and a host of others\n in evidence of this fact. We owe these pioneers in this new field of\n theological investigation our profoundest gratitude.\n</p>\n<p>\n And why should we not avail ourselves of every means afforded\n us of demonstrating the truth of our holy religion? If science can\n give us any help, then why despise it? The laws of God are eter\u00ac\n nally the same, and are never in conflict with each other, whatever\n may be the form of their expression. Call them \u201c laws of nature \u201d\n or \u201claws of grace,\u201d it matters not; they are but different expressions\n of the same principles pervading all things. If science can, by its\n inductions, discover to us the mode of action of any principle or law\n in the natural world, we may not be surprised to observe the same\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0011/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 261, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 432}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0011/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 522, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 864}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0011/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1045, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1728}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0011/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2091, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3456}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0011/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/mo/rt/al/it/yo/fs/ou/00/al/le/immortalityofsou00alle/immortalityofsou00alle_0011.jp2", "height": 3456, "width": 2091, "levels": 6, "size": 511947}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"11\">\n<p>\n Introductory Note .\n</p>\n<p>\n 5\n</p>\n<p>\n mode of operation in what is called the spiritual world. If we find\n it will not work, something is wrong either with the induction or\n with our received theology. Seek, then, for the truth. Surely we\n have nothing to gain by the establishment of a false theology any\n more than a false science. What we want is the truth, whenceso\u00ac\n ever it may come. The time has come for the Church to cease re\u00ac\n garding all scientists as incarnate demons seeking her disruption\n and ruin. They have more than once proven to be her best friends.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many of the so-called \u201cconflicts\u201d of science and religion have al\u00ac\n ready fallen in line with accepted truth, and are now employed in\n the inculcation of the faith of the gospel of Christ. The God of nat\u00ac\n ure is the Gpd of revelation. He has revealed his glory not only\n through the word of inspiration, but he makes the \u201c heavens de\u00ac\n clare\u201d the same, and the \u201cfirmament to show his handiwork.\u201d\n Science and religion are therefore inseparable. \u201c What God has\n joined together\u201d let no man with ignorant presumption \u201cput asun\u00ac\n der.\u201d Theology is everywhere beginning to recognize this truth,\n and in consequence the same old doctrines of revelation stand out\n before us in clearer light. Nor is this light the less valuable in that\n it enables us to distinguish between the opinions of men and the\n truth of God. What in the twilight of our knowledge we fondly\n supposed to be living verities are now known to be only the em\u00ac\n balmed mummies of tradition, while the real truths of revelation ap\u00ac\n pear with even greater certainty.\n</p>\n<p>\n For these results we are largely indebted to that class of scientific\n theologians who have fearlessly applied the inductions of science in\n support of the evidences of Christianity\u2014a class, we are glad to see,\n which is everywhere rapidly increasing.

Many facts which formerly were\n regarded as diametrically opposed to revelation are now among the\n props of our faith. And it may be that what now appears to us the\n noise of battle between the contending hosts shall prove in the light\n of the coming day but the soughing of the bellows and the clang of\n the hammers forging for us a citadel of impregnable truth. But still\n there are probably as many scientists who are ignorant of theology\n as there are theologians who are ignorant of science, and there is\n little doubt that along the line of this mutual ignorance most of our\n \u201c conflicts \u201d come. The better they become known to each other\n the more hope of a permanent union. As already intimated, many\n of the greatest minds in both of these departments of study are now\n endeavoring to encompass this end. Through their combined ef\u00ac\n forts we may yet learn that there are many great truths in the uni\u00ac\n verse of God never before dreamed of in our philosophy.\n</p>\n<p>\n And now in this same general line comes the present volume.\n We hail it with greatest pleasure, and bespeak for the author a\n gracious reception at the hands of the reading public. We feel a\n peculiar pride and pleasure in this work, coming as it does from our\n old friend and preceptor in the things of God. Of the author\u2019s abil\u00ac\n ity and fitness for the task he has essayed, the book itself is evidence.\n Gifted by nature and by grace, he has brought to this undertaking a\n mind well stored with facts and a heart filled with love to God and\n man. An earnest Christian, a progressive theologian, and a prac\u00ac\n tical scientist, he unites the qualifications necessary for the faithful\n investigation of the subjects he has in hand. In many respects the\n field of his investigations is entirely new. He explores territory but\n faintly outlined by those who have gone before. But his tread is\n confident, and the result of his work such as to command the respect\u00ac\n ful and serious attention of all thoughtful readers.\n</p>\n<p>\n Perhaps it would be too much to say that all of the author\u2019s con\u00ac\n clusions will meet with universal assent.

Thus the term includes all matter,,\n and whatever else exists, both of this earth and of all\n worlds, with all the phenomena connected therewith, all\n organisms with the life that is manifested in them; and\n since life in the organism often evidences the presence of\n mind-intelligence of various degrees, this mind also comes\n under nature\u2019s domain, as declared above.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is not a question now of the liow , the what, or the why\n of things; in many respects these are inscrutable, and may\n ever remain so.

These are\n \u201c dispartate from the world of sense.\u201d Phenomena\u2014objects\n of sense\u2014classified, reveal to the mind laws, which are\n thus matter of pure reason. Thus science is solely based on\n the establishment of laws, and thus itself becomes matter\n of pure reason.

The term will be fifty thousand and one,\n and the same regular succession will continue, the five mill\u00ac\n ionth and the fifty millionth term will still appear in their\n expected order, and one unbroken chain of natural num\u00ac\n bers will pass before your eyes from one up to one hundred\n millions.

Life, Origin of. The introduction of life upon our\n earth has been the great puzzle to scientists. There cer\u00ac\n tainly was a time when there was no life upon our globe.\n Then life appeared. The how, the what, the whence, have\n been the great questions. The most prominent scientists,\n habitually referriug all phenomena to the forces of nature,\n working in regular sequence under the laws of matter, ad\u00ac\n mit of no explanation outside of the realm of matter and\n material forces. Did life, then, originate in the realm of\n matter? Can it be accounted for by the interaction of\n material atoms under the operation of known molecular\n and chemic forces?\n</p>\n<p>\n The question has been extensively submitted to the test\n of experiments. One party answered the above questions\n affirmatively, embracing the doctrine known as abiogenesis,\n appealing to the results of hundreds of experiments by dif\u00ac\n ferent observers as proofs of abiogenesis. Another party\n answered the questions negatively, appealing also to the re\u00ac\n sults of their experiments, which seemed to prove that life\n comes only from antecedent life, or the truth of the doc\u00ac\n trine known as biogenesis.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is not our purpose to discuss the question at any\n length. Suffice it to say that the advocates of biogenesis\n have been triumphant all along the line, and that now no\n true scientist will affirm the truth of abiogenesis. Huxley\n and Tyndall, the leading scientists of the age, declare that\n there is no scintilla of evidence that in our day life has\n been produced where there were no germs of antecedent\n life; yet strangely enough they think, or seem to think,\n that in primordial days matter may have been in such a\n state as to produce life spontaneously. Upon this we sim\u00ac\n ply remark, if that be so, the elements have changed their\n nature during the progress of the ages, and the Hydrogen,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0044/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 261, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 432}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0044/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 522, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 864}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0044/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1045, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1728}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0044/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2091, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3456}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0044/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/mo/rt/al/it/yo/fs/ou/00/al/le/immortalityofsou00alle/immortalityofsou00alle_0044.jp2", "height": 3456, "width": 2091, "levels": 6, "size": 568543}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"44\">\n<p>\n 38 Immortality of the Soul Voiced by Nature ,\n</p>\n<p>\n Oxygen, Nitrogen, and Carbon (the chief elements of the or\u00ac\n ganic cell) of primeval time were not the same elements that\n we now find them; and what becomes of the regular unvary\u00ac\n ing sequence of things and the orderly working of nature ?\n</p>\n<p>\n Discussing this question, the authors of the \u201cUnseen\n Universe \u201d say (pp. 229, 230) that \u201c dead matter cannot pro\u00ac\n duce a living organism is the universal experience of the\n most eminent physiologists\u2014in fact, the law of biogenesis\n is justly regarded by Prof. Huxley and others as the great\n principle underlying all the phenomena of organized ex\u00ac\n istence.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Prof. Eoscoe, again, approaching the subject from the\n chemical point of view, says, speaking of red blood cor\u00ac\n puscles: \u201cWe have not been able, and the evidence at\n present rather goes to show that there is not much hope of\n our being able, to construct these granules artificially; and\n the case is in this position, that, so far as science has pro\u00ac\n gressed at present, we have not been able to obtain any\n organism without the intervention of some sort of pre\u00ac\n existing germ.\u201d \u201c If we assume the truth of this principle\n it appears to lead us directly to infer that life is not mere\u00ac\n ly a species of energy, or a phenomenon of matter.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n We take it, then, as settled in science that life comes only\n from antecedent life, and that it is incompetent for the\n forces of nature to produce life.

This result, it seems to us, might have been deduced\n by a priori reasoning. Thus: The organic cell of which\n all organisms are built up is composed of atoms of Oxygen^\n Hydrogen, Nitrogen, and Carbon. These several elements\n have their natural affinities for each other, according to the\n well-known laws of chemistry, and in combining with each\n other, in whatever ratios, always obey those laws. Now\n nothing is more certain than that the organic cell is such\n an unstable compound that its elements are only held to\u00ac\n gether by the presence of life; bereft of this it at once be\u00ac\n gins to dissolve into its elements. Now it may well be asked,\n What is it that holds in abeyance the natural chemical affin\u00ac\n ities of the several elements, and compels them, despite\n those affinities, to unite to form the cell? We take it that\n only one answer can be given to this question\u2014viz., the\n life force. We call life a force, though we hold it to be an\n entity exerting a force peculiar to itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n Again, an unstable equilibrium can only be maintained\n by a force external to itself; but the organic cell is an un\u00ac\n stable equilibrium, and when the life is withdrawn, the cell ?\n and the entire structure of which it forms a part, speedily\n falls to pieces, decomposes, is resolved into its element, the\n presence of life being necessary to the maintenance of the\n equilibrium. It would seem therefore impossible that the\n equilibrium should have been attained without the con\u00ac\n structor presence of life, since that would be making the\n result a cause of itself manifestly absurd.\n</p>\n<p>\n On this subject the authors of the \u201c Unseen Universe\u201d say\n (p. 186): \u201c The body owes its delicacy to its chemically\n unstable nature; to a peculiar collection of particles, which\n certainly would not, by virtue of their own mere physical\n forces, have united themselves together as we find them in\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0046/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 261, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 432}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0046/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 522, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 864}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0046/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1045, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1728}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0046/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2091, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3456}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0046/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/mo/rt/al/it/yo/fs/ou/00/al/le/immortalityofsou00alle/immortalityofsou00alle_0046.jp2", "height": 3456, "width": 2091, "levels": 6, "size": 569794}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"46\">\n<p>\n 40\n</p>\n<p>\n Immortality of the Soul Voiced by Nature,\n</p>\n<p>\n the body.\u201d The life, then, is the builder of the organism,\n and not a function of it\u2014 i. e., proceeding from, and due to,\n the organism. \u201cThe builder of the house is greater than\n it.\u201d (Paul.)

If we understand Mr. Spencer\u2019s theory, as set forth\n at length in his \u201c Biology,\u201d it is that vibrations are caused\n by the proper stimulants among the molecules of the nerves\n of sense (peculiar to each organ), and by them transmitted\n to the brain, whose molecules are thus set in vibration, and\n the results of these vibrations of the brain-matter are sensa\u00ac\n tions, perceptions, thoughts, etc. Thus the vibrations of ether,\n falling upon the retina, set up corresponding vibrations in\n the optic nerve, terminating in a peculiar vibration\u2019 of the\n brain molecules, which gives the sensation of sight; or,\n rather, we should say, on the basis of this theory, is the\n sensation or perception of sight. And so of the auditory\n nerves, set in motion by the vibrations of the atmosphere,\n or other substances capable of causing such vibrations; and\n so of all the organs of sense.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, if this be true, it would seem that whenever the\n vibrations of any nerve of sense are sent to the brain, that\n sense must be called consciously into exercise.

We\n consider this life to be connected with the organism by what\n we have called the mental aura (perhaps a segregated por\u00ac\n tion of ether), by which it is able to control the movements\n of its house. And, until more fully informed on the sub\u00ac\n ject, this mental aura may perhaps be considered as\n the soul\u2019s habitat, identical with, or allied with, the spiritual\n body which Paul, more than eighteen centuries ago, de\u00ac\n clared that men possess, telling us \u201cthat if our earthly\n house [the body] of this tabernacle were dissolved, we have\n [not will have] a building of God, a house not made with\n hands [not material], eternal in the heavens.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0055/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 261, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 432}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0055/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 522, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 864}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0055/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1045, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1728}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0055/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2091, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3456}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0055/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/mo/rt/al/it/yo/fs/ou/00/al/le/immortalityofsou00alle/immortalityofsou00alle_0055.jp2", "height": 3456, "width": 2091, "levels": 6, "size": 515941}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"55\">\n<p>\n 49\n</p>\n<p>\n And Christianity in Accord with Science.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00a7 22. Nature of Life continued. Before proceeding fur\u00ac\n ther in our investigation, we propose to consider somewhat\n at length, as being in the purview of our line of thought, the\n nature of life under the aspect of it presented by Mr. Spen\u00ac\n cer in his \u201c Principles of Biology.\u201d Mr. Spencer writes as fol\u00ac\n lows (\u201cBiology,\u201d p. 74): \u201c Our conception of life becomes the\n definite combination of heterogeneous changes, both simul\u00ac\n taneous and successive, in correspondence with external co\u00ac\n existence and sequences.\u201d And on page 80 he says: \u201cThe\n broadest and most complete definition of life will be the\n continuous adjustment of internal relations to external rela\u00ac\n tions.\u201d And in illustration he says: \u201c The actions going on\n in a plant presuppose a surrounding medium, containing at\n least carbonic acid and water, together with a supply of\n light and a certain temperature. Within the leaves Carbon is\n being assimilated and Oxygen given off; without them is the\n gas from which the Carbon is being abstracted, and the im\u00ac\n ponderable agents that aid the abstraction. Be the nature\n of the process what it may, it is clear that there are external\n elements prone to undergo special re-arrangements under\n special conditions. It is clear that the plant in sunshine\n presents these conditions, and so effects these re-arrange\u00ac\n ments ; and thus it is clear that the changes that constitute\n the plant\u2019s life are in correspondence with co-existence in\n its environment.\u201d And so in every living being.\n</p>\n<p>\n We simply take occasion to remark that the changes Mr.\n Spencer speaks of clearly do not constitute the plant\u2019s life,\n but are simply phenomena indicating the presence of that life.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spencer, in his 6th chapter, page 82, says: \u201c The de\u00ac\n gree of life varies as the degree of correspondence.\u201d \u201cAl\u00ac\n lowing a margin for perturbations, the life will continue only\n while the correspondence continues; the completeness of this\n life will be proportionate to the completeness of the corre\u00ac\n spondence, and the life will be perfect only when the corre\u00ac\n spondence is perfect.\u201d Again (page 88) he says: \u201cAs afford-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0056/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 261, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 432}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0056/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 522, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 864}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0056/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1045, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1728}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0056/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2091, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3456}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0056/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/mo/rt/al/it/yo/fs/ou/00/al/le/immortalityofsou00alle/immortalityofsou00alle_0056.jp2", "height": 3456, "width": 2091, "levels": 6, "size": 491291}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"56\">\n<p>\n 50 Immortality of the Soul Voiced by Nature .\n</p>\n<p>\n ing the simplest and most conclusive proof that the degree of\n life varies as the degree of correspondence, it remains to\n point out that perfect correspondence would be perfect life\n were there no changes in the environment, but such as the\n organism had adapted changes to meet; and, were it never\n to fail in the efficiency with which it met them, there would\n be eternal existence and universal knowledge .\u201d (Italics ours.)\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00a7 23. Following the line of thought thus clearly indicat\u00ac\n ed by Mr. Spencer, we perceive that where there are no\n correspondences, no adjustments of internal relations to ex\u00ac\n ternal relations, there is, there can be, no life. This is death.\n Thus in the mineral, as the crystal, there being no corre\u00ac\n spondence whatever between internal and external relations,\n there is death\u2014the mineral is dead, a mere thing. And\n in the plant, the correspondences having only relation to the\n vegetal life, the plant is dead to the higher, the animal life.\n Thus also in the animal, the correspondences being solely be\u00ac\n tween the internal and the things in the external visible\n environment\u2014that is, the adjustment of internal relations to\n relations in the material universe surrounding it\u2014the ani\u00ac\n mal is, must be, forever dead to the higher life in the do\u00ac\n main of the spiritual.

Every other\n genus of that early time sooner or later numbered only ex\u00ac\n tinct species; afterward, in the lower silurian, nautilus\n and a few others were added to discina.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Such unbroken lines prove the oneness of plan or sys\u00ac\n tem throughout geological history.

On the Darwin\u00ac\n ian hypothesis of evolution it must result, as the progressive\n variations would only be permanent, so as to attain to specif\u00ac\n ic differentiation, when the individuals were adapted to their\n environment, and this is all the law means.

Law of Instinct.

Thus: That propen\u00ac\n sity or tendency in every animal to present the power of\n faculty within to that in the environment to which it is\n adapted or adjusted; and, further, the propensity to do that ,\n whatever it may be, that is necessary to reproduction and\n the preservation of its offspring. Or, instinct is a blind,\n innate impulse, from a nervous organization and corre\u00ac\n sponding disposition, directing all the individuals of the\n same species to the same ends by the use of the same means.\n This law of instinct is so universal, so manifested in all an\u00ac\n imals, that it is difficult to choose from the great mass of\n facts appropriate illustrations.\n</p>\n<p>\n It must be observed as necessary to the very idea of in\u00ac\n stinct, and as an essential part of the law, that whatever it\n leads the animal to do, the environment contains a somewhat\n answering to, adjusted to\u2014 meeting the act to which the in\u00ac\n stinct leads. Thus, the new-born mammal immediately , instinct\u00ac\n ively seeks the teat; therefore, there must be in the environ\u00ac\n ment a teat answering to the instinct. The teat proves the\n instinct, and the instinct proves the teat as well. The op\u00ac\n erations of this law of instinct are seen everywhere, in all\n animals in thousands of different ways; in every animal\n seeking its appropriate food, as the mammal in sucking, the\n chicken in scratching, etc.; in the pairing of male and female\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0085/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 261, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 432}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0085/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 522, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 864}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0085/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1045, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1728}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0085/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2091, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3456}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0085/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/mo/rt/al/it/yo/fs/ou/00/al/le/immortalityofsou00alle/immortalityofsou00alle_0085.jp2", "height": 3456, "width": 2091, "levels": 6, "size": 475795}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"85\">\n<p>\n Christianity in Accord with Science. 79\n</p>\n<p>\n of every species; in the care of parents for their offspring;\n in the nesting of birds and reptiles; in the provision made\n by insects for the preservation of offspring they are never\n to see; in the preparation of many insects for their meta\u00ac\n morphosis; and in the work of certain insects necessary to\n the propagation of certain plants, showing the correlation\n between the vegetable and the animal kingdom.\n</p>\n<p>\n We proceed to give a number of illustrations sufficient\n to make the subject clear to the reader and to establish the\n law.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00a7 44. 1.

Be\u00ac\n sides, in most of the instances cited, neither of these hypoth\u00ac\n eses will account for the origin of the instinct. For in\u00ac\n stance, how came Mr. Mivait\u2019s wasp (4), in the first place, to\n sting the spider in that particular point necessary to the de\u00ac\n sired result ? Was it accidental ? and repeated accidentally\n until it became a habit so as to be transmitted to its prog\u00ac\n eny?\n</p>\n<p>\n And what of the case of the stag-beetle (5), perhaps the\n most wonderful of all these wonders ? Is that also hered\u00ac\n ity? No; instinct is intelligent and wise, wondrously\n selecting means, and skillfully adjusting effort to ends.\n The intelligence does not reside in the animal; the wisdom\n does not belong to it. There must have been a Creator,\n who did both know and intend that his creatures should do\n just these things and nothing else. Instinct must be the\n intelligence of the Creator in the animal. The unreasoning,\n unintelligent animal works unerringly, because the inspira\u00ac\n tion of the All-wise makes it wise without reason and be\u00ac\n yond reason.\n</p>\n<p>\n Instinct, as a law of nature, is God\u2019s way of working in\n the animal for its own good and his own glory\u2014his way of\n working.\n</p>\n<p>\n Finally, we lay it down as a law of nature, universal and\n incontrovertible, that there is in every case a somewhat in\n the environment that answers , is adjusted to, the instinct. There\n is, there can be, absolutely no exception to the law, and this\n we lay down comprehensively as the law of instinct.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0088/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 261, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 432}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0088/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 522, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 864}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0088/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1045, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1728}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0088/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2091, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3456}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0088/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/mo/rt/al/it/yo/fs/ou/00/al/le/immortalityofsou00alle/immortalityofsou00alle_0088.jp2", "height": 3456, "width": 2091, "levels": 6, "size": 404453}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"88\">\n<p>\n 82 Immortality of the Soul Voiced by Nature.\n</p>\n<p>\n It has been asserted that instinct always works for the\n good of the animal and the species, and that therefore it\n is the product of natural selection.

Since that time there has been\n an equilibrium maintained by the operation of vegetable\n and animal life, the latter absorbing the Oxygen and emit\u00ac\n ting C0 2 , while the former absorbed C0 2 , and emitted Oxy\u00ac\n gen, thus maintaining the equilibrium. We observe also, as\n partly accounting for the uniform warm temperature of the\n earth in all latitudes in those earlier eras, that the atmos\u00ac\n phere acts as a blanket, absorbing and retaining the heat\n from the sun, and also preventing the rapid radiation of that\n from the earth\u2019s interior heat. In those earlier eras the\n blanket was thicker, so that the remains of animals of types\n now existing only in temperate or tropical or sub-tropical\n regions are found in the higher, even the arctic latitudes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus it is seen that the law of adaptation has always and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0103/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 261, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 432}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0103/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 522, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 864}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0103/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1045, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1728}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0103/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2091, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3456}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0103/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/mo/rt/al/it/yo/fs/ou/00/al/le/immortalityofsou00alle/immortalityofsou00alle_0103.jp2", "height": 3456, "width": 2091, "levels": 6, "size": 481416}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"103\">\n<p>\n Christianity in Accord with Science. 97\n</p>\n<p>\n everywhere controlled, both in the vegetable and animal\n kingdoms.\n</p>\n<p>\n Anterior to the carboniferous era, as said before, the at\u00ac\n mosphere must have been so surcharged with carbon diox\u00ac\n ide, and so deficient in Oxygen, as to be utterly unfit for\n animal life of the higher grade.

Thus an animal having no eyes is dead\n to light; but under the law of heredity it would happen,\n if its ancestors had eyes, that an instinct of the lost power\n would remain, and consequently a certain unrest, from a\n failure in the correspondence natural to the animal in that\n particular respect, would result. Just this, we take it, is\n the case with man; his instincts of prayer, worship, and ac\u00ac\n countability (to be considered presently) are what remains\n of a faculty belonging to the progenitors of the race, where\u00ac\n by they had a consciousness of the divine presence\u2014com\u00ac\n munion with God\u2014which constituted their spiritual life.\n This consciousness being lost through their lapse from a\n state of rectitude, there remains, under the law of heredity,\n these instincts looking out, searching restlessly for their\n natural correspondence in the unseen environment. Science,\n it seems to us, is compelled by its great law of continuity\n to predicate of this instinct as of all others; it has its\u201ecor-\n respondence, is adjusted to something in the environment.\n But manifestly there is nothing in the visible environment\n answering to it; indeed, there cannot be, from the very\n nature of the instinct.\n</p>\n<p>\n It must be admitted, then, by true science to have its cor\u00ac\n respondence in the invisible environment, to be adjusted to\n a power in the unseen universe, even to the \u201c force that makes\n for righteousness,\u201d which science is compelled to recognize.\n But men do not pray to a wall, to dead matter, or to deaf\n force; the very nature of the instinct forbids this, makes it\n even absurd.

We allude to\n that in man, manifested in all races and all ages, that leads\n him to worship some real or imagined supreme being or\n beings, or things which are conceived to represent such\n being.\n</p>\n<p>\n We note a strong evidence of this worshiping instinct in\n the positivists of to-day, who, having dethroned God, striv\u00ac\n ing to blot out the very idea of his existence, have found it\n necessary, impelled by this instinct, to establish a worship\n of humanity. What stronger proof can be asked ?\n</p>\n<p>\n Since writing the above, we have read a paper on \u201c Evolu\u00ac\n tion of Theology,\u201d by Huxley {Nineteenth Century for April,\n 1886, p. 493), from which we make the following extract:\n</p>\n<p>\n A theological system.exhibiting the same fundamental\n</p>\n<p>\n conceptions respecting the continued existence and incessant inter\u00ac\n ference in human affairs of disembodied spirits prevails, or formerly\n prevailed, among the whole of the inhabitants of the Polynesian\n and Melanesian Islands, and among the people of Australia, not\u00ac\n withstanding the wide differences in physical character and in grade\n of civilization which obtain among them.

Instinct of Accountability. There is also found\n in all men in all ages what may be called an instinct of ac\u00ac\n countability. It cannot be denied that mankind has always\n given evidence of this feeling\u2014not simply accountability to\n one another, to society, and to the government under which\n they were living, but to an unseen power; to the God or\n gods who had, or were imagined to have, control over the\n destinies of men.

Hence the smoking altars, the sacrifices that\n have been offered from of old among all peoples. Search\n wherever we will, in the history of whatever people of an\u00ac\n cient or modern times, this fact stares us in the face: Bl ood,\n for sin, has ever flowed upon millions of altars in every\n part of the world and among all nations. The question has\n ever arisen in the human heart, \u201cHow shall I propitiate the\n gods? Shall I give the fruit of my body for the sins of\n my soul? or will multiplied oblations suffice?\u201d This\n instinct, for undoubtedly its universality compels its recog\u00ac\n nition as an instinct, cognizes a Supreme Ruler, whose law\n it is man\u2019s bounden duty to obey. Now, remembering that\n under the universal law of instinct in any animal any in\u00ac\n stinct whatever has, and must have, in the environment,\n that to which it is adjusted\u2014its correspondence\u2014science\n must recognize in the environment a somewhat to which\n this instinct corresponds, and since there is nothing, there\n can be nothing to which it is adjusted in the visible universe,\n then its correspondence must be sought in the unseen universe.\n This instinct, then, also brings us face to face with God.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0115/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 261, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 432}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0115/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 522, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 864}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0115/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1045, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1728}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0115/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2091, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3456}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0115/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/mo/rt/al/it/yo/fs/ou/00/al/le/immortalityofsou00alle/immortalityofsou00alle_0115.jp2", "height": 3456, "width": 2091, "levels": 6, "size": 481508}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"115\">\n<p>\n And Christianity in Accord with Science. 109\n</p>\n<p>\n Before proceeding further in our argument, we pause to\n point out that all these elements in man\u2019s nature bring him\n into relation to the invisible; and, while they furnish us a\n broad, well-defined line of demarkation, unmistakably sepa\u00ac\n rating man from animals, they as certainly demand his\n continued existence in the invisible universe under the\n great law of continuity universally accepted by scientists.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00a7 71.

Does\n nature tell us any thing of its beginning, nature, and direc\u00ac\n tion? Let us see.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. We have seen that evolution on the first line was of\n dead matter alone, in preparation of a home for organic life,\n and that the evolution toward a perfected world was car\u00ac\n ried on by the properties of dead matter assisted by living\n organisms under the directive agency of the Supreme Will.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

From\n the principles established in Sections 22, 23, as deduced from\n Mr. Spencer\u2019s definition, noting that they are necessarily\n applicable to all life, we are inevitably led to the conclu\u00ac\n sion that the natural man (in his state of unnature) is, and\n must forever remain, dead to the life of the spiritual king\u00ac\n dom of God, since there is in him no correspondence of\n the internal attributes with his spiritual environment, no\n adjustment of \u201cthe internal relations to the external rela\u00ac\n tions,\u201d which are the environing spirit of God, and we\n find this fact abundantly affirmed in the Christian Script\u00ac\n ures\u2014indeed, lying at the very foundation of their system\n of truth.

And as exercise is essential to the strength and\n proper growth of the animal, so is use (exercise) essential to\n</p>\n<p>\n *See how, in accordance with these deductions of science, Paul\n states the ' fundamental principles of the Christian system. (i For the\n law of the spirit of life in Christ Jesus hath made me free from\n the law of sin and death. For what the law could not do, in that it\n was weak through the flesh, God sending his own Son in the like\u00ac\n ness of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin in the flesh; that\n the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not\n after the flesh, but after the spirit. For they that are after the\n flesh do mind the things of the flesh; but they that are after the\n spirit the things of the spirit. For to be carnally minded is death;\n but to be spiritually minded is life and peace. Because the carml\n mind is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God,\n neither indeed can be. So then they that are in the flesh cannot\n please God. But ye are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if so\n be that the Spirit of God dwell in you. Now if any man have not\n the spirit of Christ, he is none of his. And if Christ be in you, the\n body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of right\u00ac\n eousness. . . . Therefore, brethren, we are debtors not to the\n</p>\n<p>\n flesh, to live after the flesh. For if ye live after the flesh ye shall\n die; but if ye through the spirit do mortify [kill] the deeds of the\n body, ye shall live. For as many as are led by the Spirit of God,\n they are the sons of God.\u201d (Rom. viii. 2, et seq. to verse 14.)\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0144/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 261, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 432}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0144/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 522, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 864}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0144/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1045, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1728}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0144/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2091, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3456}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:mo:rt:al:it:yo:fs:ou:00:al:le:immortalityofsou00alle:immortalityofsou00alle_0144/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/mo/rt/al/it/yo/fs/ou/00/al/le/immortalityofsou00alle/immortalityofsou00alle_0144.jp2", "height": 3456, "width": 2091, "levels": 6, "size": 501583}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"144\">\n<p>\n 138 Immortality of the Soul Voiced by Nature,\n</p>\n<p>\n the spiritual growth of the Christian. \u201c To him that hath\n shall be given;\u201d and as in nature unused faculties are\n taken away (as sight from the cavern fish), so the unused\n grace shall be taken from the Christian\u2014\u201c take from him\n the talent, and give to him that hath ten talents,\u201d and \u201c from\n him that hath not shall be taken away even that which he\n hath.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00a7 104.

And first it is seen in the sexual and family\n relations foreshadowed in the constitution of vegetal life,\n being especially manifest in the higher division of the phen-\n ogams, while its working is concealed in the cryptogams;\n it becomes markedly manifest in almost all tribes of ani\u00ac\n mate beings, being concealed in a few only of the very low\u00ac\n est tribes, as in the cryptogams.

They could not obey it, \u201c because the carnal\n mind [mind of the flesh] is enmity against God; for it is\n not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can be.\u201d\n How, then, shall men love him? how the impure love in\u00ac\n finite purity? how the vicious love the infinitely good? how\n the guilty love the law that pronounces their doom? how\n the condemned criminal love the judge pronouncing the\n sentence of death? How, indeed?\n</p>\n<p>\n The chief glory of Christianity lies Just here. Not that\n it propounded a new law\u2014that was impossible.
