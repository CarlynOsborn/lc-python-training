While he was\n receiving it from a kind Friar, he gave him\n a history of himself, and told him for what\n purpose he had come into that country. At\n that time, the inhabitants of Europe, Asia,\n and Africa, did not know that there was any\n other land than those continents, and some\n Inlands not very distant from them. '\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2019 -I most learned men, who were endea-\n vouring to increase their knowledge of geo-\n graphy, thought that the ocean surrounded\n those countries like a great belt, and Christo-\n pher Columbus , the stranger who stood at\n the convent gate, was perhaps the first per-\n son who thought that belt, might be crossed\n to the land on the opposite side ; which was\n supposed to be the eastern part of Asia.

There\n were no sounds of gladness to hail the new\n year of 1781, but it commenced with an event\n that threatened ruin to the American cause.\n That part of the army which was stationed\n near Morristown, in New Jersey, had suffered\n so much for want of clothing and food, that\n they determined to march to Philadelphia\n and force Congress to obtain supplies for\n them, or else threaten that they would no\n longer continue in service. Their command-\n ing officer tried in vain to prevent their doing\n so, and they marched towards Princeton.\n Three officers, to whom the soldiers were at-\n tached, followed them to the place where they\n encamped for the night, and prevailed on them\n to send a sergeant from each regiment to meet\n them and state their complaints, and what\n they intended to demand form Congress.\n They did so, and General Wayne, their com-\n mander, promised that their wishes should be\n made known to Congress, and attended to ;\n and urged them to return to their duty. Gene-\n ral Washington was at that time at New\n Windsor, on the North river, and General\n Wayne immediately sent to him an account\n of this alarming mutiny ; and of the demands\n made by those who were engaged in it.\n Washington was much distressed by their\n conduct ; but he felt that they had cause for\n complaint, and thought that he ought not to go\n to them lest they should disobey him, and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:fe:of:ge:or:ge:wa:sh:00:am:er:_0:lifeofgeorgewash00amer_0:lifeofgeorgewash00amer_0_0167/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 191, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 341}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:fe:of:ge:or:ge:wa:sh:00:am:er:_0:lifeofgeorgewash00amer_0:lifeofgeorgewash00amer_0_0167/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 383, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 682}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:fe:of:ge:or:ge:wa:sh:00:am:er:_0:lifeofgeorgewash00amer_0:lifeofgeorgewash00amer_0_0167/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 766, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1364}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:fe:of:ge:or:ge:wa:sh:00:am:er:_0:lifeofgeorgewash00amer_0:lifeofgeorgewash00amer_0_0167/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1532, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2729}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:fe:of:ge:or:ge:wa:sh:00:am:er:_0:lifeofgeorgewash00amer_0:lifeofgeorgewash00amer_0_0167/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/li/fe/of/ge/or/ge/wa/sh/00/am/er/_0/lifeofgeorgewash00amer_0/lifeofgeorgewash00amer_0_0167.jp2", "height": 2729, "width": 1532, "levels": 6, "size": 321541}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"167\">\n<p>\n WASHINGTON.\n</p>\n<p>\n 169\n</p>\n<p>\n thus deserve a punishment which would pre-\n vent their being willing to return to duty.
