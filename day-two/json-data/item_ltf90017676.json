It is known to be the ablest production, of its\n class, extant in any language. It is the master-piece of\n one of England\u2019s greatest minds. It has ever been regard\u00ac\n ed, since its first publication, as a perfectly unanswerable\n defense of Christianity against the most plausible of all its\n opposers.\n</p>\n<p>\n Butler\u2019s Analogy should be read by all Christians, exam\u00ac\n ined critically and repeatedly by every minister, and faith\u00ac\n fully studied by the students of our schools and colleges.\n That family, which makes it a fireside reading-book, will\n scarcely be troubled with doubts in religious matters, or\n rear up skeptics from its circle. Those ministers of the\n Gospel, who most frequently consult its pages, will be best\n prepared to meet and master the subtil cavils of the wicked.\n The pupils of that seminary of learning, where this Analogy\n is made a prominent text-book, under whose influence all\n must pass prior to graduation, will receive a bias to religion,\n which subsequent years will serve only to strengthen.\n</p>\n<p>\n To these three classes of readers this edition has been\n carefully adapted. It is expressly intended for the use of\n families, ministers, and students; and under the latter class\n are included young ministers during their course of prepar\u00ac\n atory study.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Analysis, prepared by the Editor expressly for this\n edition, is to be met with in no other. It contains the argu\u00ac\n ment of every chapter, and furnishes, in every place, a key\n to the author\u2019s meaning.

If the soul be no larger than an atom of matter, it\n may not be capable of dissolution;\n</p>\n<p>\n 2.

(1) Because of our capacity for happiness and misery, and, es\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n pecially, as that happiness and misery may depend upon\n our present conduct.\n</p>\n<p>\n (2) But, in this life, we know that all our happiness, and a\n great part of our misery, are put in our own power.\n</p>\n<p>\n 69. (3) There are many very probable reasons, why the Author of\n</p>\n<p>\n nature should make our happiness and misery to depend on\n our own actions.\n</p>\n<p>\n 70. (4) And this connection between our actions and our present\n</p>\n<p>\n happiness and misery is certainly to .be ascribed to the\n course of nature, that is, to Him who makes nature to be\n what it is.\n</p>\n<p>\n 71. (5) But we cannot infer from this, that we are, therefore,\n</p>\n<p>\n called upon to gratify every passion which may give us\n present pleasure, any more than we are to see every object\n capable of being beheld by our natural vision.\n</p>\n<p>\n 71. (6) But we are to conclude, from this natural connection\n between our conduct and our condition, that we are under\n the government of Him who formed the connection.\n</p>\n<p>\n 73. (7) The true conception, then, of the Author of nature is that\n of a master or governor, even prior to the consideration\n of his moral attributes.\n</p>\n<p>\n 73. (8) And there is, consequently, nothing incredible in the gen\u00ac\n eral doctrine of religion, that God will reward and punish\n men for their actions hereafter.\n</p>\n<p>\n The doctrine of future punishment sustained.\n</p>\n<p>\n 73.

(5) It is confessed, that happiness and misery are not\n</p>\n<p>\n always distributed according to merit and demerit, but\n frequently by way of discipline.\n</p>\n<p>\n 92. (6) God, then, has declared himself to be on the side of\n</p>\n<p>\n virtue, and against vice, in the general administration\n of the world, and he who falls in with this administra\u00ac\n tion is rewarded by a peculiar pleasure.\n</p>\n<p>\n 93.

(1) Propriety of examining the doctrine of necessity.\n</p>\n<p>\n 137. (2) We should know, whether the supposed necessity, existing\n</p>\n<p>\n in nature, is reconcilable with the natural government\n of God, before we pronounce it irreconcilable with his\n moral government; and if we find no fatality or foreordina\u00ac\n tion which excludes free deliberation and choice in our\n natural relations, we may not expect to find any thing of\n this kind to hinder or limit our freewill in respect to our\n moral conduct.\n</p>\n<p>\n 138. (3) Though God is said to exist by a kind of necessity, it\n</p>\n<p>\n cannot be said that all othfer things exist in the same man\u00ac\n ner.\n</p>\n<p>\n 139. (4) Necessity as much demands a necessary agent, as freedom\n</p>\n<p>\n demands a free agent, to be the former of the world, and\n proves nothing against the intelligence and design manifest\u00ac\n ed in creation. It supposes, then, an intelligent Designer,\n who acts from choice, that is, acts freely, and virtually\n destroys the idea of necessity. In other words, the doc\u00ac\n trine of necessity, or fatality, or fixed foreordination, is\n self-destructive.\n</p>\n<p>\n 140. (5) But, if the doctrine of a supposed necessity does not destroy\n</p>\n<p>\n the proof of there being an intelligent and free natural\n Governor of the world, we are prepared to believe it may\n not exclude the idea of a free and intelligent moral Gov\u00ac\n ernor of it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 140. (6) The doctrine of necessity, or of fixed foreordination, when\n applied to the conduct of this life, becomes a dangerous\n absurdity, leading us into summary mistakes and misery;\n from which we have a right to conclude, that, applied to\n our conduct in reference to a future state of being, it will\n not be less fallacious.\n</p>\n<p>\n 143.

The existence of a moral sense\n proves, that there is a distinction between wrong and right,\n and that there is a rule of life, by which we must govern\n our conduct, or be self-condemned.

It has been professed by a great part of the\n human family from the beginning of authentic history,\n and tradition carries it back even to the first ages; from\n which we are naturally led to conclude, either that it lies\n stamped upon the very frame-work of nature, and so comes\n naturally, and easily, and universally into the human mind,\n or that it was given at the first by revelation.\n</p>\n<p>\n 150.

It is conceded, that the treatise is not entirely conclusive\n</p>\n<p>\n or satisfactory; but it is enough so to answer the end for\n which it is intended; for it shows the evidence of relig\u00ac\n ion to be sufficient to prove and discipline the virtue\n which it presupposes and wishes to encourage.\n</p>\n<p>\n 308. 5.

Concerning this faculty, proved to exist by\n consciousness, by observation, by the daily exercise of it\n on both real and feigned objects, by language, by many\n written treatises, by our sense of gratitude, and by our\n distinguishing between injury, harm, and punishment, sev\u00ac\n eral things are to be distinctly noted:\n</p>\n<p>\n 332. 1. The object of this faculty is actions, including active or\n</p>\n<p>\n motive principles.\n</p>\n<p>\n 333. 2. Our perception of actions, as morally good or evil,\n</p>\n<p>\n implies in it a sense of them as of good or ill deserving.\n 335. 3. This perception of vice and ill desert, arises from a\n</p>\n<p>\n comparison of actions with the nature and capacities\n of the agent.\n</p>\n<p>\n 335. 4. It should be considered, whether we have more right to\n</p>\n<p>\n make ourselves miserable without reason, than to make\n others so. It is this consideration by which prudence is\n seen to be a virtue.\n</p>\n<p>\n 337. 5. Benevolence, so great a part of virtue, is not the whole\n</p>\n<p>\n of it; and benevolence to one person, rather than, or\n more than to another, may be a virtue, and falsehood,\n violence and injustice, vice in us, independent of either\n the good or evil consequences respectively produced by\n them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 339. ( 1) If, now, we are endowed with such a moral fac\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n ulty, the natural object of which is moral actions,\n moral government must consist in rendering us\n happy or unhappy, by rewarding or punishing us,\n according as we follow or abandon this rule of ac\u00ac\n tion recorded in our nature.\n</p>\n<p>\n 339. (2) It is, then, a great error, though committed by\n</p>\n<p>\n many good men, to make virtue to consist merely in\n promoting the greatest amount of happiness in oth\u00ac\n ers, and vice in doing that which tends evidently to\n an overplus of evil.\n</p>\n<p>\n 340.

They lived together like two\n brothers, reading, writing, and studying together, each\n regarding the other\u2019s welfare dearer than his own. Seeker,\n having studied medicine in addition to his regular course,\n went to Paris with a view to his profession, where, meeting\n with Edward Talbot, son of the Bishop of Durham, he was\n prevailed upon by his new friend to abandon physic and\n devote himself to the Church. Passing over into England,\n he was soon after ordained by Bishop Talbot, received the\n degree of Doctor of Laws at Oxford, and accepted the\n living of St. James\u2019, Westminster, offered him by his\n patron. During all this time, and through the whole\n course of his brilliant and successful career, he retained\n the strongest affection for his old class-mate, and served\n him on all occasions. It is difficult to say, whether Mr.\n Butler received or gave the greater honor by this connec\u00ac\n tion. They were both worthy of their distinction.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Butler, unlike his fellow-student, had always intended\n to enter the ministry; but, like him, he was the son of a\n Dissenter. At a mature age, when the period of decision\n came, for his own satisfaction, he undertook to examine the\n doctrines and discipline of the Church to the bottom. With\n what ability a duty of this kind could be done by Joseph\n Butler, the reader will have, in the following treatise, a suf\u00ac\n ficient demonstration. After the most profound investiga\u00ac\n tion, he rejected Presbyterianism, and joined the Church of\n England. His father, naturally dissatisfied with the young\n man\u2019s decision, called to his aid a number of dissenting\n ministers; but it was impossible, as might have been fore\u00ac\n seen, to move such a mind from its deliberate determinations.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0037/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 246, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 426}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0037/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 493, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 852}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0037/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 986, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1705}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0037/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1972, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3411}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0037/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/an/al/og/yo/fr/el/ig/io/00/bu/tl/_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3_0037.jp2", "height": 3411, "width": 1972, "levels": 6, "size": 375800}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"37\">\n<p>\n THE LIFE OF BISHOP BUTLER.\n</p>\n<p>\n 33\n</p>\n<p>\n About this period, Joseph was removed, by consent of\n his father, to the University of Oxford, where he imme\u00ac\n diately took the highest rank in all the studies of his antic\u00ac\n ipated profession.\n</p>\n<p>\n Edward Talbot, the gentleman before mentioned as the\n patron of Mr. Seeker, must have taken great satisfaction in\n giving encouragement to merit.

He began to grow melancholy, and\n spent, it was thought, many hours in gloomy meditation.\n Here, again, the angel of his life, now the renowned\n Thomas Seeker, who had watched, esteemed, and admired\n him from the beginning, came to his relief. In conversa\u00ac\n tion, one day, with Queen Caroline, he made an honorable\n allusion to the name of Mr. Butler. The Queen replied,\n that she supposed him to be dead; but the eulogies of\n his friend assured her, that he not only lived, but lived\n in the heart of a good and great man. It was Arch\u00ac\n bishop Blackburn, however, and not Mr. Seeker, who made\n the famous reply to her majesty, so often quoted. The\n Queen, on a certain occasion, asked the Archbishop, if\n Mr. Butler were not dead? \u201cNo, madam,\u201d responded\n the benevolent but witty prelate, \u201cbut he is buried.\u201d\n The Queen comprehended the ingenious reproof, and be\u00ac\n came, at once, Mr. Butler\u2019s patron. His friend, Dr. Tal\u00ac\n bot, was made Lord Chancellor, and, at the instance of\n Mr. Seeker, Butler became his chaplain. On his way to\n London, he spent a little time at Oxford, where he received\n the degree of Doctor of Laws.

It is enough to the present pur\u00ac\n pose to observe, that this general way of arguing is evi\u00ac\n dently natural, just and conclusive.

(1) For, if it would be in a\n manner certain that we should survive death, provided it\n were certain that death would not be our destruction, it\n must be highly probable that we shall survive it, if there\n be no ground to think death will be our destruction.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, though I think it must be acknowledged, that prior\n to the natural and moral proofs of a future life commonly\n insisted upon, there would arise a general confused sus\u00ac\n picion, that, in the great shock and alteration which we shall\n</p>\n<p>\n (1 ) Destruction of living powers, is a manner of expression una\u00ac\n voidably ambiguous; and may signify either the destruction of a\n living being, so as that the same living being shall be incapable of ever\n perceiving or acting again at all; or the destruction of those means and\n instruments by which it is capable of its present life, of its present state\n of perception and of action. It is here used in the former sense.\n When it is used in the latter, the epithet present is added. The loss\n of a man\u2019s eye is a destruction of living powers in the latter sense.\n But we have no reason to think the destruction of living powers in\n the former sense, to be possible.

For, were the motion\n of any particle of matter absolutely one and indivisible, so\n as that it should imply a contradiction to suppose part\n of this motion to exist, and part not to exist, that is, part\n of this matter to move, and part to be at rest; then its\n power of motion would be indivisible; and so, also, would\n the subject in which the power inheres, namely, the particle\n of matter: for if this could be divided into two, one part\n might be moved and the other at rest, which is contrary to\n the supposition.

And persons can trace up the existence of\n themselves to a time when the bulk of their bodies was ex\u00ac\n tremely small, in comparison of what it is in mature age;\n and we cannot but think, that they might then have lost a\n considerable part of that small body, and yet have remained\n the same living agents, as they may now lose great part of\n their present body, and remain so. And it is certain, that\n the bodies of all animals are in a constant flux, from that\n never-ceasing attrition which there is in every part of them.\n Now, things of this kind unavoidably teach us to distin\u00ac\n guish between these living agents, ourselves, and large\n quantities of matter, in which we are very nearly inter\u00ac\n ested : since these may be alienated, and actually are in a\n daily course of succession, and changing their owners;\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0060/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 426}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0060/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 488, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 852}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0060/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 976, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1705}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0060/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1953, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3411}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0060/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/an/al/og/yo/fr/el/ig/io/00/bu/tl/_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3_0060.jp2", "height": 3411, "width": 1953, "levels": 6, "size": 399176}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"60\">\n<p>\n 56\n</p>\n<p>\n OF A FUTURE LIFE.\n</p>\n<p>\n [part.

But, after all,\n the relation a person bears to those parts of his body to\n which he is the most nearly related, what does it appear to\n amount to but this, that the living agent and those parts of\n the body mutually affect each other ? And the same thing,\n the same thing in kind, though not in degree, may be said\n of all foreign matter, which gives us ideas, and which we\n have any power over.

For, sus\u00ac\n pension of reason, memory, and the affections which they\n excite, is no part of the idea of death, nor is implied in our\n notion of it.

It requires, also, to be men\u00ac\n tioned, that, in numberless cases, the natural course of\n things affords us opportunities for procuring advantages to\n ourselves at certain times, which we cannot procure when\n we will, nor ever recall the opportunities, if we have\n neglected them. Indeed, the general course of nature is an\n example of this. If, during the opportunity of youth, per\u00ac\n sons are indocile and self-willed, they inevitably suffer in\n their future life, for want of those acquirements which they\n neglected the natural season of attaining. If the husband\u00ac\n man lets his seed-time pass without sowing, the whole year\n is lost to him beyond recovery. In like manner, though\n after men have been guilty of folly and extravagance, up to\n a certain degree , it is often in their power, for instance, to\n retrieve their affairs, to recover their health and character,\n at least in good measure, yet real reformation is, in many\n cases, of no avail at all toward preventing the miseries,\n poverty, sickness, infamy, naturally annexed to folly and\n extravagance, exceeding that degree.

Reason did, as it well might, conclude, that it should,\n finally and upon the whole, be well with the righteous and ill with\n the wicked; but it could not be determined, upon any principles of\n reason, whether human creatures might not have been appointed to\n pass through other states of life and being, before that distributive\n justice should finally and effectually take place. Revelation teaches\n us, that the next state of things, after the present, is appointed for\n the execution of this justice; that it shall be no longer delayed; but the\n mystery of God, the great mystery of his suffering vice and confusion\n to prevail, shall then he finished; and he will take to him his great power,\n and will reign, by rendering to every one according to his works.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0081/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 241, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0081/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 483, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 862}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0081/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 967, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1724}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0081/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1935, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3449}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0081/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/an/al/og/yo/fr/el/ig/io/00/bu/tl/_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3_0081.jp2", "height": 3449, "width": 1935, "levels": 6, "size": 388070}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"81\">\n<p>\n CHAP.

He may,\n consistently with this, be simply and absolutely benevolent,\n in the sense now explained; but he is, for he has given us\n a proof in the constitution and conduct of the world that\n he is, a governor over servants, as he rewards and punishes\n us for our actions. And in the constitution and conduct of\n it, he may, also, have given, besides the reason of the thing,\n and the natural presages of conscience, clear and distinct\n intimations, that his government is righteous or moral\u2014\n clear to such as think the nature of it deserving their atten\u00ac\n tion ; and yet not to every careless person who casts a tran\u00ac\n sient reflection upon the subject.(l)\n</p>\n<p>\n (1) The objections against religion, from the evidence of it not\n being universal, nor so strong as might possibly have been, may be\n urged against natural religion, as well as against revealed.

From the natural course of things, vicious actions\n are, to a great degree, actually punished as mischievous to\n society; and besides punishment actually inflicted upon this\n account, there is, also, the fear and apprehension of it in\n those persons whose crimes have rendered them obnoxious\n to it in case of a discovery; this state of fear being itself\n often a very considerable punishment. The natural fear\n and apprehension of it, too, which restrains from such\n crimes, is a declaration of nature against them.

So that it\n stands good, without any thing on the side of vice to be set\n over against it, that the Author of nature has as truly\n directed that vicious actions, considered as mischievous to\n society, should be punished, and put mankind under a ne\u00ac\n cessity of thus punishing them, as he has directed and ne\u00ac\n cessitated us to preserve our lives by food.\n</p>\n<p>\n IV.

In order to\n see this more clearly, we must distinguish between actions\n themselves, and that quality ascribed to them, which we\n call virtuous or vicious. The gratification itself of every\n natural passion must be attended with delight; and acqui\u00ac\n sitions of fortune, however made, are acquisitions of the\n means or materials of enjoyment. An action, then, by\n which any natural passion is gratified, or fortune acquired,\n procures delight or advantage, abstracted from all consider\u00ac\n ation of the morality of such action. Consequently, the\n pleasure or advantage in this case is gained by the action\n itself, not by the morality, the virtuousness or viciousness\n of it, though it be, perhaps, virtuous or vicious. Thus, to\n say such an action, or course of behavior, procured such\n pleasure or advantage, or brought on such inconvenience\n and pain, is quite a different thing from saying, that such\n good or bad effect was owing to the virtue or vice of such\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0091/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 427}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0091/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 488, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 855}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0091/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 976, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1710}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0091/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1953, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3421}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0091/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/an/al/og/yo/fr/el/ig/io/00/bu/tl/_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3_0091.jp2", "height": 3421, "width": 1953, "levels": 6, "size": 389077}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"91\">\n<p>\n CHAP.

That inward\n feeling, which, respecting lesser matters and in familiar\n speech, we call being vexed with one\u2019s self, and in matters\n of importance, and in more serious language, remorse, is an\n uneasiness naturally arising from an action of a man\u2019s own,\n reflected upon by himself as wrong, unreasonable, faulty,\n that is, vicious in greater or less degrees; and this mani\u00ac\n festly is a different feeling from that uneasiness which arises\n from a sense of mere loss or harm. What is more common\n than to hear a man lamenting an accident or event, and\n adding, But, however, he has the satisfaction that he cannot\n blame himself for it; or, on the contrary, that he has the\n uneasiness of being sensible that it was his own doing?\n Thus, also, the disturbance and fear which often follow upon\n a man\u2019s having done an injury, arise from a sense of his\n being blameworthy; otherwise there would, in many cases,\n be no ground of disturbance, nor any reason to fear resent\u00ac\n ment or shame. On the other hand, inward security and\n peace, and a mind open to the several gratifications of life,\n are the natural attendants of innocence and virtue; to\n which must be added, the complacency, satisfaction, and\n even joy of heart, which accompany the exercise, the real\n exercise, of gratitude, friendship, benevolence.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0092/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 426}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0092/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 488, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 852}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0092/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 976, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1705}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0092/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1953, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3411}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0092/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/an/al/og/yo/fr/el/ig/io/00/bu/tl/_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3_0092.jp2", "height": 3411, "width": 1953, "levels": 6, "size": 416174}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"92\">\n<p>\n 88 OF THE MORAL [PART I.\n</p>\n<p>\n And here, I think, ought to be mentioned the fears of\n future punishment, and peaceful hopes of a better life, in\n those who fully believe or have any serious apprehension of\n religion; because these hopes and fears are present uneasi\u00ac\n ness and satisfaction to the mind, and cannot be got rid of\n by great part of the world, even by men who have thought\n most thoroughly upon that subject of religion.

These tendencies\n of virtue and vice are obvious with regard to individuals.\n But it may require more particularly to be considered, that\n power in a society, by being under the direction of virtue,\n naturally increases, and has a necessary tendency to prevail\n over opposite power, not under the direction of it; in like\n manner as power, by being under the direction of reason,\n increases, and has a tendency to prevail over brute force.\n There are several brute creatures of equal, and several of\n superior strength, to that of men; and, possibly, the sum\n of the whole strength of brutes may be greater than that\n of mankind, but reason gives us the advantage and supe\u00ac\n riority *over them, and thus man is the acknowledged\n governing animal upon the earth. Nor is this superiority\n considered by any as accidental, but as what reason has a\n tendency, in the nature of the thing, to obtain. And yet,\n perhaps, difficulties may be raised about the meaning, as\n well as the truth of the assertion, that virtue has the like\n tendency.\n</p>\n<p>\n To obviate these difficulties, let us see more distinctly\n how the case stands with regard to reason, which is so\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0098/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 426}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0098/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 488, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 852}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0098/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 976, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1705}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0098/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1953, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3411}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0098/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/an/al/og/yo/fr/el/ig/io/00/bu/tl/_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3_0098.jp2", "height": 3411, "width": 1953, "levels": 6, "size": 414441}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"98\">\n<p>\n 94 OF THE MORAL [PART I.\n</p>\n<p>\n readily acknowledged to have this advantageous tendency.\n Suppose, then, two or three men, of the best and most im\u00ac\n proved understanding, in a desolate, open plain, attacked by\n ten times the number of. beasts of prey; would their reason\n secure them the victory in this unequal combat?

But\n the first and most common meaning of it seems to be, that\n our future interest is now depending, and depending upon\n ourselves\u2014that we have scope and opportunities here for\n that good and bad behavior, which God will reward and\n punish hereafter; together with temptations to one, as well as\n inducements of reason to the other. And this is, in a great\n measure, the same with saying, that we are under the moral\n government of God, and to give an account of our actions\n to him. For the notion of a future account, and general\n righteous judgment, implies some sort of temptations to\n what is wrong, otherwise there would be no moral possi\u00ac\n bility of doing wrong, nor ground for judgment or dis\u00ac\n crimination. But there is this difference, that the word\n probation is more distinctly and particularly expressive of\n allurements to wrong, or difficulties in adhering uniformly\n to what is right, and of the danger of miscarrying by such\n temptations, than the words moral government.

Indeed, if\n mankind, considered in their natural capacity as inhabitants\n of this world only, found themselves, from their birth to\n their death, in a settled state of security and happiness,\n without any solicitude or thought of their own; or, if they\n were in no danger of being brought into inconveniences and\n distress by carelessness, or the folly of passion, through\n bad example, the treachery of others, or the deceitful\n appearances of things; were this our natural condition, then\n it might seem strange, and be some presumption against\n the truth of religion, that it represents our future and more\n general interest, as not secure, of course, but as depending\n upon our behavior, and requiring recollection and self-\n government to obtain it.

The constitution of human creatures, and, indeed, of\n all creatures which come under our notice, is such, as that\n they are capable of naturally becoming qualified for states\n of life, for which they were once wholly unqualified. In\n imagination we may, indeed, conceive of creatures, as inca\u00ac\n pable of having any of their faculties naturally enlarged, or\n as being unable naturally to acquire any new qualifications;\n but the faculties of every species known to us are made for\n enlargement\u2014for acquirements of experience and habits.\n We find ourselves in particular endued with capacities, not\n only of perceiving ideas, and of knowledge or perceiving\n truth, but, also, of storing up our ideas and knowledge by\n memory. We are capable, not only of acting, and of hav\u00ac\n ing different momentary impressions made upon us, but of\n getting a new facility in any kind of action, and of settled\n alterations in our temper or character. The power of the\n two last is the power of habits. But neither the perception\n of ideas, nor knowledge of any sort, are habits, though\n absolutely necessary to the forming of them. However,\n apprehension, reason, memory, which are the capacities of\n acquiring knowledge, are greatly improved by exercise.\n Whether the word habit is applicable to all these improve\u00ac\n ments, and, in particular, how far the powers of memory\n and of habits may be powers of the same nature, I shall\n not inquire. But that perceptions come into our minds\n readily and of course, by means of their having been there\n before, seems a thing of the same sort, as readiness in any\n particular kind of action, proceeding from being accustomed\n to it. And aptness to recollect practical observations of\n service in our conduct, is plainly habit in many cases.\n There are habits of perception and habits of action.

But, going over the theory of virtue in one\u2019s\n thoughts, talking well, and drawing fine pictures of it, this\n is so far from necessarily or certainly conducing to form a\n habit of it in him who thus employs himself, that it may\n harden the mind in a contrary course, and render it gradu\u00ac\n ally more insensible; that is, form a habit of insensibility\n to all moral considerations. For, from our very faculty\n of habits, passive impressions, by being repeated, grow\n weaker. Thoughts, by often passing through the mind,\n are felt less sensibly; being accustomed to danger, begets\n intrepidity, that is, lessens fear; to distress, lessens the\n passion of pity; to instances of others\u2019 mortality, lessens\n the sensible apprehension of our own. And from these\n two observations together, that practical habits are formed\n and strengthened by repeated acts, and that passive im\u00ac\n pressions grow weaker by being repeated upon us, it must\n follow, that active habits may be gradually forming and\n strengthening, by a course of acting upon such and such\n motives and excitements, whilst these motives and excite\u00ac\n ments themselves are, by proportionable degrees, growing\n less sensible; that is, are continually less and less sensibly\n felt, even as the active habits strengthen. And experience\n confirms this; for active principles, at the very time that\n they are less lively in perception than they were, are found\n to be somehow wrought more thoroughly into the temper\n and character, and become more effectual in influencing our\n practice.

It is in vain, then, to object against the credibility\n of the present fife\u2019s being intended for this purpose, that all\n the trouble and the danger unavoidably accompanying such\n discipline might have been saved us, by our being made at\n once the creatures and the characters which we were to be. ^\n For we experience, that what we were to be, was to be the\n effect of what we would do; and that the general conduct of\n nature is, not to save us trouble or danger, but to make us\n capable of going through them, and to put it upon us to do\n so. Acquirements of our own experience and habits, are\n the natural supply to our deficiencies, and security against\n our dangers; since it is as plainly natural to set ourselves to\n acquire the qualifications as the external things which we\n stand in need of.

The reader, then, will observe,\n that the question now before us, is not absolute, whether\n the opinion of fate be reconcilable with religion; but hypo\u00ac\n thetical, whether, upon supposition of its being reconcilable\n with the constitution of nature, it be not reconcilable with\n religion also; or, what pretense a fatalist\u2014not other per\u00ac\n sons, but a fatalist\u2014has to conclude, from his opinion, that\n there can be no such thing as religion.

And this reasoning\n from fact is confirmed, and, in some degree, even verified,\n by other facts\u2014by the natural tendencies of virtue and\n of vice,(2) and by this, that God, in the natural course of\n his providence, punishes- vicious ' actions, as mischievous to\n society, and, also, vicious actions, as such, in the strictest\n sense.(3) So that the general proof of religion is unan\u00ac\n swerably real, even upon the wild supposition which we are\n arguing upon.\n</p>\n<p>\n (1) However, I am far from intending to deny, that the will of\n God is determined by what is fit, by the right and reason of the\n case; though one chooses to decline matters of such abstract specu\u00ac\n lation, and to speak with caution when one does speak of them.\n But if it be intelligible to say, that it is Jit and reasonable for every\n one to consult his own happiness, then fitness of action, or the right and\n reason of the case, is an intelligible manner of speaking. And it\n seems as inconceivable, to suppose God to approve one course of\n action, or one end, preferably to another, which yet his acting at all\n from design implies that he does, without supposing somewhat prior\n in that end to be the ground of the preference; as to suppose him to\n discern an abstract proposition to be true, without supposing some\u00ac\n what prior in it to be the ground of the discernment. It doth not,\n therefore, appear, that moral right is any more relative to percep\u00ac\n tion than abstract truth is; or that it is any more improper to\n speak of the fitness and rightness of actions and ends, as founded\n in the nature of things, than to speak of abstract truth, as thus\n founded.\n</p>\n<p>\n (2) Page 93.\n</p>\n<p>\n (3) Page 86, & c.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0152/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 426}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0152/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 488, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 852}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0152/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 976, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1705}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0152/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1953, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3411}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0152/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/an/al/og/yo/fr/el/ig/io/00/bu/tl/_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3_0152.jp2", "height": 3411, "width": 1953, "levels": 6, "size": 411746}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"152\">\n<p>\n 148 OF THE OPINION OF NECESSITY, [PART I.\n</p>\n<p>\n It must, likewise, be observed farther, that natural relig\u00ac\n ion hath, besides this, an external evidence, which the doc\u00ac\n trine of necessity, if it could be true, would not affect.\n For, suppose a person, by the observations and reasoning\n above, or by any other, convinced of the truth of religion\u2014\n that there is a God who made the world, who is the moral\n governor and judge of mankind, and will, upon the whole,\n deal with every one according to his works\u2014I say, suppose\n a person convinced of this by reason, but to know nothing\n at all of antiquity, or the present state of mankind, it would\n be natural for such a one to be inquisitive, what was the\n history of this system of doctrine; at what time, and in\n what manner, it came first into the world; and whether it\n were believed by any considerable part of it.

The second, namely, that religion was believed in\n the first ages of the world, especially as it does not appeal\n that there were then any superstitious or false additions to\n it, cannot but be a farther confirmation of its truth. For\n it is a proof of this alternative; either that it came into the\n world by revelation, or that it is natural, obvious, and forces\n itself upon the mind.

And, from the same observations,\n it appears to be no presumption against this, that we do\n not, if, indeed, we do not, see those means to have any\n such tendency, or that they seem to us to have a con\u00ac\n trary one.

Whether we are any way\n related to the more distant parts of the boundless universe\n into which we are brought, is altogether uncertain. But it\n is evident, that the course of things which comes within our\n view, is connected with somewhat past, present, and future\n beyond it. (1) So that we are placed, as one may speak, in\n the middle of a scheme, not a fixed, but a progressive one,\n every way incomprehensible\u2014incomprehensible, in a man\u00ac\n ner, equally with respect to what has been, what now is,\n and what shall be hereafter. And this scheme cannot but\n contain in it somewhat as wonderful, and as much beyond\n our thought and conception,(2) as any thing in that of\n religion. For, will any man in his senses say, that it is less\n difficult to conceive how the world came to be, and to con\u00ac\n tinue as it is, without, than with, an intelligent Author and\n Governor of it ? or, admitting an intelligent Governor of it,\n that there is some other rule of government more natural,\n and of easier conception, than that which we call moral?\n Indeed, without an intelligent Author and Governor of\n nature, no account at all can be given, how this universe, or\n the part of it particularly in which we are concerned, came\n to be, and the course of it to be carried on, as it is; nor any\n of its general end and design, without a moral Governor of\n it. That there is an intelligent Author of nature and na\u00ac\n tural Governor of the world, is a principle gone upon in\n the foregoing treatise, as proved, and generally known\n and confessed to be proved.

(1) Now, as our\n whole nature, the nature which he has given us, leads us\n to conclude his will and character to be moral, just, and\n good, so we can scarce in imagination conceive what it can\n be otherwise. However, in consequence of this his will\n and character, whatever it be, he formed the universe\n as it is, and carries on the course of it as he does, rather\n than in any other manner; and has assigned to us, and\n to all living creatures, a part and a lot in it. Irrational\n creatures act this their part, and enjoy and undergo the\n pleasures and the pains allotted them, without any reflection.\n But one would think it impossible, that creatures endued\n with reason could avoid reflecting sometimes upon all\n this\u2014reflecting, if not from whence we came, yet, at least,\n whither we are going, and what the mysterious scheme,\n in the midst of which we find ourselves, will, at length,\n come out and produce\u2014a scheme in which it is certain\n we are highly interested, and in which we may be inter\u00ac\n ested even beyond conception. For many things prove it\n palpably absurd to conclude, that we shall cease to be at\n death. Particular analogies do most sensibly show us, that\n there is nothing to be thought strange in our being to exist\n in another state of life. And that we are now living beings,\n affords a strong probability that we shall continue so; unless\n there be some positive ground, and there is none from\n reason or analogy, to think death will destroy us. Were a\n persuasion of this kind ever so well grounded, there would,\n surely, be little reason to take pleasure in it. But, indeed,\n it can have no other ground than some such imagination, as\n that of our gross bodies being ourselves; which is contrary\n to experience. Experience, too, most clearly shows us the\n folly of concluding, from the body and the living agent\n affecting each other mutually, that the dissolution of the\n former is the destruction of the latter.

The supposition, then,\n which in all reason we are to go upon, is, that our living\n nature will continue after death. And it is infinitely unrea\u00ac\n sonable to form an institution of life, or to act upon any\n other supposition. Now, all expectation of immortality,\n whether more or less certain, opens an unbounded prospect\n to our hopes and our fears; since we see the constitution\n of nature is such as to admit of misery, as well as to be\n productive of happiness, and experience ourselves to par\u00ac\n take of both in some degree; and since we cannot but know\n what higher degrees of both we are capable of. And there\n is no presumption against believing farther, that our future\n interest depends upon our present behavior: for we see our\n present interest doth; and that the happiness and misery,\n which are naturally annexed to our actions, very frequently\n do not follow till long after the actions are done to which\n they are respectively annexed. So that, were speculation\n to leave us uncertain, whether it were likely that the Author\n of nature, in giving happiness and misery to his creatures,\n hath regard to their actions or not; yet, since w ' e find by\n experience that he hath such regard, the whole sense of\n things which he has given us, plainly leads us, at once, and\n without any elaborate inquiries, to think that it may, indeed\n must, be to good actions chiefly that he hath annexed hap\u00ac\n piness, and to bad actions misery; or that he will, upon the\n whole, reward those who do well, and punish those who do\n evil. To confirm this from the constitution of the world, it\n has been observed, that some sort of moral government is\n necessarily implied in that natural government of God\n which we experience ourselves under; that good and bad\n actions, at present, are naturally rewarded and punished,\n not only as beneficial and mischievous to society, but, also,\n as virtuous and vicious; and that there is, in the very na\u00ac\n ture of the thing, a tendency to their being rewarded and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0172/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 426}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0172/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 488, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 852}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0172/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 976, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1705}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0172/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1953, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3411}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0172/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/an/al/og/yo/fr/el/ig/io/00/bu/tl/_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3_0172.jp2", "height": 3411, "width": 1953, "levels": 6, "size": 414834}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"172\">\n<p>\n 168 CONCLUSION.

Now, as these\n things, in the natural conduct of Providence, are observable\n on the side of virtue, so there is nothing to be set against\n them on the side of vice. A moral scheme of government,\n then, is visibly established, and, in some degree, carried\n into execution; and this, together with the essential tenden\u00ac\n cies of virtue and vice duly considered, naturally raise in us\n an apprehension that it will be carried on farther toward\n perfection in a future state, and that every one shall there\n receive according to his deserts. And if this be so, then\n our future and general interest, under the moral govern\u00ac\n ment of God, is appointed to depend upon our behavior,\n notwithstanding the difficulty which this may occasion of\n securing it, and the danger of losing it; just in the same\n manner as our temporal interest, under his natural gov\u00ac\n ernment, is appointed to depend upon our behavior, not\u00ac\n withstanding the like difficulty and danger. For, from\n our original constitution, and that of the world which we\n inhabit, we are naturally trusted with ourselves, with our\n own conduct and our own interest.

From these temp\u00ac\n tations arise the difficulties of behaving so as to secure our\n temporal interest, and the hazard of behaving so as to\n miscarry in it.

Thus, for instance, the external worship of\n God is a moral duty, though no particular mode of it be\n so. Care, then, is to be taken, when a comparison is made\n between positive and moral duties, that they be compared\n no farther than as they are different\u2014no farther than\n as the former are positive, or arise out of mere external\n command, the reasons of which we are not acquainted\n with; and as the latter are moral, or arise out of the\n apparent reason of the case, without such external com\u00ac\n mand.

And I know nothing of this sort ob\u00ac\n jected against Scripture, excepting such objections as are\n formed upon suppositions, which would equally conclude,\n that the constitution of nature is contradictory to wisdom,\n justice, or goodness; which most certainly it is not. In\u00ac\n deed, there are some particular precepts in Scripture, given\n to particular persons, requiring actions, which would be\n immoral and vicious, were it not for such precepts. But\n it is easy to see, that all these are of such a kind, as that\n the precept changes the whole nature of the case and of\n the action; and both constitutes and shows that not to be\n unjust or immoral, which, prior to the precept, must have\n appeared and really have been so: which may well be,\n since none of these precepts are contrary to immutable\n morality. If it were commanded, to cultivate the princi\u00ac\n ples, and act from the spirit of treachery, ingratitude,\n cruelty; the command would not alter the nature of the\n case, or of the action in any of these instances. But it is\n quite otherwise in precepts which require only the doing an\n external action; for instance, taking away the property or\n life of any. For men have no right to either life or prop\u00ac\n erty, but what arises solely from the grant of God. When\n this grant is revoked, they cease to have any right at all\n in either; and when this revocation is made known, as\n surely it is possible it may be, it must cease to be unjust to\n deprive them of either.

And as one of them is made against the\n whole scheme of it together, as just now described, I choose\n to consider it here, rather than in a distinct chapter by\n itself. The thing objected against this scheme of the Gos\u00ac\n pel is, \u201cThat it seems to suppose God was reduced to the\n necessity of a long series of intricate means, in order to\n accomplish his ends, the recovery and salvation of the\n world; in like sort as men, for want of understanding, or\n power, not being able to come at their ends directly, are\n forced to go round-about ways, and make use of many per\u00ac\n plexed contrivances to arrive at them.\u201d Now, every thing\n which we see shows the folly of this, considered as an\n objection against the truth of Christianity. For, according\n to our manner of conception, God makes use of variety of\n means, what we often think tedious ones, in the natural\n course of Providence, for the accomplishment of all his\n ends. Indeed, it is certain, there is somewhat in this matter\n quite beyond our comprehension; but the mystery is as\n great in nature as in Christianity. We know what we our\u00ac\n selves aim at, as final ends; and what courses we take,\n merely as means conducing to those ends. But we are\n greatly ignorant, how far things are considered by the\n Author of nature, under the single notion of means and\n ends; so as that it may be said, this is merely an end, and\n that merely means, in his regard. And whether there be\n not some peculiar absurdity in our very manner of concep\u00ac\n tion concerning this matter, somewhat contradictory, arising\n from our extremely imperfect views of things, it is impos\u00ac\n sible to say.

Thus, vegetable bodies, and those of\n animals, though possibly formed at once, yet grow up by\n degrees to a mature state.

And the supposi\u00ac\n tion, that part of it is so, appears, to say the least, altogether\n as credible as the contrary. There is then no sort of objec\u00ac\n tion, from the fight of nature, against the general notion of\n a mediator between God and man, considered as a doctrine\n of Christianity, or as an appointment in this dispensation;\n since we find, by experience, that God does appoint me\u00ac\n diators, to be the instruments of good and evil to us, the\n instruments of his justice and his mercy.

But\n still it may be thought, that this whole manner of treating\n the subject before us, supposes mankind to be naturally in\n a very strange state. And truly so it does. But it is not\n Christianity which has put us into this state.

But it may be needful to mention, that several\n questions, which have been brought into the subject before us, and\n determined, are not in the least entered into here\u2014questions which\n have been, I fear, rashly determined, and, perhaps, with equal rash\u00ac\n ness, contrary ways. For instance, whether God could have saved\n the world by other means than the death of Christ, consistently\n with the general laws of his government? And, had not Christ\n come into the world, what would have been the future condition\n of the better sort of men\u2014those just persons over the face of the\n earth, for whom Manasses in his prayer asserts, repentance was not\n appointed? The meaning of the first of these questions is greatly\n ambiguous; and neither of them can properly be answered, without\n going upon that infinitely absurd supposition, that we know the\n whole of the case. And, perhaps, the very inquiry, what would have\n followed if God had not done as he has? may have in it some very\n great impropriety; and ought not to be carried on any farther than\n is necessary tq help our partial and inadequate conceptions of things.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0236/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 426}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0236/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 488, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 852}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0236/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 976, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1705}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0236/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1953, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3411}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0236/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/an/al/og/yo/fr/el/ig/io/00/bu/tl/_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3_0236.jp2", "height": 3411, "width": 1953, "levels": 6, "size": 396778}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"236\">\n<p>\n 232 THE APPOINTMENT OP [PART II.\n</p>\n<p>\n will consider the manifold miseries, and the extreme wicked\u00ac\n ness of the world; that the best have great wrongnesses\n within themselves, which they complain of, and endeavor to\n amend, but, that the generality grow more profligate and\n corrupt with age; that heathen moralists thought the present\n state to be a state of punishment; and, what might be added,\n that the earth, our habitation, has the appearances of being\n a ruin; whoever, I say, will consider all these, and some\n other obvious things, will think he has little reason to object\n against the Scripture account, that mankind is in a state of\n degradation\u2014against this being the fact: how difficult so-\n soever he may think it to account for, or even to form a\n distinct conception of, the occasions and circumstances of it.\n But that the crime of our first parents was the occasion of\n our being placed in a more disadvantageous condition, is a\n thing throughout, and particularly analogous to what we\n see, in the daily course of natural Providence; as the recov\u00ac\n ery of the world, by the interposition of Christ, has been\n shown to be so in general.\n</p>\n<p>\n VI.

The evidence of religion not appearing obvious, may\n constitute one particular part of some men\u2019s trial in the\n religious sense; as it gives scope for a virtuous exercise, or\n vicious neglect, of their understanding, in examining or not\n examining into that evidence. There seems no possible rea\u00ac\n son to be given, why we may not be in a state of moral\n probation, with regard to the exercise of our understanding\n upon the subject of religion, as we are with regard to our\n behavior in common affairs. The former is as much a thing\n within our power and choice as the latter. And, I suppose,\n it is to be laid down for certain, that the same character,\n the same inward principle, which, after a man is convinced\n of the truth of religion, renders him obedient to the precepts\n of it, would, were he not thus convinced, set him about\n an examination of it, upon its system and evidence being\n offered to his thoughts; and that, in the latter state, his\n examination would be with an impartiality, seriousness, and\n solicitude, proportionable to what his obedience is in the\n former. And as inattention, negligence, want of all serious\n concern, about a matter of such a nature and importance,\n when offered to men\u2019s consideration, is, before a distinct\n conviction of its truth, as real immoral depravity and disso\u00ac\n luteness, as neglect of religious practice after such convic\u00ac\n tion ; so, active solicitude about it, and fair, impartial consid\u00ac\n eration of its evidence before such conviction, is as really an\n exercise of a morally right temper, as is religious practice\n after.

It appears to be a thing as evident, though it is not\n so much attended to, that if, upon consideration of religion,\n the evidence of it should seem to any persons doubtful in\n the highest supposable degree, even this doubtful evidence\n will, however, put them into a general state of probation, in\n the moral and religious sense. For, suppose a man to be\n really in doubt, whether such a person had not done him\n the greatest favor, or, whether his whole temporal interest\n did not depend upon that person, no one, who had any\n sense of gratitude and of prudence, could possibly consider\n himself in the same situation, with regard to such person,\n as if he had no such doubt. In truth, it is as just to say,\n that certainty and doubt are the same, as to say, the situa\u00ac\n tions now mentioned would leave a man as entirely at lib\u00ac\n erty, in point of gratitude or prudence, as he would be,\n were he certain he had received no favor from such person,\n or that he no way depended upon him. And thus, though\n the evidence of religion which is afforded to some men,\n should be little more than that they are given to see the\n system of Christianity, or religion in general, to be suppo\u00ac\n sable and credible, this ought, in all reason, to beget a serious\n practical apprehension that it may be true. And even this\n will afford matter of exercise for religious suspense and\n deliberation, for moral resolution and self-government; be\u00ac\n cause the apprehension that religion may be true, does as\n really lay men under obligations, as a full conviction that it\n is true.

For, the reason why a prince would give his\n directions in this plain manner, is, that he absolutely desires\n such an external action should be done, without concerning\n himself with the motive or principle upon which it is done;\n that is, he regards only the external event, or the thing\u2019s\n being done, and not at all, properly speaking, the doing of\n it, or the action. Whereas, the whole of morality and relig\u00ac\n ion consisting merely in action itself, there is no sort of par\u00ac\n allel between the cases. But if the prince be supposed to\n regard only the action, that is, only to desire to exercise,\n or in any sense prove, the understanding or loyalty of a\n servant, he would not always give his orders in such a plain\n manner. It may be proper to add, that the will of God,\n respecting morality and religion, may be considered either\n as absolute, or as only conditional. If it be absolute, it\n can only be thus, that we should act virtuously in such\n given circumstances; not that we should be brought to act\n so, by his changing of our circumstances. And if God\u2019s\n will be thus absolute, then it is in our power, in the highest\n and strictest sense, to do or to contradict his will; which is\n a most weighty consideration. Or his will may be consid\u00ac\n ered only as conditional\u2014that if we act so and so, we shall\n be rewarded; if otherwise, punished: of which conditional\n will of the Author of nature, the whole constitution of it\n affords most certain instances.\n</p>\n<p>\n Upon the whole, that we are in a state of religion\n necessarily implies, that we are in a state of probation;\n and the credibility of our being at all in such a state being\n admitted, there seems no peculiar difficulty in supposing\n our probation to be, just as it is, in those respects which\n are above objected against.

And this, we\n find by experience, is frequently our probation,(l) in our\n temporal capacity. For the information which we want,\n with regard to our worldly interests, is by no means always\n given us of course, without any care of our own. And we\n are greatly liable to self-deceit from inward, secret preju\u00ac\n dices, and, also, to the deceits of others. So that to be able\n to judge what is the prudent part, often requires much and\n and difficult consideration.

This, indeed, could not have\n been affirmed by any reasonable man, if the authors of these\n books, like many other historians, had appeared to make an\n entertaining manner of writing their aim; though they had\n interspersed miracles in their works, at proper distances,\n and upon proper occasions. These might have animated a\n dull relation, amused the reader, and engaged his atten\u00ac\n tion.

But\n the facts, both miraculous and natural, in Scripture, are\n related in plain, unadorned narratives ; and both of them\n appear, in all respects, to stand upon the same foot of\n historical evidence.

The obscurity or unintelligibleness of one part of a\n prophecy, does not, in any degree, invalidate the proof of\n foresight, arising from the appearing completion of those\n other parts which are understood. For the case is evi\u00ac\n dently the same, as if those parts, which are not under\u00ac\n stood, were lost, or not written at all, or written in an\n unknown tongue. Whether this observation be commonly\n attended to or not, it is so evident, that one can scarce\n bring one\u2019s self to set down an instance in common matters,\n to exemplify it. However, suppose a writing, partly in\n cipher, and partly in plain words at length, and that,\n in the part one understood, there appeared mention of\n several known facts, it would never come into any man\u2019s\n thoughts to imagine, that if he understood the whole, per\u00ac\n haps he might find, that those facts were not, in reality,\n known by the writer. Indeed, both in this example, and\n the thing intended to be exemplified by it, our not under\u00ac\n standing the whole, (the whole, suppose, of a sentence or a\n paragraph,) might sometimes occasion a doubt, whether one\n understood the literal meaning of such a part; but this\n comes under another consideration.\n</p>\n<p>\n For the same reason, though a man should be incapable.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0281/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 427}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0281/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 488, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 855}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0281/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 976, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1710}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0281/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1953, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3421}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0281/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/an/al/og/yo/fr/el/ig/io/00/bu/tl/_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3_0281.jp2", "height": 3421, "width": 1953, "levels": 6, "size": 398539}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"281\">\n<p>\n FOR CHRISTIANITY.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAP.

There is no need of abstruse\n reasonings and distinctions, to convince an unprejudiced\n understanding, that there is a God who made and governs\n the world, and will judge it in righteousness; though they\n may be necessary to answer abstruse difficulties, when\n once such are raised; when the very meaning of those\n words, which* express most intelligibly the general doctrine\n of religion, is pretended to be uncertain, and the clear truth\n of the thing itself is obscured by the intricacies of specula\u00ac\n tion. But, to an unprejudiced mind, ten thousand thousand\n instances of design, cannot but prove a Designer. And it\n is intuitively manifest, that creatures ought to live under a\n dutiful sense of their Maker; and that justice and charity\n must be his laws, to creatures whom he has made social,\n and placed in society. Indeed, the truth of revealed relig\u00ac\n ion, peculiarly so called, is not self-evident, but requires\n external proof, in order to its being received. Yet inatten\u00ac\n tion, among us, to revealed religion, will be found to imply\n the same dissolute immoral temper of mind, as inattention\n to natural religion; because, when both are laid before us,\n in the manner they are in Christian countries of liberty, our\n obligations to inquire into both, and to embrace both upon\n supposition of their truth, are obligations of the same na\u00ac\n ture.

It is, therefore, most certain, that our obligations to\n inquire seriously into the evidence of Christianity, and, upon\n supposition of its truth, to embrace it, are of the utmost\n importance, and moral in the highest and most proper sense.\n Let us, then, suppose, that the evidence of religion in gen\u00ac\n eral, and of Christianity, has been seriously ' inquired into\n by all reasonable men among us.

Or,\n however this opinion came into the world, these appear\u00ac\n ances must have kept up the tradition, and confirmed the\n belief of it. And as it was the general opinion, under the\n light of nature, that repentance and reformation, alone and\n by itself, was not sufficient to do away sin, and procure a full\n remission of the penalties annexed to it; and as the reason\n of the thing does not at all lead to any such conclusion; so\n every day\u2019s experience shows us that reformation is not, in\n any sort, sufficient to prevent the present disadvantages and\n miseries, which, in the natural course of things, God has\n annexed to folly and extravagance. Yet there may be\n ground to think, that the punishments, which, by the gen\u00ac\n eral laws of Divine government, are annexed to vice, may\n be prevented; that provision may have been even originally\n made, that they should be prevented by some means or\n other, though they could not by reformation alone. For\n we have daily instances of such mercy , in the general con\u00ac\n duct of nature: compassion provided for misery,(1) medi\u00ac\n cines for diseases, friends against enemies. There is provis\u00ac\n ion made, in the original constitution of the world, that\n much of the natural bad consequences of our follies, which\n persons themselves alone cannot prevent, may be prevented\n by the assistance of others\u2014assistance, which nature ena\u00ac\n bles, and disposes, and appoints them to afford.

This,\n I say, must follow: for if the self or person of to-day, and\n that of to-morrow, are not the same, but only like persons,\n the person of to-day is really no more interested in what\n will befall the person of to-morrow, than in what will befall\n any other person.

However, since great stress is said to be put upon it,\n I add the following things:\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. This notion is absolutely contradictory to that certain\n conviction which necessarily, and every moment, rises within\n us, when we turn our thoughts upon ourselves; when we\n reflect upon what is past, and look forward upon what is to\n come. All imagination of a daily change of that living\n agent which each man calls himself, for another, or of any\n such change throughout our whole present life, is entirely\n borne down by our natural sense of things. Nor is it pos\u00ac\n sible for a person in his wits to alter his conduct, with\n regard to his health or affairs, from a suspicion, that though\n he should live to-morrow, he should not, however, be the\n same person he is to-day. And yet, if it be reasonable to\n act, with respect to a future life, upon this notion, that per\u00ac\n sonality is transient, it is reasonable to act upon it, with\n respect to the present. Here, then, is a notion equally\n applicable to religion and to our temporal concerns, and\n every one sees and feels the inexpressible absurdity of it in\n the latter case. If, therefore, any can take up with it in the\n former, this cannot proceed from the reason of the thing,\n but must be owing to an inward unfairness, and secret cor\u00ac\n ruption of heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. It is not an idea, or abstract notion, or quality, but a\n being only which is capable of life and action, of happiness\n and misery. Now, all beings confessedly continue the\n same, during the whole time of their existence. Consider,\n then, a living being now existing, and which has existed\n for any time alive: this living being must have done, and\n suffered, and enjoyed, what it has done, and suffered, and\n enjoyed formerly, (this living being, I say, and not an\u00ac\n other,) as really as it does, and suffers, and enjoys, what it\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0333/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 427}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0333/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 488, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 855}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0333/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 976, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1710}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0333/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1953, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3421}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0333/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/an/al/og/yo/fr/el/ig/io/00/bu/tl/_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3_0333.jp2", "height": 3421, "width": 1953, "levels": 6, "size": 382485}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"333\">\n<p>\n DISS.

Every person is conscious, that he is now the same\n person or self he was, as far back as his remembrance\n reaches; since, when any one reflects upon a past action of\n his own, he is just as certain of the person who did that\n action, namely, himself, the person who now reflects upon\n it, as he is certain that the action was at all done.

If he, if person, be a substance, then\n consciousness that he is the same person, is consciousness\n that he is the same substance. If the person, or he, be the\n property of a substance, still consciousness that he is the\n same property, is as certain a proof that his substance re\u00ac\n mains the same, as consciousness that he remains the same\n substance would be; since the same property cannot be\n transferred from one substance to another.\n</p>\n<p>\n But, though we are thus certain that we are the same\n agents, living beings, or substances, now, which we were\n as far back as our remembrance reaches, yet, it is asked,\n whether we may not possibly be deceived in it ?

Brute creatures are impressed and\n actuated by various instincts and propensions: so, also, are\n we. But, additional to this, we have a capacity of reflect\u00ac\n ing upon actions and characters, and making them an object\n to our thought; and, on doing this, we naturally and una\u00ac\n voidably approve some actions, under the peculiar view of\n their being virtuous and of good desert; and disapprove\n others, as vicious and of ill-desert. That we have this\n moral approving and disapproving (1) faculty, is certain\n from our experiencing it in ourselves, and recognizing it in\n each other. It appears from our exercising it unavoidably,\n in the approbation and disapprobation even of feigned char\u00ac\n acters : from the words, right and wrong, odious and amia\u00ac\n ble, base and worthy, with many others of like signification\n in all languages, applied to actions and characters: from\n the many written systems of morals which suppose it; since\n it cannot be imagined, that all these authors, throughout all\n these treatises, had absolutely no meaning at all to their\n</p>\n<p>\n (1) This way of speaking is taken from Epictetus,* and is made\n use of as seeming the most full, and least liable to cavil.

But to\n ours they are; and they are the object, and the only one,\n of the approving and disapproving faculty. Acting, con\u00ac\n duct, behavior, abstracted from all regard to what is, in\n fact and event, the consequence of it, is itself the natural\n object of the moral discernment, as speculative truth and\n falsehood is of speculative reason.

Innocence\n and ill desert are inconsistent ideas. Ill desert always sup\u00ac\n poses guilt; and if one be no part of the other, yet they\n are evidently and naturally connected in our mind. The\n sight of a man in misery raises our compassion toward him;\n and, if this misery be inflicted on him by another, our indig\u00ac\n nation against the author of it. But when we are informed\n that the sufferer is a villain, and is punished only for his\n treachery or cruelty, our compassion exceedingly lessens,\n and, in many instances, our indignation wholly subsides.\n Now, what produces this effect, is the conception of that in\n the sufferer, which we call ill desert. Upon considering,\n then, or viewing together, our notion of vice and that of mis\u00ac\n ery, there results a third, that of ill desert. And thus there\n is in human creatures an association of the two ideas, natural\n and moral evil, wickedness and punishment.

And on the other\n hand, our perception of ill desert in vicious actions lessens\n in proportion to the temptations men are thought to have\n had to such vices.

Our perception of vice and ill deserts arises from, and\n is the result of, a comparison of actions with the nature and\n capacities of the agent. For, the mere neglect of doing\n what we ought to do, would, in many cases, be determined\n by all men to be in the highest degree vicious. And this\n determination must arise from such comparison, and be the\n result of it; because such neglect would not be vicious in\n creatures of other natures and capacities, as brutes. And\n it is the same, also, with respect to positive vices, or such as\n consist in doing what we ought not. For, every one has a\n different sense of harm done by an idiot, madman, or child,\n and by one of mature and common understanding; though\n the action of both, including the intention, which is part of the\n action, be the same: as it may be, since idiots and madmen,\n as well as children, are capable, not only of doing mischief,\n but, also, of intending it. Now, this difference must arise\n from somewhat discerned in the nature or capacities of\n one, which renders the action vicious; and the want of\n which in the other, renders the same action innocent, or less\n vicious; and this plainly supposes a comparison, whether\n reflected upon or not, between the action and capacities of\n the agent, previous to our determining an action to be\n vicious. And hence, arises a proper application of the epi\u00ac\n thets, incongruous, unsuitable, disproportionate, unfit, to ac\u00ac\n tions which our moral faculty determines to be vicious.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4.

For this reflection might easily be carried on;\n but I forbear. The happiness of the world is the concern\n of Him who is the Lord and the proprietor of it; nor do\n we know what we are about, when we endeavor to promote\n the good of mankind in any ways but those which he has\n directed; that is, indeed, in all ways not contrary to veracity\n and justice. I speak thus upon supposition of persons really\n endeavoring, in some sort, to do good without regard to\n these. But the truth seems to be, that such supposed\n endeavors proceed, almost always, from ambition, the spirit\n of party, or some indirect principle, concealed, perhaps, in\n great measure from persons themselves. And though it is\n our business and our duty to endeavor, within the bounds of\n veracity and justice, to contribute to the ease, convenience,\n and even cheerfulness and diversion of our fellow-creatures;\n yet, from our short views, it is greatly uncertain whether\n this endeavor will, in particular instances, produce an over\u00ac\n balance of happiness upon the whole; since so many and\n distant things must come into the account. And that\n which makes it our duty, is, that there is some appearance\n that it will, and no positive appearance sufficient to balance\n this on the contrary side; and also, that such benevolent\n endeavor is a cultivation of that most excellent of all vir\u00ac\n tuous principles, the active principle of benevolence.\n</p>\n<p>\n However, though veracity, as well as justice, is to be our\n rule of life, it must be added, otherwise a snare will be laid\n in the way of some plain men, that the use of common forms\n of speech generally understood, cannot be falsehood; and,\n in general, that there can be no designed falsehood without\n designing to deceive. It must likewise be observed, that,\n in numberless cases, a man may be under the strictest\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0345/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 427}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0345/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 488, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 855}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0345/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 976, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1710}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0345/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1953, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3421}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:an:al:og:yo:fr:el:ig:io:00:bu:tl:_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3:analogyofreligio00butl_3_0345/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/an/al/og/yo/fr/el/ig/io/00/bu/tl/_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3/analogyofreligio00butl_3_0345.jp2", "height": 3421, "width": 1953, "levels": 6, "size": 201709}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"345\">\n<p>\n DISS.
