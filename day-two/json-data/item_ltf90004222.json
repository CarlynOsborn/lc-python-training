Among others,\n you may find some such methods as these successful.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. Take a wide survey now and then of the vast and\n unlimited regions of learning. Let your meditations run\n over the names of all the sciences, with their numerous\n branchings, and innumerable particular themes of know\u00ac\n ledge; and then reflect how few of them you are ac\u00ac\n quainted with in any tolerable degree.

You should never\n despair therefore of finding out that which has never yet\n been found, unless you see something in the nature of it\n which renders it unsearchable, and above the reach of\n our faculties.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nor should a student in divinity imagine that our age\n is arrived at a full understanding of every thing which\n can be known by the Scriptures. Every age since the\n Reformation hath thrown some further light on difficult\n texts and paragraphs of the Bible, which have been long\n obscured by the early rise of antichrist: and since there\n are at present many difficulties and darknesses hanging\n about certain truths of the Christian religion, and since\n several of these relate to important doctrines, such as\n the origin of sin, the fall of Adam, the person of Christ,\n the blessed Trinity, and decrees of God, & c. which do\n still embarrass the minds of honest and inquiring rea\u00ac\n ders, and which make work for noisy controversy; it is\n certain there are several things in the Bible yet un\u00ac\n known, and not sufficiently explained; and it is certain\n that there is some way to solve these difficulties, and to\n reconcile these seeming contradictions. And why may\n not a sincere searcher of truth in the present age, by la\u00ac\n bour, diligence, study, and prayer, with the best use of\n his reasoning powers, find out the proper solution of\n those knots and perplexities which have hitherto been\n unsolved, and which have afforded matter for angry\n quarrelling? Happy is every man who shall be favoured\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0021/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 351}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0021/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 409, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0021/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 818, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1406}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0021/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1636, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0021/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0021.jp2", "height": 2813, "width": 1636, "levels": 6, "size": 343287}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"21\">\n<p>\n /\n</p>\n<p>\n TO OBTAIN KNOWLEDGE. f 18\n</p>\n<p>\n of Heaven, to give a helping hand towards the intro\u00ac\n duction of the blessed age of light and love.\n</p>\n<p>\n VIII.

I confess it is\n better not to judge, than to judge falsely; it is wiser to\n withhold our assent till we see complete evidence; but\n if we have too suddenly given up our assent, as the wisest\n man does sometimes, if we have professed what we find\n afterwards to be false, we should never be ashamed nor\n afraid to renounce a mistake.

Observation is the notice that we take of all occur\u00ac\n rences in human life, whether they are sensible or intel\u00ac\n lectual, whether relating to persons or things, to our\u00ac\n selves or others. It is this that furnishes us, even from\n our infancy, with a rich variety of ideas and proposi\u00ac\n tions, words and phrases: it is by this we know that fire\n will burn, that the sun gives light, that a horse eats\n grass, that an acorn produces an oak, that man is a be\u00ac\n ing capable of reasoning and discourse, that our judg\u00ac\n ment is weak, that our mistakes are many, that our sor\u00ac\n rows are great, that our bodies die and are carried to the\n grave, and that one generation succeeds another. All\n those things which we see, which we hear or feel, which\n we perceive by sense or consciousness, or which we\n know in a direct manner, with scarce any exercise of our\n reflecting faculties, or our reasoning powers, may be in\u00ac\n cluded under the general name of observation.\n</p>\n<p>\n When this observation relates to any thing that im\u00ac\n mediately concerns ourselves, and of which we are con-\n \u25a0cious, it may be called experience. So I am said to\n know or experience that I have in myself a power of\n thinking, fearing, loving, & c. that I have appetites and\n passions working in me, and many personal occurrences\n have attended me in this life.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0030/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 209, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0030/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 418, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 708}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0030/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 836, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1416}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0030/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1673, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2832}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0030/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0030.jp2", "height": 2832, "width": 1673, "levels": 6, "size": 348455}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"30\">\n<p>\n 22\n</p>\n<p>\n THE FIVE METHODS\n</p>\n<p>\n Observation therefore includes all that Mr. Locke\n means by sensation and reflection.\n</p>\n<p>\n When we are searching out the nature or properties\n of any being by various methods of trial, or when we ap\n ply some active powers, or set some causes to work to\n observe what effects they would produce, this sort of ob\u00ac\n servation is called experiment. So when I throw a bul\n let into water, I find it sinks; and when I throw the\n same bullet into quicksilver, I see it swims: but if I beat\n out this bullet into a thin hollow shape, like-a dish, then\n it will swim in the water too.

Reading is that means or method of knowledge\n whereby we acquaint ourselves with what other men\n have written, or published to the world in their writings.\n These arts of reading and writing are of infinite advan\u00ac\n tage; for by them we are made partakers of the senti\u00ac\n ments, observations, reasonings, and improvements of all\n the learned world, in the most remote nations, and in\n former ages almost from the beginning of mankind.\n</p>\n<p>\n III. Public or private lectures are such verbal instruc\u00ac\n tions as are given by a teacher while the learners attend\n in silence. This is the way of learning religion from\n the pulpit; or of philosophy or theology from the pro\u00ac\n fessor\u2019s chair; or of mathematics, by a teacher showing\n us various theorems or problems, i. e. speculations or\n practices, by demonstration and operation, with all the\n instruments of art necessary to those operations.\n</p>\n<p>\n IV. Conversation is another method of improving our\n minds, wherein, by mutual discourse and inquiry, we\n learn the sentiments of others, as well as communicate\n our sentiments to others in the same manner. Some\u00ac\n times, indeed, though both parties speak by turns, yet\n the advantage is only on one side, as when a teacher\n and a learner meet and discourse together: but frequently\n the profit is mutual. Under this head of conversation\n we may also rank disputes of various kinds.\n</p>\n<p>\n V.

It is meditation or study that\n draws out long chains of argument, and searches and\n finds deep and difficult truths which before lay concealed\n in darkness.\n</p>\n<p>\n It would be a needless thing to prove, that our own\n solitary meditations, together with the few observations\n that the most part of mankind are capable of making,\n are not sufficient, of themselves, to lead us into the at\u00ac\n tainment of any considerable proportion of knowledge, at\n least in an age so much improved as ours is, without the\n assistance of conversation and reading, and other proper\n instructions that are to be attained in bur days. Yet\n each of these five methods have their peculiar advan\u00ac\n tages, whereby they assist each other; and their pecu\u00ac\n liar defects, which have need to be supplied by the other\u2019s\n assistance.

It is\n this lays the ground-work and foundation of all know\u00ac\n ledge, and makes us capable of using any of the other\n methods for improving the mind: for if we did not at\u00ac\n tain a variety of sensible and intellectual ideas by the\n sensations of outward objects, by the consciousness of\n our own appetites and passions, pleasures and pains, and\n by inward experience of the actings of our own spirits,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0032/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 209, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0032/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 418, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 708}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0032/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 836, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1416}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0032/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1673, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2832}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0032/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0032.jp2", "height": 2832, "width": 1673, "levels": 6, "size": 350582}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"32\">\n<p>\n 24\n</p>\n<p>\n THE FIVE METHODS\n</p>\n<p>\n it would be impossible either for men or books to teach\n us any thing.

All our knowledge derived from observation, whe\u00ac\n ther it be of single ideas or of propositions, is knowledge\n gotten at first hand.

By reading of\n books we may learn something from all parts of man\u00ac\n kind; whereas, by observation we learn all from our\u00ac\n selves, and only what comes within our own direct cog\u00ac\n nizance; by conversation we can only enjoy the assist\u00ac\n ance of a very few persons, viz. those who are near us,\n and live at the same time when we do, that is, our neigh\u00ac\n bours and contemporaries; but our knowledge is much\n more narrowed still, if we confine ourselves merely to\n our own solitary reasonings, without much observation\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0033/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 351}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0033/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 409, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0033/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 818, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1406}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0033/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1636, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0033/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0033.jp2", "height": 2813, "width": 1636, "levels": 6, "size": 336306}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"33\">\n<p>\n OF IMPROVEMENT COMPARED\n</p>\n<p>\n 25\n</p>\n<p>\n or reading: for then all our improvement nr. ust arise only\n from our own inward powers and meditations.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2.

And as for our\n study and meditations, even when we arrive at some\n good degrees of learning, our advantage for further im\u00ac\n provement in knowledge by them, is still far more con\u00ac\n tracted than what we may derive from reading.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. When we read good authors, we learn the best, the\n most laboured, and most refined sentiments, even of\n those wise and learned men; for they have studied hard,\n and have committed to writing their maturest thoughts,\n and the result of their long study and experience: where\u00ac\n as, by conversation, and in some lectures, we obtain\n many times only the present thoughts of our tutors or\n friends, which, (though they may be bright and useful)\n yet, at first perhaps, may be sudden and indigested, and\n are mere hints which have risen to no maturity.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. It is another advantage of reading, that we may\n review what wo have read; we may consult the page\n again and again, and meditate on it at successive sea\u00ac\n sons, in our serenest and retired hours, having the book\n always at hand: but what we obtain by conversation and\n in lectures, is oftentimes lost again as soon as the com\u00ac\n pany breaks up, or at least when the day vanishes, un\u00ac\n less we happen to have the talent of a good memory, or\n quickly retire and note down what remarkables we have\n found in those discourses.

He can show\n you which paragraphs are of greatest importance, and\n which are of less moment. He can teach his hearers\n what authors, or what parts of an author a?e best worth\n reading on any particular subject, and thus save his dis\u00ac\n ciples much time and pains, by shortening the lab.ours\n of their closet and private studies. He can show you\n what were the doctrines of the ancients, in a compendium\n which perhaps would cost much labour and the perusal\n of many books to attain. He can inform you what new\n doctrines or sentiments are arising in the world before they\n come to be public; as well as acquaint you with his own\n private thoughts, and his own experiments and observa\u00ac\n tions, which never were, and perhaps never will be publish\u00ac\n ed to the world, and yet may be very valuable and useful.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. A living instructer can convey to our senses those\n notions with which he would furnish our minds, when\n he teaches us natural philosophy, or most parts of mathe\u00ac\n matical learning. He can make the experiments before\n our eyes. He can describe figures and diagrams, point\n to the lines and angles, and make out the demonstration\n in a more intelligible manner by sensible means, which\n cannot so well be done by mere reading, even though we\n should have the same figures lying in a book before our\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0035/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 351}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0035/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 409, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0035/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 818, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1406}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0035/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1636, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0035/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0035.jp2", "height": 2813, "width": 1636, "levels": 6, "size": 325250}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"35\">\n<p>\n OP IMPROVEMENT COMPARED. 2 m ,\n</p>\n<p>\n eyes.

When we converse familiarly with a learned friend,\n we have his own help at hand to explain to us every\n word and sentiment that seems obscure in his discourse,\n and to inform us of his whole meaning; so that we are\n in much less danger of mistaking his sense: whereas in\n books, whatsoever is really obscure may also abide al\u00ac\n ways obscure without remedy, since the author is not\n at hand, that we may inquire his sense.\n</p>\n<p>\n If we mistake the meaning of our friend in conversa\u00ac\n tion, we are quickly set right again; but in reading, we\n many times go on in the same mistake, and are not\n capable of recovering ourselves from it. Thence it comes\n to pass that we have so many contests in all ages about\n the meaning of ancient authors, and especially the sacred\n writers. Happy should we be could we but converse\n with Moses, Isaiah, and St. Paul, and consult the pro\u00ac\n phets and apostles, when we meet with a difficult text:\n but that glorious conversation ia reserved for the ages of\n future blessedness.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0036/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 209, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0036/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 418, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 708}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0036/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 836, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1416}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0036/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1673, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2832}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0036/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0036.jp2", "height": 2832, "width": 1673, "levels": 6, "size": 347585}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"36\">\n<p>\n 28\n</p>\n<p>\n THE FIVE METHODS\n</p>\n<p>\n 2.

Books cannot speak.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Not only the doubts which arise in the mind upon\n any subject or discourse are easily proposed and solved\n in conversation, but the very difficulties we meet with\n in books, and in our private studies, may find a relief by\n friendly conferences. We may pore upon a knotty point\n in solitary meditation many months without a solution,\n because perhaps we have gotten into a wrong tract of\n thought; and our labour (while we are pursuing a false\n scent) is not only useless and unsuccessful, but it leads\n us perhaps into a long*train of error for want of being\n corrected in the first step. But if we note down this\n difficulty when we read it, we may propose it to an in\u00ac\n genious correspondent when we see him; we may be re\u00ac\n lieved in a moment, and find the difficulty vanish: he\n beholds the object perhaps in a different view, sets it be\u00ac\n fore us in quite another light, leads us at once into evi\u00ac\n dence and truth, and that with a delightful surprise.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Conversation calls out into light what has been\n lodged in all the recesses and secret chambers of the\n soul: by occasional hints and incidents it brings old useful\n notions into remembrance; it unfolds and displays the\n hidden treasures of knowledge with which reading, ob\u00ac\n servation, and study, had before furnished the mind.\n By mutual discourse the soul is awakened and allured\n to bring forth its hoards of knowledge, and it learns how\n to render them most useful to mankind.

By perusing books in the manner I have de\u00ac\n scribed, you will make all your reading subservient not\n only to the enlargement of your treasures of knowledge,\n but also to the improvement of your reasoning powers.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are many who read with constancy and dili\u00ac\n gence, and yet make no advances in true knowledge by\n it. They are delighted with the notions which they\n read or hear, as they would be with stories that are told;\n but they do not weigh them in their minds as in a just\n balance, in order to determine their truth or falsehood;\n they make no observations upon them, or inferences\n from them. Perhaps their eye slides over the pages, or\n the words slide o.ver their ears, and vanish like a rhap\u00ac\n sody of evening tales, or the shadows of a cloud flying\n over a green field in a summer\u2019s day.\n</p>\n<p>\n Or if they review them sufficiently to fix them in\n their remembrance, it is merely with a design to tell the\n tale over again, and show what men of learning they\n are. Thus they dream out their days in a course of\n reading, without real advantage. As a man may be\n eating all day, and, for want of digestion is never nour\u00ac\n ished; so those endless readers may cram themselves in\n vain with intellectual food, and without real improve\u00ac\n ment of their minds, for want of digesting it by proper\n reflections.\n</p>\n<p>\n X. Be diligent therefore in observing these directions.\n Enter into the sense and arguments of the authors you\n read; examine all their proofs, and then judge of the\n truth or falsehood of their opinions; and thereby you\n shall not only gain a rich increase of your understand-\n ing, by those truths which the author teaches, when you\n see them well supported, but you shall acquire also by\n degrees a habit of judging justly, and of reasoning well,\n in imitation of the good writer whose works you peruse.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is laborious indeed, and the mind is backward\n to undergo the fatigue of weighing every argument, and\n tracing every thing to its original.

As for those treatises which are written to di\u00ac\n rect or to enforce and persuade our practice, there i3 one\n thing further necessary; and that is, that when our con\u00ac\n sciences are convinced that these rules of prudence or\n duty belong to us, and require our conformity to them,\n we should then call ourselves to account, and inquire\n seriously whether we have put them in practice or no;\n we should dwell upon the arguments, and impress the\n motives and methods of persuasion upon our own hearts,\n till we feel the force and power of them inclining us to\n the practice of the things which are there recommended.\n</p>\n<p>\n If folly or vice be represented in its open colours, or\n its se ' cret disguises, let us search our hearts, and review\n our lives, and inquire how far we are criminal; nor should\n we ever think we have done with the treatise while we\n feel ourselves in sorrow for our past misconduct, and\n aspiring after a victory over those vices, or till we find a\n cure of those follies begun to be wrought upon our souls.\n</p>\n<p>\n In all our studies and pursuits of knowledge, let us\n remember that virtue and vice, sin and holiness, and the\n conformation of our hearts and lives to the duties of truy\n religion and morality, are things of far more conse\u00ac\n quence than all the furniture of our understanding, and\n the richest treasures of more speculative knowledge; and\n that because they have a more immediate and effectual\n influence upon our eternal felicity or eternal sorrow.\n</p>\n<p>\n XIV. There is yet another sort of books, of which it\n is proper I should say something, while I am treating\n on this subject; and these are history, poesy, travels;\n books of diversion or amusement: among which we may\n reckon also little common pamphlets, newspapers, or\n such like: for many of these I confess once reading may\n be sufficient-, where there is a tolerable good memory.\n</p>\n<p>\n Or when several persons are in company, and one\n reads to the rest such a sort of writing, once hearing\n may be sufficient, provided that every one be so atten-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0055/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 351}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0055/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 409, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0055/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 818, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1406}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0055/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1636, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0055/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0055.jp2", "height": 2813, "width": 1636, "levels": 6, "size": 327216}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"55\">\n<p>\n OF BOOKS AND READING.\n</p>\n<p>\n 47\n</p>\n<p>\n tive, and so free, as to make their occasional remarks\n on such lines or sentences, sucli periods or paragraphs,\n as in their opinion deserve it.

An ingenious writer may put excellent colours\n upon his own mistakes. Some Socinians who deny the\n Atonement of Christ, have written well, and with much\n appearance of argument for their own unscriptural senti\u00ac\n ments; and some writers for the Trinity and Satisfaction\n of Christ, have exposed themselves and the sacred doc\u00ac\n trine by their feeble and foolish manner of handling it.\n Books are never tp be judged of merely by their subject,\n or ,the opinion they represent, but by the justness of their\n sentiment, the beauty of their manner, the force of their\n expression, or the strength of reason, and the weight of\n just and proper argument which appears in them.\n</p>\n<p>\n But this folly and weakness of trifling, instead of\n arguing, does not happen to fall only to the share of\n Christian writers; there are some who have taken the\n pen in hand to support the Deistical or Antichristian\n scheme of our days, who make big pretences to reason\n upon all occasions, but seem to have left it all behind\n them when they are jesting with the Bible, and grinning\n at the books which we call sacred.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some of these performances would scarce have been\n thought tolerable, if they had not assaulted the Chris\u00ac\n tian faith, though they have now grown up to a place\n amongst the admired pens.

There are very few tutors who are sufficiently\n furnished with such universal learning, as to sustain all\n the parts and provinces of instruction. The sciences are\n numerous, and many of them lie far wide of each other;\n and it is best to enjoy the instructions of two or three\n tutors at least, in order to run through the whole ency\u00ac\n clopaedia, or circle of sciences, where it may be obtained;\n then we may expect that each will teach the few parts\n of learning which are committed to his care in greater\n</p>\n<p>\n 6\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0070/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 209, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0070/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 418, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 708}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0070/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 836, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1416}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0070/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1673, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2832}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0070/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0070.jp2", "height": 2832, "width": 1673, "levels": 6, "size": 359719}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"70\">\n<p>\n 62\n</p>\n<p>\n OP LIVING INSTRUCTIONS\n</p>\n<p>\n perfection.

Living\n languages, or such as are the native tongue of any na\u00ac\n tion in the present age, are more easily learned and-\n taught by a few rules and much familiar converse,\n joined to the reading some proper authors. The dead\n languages are such as cease to be spoken in any nation;\n and even these are more easy to be taught (as far as\n may be) in that method wherein living languages are\n best learned, i. e. partly by rule, and partly by rote or\n custom. And it may not be improper in this place to\n mention a very few directions for that purpose.\n</p>\n<p>\n I. Begin with the most necessary and most general\n observations and rules which belong to that language,\n compiled in the form of a grammar; and these are but\n few in most languages. The regular declensions and\n variations of nouns and verbs should be early and\n thoroughly learned by heart, together with twenty or\n thirty of the plainest and most necessary rules of syntax.\n</p>\n<p>\n But let it be observed that, in almost all languages,\n some of the very commonest nouns and verbs have many\n irregularities in them; such are the common auxiliary\n verbs\u2014to be, and to have\u2014to do, and to be done, & c.\n The comparatives and superlatives of the words\u2014 good,\n bad, great, small, much, little, & c.; and these should be\n learned among the first rules and variations, because\n they continually occur.\n</p>\n<p>\n But as to other words, which are less frequent, let but\n few of the anomalies or irregularities of the tongue be\n taught among the general rules to young beginners.\n These will come in afterwards to be learned by advanced\n 6 *\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0074/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 209, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0074/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 418, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 708}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0074/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 836, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1416}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0074/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1673, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2832}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0074/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0074.jp2", "height": 2832, "width": 1673, "levels": 6, "size": 379534}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"74\">\n<p>\n 66\n</p>\n<p>\n OF LEARNING A LANGUAGE.\n</p>\n<p>\n scholars in a way of notes on the rules, as in the Latin\n Grammar, called the Oxford Grammar, or in Ruddi-\n man\u2019s notes on his Rudiments, & c. Or they may be\n learned by examples alone, when they do occur; or by\n a larger and more complete system of grammar, which\n descends to the more particular forms of speech; so the\n heteroclite nouns of the Latin tongue, which are taught\n in the school-book called Quae Genus, should not be\n touched in the first learning of the rudiments of the\n tongue.\n</p>\n<p>\n II. As the grammar by which you learn any tongue\n should be very short at first, so it must be written in a\n tongue with which you are well acquainted, and which\n is very familiar to you. Therefore I much prefer even\n the common English accidence (as it is called) to any\n grammar whatsoever written in Latin for this end. The\n English accidence has, doubtless, many faults; but those\n editions of it which were printed since the year 1728,\n under the correction of a learned professor, are the best;\n or the English rudiments of the Latin tongue, by that\n learned North Briton, Mr. Ruddiman, which are per\u00ac\n haps the most useful books of this kind I am acquainted\n with; especially because I would not depart too far from\n the ancient and common forms of teaching, which seve\u00ac\n ral good grammarians have done, to the great detriment\n of such lads as have been removed to other schools.\n</p>\n<p>\n The tiresome and unreasonable method of learning\n the Latin tongue by a grammar, with Latin rules,\n would appear, even to those masters who teach it so, in\n its proper colours of absurdity and ridicule, if those very\n masters would attempt to learn the Chinese or Arabic\n tongue, by a grammar written in the Chinese or Arabic\n language. Mr. Clarke, of Hull, has said enough in a\n few pages of the preface to his new grammar, 1723, to\n make that practice appear very irrational and improper;\n though he lias said it in so warm and angry a manner,\n that it has kindled Mr. Ruddiman to write against him,\n and to say what can be said to vindicate a practice,\n which, I think, is utterly indefensible.\n</p>\n<p>\n III. At the same time when you begin the rules, begin\n also the practice.

This is a most\n useful exercise to lead boys into a complete and thorough\n knowledge of what they are doing.\n</p>\n<p>\n The English translations, which the learner has made,\n should be well corrected by the master, and then they\n should be translated back again for the next day\u2019s ex\u00ac\n ercise by the child into Latin, while the Latin author is\n withheld from him; but he should have the Latin words\n given him in their first case and tense; and should never\n be left to seek them himself from a dictionary; and\n the nearer he translates it to the words of the author\n whence he derives his English, the more should the\n child be commended. Thus he will gain skill in two\n languages at once. I think Mr. Clarke has done good\n service to the public by his translations of Latin books\n for this end.\n</p>\n<p>\n But let the foolish custom of employing every silly\n boy to make themes or declamations and verses upon\n moral subjects, in a strange tongue, before he under\u00ac\n stands common sense, even in his own language, be\n abandoned and cashiered for ever.\n</p>\n<p>\n VII. As the learner improves, let him acquaint him\u00ac\n self with the anomalous words, the irregular declensions\n of nouns and verbs, the more uncommon connexions of\n words in syntax, and the exceptions to the general rules\n of grammar. But let them all be reduced, as far as\n possible, to those sever il original and general rules,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0077/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 351}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0077/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 409, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 703}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0077/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 818, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1406}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0077/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1636, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0077/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0077.jp2", "height": 2813, "width": 1636, "levels": 6, "size": 339159}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"77\">\n<p>\n OF LEARNING A LANGUAGE. 69\n</p>\n<p>\n which he has learned, as the proper rank and place to\n which they belong.\n</p>\n<p>\n VIII.

(2.)

(3.) I will grant yet further, that lads who are\n designed to make great scholars or divines, may, by\n reading these heathen poets, be taught better to under\u00ac\n stand the writings of the ancient fathers against the\n heathen religion; and they learn here what ridiculous\n fooleries the Gentile nations believed as tllfe articles of\n their faith, what wretched and foul idolatries they in\u00ac\n dulged and practised as duties of religion, for want of\n the divine revelation.

Upon the whole survey of things it is my\n opinion that, for almost all boys who learn this tongue,\n it would be much safer to be taught Latin poesy (as\n soon and as far as they can need it) from those excellent\n translations of David\u2019s Psalms, which are given us by\n Buchanan in the various measures of Horace; and the\n lower classes had better read Dr. Johnston\u2019s translation\n of these psalms, another elegant writer of the Scots\n nation, instead of Ovid\u2019s Epistles; for he has turned the\n same psalms, perhaps with greater elegance, into elegiac\n verse, whereof the learned W. Benson, esq. has lately\n published a noble edition, and I hear that these psalms\n are honoured with an increasing use in the schools of\n Holland and Scotland. A stanza or a couplet of these\n writers would now and then stick upon the minds of\n youth, and would furnish them infinitely better with\n pious and moral thoughts, and do something towards\n making them good mei^ and Christians.\n</p>\n<p>\n XVIII. A little book collected from the psalms of\n both these translators Buchanan and Johnston, and a\n few other Christian poets, would be cf excellent use for\n schools to begin their instructions in Latin poesy; and I\n am well assured this would be richly sufficient for all\n those in lower rank, who never design a learned profes\u00ac\n sion, and yet custom has foolishlv bound them to learn\n that language.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0080/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 209, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0080/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 418, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 708}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0080/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 836, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1416}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0080/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1673, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2832}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0080/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0080.jp2", "height": 2832, "width": 1673, "levels": 6, "size": 329786}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"80\">\n<p>\n T2\n</p>\n<p>\n OF LEARNING A LANGUAGE.\n</p>\n<p>\n But lest it should be thought hard to cast Horace\n and Virgil, Ovid and Juvenal entirely out of the schools,\n</p>\n<p>\n I add, if here and there a few lyric odes, or pieces of\n satires, or some episodes of heroic verse, with here and\n there an epigram of Martial, all which shall be clear\n from the stains of vice and impiety, and which may in\u00ac\n spire the mind with noble sentiments, fire the fancy with\n bright and warm ideas, or teach lessons of morality and\n prudence, were chosen out of those ancient Roman\n writers for the use of the schools, and were collected and\n printed in one moderate volume, or two at the most, it\n would be abundantly sufficient provision out of the\n Roman poets for the instruction of boys in all that is\n necessary in that age of life.\n</p>\n<p>\n Surely Juvenal himself would not have the face to\n vindicate the masters who teach boys his sixth satire,\u2019\n and many paragraphs of several others, when he him\u00ac\n self has charged us,\n</p>\n<p>\n Nil diclu foedum, visuque, ha;c limina tangat\n Intra qua; puer est.

It is this reign\u00ac\n ing principle of prejudice and party, that has given\n such a variety of senses both to the sacred writers and\n others, which would never have come into the mind of\n the reader if he had not laboured under some such pre\u00ac\n possessions.\n</p>\n<p>\n XI. For the same reason take heed of the prejudices\n of passion, malice, envy, pride, or opposition to an au\u00ac\n thor, whereby you may be easily tempted to put a false\n and invidious sense upon his -words. Lay aside there\u00ac\n fore a carping spirit, and read even an adversary with\n attention and diligence, with an honest design to find\n out his true meaning; do not snatch at little lapses and\n appearances of mistake, in opposition to his declared\n and avowed meaning; nor impute any sense or opinion\n to him which he denies to be his opinion, unless it be\n proved by the most plain and express language.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lastly, remember that you treat every author, writer,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0085/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 196, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 355}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0085/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 392, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 710}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0085/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 785, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1420}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0085/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1570, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2841}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0085/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0085.jp2", "height": 2841, "width": 1570, "levels": 6, "size": 314261}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"85\">\n<p>\n OF WRITERS OR SPEAKERS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 77\n</p>\n<p>\n or speaker, just as you yourselves would be willing to\n be treated by others, who are searching out the meaning\n of what you write or speak; and maintain upon your\n spirit an awful sense of the presence of God, who is the\n judge of hearts, and will punish those who, by a base\n and dishonest turn of mind, wilfully pervert the meaning\n of the sacred writers, or even of common authors, under\n the influence of culpable prejudices.

If we would improve our minds by conversation,\n it is a great happiness to be acquainted with persons\n wiser than ourselves. It is a piece of useful advice\n therefore to get the favour of their conversation fre\u00ac\n quently, as far as circumstances will allow: and if they\n happen to be a little reserved, use all obliging methods\n to draw out of them what may increase your own know\u00ac\n ledge.\n</p>\n<p>\n II. Whatsoever company you are in, waste not the\n time in trifle and impertinence. If you spend some hours\n amongst children, talk with them according to their\n capacity; mark the young buddings of infant reason;\n observe the different motions and distinct workings of\n the animal and the mind, as far as you can discern them;\n take notice by what degrees the little creature grows up\n to the use of his reasoning powers, and what early pre\u00ac\n judices beset and endanger his understanding. By this\n means you will learn to address yourself to children for\n their benefit, and perhaps you may derivesome useful\n philosophemes or theorems for your own entertainment.\n</p>\n<p>\n III. If you happen to be in company with a merchant\n or a sailor, a farmer or a mechanic, a milk-maid or a\n spinster, lead them into a discourse of the matters of\n their own peculiar province or profession; for every one\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0086/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 203, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 350}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0086/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 406, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 701}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0086/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 813, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1402}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0086/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1626, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2804}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0086/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0086.jp2", "height": 2804, "width": 1626, "levels": 6, "size": 344131}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"86\">\n<p>\n 78\n</p>\n<p>\n OF CONVERSATION.\n</p>\n<p>\n knows, or should know, their own business best.

Confine not yourself always to one sort of com\u00ac\n pany, or to persons of the same party or opinion, either\n in matters of learning, religion, or civil life, lest, if you\n should happen to be nursed up or educated in early\n mistake, you should be confirmed and established in the\n same mistake, by conversing only with persons of the\n same sentiments. A free and general conversation with\n men of very various countries and of different parties,\n opinions, and practices, so far as it may be done safely, is\n of excellent use to undeceive us in many wrong judg\u00ac\n ments which we may have framed, and to lead us into\n juster thoughts. It is said, when the king of Siam, near\n China, first conversed with some European merchants,\n who sought the favour of trading on his coast, he in\u00ac\n quired of them some of the common appearances of\n summer and winter in their country; and when they\n told him of water growing so hard in their rivers, that\n men and horses and laden carriages passed over it, and\n that rain sometimes fell down as white and light as\n feathers, and sometimes almost as hard as stones, he\n would not believe a syllable they said; for ice, snow, and\n hail, were names and things utterly unknown to him\n and to his subjects in that hot climate: he renounced all\n traffic with such shameful liars, and would not suffer\n them to trade with his people. See here the natural\n effects of gross ignorance.\n</p>\n<p>\n Conversation with foreigners on various occasions,\n has a happy influence to enlarge our minds, and to set\n them free from many errors and gross prejudices we are\n ready to imbibe concerning them. Domicillus has never\n travelled five miles from his mother\u2019s chimney, and he\n imagines all outlandish men are papishes, and worship\n nothing but a cross. Tityrus, the shepherd, was bred\n up all his life in the country, and never saw Rome; he\n fancied it to be only a huge village, and was therefore\n infinitely surprised to find such palaces, such streets,\n such glittering treasures and gay magnificence as his\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0087/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 196, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 355}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0087/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 392, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 710}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0087/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 785, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1420}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0087/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1570, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2841}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0087/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0087.jp2", "height": 2841, "width": 1570, "levels": 6, "size": 311646}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"87\">\n<p>\n OP CONVERSATION. 79\n</p>\n<p>\n first journey to the city showed him, and with wonder he\n confesses his folly and mistake.*\n</p>\n<p>\n So Virgil introduces a poor shepherd,\n</p>\n<p>\n Urbem quam dicunt Romam, Meliboec, putavi\n Stultus ego huic nostra; similem, quo saepe solemus\n Pastores ovium teneros depellere foetus, & c.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus Englished:\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Fool that I was!

In mixed company, among acquaintance and\n strangers, endeavour to learn something from all. Be\n swift to hear; but be cautious of your tongue, lest you\n betray your ignorance, and perhaps offend some of those\n who are present too. The scripture severely censures\n those who speak evil of the things they know not. Ac\u00ac\n quaint yourself therefore sometimes with persons and\n parties which are far distant from your common life and\n customs: this is a way whereby you may form a wiser\n opinion of men and things. Prove all things, and hold\n fast that which is good, is a divine rule, and it comes\n from the Father of light and truth. But young persons\n should practise it indeed with due limitation, and under\n the eye of their elders.\n</p>\n<p>\n VI. Be not frighted nor provoked at opinions different\n from your own. Some persons are so confident they\n are in the right, that they will not come within the\n hearing of any notions but their own: they canton out\n to themselves a little province in the intellectual world,\n where they fancy the light shines; and all the rest is in\n darkness.

Sometimes you will find a\n person who, in his conversation or his writings, delivers\n his thoughts in so plain, so easy, so familiar, and per\u00ac\n spicuous a manner, that you both understand and assent\n to every thing he saith, as fast as you read or hear it:\n hereupon some hearers have been ready to conclude in\n haste, Surely this man saith none but common things; I\n knew as much before, or I would have said all this my\u00ac\n self. This is a frequent mistake. Pellucido was a very\n great genius; when he spoke in the senate, he was wont\n to convey his ideas in so simple and happy a manner as\n to instruct and convince every hearer, and to enforce the\n conviction through the whole illustrious assembly; and\n that with so much evidence, that you would have been\n ready to wonder, that every one who spoke had not said\n the same things: but Pellucido was the only man\n that could do it; the only speaker who had attained this\n art and honour. Such is the writer of whom Horace\n would say,\n</p>\n<p>\n .Ut sibi quivis\n</p>\n<p>\n Speret idem; sudet multum, frustraque laboret\n</p>\n<p>\n Ausus idem. De Art, Poet,\n</p>\n<p>\n Smooth be your style, and plain and natural,\n</p>\n<p>\n To strike the sons of Wapping or Whitehall.\n</p>\n<p>\n While others think this easy to attain,\n</p>\n<p>\n Let them but try, and with their utmost pain,\n</p>\n<p>\n They\u2019ll sweat and strive to imitate in vain.\n</p>\n<p>\n XII. If any thing seem dark in the discourse of your\n companion, so that you have not a clear idea of what is\n spoken, endeavour to obtain a clearer conception of it by\n a decent manner of inquiry. Do not charge the speaker\n with obscurity, either in his sense or his words, but\n entreat his favour to relieve your own want of penetra\u00ac\n tion, or to add an enlightening word or two, that you\n may take up his whole meaning.\n</p>\n<p>\n If difficulties arise in your mind, and constrain your\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0091/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 196, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 355}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0091/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 392, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 710}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0091/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 785, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1420}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0091/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1570, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2841}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0091/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0091.jp2", "height": 2841, "width": 1570, "levels": 6, "size": 329477}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"91\">\n<p>\n OF CONVERSATION.\n</p>\n<p>\n 83\n</p>\n<p>\n dissent to the things spoken, represent what objection\n some persons would be ready to make against the senti\u00ac\n ments of the speaker, without telling him you oppose.\n This manner of address carries something more modest\n and obliging in it, than to appear to raise objections of\n your own by way of contradiction to him that spoke.\n</p>\n<p>\n XIII.

It is pity in\u00ac\n deed that truth should ever need such sort of defences;\n but we know that a triumphant assurance hath some\u00ac\n times supported gross falsehoods, and a whole company\n have been captivated to error by this means, till some\n man with equal assurance has rescued them. It is pity\n that any momentous point of doctrine should happen\n to fall under such reproaches, and require such a mode\n of vindication: though if I happen to hear it, I ought\n not to turn my back and to sneak off in silence, and\n leave the truth to lie baffled, bleeding, and slain. Yet\n I must confess, I should be glad to have no occasion ever\n given me to fight with any man at this sort of weapons,\n even though i should be so happy as to silence his in\u00ac\n solence and to obtain an evident victory.\n</p>\n<p>\n XVII. Be not fond of disputing every thing pro and\n con, nor indulge yourself to show your talent of attack\u00ac\n ing and defending. A logic which teaches nothing else\n is little worth. This temper and practice will lead you\n just so far out of the way of knowledge, and divert your\n honest inquiry after the truth which is debated or sought.\n In set disputes, every little straw is often laid hold on\n 8\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0094/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 203, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 350}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0094/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 406, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 701}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0094/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 813, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1402}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0094/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1626, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2804}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0094/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0094.jp2", "height": 2804, "width": 1626, "levels": 6, "size": 351130}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"94\">\n<p>\n 86\n</p>\n<p>\n OF\u00bbCONVERSATIOV.\n</p>\n<p>\n to support our own cause; every thing that can be drawn\n in any way to give colour to our argument is advanced,\n and that perhaps with vanity and ostentation.

Under the general head of conversation for the\n improvement of the mind, we may rank the practice of\n disputing; that is, when two or more persons appear to\n maintain different sentiments, and defend their own or\n oppose the other\u2019s opinion, in alternate discourse, by some\n methods of argument.\n</p>\n<p>\n II. As these disputes often arise in good earnest,\n where the two contenders do really believe the different\n propositions which they support; so sometimes they are\n appointed as mere trials of skill in academies or schools\n by the students; sometimes they are practised, and that\n with apparent fervour, in courts of judicature by law\u00ac\n yers, in order to gain the fees of their different clients,\n while both sides perhaps are really of the same senti\u00ac\n ment with regard to the cause which is tried.\n</p>\n<p>\n III. In common conversation, disputes are often man\u00ac\n aged without any forms of regularity or order, and they\n turn to good or evil purposes, chiefly according to the\n temper of the disputants. They may sometimes be suc\u00ac\n cessful to search out truth, sometimes effectual to main\u00ac\n tain truth, and convince the mistaken; but at other times\n a dispute is a mere scene of battle in order to victory\n and vain triumph.\n</p>\n<p>\n IV. There aro some few general rules which should\n</p>\n<p>\n be observed in all debates whatsoever, if we would find\n out truth by them, or convince a friend of his error, even\n though they be not managed according to any settled\n forms of disputation; and as there are almost as many\n opinions and judgments of things as there are persons,\n so when several persons happen to meet and confer to\u00ac\n gether upon any subject, they are ready to ' declare their\n different sentiments, and support them by such reason\u00ac\n ings as they are capable of. This is called debating or\n disputing, as is above described. ^\n</p>\n<p>\n V When persons begin a debate, they should always\n take care that they are agreed in some general princi\u00ac\n ples or propositions, which either more nearly or remote-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0101/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 202, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 349}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0101/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 404, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 698}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0101/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 808, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1397}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0101/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1617, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2794}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0101/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0101.jp2", "height": 2794, "width": 1617, "levels": 6, "size": 337951}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"101\">\n<p>\n OP PISPUTES IN GENERAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n 93\n</p>\n<p>\n ly affect the question in hand; for otherwise they have\n no foundation or hope of convincing each other; they\n must have some common ground to stand upon, while\n they maintain the contest.\n</p>\n<p>\n When they find they agree in some remote proposi\u00ac\n tions, then let them search farther, and inquire how near\n they approach to each other\u2019s sentiments, and whatso\u00ac\n ever propositions they agree in, let these lay a founda\n tion for the mutual hope of conviction.

And not only the sense and meaning of the\n words used in the question should be settled and adjust\u00ac\n ed between the disputants, but the precise point of in\u00ac\n quiry should be distinctly fixed; the question in debate\n should be limited precisely to its special extent, or de\u00ac\n clared to be taken in its more general sense. As for in\u00ac\n stance, if two men are contending whether civil govern\u00ac\n ment be of divine right or not: here it must be observed,\n the question is not whether monarchy in one man, or a\n republic in multitudes of the people, or an aristocracy\n in a few of the chief, is appointed of God as necessary;\n but whether civil government in its most general sense,\n or in any form whatsoever, is derived from the will and\n appointment of God. Again, the point of inquiry should\n be limited further. Thus the question is, not whether\n government comes from the will of God by the light of\n divine revelation, for that is granted; but whether it is\n derived from the will of God by the light of reason too.\n This sort of specification or limitation of the question\n hinders and prevents the disputants from wandering\n away from the precise point of inquiry.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is this trifling humour or dishonest artifice of chang\u00ac\n ing the question, and wandering away from the first\n point of debate, which gives endless length to disputes,\n and causes both disputants to part without any satisfac\u00ac\n tion. And one chief occasion of it is this: when one of\n the combatants feels his cause run low and fail, and is\n just ready to be confuted and demolished, he is tempted\n to step aside to avoid the blow, and betakes him to a dif\u00ac\n ferent question: thus, if his adversary be not well aware\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0103/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 202, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 349}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0103/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 404, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 698}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0103/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 808, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1397}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0103/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1617, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2794}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0103/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0103.jp2", "height": 2794, "width": 1617, "levels": 6, "size": 337037}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"103\">\n<p>\n OF DISPUTES IN GENERAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n 95\n</p>\n<p>\n of him, he begins to entrench himself in a new fastness,\n and holds out the siege with a new artillery of thoughts\n and words.

How swift to take hold of some occasion\u00ac\n al word, thereby to lead the discourse off from the point\n in hand! So much afraid is human nature of parting with\n its errors, and being overcome by truth.

The tutor appoints a question in some of the\n sciences, to be debated amongst his students: one of\n them undertakes to affirm or to deny the question, and\n to defend his assertion or negation, and to answer all\n objections against it; he is called the respondent: and\n the rest of the students in the same class, or who pursue\n the same science, are the opponents, who are appointed\n to dispute or raise objections against the proposition thus\n affirmed or denied.\n</p>\n<p>\n II. Each of the students successively in their tarn be\u00ac\n come the respondent or the defender of that proposition,\n while the rest oppose it also successively in their turns.\n</p>\n<p>\n III. It is the business of the respondent to write a\n thesis in Latin, or short discourses on the question pro\u00ac\n posed; and he either affirms or denies the question, ac\u00ac\n cording to the opinion of the tutor, which is supposed\n to be the truth, and he reads it at the beginning of the\n dispute.\n</p>\n<p>\n IV. In his discourse (which is written with as great\n accuracy as the youth is capable of) he explains the\n terms of the question, frees them from all ambiguity,\n fixes their sense, declares the true intent and meaning\n of the question itself, separates it from other questions\n with which it may have been complicated, and distin\u00ac\n guishes it from other questions which may happen to\n be akin to it, and then pronounces in the negative or af\u00ac\n firmative concerning it.\n</p>\n<p>\n V. When this is done, then, in the second part of his\n discourse, he gives his own strongest arguments to con\u00ac\n firm the proposition he has laid down, i. e. to vindicate\n his own side of the question; but he does not usually\n proceed to represent the objections against it, and to\n solve or answer them; for it is the business of the other\n etudents to raiso objections in disputing.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0118/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 203, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 350}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0118/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 406, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 701}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0118/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 813, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1402}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0118/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1626, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2804}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0118/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0118.jp2", "height": 2804, "width": 1626, "levels": 6, "size": 345175}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"118\">\n<p>\n no\n</p>\n<p>\n OP ACADEMIC, OB\n</p>\n<p>\n VI.

But this is not al\u00ac\n ways permitted; nor should it indeed ever be indulged,\n lest it teach youth to reproach instead of to reason.\n</p>\n<p>\n VII. When the respondent has read over his thesis in\n the school, the junior student makes an objection, and\n draws it up into the regular form of a syllogism: the\n respondent repeats the objection, and either denies the\n major or minor proposition directly, or he distinguishes\n upon some word or phrase in the major or minor, and\n shows in what sense the proposition may be true, but\n that sense does not affect the question: and then declares,\n that in the sense which affects the present question, the\n proposition is not true, and consequently he denies it.\n</p>\n<p>\n VIII.

When the state of the controversy is well known,\n and plainly determined and agreed, it must not be al\u00ac\n tered by either disputant in the course of the disputa\u00ac\n tion; and the respondent especially should keep a watch\u00ac\n ful eye on the opponent in this matter.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

It\n furnishes the soul with various occasions of starting such\n thoughts as otherwise would never have come into the\n mind. It makes a student more expert in attacking and\n refuting an error, as well as in vindicating a truth. It\n instructs the scholar in the various methods of warding\n off the force of objections, and of discovering and re\u00ac\n pelling the subtle tricks of sophisters. It procures also\n a freedom and readiness of speech, and raises the mod\u00ac\n est and diffident genius to a due degree of courage.\n</p>\n<p>\n XVI. But there are some very grievous inconvenien\u00ac\n ces that may sometimes overbalance all these advanta\u00ac\n ges. For many young students, by a constant habit of\n disputing, grow impudent and audacious, proud and dis\u00ac\n dainful, talkative and impertinent, and render themselves\n intolerable by an obstinate humour of maintaining what\u00ac\n ever they have asserted, as well as by a spirit of contra\u00ac\n diction, opposing almost every thing that they hear.\n The disputation itself often awakens the passions of am\u00ac\n bition, emulation, and anger; it carries away the mind\n</p>\n<p>\n 10*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0122/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 203, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 350}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0122/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 406, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 701}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0122/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 813, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1402}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0122/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1626, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2804}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0122/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0122.jp2", "height": 2804, "width": 1626, "levels": 6, "size": 335831}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"122\">\n<p>\n 114\n</p>\n<p>\n OF ACADEMIC, OR\n</p>\n<p>\n from that calm and sedate temper which is so necessary\n to contemplate truth.\n</p>\n<p>\n XVII. It is evident also, that by frequent exercises of\n this sort, wherein opinions true and false are argued,\n supported, and refuted on both sides, the mind of man\n is led by insensible degrees to an uncertainty and fluctu\u00ac\n ating temper, and falls into danger of a sceptical hu\u00ac\n mour, which never comes to an establishment in any\n doctrines. Many persons, by this means, become much\n more ready to observe whatsoever is offered in searching\n out truth; they hardly wait till they have read or heard\n the sentiment of any person, before their heads are bus\u00ac\n ily employed to seek out arguments against it. They\n grow naturally sharp in finding out difficulties; and by\n indulging this humour they converse with the dark and\n doubtful parts of a subject so long, till they almost ren\u00ac\n der themselves incapable of receiving the full evidence\n of a proposition, and acknowledging the light of truth.\n It has some tendency to make a youth a carping critic,\n rather than a judicious man.\n</p>\n<p>\n XVIII. I would add yet further, that in these dispu\u00ac\n tations the respondent is generally appointed to main\u00ac\n tain the supposed truth, that is, the tutor\u2019s opinion. But\n all the opponents are busy and warmly engaged in find\u00ac\n ing arguments against the truth. Now if a sprightly\n young genius happens to manage his arguments so well\n as to puzzle and gravel the respondent, and perhaps to\n perplex the moderator a little too, he is soon tempted to\n suppose his argument unanswerable, and the truth en\u00ac\n tirely to lie on his side. The pleasure which he takes\n in having found a sophism which has great appearance\n of reason, and which he himself has managed with such\n success, becomes perhaps a strong prejudice to engage his\n inward sentiments in favour of his argument, and in op\u00ac\n position to the supposed truth.\n</p>\n<p>\n XIX. Yet perhaps it may be possible to reduce scho\u00ac\n lastic disputations under such a guard as, may, in some\n measure, prevent most of these abuses of them, and the\n unhappy events that too often attend them; for it is pity\n that an exercise which has some valuable benefits atten\u00ac\n ding it, should be utterly thrown away, if it be possible\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0123/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 202, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 349}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0123/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 404, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 698}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0123/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 808, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1397}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0123/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1617, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2794}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0123/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0123.jp2", "height": 2794, "width": 1617, "levels": 6, "size": 324199}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"123\">\n<p>\n SCHOLASTIC DISPUTATION. 115\n</p>\n<p>\n to secure young minds against the abuse of it; for which\n purpose some of these directions may seem proper.\n</p>\n<p>\n XX. General directions for scholastic disputes:\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. Never dispute upon mere trifles, things that are\n utterly useless to be known, under a vain pretence of\n sharpening the wit; for the same advantage may be de\u00ac\n rived from solid and useful subjects, and thus two hap\u00ac\n py ends may be attained at once. Or if such disputa\u00ac\n tions are always thought dangerous in important mat\u00ac\n ters, let them be utterly abandoned.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Do not make infinite and unsearchable things the\n matter of dispute, nor such propositions as are made up\n of mere words without ideas, lest it lead young persons\n into a most unhappy habit of talking without a mean\u00ac\n ing, and boldly to determine upon things that are hardly\n within the reacli of human capacity.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Let not obvious and known truths, or some of the\n most plain and certain propositions, be bandied about in\n a disputation, for a mere trial of skill; for he that oppo\u00ac\n ses them in this manner will be in danger of contracting\n a habit of opposing all evidence, will acquire aspiritof\n contradiction, and pride himself in a power of resisting\n the brightest light, and fighting against the strongest\n proofs; this will insensibly injure the mind, and tends\n greatly to a universal scepticism.\n</p>\n<p>\n Upon the whole, therefore, the most proper subjects\n of dispute seem to be, those very questions which are\n not of the very highest importance and certainty, nor\n of the meanest and trifling kind; but rather the interme\u00ac\n diate questions between these two, and there is a large\n sufficiency of them in the sciences. But this I put as a\n mere proposal, to be determined by the more learned\n and prudent.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. It would be well if every dispute could be so or\u00ac\n dered as to be a means of searching out truth, and not\n to gain a triumph. Then each disputant might come\n to the work without bias and prejudice: with a desire of\n truth, and not witn ambition of glory and victory.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nor should the aim and design of the disputant be to\n avoid artfully arid escape the difficulties which the op-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0124/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 203, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 350}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0124/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 406, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 701}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0124/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 813, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1402}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0124/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1626, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2804}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0124/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0124.jp2", "height": 2804, "width": 1626, "levels": 6, "size": 348448}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"124\">\n<p>\n lie\n</p>\n<p>\n OF ACADEMIC, OR\n</p>\n<p>\n portent offers, but to discuss them thoroughly, and solve\n them fairly, if they are capable of being solved.\n</p>\n<p>\n Again, let the opponent be solicitous not to darken\n and confound the responses that are given him by fresh\n subtleties; but let him bethink himself whether they are\n not a just answer to the objection, and be honestly ready\n to perceive and accept them, and yield to them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.

We\n make haste to determine upon a slight and a sudden\n view, we confirm our guesses which arise from a glance,\n we pa.ss a judgment while we have but a confused or\n obscure perception, and thus plunge ourselves into mis\n takes. This is like a man who, walking in a mist, or\n being at a great distance fron\\any visible object (suppose\n a tree, a man, a horse, or a church,) judges much amiss\n of the figure, and situation, and colours of it, and some\u00ac\n times takes one for the other; whereas, if he would but\n withhold his judgment till he came nearer to it, or stay\n till clearer light comes, and then would fix his eyes longer\n upon it, he would secure himself from those mistakes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, in order to gain a greater facility of attention,\n we may observe these rules:\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n I.

It is but acquiring a hearty good will and\n resolution to search out and survey the various properties\n and parts of such objects, and our attention will be en\u00ac\n gaged, if there be any delight or diversion in the study\n or contemplation of them. Therefore mathematical\n studies have a strange influence towards fixing the at\u00ac\n tention of the mind, and giving a steadiness to a wander\u00ac\n ing disposition, because they deal much in lines, figures,\n and numbers, which affect and please the sense and im\u00ac\n agination. Histories have a strong tendency the same\n way, for they engage the soul by a variety of sensible\n occurrences; when it hath begun, it knows not how to\n leave off; it longs to know the final event, through a\n natural curiosity that belongs to mankind. Voyages\n and travels, and accounts of strange countries and strange\n appearances, will assist in this work. This sort of study\n detains the mind by the perpetual occurrence and ex\u00ac\n pectation of something new, and that which may grate\u00ac\n fully strike the imagination.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0139/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 202, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 349}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0139/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 404, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 698}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0139/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 808, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1397}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0139/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1617, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2794}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0139/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0139.jp2", "height": 2794, "width": 1617, "levels": 6, "size": 363425}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"139\">\n<p>\n OF FIXING THE ATTEirtrON.

Apply yourself to those studies, and read those\n authors who draw out their subjects into a perpetual\n chain of connected reasonings, wherein the following\n parts of the discourse are naturally and easily derived\n from those which go before.

Rather\n be contented with ignorance for a season, and continue\n in suspense till your attention, and meditation, and due\n labour, have found out sufficient evidence on one side.\n Some are so fond to know a great deal at once, and\n love to talk of things with freedom and boldness before\n they truly understand them, that they scarcely ever al\u00ac\n low themselves attention enough to search the matter\n through and through.\n</p>\n<p>\n VI.

The passions call away the thoughts\n with incessant importunity towards the object that ex\u00ac\n cited them; and if we indulge the frequent rise and rov\u00ac\n ing of passions, we shall thereby procure an unsteady\n and. unattentive habit of mind.\n</p>\n<p>\n Yet this one exception must be admitted, viz.

Be not satisfied with obscure\n and confused conceptions of things, especially where\n clearer may be obtained; for one obscure or confused\n idea, especially if it be of great importance in the ques\u00ac\n tion, intermingled with many clear ones, and placed in\n its variety of aspects towards them, will be in danger\n of spreading confusion over the whole scene of ideas,\n and thus may have an unhappy influence to overwhelm\n the understanding with darkness and pervert the judg\u00ac\n ment. A little black paint will shamefully tincture and\n spoil twenty gay colours.\n</p>\n<p>\n Consider yet further, that if you content yourself\n frequently with words instead of ideas, or with cloudy\n and confused notions of things, how impenetrable will\n that darkness be, and how vast and endless that confu\u00ac\n sion which must surround and involve the understand\u00ac\n ing, when many of these obscure and confused ideas\n come to be set before the soul at once; and how impos-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0155/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 202, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 349}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0155/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 404, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 698}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0155/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 808, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1397}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0155/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1617, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2794}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0155/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0155.jp2", "height": 2794, "width": 1617, "levels": 6, "size": 330664}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"155\">\n<p>\n CAPACITY OP THE MIND.\n</p>\n<p>\n 141\n</p>\n<p>\n sible will it be to form a clear and just, judgment about\n them.\n</p>\n<p>\n III. Use all diligence to acquire and treasure up a\n large store of ideas and notions: take every opportunity\n to add something to your stock; and by frequent recol\u00ac\n lection fix them in your memory; nothing tends to con\u00ac\n firm and enlarge the memory like a frequent review of\n its possessions. Then the brain being well furnished\n with various traces, signatures, and images, will have a\n rich treasure always ready to be proposed or offered to\n the soul, when it directs its thought towards any par\u00ac\n ticular subject. This will gradually give the mind a\n faculty of surveying many objects at once, as a room\n that is richly adorned and hung round with a great va\u00ac\n riety of pictures strikes the eye almost at once with all\n that variety, especially if they have been well surveyed\n one by one at first: this makes it habitual and more ea\u00ac\n sy to the inhabitants to take in many of those painted\n scenes with a single glance or two.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here note, that by acquiring a rich treasure of notions,\n I do not mean only single ideas, but also propositions,\n observations, and experiences, with reasonings and argu\u00ac\n ments upon the various subjects that occur among\n natural and moral, common or sacred affairs; that when\n you are called to judge concerning any question, you\n will have some principles of truth, some useful axioms\n and observations, always ready at hand to direct and as\u00ac\n sist your judgment.\n</p>\n<p>\n IV. It is necessary that we should as far as possible\n entertain and lay up our daily new ideas in a regular order,\n and range the acquisitions of our souls under proper heads,\n whether of divinity, law, physics, mathematics, morality,\n politics, trade, domestic life, civility, decency, & .c.\n whether of cause, effect, substance, mode, power, pro\u00ac\n perty, body, spirit, & c. We should inure our minds to\n method and order continually; and when we take in any\n fresh ideas, occurrences, and observations, we should\n dispose of them in their proper places, and see how they\n stand and agree with the rest of our notions on the same\n subjects: as a scholar would dispose of a new book on a\n proper shelf among its kindred authors; or as an officer\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0156/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 203, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 350}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0156/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 406, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 701}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0156/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 813, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1402}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0156/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1626, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2804}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0156/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0156.jp2", "height": 2804, "width": 1626, "levels": 6, "size": 333767}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"156\">\n<p>\n 14S\n</p>\n<p>\n OF ENLARGING THE\n</p>\n<p>\n at the post-house in London disposes of eveiy letter he\n takes in, placing it in the box that belongs to the proper\n road or county.\n</p>\n<p>\n In any of these cases, if things lay all in a heap, the\n addition of any new object would increase the confusion;\n but method gives a speedy and short survey of them\n with ease and pleasure. Method is of admirable ad\u00ac\n vantage to keep our ideas from a confused mixture, and\n to preserve them ready for every use. The science of\n ontology, which distributes all beings, and all the affec\u00ac\n tions of being, whether absolute or relative, under proper\n classes, is of good service to keep our intellectual acqui\u00ac\n sitions in such order as that the mind may survey them\n at once.\n</p>\n<p>\n V. As method is necessary for the improvement of the\n mind, in order to make your treasure of ideas most use\u00ac\n ful, so in all your further pursuits of truth and acquire\u00ac\n ments of rational knowledge, observe a regular progres\u00ac\n sive method. Begin with the most simple, easy, and\n obvious ideas; then b}^ degrees join two, and three, and\n more of them together: thus the complicated ideas, grow\u00ac\n ing ' up under your eye and observation, will not give the\n same confusion of thought as they would do if they were\n all offered to the mind at once, without your observing\n the original and formation of them. An eminent ex\u00ac\n ample of this appears in the study of arithmetic. If a\n scholar, just admitted into the school, observes his master\n performing an operation in the rule of division, his\n head is at once disturbed and confounded with the mani\u00ac\n fold comparisons of the numbers of the divisor and di\u00ac\n vidend. and the multiplication of the one and subtrac\u00ac\n tion of it from the other; but if he begin regularly at\n addition, and so proceed by subtraction and multiplica\u00ac\n tion, he will then in a few weeks be able to take in an\n intelligent survey of all those operations in division, and\n to practise them himself with ease and pleasure, each\n of which at first seemed all intricacy and confusion.\n</p>\n<p>\n An illustration of the like nature may be borrowed\n from geometry and algebra, and other mathematical\n practices: how easily does an expert geometrician with\n one glance of his eye take in a complicated diagram,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0157/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 202, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 349}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0157/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 404, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 698}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0157/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 808, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1397}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0157/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1617, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2794}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0157/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0157.jp2", "height": 2794, "width": 1617, "levels": 6, "size": 327905}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"157\">\n<p>\n CAPACITY OF THE MIND.\n</p>\n<p>\n 149\n</p>\n<p>\n made up of many lines and circles, angles, and arches!\n How readily does he judgS of it, whether the demon\u00ac\n stration designed by it be true or false!

These are the first\n steps by which the ample and capacious souls among\n mankind have arrived at that prodigious extent of know\u00ac\n ledge, which renders them the wonder and glory of the\n nation where they live. Though Plato and Cicero,\n Descartes and Mr. Boyle, Mr. Locke and Sir Isaac New\u00ac\n ton, were doubtless favoured by nature with a genius of\n uncommon amplitude; yet, in their early years, and first\n attempts of science, this was but limited and narrow, in\n comparison of what they attained at last.

You shall scarcely ever find this man\n forward in judging and determining things proposed to\n him; but he always takes time, and delays, and sus\u00ac\n pends, and ponders things maturely, before he passes his\n judgment: then he practises a slow meditation, rumi\u00ac\n nates on the subject, and thus perhaps in two or three\n nights and days rouses and awakens those several ideas,\n one after* another, as he can, which are necessary in or\u00ac\n der to judge aright of the thing proposed, and makes\n them pass before his review in succession: this he doth\n to relieve the want both of a quick sagacity of thought\n and of a ready memory and speedy recollection; and\n this caution and practice lays the foundation of his just\n judgment and wise conduct.

The bright genius is ready\n to be so forward as often betrays itself into great errors\n in judgment, speech, and conduct, without a continual\n guard upon itself, and using the bridle of the tongue.\n And it is by this delay and precaution that many a person\n of much lower natural abilities shall often excel persons\n of the brightest genius in wisdom and prudence.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is often found that a fine genius has but a feeble\n memory: for where the genius is bright, and the imagi\u00ac\n nation vivid, the power of memory may be too much\n neglected and lose its improvement.

Though it is not mat\u00ac\n ter, yet it works by means of matter, and its operations\n are materially affected by the condition of the brain, its\n principal organ. Through the medium of the brain and\n nervous system the mind obtains a knowledge of the\n external world. The memory receives impressions of\n facts and evdhts, and treasures up their images ; and\n it also becomes the retentive receptacle of the ideas and\n conclusions derived from meditation and reflection.\n</p>\n<p>\n The immaturity of the brain in early life renders it\n incapable of becoming the instrument of powerful mental\n actions, and the images which are then impressed upon\n the memory are chiefly those of facts and events. The\n memory grows from the period of infancy, and may be\n greatly improved by proper exercise, or injured by sloth.\n</p>\n<p>\n The improvement of the memory requires the culti\u00ac\n vation of habits of attention, or of intense application of\n the mipd to whatever is, at the time, its more immediate\n object of pursuit. Slight impressions are soon forgotten,\n but whatever is impressed upon the mind by fixed atten\u00ac\n tion and close thought, is indelibly stamped upon the\n memory, and becomes as durable as the mind itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many persons of advanced age will tell long stories\n of things which occurred during the early period of their\n lives, and were so deeply engraven upon the memory\n as to be retained, in their most minute particulars through\n a long succession of years.\n</p>\n<p>\n The memory is more or less affected by various dis\u00ac\n eases of the body ; chiefly from injuries of the head,\n affections of the brain, fever, and diseases of extreme\n debility.

Many acts by degrees form a habit,\n and thereby the ability or power is strengthened, and\n made more ready to appear again in action. Our mem\u00ac\n ories should be used and inured from childhood to bear\n a moderate quantity of knowledge let into them early,\n and they will thereby become strong for use and service.\n As any limb well and duly exercised grows stronger, the\n nerves of the body are corroborated thereby. Milo took\n up a calf, and daily carried it on his shoulders; as the\n calf grew, his strength grew also, and he at last arrived\n at firmness of joints enough to bear the bull.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our memories will be in a great m\u2019easure moulded\n and formed, improved or injured, according to the ex\u00ac\n ercise of them. If we never use them, they will be al\u00ac\n most lost. Those who are wont to converse or read\n but a few things only, will retain but a few in their\n memory; those who are used to remember things but for\n an hour, and ' charge their memories with it no longer,\n will retain them but an hour before they vanish. And\n let words be remembered as well as things, that so you\n may acquire a copia verborum as well as rerum , and be\n more ready to express your mind on all occasions.\n</p>\n<p>\n Yet there should be a caution given in such cases: the\n memory of a child or any infirm person should not be\n overburdened; for a limb or a joint may be overstrained\n by being too much loaded, and its natural power never\n be recovered. Teachers should wisely judge of the\n power and constitution of youth, and impose no more\n on them than they are able to bear with cheerfulness\n and improvement.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0167/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 202, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 349}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0167/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 404, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 698}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0167/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 808, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1397}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0167/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1617, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2794}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0167/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0167.jp2", "height": 2794, "width": 1617, "levels": 6, "size": 337135}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"167\">\n<p>\n OP IMPROVING THE MEMORY 159\n</p>\n<p>\n And particularly they should take care that the rnem-\n Drv of the learner be not too much crowded with a tu\u00ac\n rn iltuous heap or overbearing multitude of documents\n or ideas at one time: this is the way to remember noth\u00ac\n ing; one idea effaces another.

Due attention and diligence to learn and know\n things, which we would commit to our remembrance, is\n a rule of great necessity in this case. When the atten\u00ac\n tion is strongly fixed to any particular subject, all that\n is said concerning it makes a deeper impression upon\n the mind. There are some persons who complain they\n cannot remember divine or human discourses which they\n hear, when, in truth, their thoughts are wandering half\n the time, or they hear with such coldness and indiffer-\n ency, and a trifling temper of spirit, that it is no wonder\n the things which are read or spoken make but a slight\n impression on the mind, and get no firm footing in the\n seat of memory, but soon vanish and are lost.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is needful, therefore, if we would maintain a long\n remembrance of the things which we read, or hear, that\n we should engage our delight and pleasure in those sub\u00ac\n jects, and use the other methods which are before pre\u00ac\n scribed in order to fix the attention. Sloth, indolence,\n and idleness, will no more bless the mind with intellec\u00ac\n tual riches, than it will fill the hand with gain, the field\n with corn, or the purse with treasure.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let it be added also, that not only the slothful and\n the negligent deprive themselves of proper knowledge\n for the\u00b0furniture of their memory, bui such as appear\n to have active spirits, who are ever skimming over the\n surface of things with a volatile temper, will fix nothing\n in their mind. 3 Vario will spend whole mornings in\n running over loose and unconnected pages, and with\n fresh curiosity is ever glancing over new words and\n ideas that strike his present fancy; - he is fluttering over\n a thousand objects of art and science, and yet treasures\n up but little knowledge.

Clear and distinct apprehension of the things\n which we commit to memory is necessary in order to\n make them stick and dwell there. If we would remem\u00ac\n ber words, or learn the names of persons or things, wo\n should have them recommended to our memory by a\n clear and distinct pronunciation, spelling, or writing.\n If we would treasure up the ideas of things, notions,\n propositions, arguments, and sciences, these should be\n recommended also to our memory by a clear and dis\u00ac\n tinct perception of them. Faint, glimmering, and con\u00ac\n fused ideas will vanish like images seen in twilight.\n Every thing which we learn should be conveyed to the\n understanding in the plainest expressions, without any\n ambiguity, that we may not mistake what we desire to\n remember. This is a general rule, whether we would\n employ the memory about words or things, though it\n must be confessed that mere sounds and words are much\n harder to get by heart than the knowledge of things and\n real images.\n</p>\n<p>\n For this reason take heed (as I have often before\n warned) that you do not take up with words instead of\n things, nor mere sounds instead of real sentiments and\n ideas. Many a lad forgets what has been taught him,\n merely because he never well understood it; he never\n clearly and distinctly took in the meaning of those\n sounds and syllables which he was required to get by\n heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is one true reason why boys make so poor a\n proficiency in learning the Latin tongue under masters\n who teach them by grammars and rules written in Lat\u00ac\n in, of which I have spoken before. And this is a com\u00ac\n mon case with children when they learn their catechisms\n in their early days.

Most of these he divided also into four parts,\n viz. head and body, feet, fins, or wings, and tail, and by\n some arbitrary or chimerical attachments of each of\n these to a word or thing, which he desired to remember,\n he committed them to the care of his memory, and that\n with good success.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is also by this association of ideas that we may\n better imprint any new idea upon the memory, by join\u00ac\n ing with it some circumstance of the time, place, com\u00ac\n pany, & c. wherein we first observed, heard, or learned\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0176/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 203, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 350}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0176/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 406, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 701}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0176/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 813, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1402}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0176/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1626, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2804}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0176/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0176.jp2", "height": 2804, "width": 1626, "levels": 6, "size": 344137}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"176\">\n<p>\n 168\n</p>\n<p>\n OF IMPROVING THE MEMORY.\n</p>\n<p>\n it.

An idea\n or word which has been lost or forgotten, has been often\n recovered by hitting upon some other kindred word or\n idea which has the nearest resemblance to it, and that\n in the letters, syllables, or sound of the name, as well as\n properties of the thing.\n</p>\n<p>\n If we would remember Hippocrates, or Galen, or\n Paracelsus, think of a physician\u2019s name beginning with\n H, G, or P.

It has sometimes been the practice of men to im\u00ac\n print names or sentences on their memory by taking the\n first letters of every word of that sentence, or of those\n names, and making a new word of them.

Who is like thee among\n the gods? which was written on their banners.

That which agrees most with the constitution of\n nature carries the greatest probability in it, where no\n other circumstance appears to counterpoise it: as if I let\n loose a greyhound within sight of a hare upon a large\n plain, there is great probability the greyhound will\n seize her; that a thousand sparrows will fly away at the\n sight of a hawk among them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. That which is most conformable to the constant\n observations of men, or to experiment frequently re\u00ac\n peated, is most likely to be true; as that a winter will\n not pass away in England without some frost and snow;\n that if you deal out great quantities of strong liquor to\n the mob, there will be many drunk; that a large assem\u00ac\n bly of men will be of different opinions in any doubtful\n point; that a thief will make his escape out of prison if\n the doors of it are unguarded at midnight.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. In matters of fact, which are past or present, where\n neither nature, nor observation, nor custom, gives us\n any sufficient information on either side of the question,\n there we may derive a probability from the attestation\n of wise and honest men, by word or writing, or the con\u00ac\n curring witnesses of multitudes who have seen and\n known what they relate, & c. This testimony in many\n cases will arise to the degree of moral certainty. So\n we believe that the plant tea grows in China; and that\n the emperor of the Turks lives at Constantinople; that\n Julius Caesar conquered France, and that Jesus our Sa\u00ac\n viour lived and died in Judea; that thousands were con\u00ac\n verted to the Christian faith in a century after the death\n of Christ; and that the books which contain the Christian\n religion are certain histories and epistles which were\n written above a thousand years ago.

It is a\n good thing to have the heart established with grace, not\n with meats; that is, in the great doctrines of the gospel\n of grace, and in Jesus Christ, who is the same yester\u00ac\n day, to-day, and for ever; but it is not so necessary in\n the more minute matters of religion, such as meats and\n drink, forms and ceremonies, which are of less impor\u00ac\n tance, and for which Scripture has not given such ex\u00ac\n press directions. This is the advice of the great apos\u00ac\n tle, Eph. 14; Heb. xiii. 8, 9.\n</p>\n<p>\n In short, those truths which are the springs of daily\n practice should be settled as soon as we can with the\n exercise of our best powers after the state of manhood:\n but those things wherein we may possibly mistake should\n never be so absolutely and finally established and deter\u00ac\n mined as though we were infallible. If the papists of\n Great Britain had maintained such a resolute establish\u00ac\n ment and assurance in the days of King Henry VIII. or\n Queen Elizabeth, there never had been a reformation:\n nor would any heathen have been converted, even un\u00ac\n der the ministry of St. Paul, if their obstinate settlement\n in their idolatries had kept their eyes shut against all\n further light. Yet this should not hinder us from set\u00ac\n tling our most important principles of faith and practice,\n where reason shines with its clearest evidence, and the\n word of God plainly determines truth and duty.\n</p>\n<p>\n XXVIII. But let us remember also, that though the\n Gospel be an infallible revelation, we are but fallible in\n terpreters when we determine the sense even of some\n important propositions written there; and therefore,\n though we seem to be established in the belief of any\n particular sense of Scripture, and though there may be\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0197/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 202, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 349}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0197/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 404, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 698}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0197/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 808, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1397}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0197/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1617, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2794}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0197/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0197.jp2", "height": 2794, "width": 1617, "levels": 6, "size": 306361}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"197\">\n<p>\n OP INQUIRING INTO, & C. 189\n</p>\n<p>\n just calls of Providence to profess and subscribe it, yet\n there is no need that we should resolve or promise, sub\u00ac\n scribe or swear, never to change our mind, since it is\n possible, in the nature and course of things, we may\n meet with such a solid and substantial objection as\n may give us a quite different view of things from what\n we once imagined, and may lay before us sufficient evi\u00ac\n dence of the contrary.

He adds further, concerning the launch\u00ac\n ing into the depths of these studies, that they are apt\n to beget a secret and refined pride, an overweening\n and overbearing vanity, the most opposite temper to the\n true spirit of the Gospel. This tempts them to presume\n on a kind of omniscience in respect to their fellow crea\u00ac\n tures, who have not risen to their elevation; nor are\n they fit to be trusted in the hands of any but those who\n have acquired an humble heart, a lowly spirit, and a\n sober and teachable temper.

Next to the knowledge of natural things, and\n acquaintance with the human nature and constitution,\n which is made up of soul and body, I think that natu\u00ac\n ral religion properly takes its place. This consists of\n these two parts, viz. 1. The speculative or contempla\u00ac\n tive, which is the knowledge of God in his various per\u00ac\n fections and in his relations to his rational creatures, so\n far as may be known by the light < *f nature, which hereto\u00ac\n fore used to be called the second part of metaphysics, it\n includes also, 2. That which is practical or active, that is,\n the knowledge of the several duties which arise from our\n relation to God, and our relation to our fellow creatures,\n and our proper conduct and government of ourselves; this\n has been used to be called ethics, or moral philosophy.\n</p>\n<p>\n XXII. The knowledge of these things is proper for\n all men of learning; not only because it teaches them\n to obtain juster views of the several parts of revealed\n religion and of Christianity, which are built upon them,\n but because every branch of natural religion, and of\n moral duty, is contained and necessarily implied in all\n the revealed religions that ever God prescribed to the\n world. We may well suspect that religion does not\n come from God which renounces any part of natural\n duty.\n</p>\n<p>\n Whether mankind live under the dispensation of\n the patriarchs, or of Moses, or the prophets, or of our\n Lord Jesus Christ, still we are bound to know the one\n true God, and to practise all that adoration and rever\u00ac\n ence, all that love to him, that faith in his perfections,\n with that obedience and submission to his will, which\n natural religion requires. We are still bound to exer\u00ac\n cise that justice, truth, and goodness towards our neigh\u00ac\n bours, that restraint and moderation of our own appe\u00ac\n tites and passions, and that regular behaviour towards\n ourselves and all our fellow creatures around us, which\n moral philosophy teaches. There is no sort of revealed\n religion that will dispense with these natural obligations:\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0215/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 202, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 349}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0215/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 404, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 698}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0215/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 808, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1397}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0215/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1617, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2794}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0215/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0215.jp2", "height": 2794, "width": 1617, "levels": 6, "size": 331205}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"215\">\n<p>\n AND THEIR USE.\n</p>\n<p>\n 207\n</p>\n<p>\n and a happy acquaintance with the several appetites,\n inclinations, and passions of human nature, and the\n best methods to rule and restrain, to direct and govern\n them, are our constant business, and ought to be our\n everlasting study.\n</p>\n<p>\n Yet I would lay down this caution, viz. That since\n students are instructed in the knowledge of the true God\n in their lectures on Christianity, and since among the\n Christian duties they are also taught all the moral dictates\n of the light of nature, or a complete scheme of ethics,\n there is no absolute necessity of learning these two parts\n of natural religion, as distinct sciences, separate and by\n themselves; but still it is of great importance for a tutor,\n while he is reading to his pupils these parts of the\n Christian religion, to give them notice how far the light\n of nature or mere reason will instruct us in these doc\u00ac\n trines and duties, and how far we are obliged to divine\n relation, and Scripture, for clearing up and establishing\n the firm foundations of the one, for affording us superior\n motives and powers to practice the other, for raising\n them to more exalted degrees, and building so glorious\n a superstructure upon them.\n</p>\n<p>\n XXIII.

The Romans\n took the first grounds of this law from what they called\n the twelve tables, which were the abridgments of the laws\n of Solon at Athens, and of other cities in G reece, famous\n for knowledge and wisdom; to which they added their\n own ancient customs of the city of Rome, and the laws\n which were made there.

The lawyers, who have the least need of\n foreign tongues, ought to understand Latin. During\n many ages past, very important matters in the law were\n always written and managed in that language by the\n lawyers, as prescriptions in medicine by the physicians,\n and citations of the Scriptures in divinity were always\n made in Latin by the divines. Prayers also were ordained\n to be said publicly and privately in the Roman tongue:\n paternosters and ave-marias were half the devotions of\n those ages. These cruel impositions upon the people\n would not suffer them to read in their own mother\n tongue what was done, either to or for their own souls,\n their bodies, or their estates. I am ready to suspect this\n was all owing to the craft and policy of the priesthood\n and church of Rome, which endeavoured to aggrandize\n themselves, and exalt their own profession into a sove\u00ac\n reign tyranny, and to make mere slaves of the laity\n among mankind, by keeping them in utter ignorance,\n darkness, and dependence. And they were willing to\n compound the matter with the physicians and the law\u00ac\n yers, and allow them a small share in this tyranny over\n the populace, to maintain their own supreme dominion\n over all.\n</p>\n<p>\n But we thank God the world is grown something\n wiser; and of late years the British parliament has been\n pleased to give relief from that bondage in matters re\u00ac\n lating to the law also, as in the age of reformation we\n were delivered from saying our prayers in Latin, from\n being bound to read the word of God in a tongue un\u00ac\n known to the people, and from living in everlasting\n</p>\n<p>\n 18 *\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0218/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 203, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 350}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0218/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 406, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 701}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0218/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 813, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1402}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0218/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1626, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2804}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0218/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0218.jp2", "height": 2804, "width": 1626, "levels": 6, "size": 338736}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"218\">\n<p>\n 210\n</p>\n<p>\n OF THE SCIENCES\n</p>\n<p>\n subjection to the clergy in matters of this life and the\n life to come.\n</p>\n<p>\n But to return, there are still so many forms of pro\u00ac\n ceeding in judicature, and things called by Latin names\n in the profession of the law, and so many barbarous words\n with Latin terminations, that it is necessary lawyers\n should understand this language.

The word strages signifies slaughter; stratum is\n Latin for a bed; stramen is straw; and stragulum is a\n quilt or coverlid: they are all drawn and derived from\n sterno; which signifies to throw down, to kill, or to\n spread abroad. Let the critics tell me what certain\n sense they could put upon either of these four words by\n their mere cognation with each other, or their deriva\u00ac\n tion from one common verb.

Persuading the will effectually to choose or refuse\n the thing suggested and represented. 3. Raising the\n passions in the most vivid and forcible manner, so as to\n set all the soul and every power of nature at work, to\n pursue or avoid the thing in debate.\n</p>\n<p>\n To attain this end there is not only a great deal of\n art necessary in the representation of matters to the\n auditory, but also in the disposition or method of intro\u00ac\n ducing these particular representations, together with\n the reasons which might convince, and the various\n methods which might persuade and prevail upon the\n hearers.

Because there are many couplets or stanzas writ\u00ac\n ten in poetic measures, which contain a variety of mor\u00ac\n als or rules of practice relating to the common pruden\u00ac\n tials of mankind, as well as to matters of religion; and\n the poetic numbers (or rhyme, if there be any) add very\n considerable force to the memory.\n</p>\n<p>\n Besides, many an elegant and admirable sentiment or\n description of things which are found among the poets\n are well worth.committing to memory, and the partic\u00ac\n ular measures of verse greatly assist us in recollecting\n such excellent passages, which might sometimes raise\n our conversation from low and grovelling subjects.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. In heroic verse, but especially in the grander lyrics,\n there are sometimes such noble elevations of thought\n and passion as illuminate all things around us, and\n convey to the soul most exalted and magnificent images\n and sublime sentiments: these furnish us with glorious\n springs and mediums to raise and aggrandize our con\u00ac\n ceptions, to warm our souls, to awaken the better pas\u00ac\n sions, and to elevate them to a divine pitch, and that\n for devotional purposes. It is the lyric ode which has\n shown to the world some of the happiest examples of\n this kind, and I cannot say but this part of poesy lias\n been my favourite amusement above all others.\n</p>\n<p>\n And for this reason it is that I have never thought\n the heroic poems, Greek, Latin, or English, which have\n obtained the highest fame in the world are sufficiently\n diversified, exalted, or animated, for want of the intersper-\n sion of now and then an elegiac or lyric ode. This\n might have been done with great and beautiful proprie\u00ac\n ty, where the poet has introduced a song at a feast, or\n the joys of a victoi v, or soliloquies of divine satisfac-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0225/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 202, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 349}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0225/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 404, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 698}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0225/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 808, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1397}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0225/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1617, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2794}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0225/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0225.jp2", "height": 2794, "width": 1617, "levels": 6, "size": 330176}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"225\">\n<p>\n AND THEIR USE.\n</p>\n<p>\n 217\n</p>\n<p>\n tion, or the pensive and despairing agonies of distressing\n sorrows.

He that writes well in verse will often find a\n necessity to send his thoughts in search through all the\n treasure of words that express any one idea in the same\n language, that so he may comport with the measures\n or the rhyme of the verse which he writes, or with his\n own most beautiful and vivid sentiments of the thing\n he describes.

All this I propose to the world as my best\n observations about reading of verse. But if the ques\u00ac\n tion were offered to me, Shall a student of a bright ge\u00ac\n nius never divert himself with writing poesy? I would\n answer, Yes, when he cannot possibly help it; a lower\n genius, in mature years, would heartily wish that he\n had spent much more time in reading the best authors\n of this kind, and employed much fewer hours in wri\u00ac\n ting. But it must be confessed or supposed at least, that\n there may be seasons when it is hardly possible for a\n poetic soul to restrain the fancy or quench the flame,\n when it is hard to suppress the exuberant flow of lofty\n % sentiments, and prevent the imagination from this sort\n of style or language: and that is the only season I think\n wherein this inclination should be indulged, especially\n by persons who have devoted themselves to professions\n of a different kind; and one reason is, because what they\n write in that hour is more likely to carry in it some ap\u00ac\n pearance above nature, some happy imitation of the dic\u00ac\n tates of the muse.*\n</p>\n<p>\n XXXVIII. There are other things besides history,\n grammar and languages, rhetoric and poesy, which had\n been included under the name of philological knowledge;\n such as an acquaintance with the notions, customs, man\u00ac\n ners, tempers, polity, & c. of the various nations of the\n earth, or the distinct sects and tribes of mankind. This\n is necessary in order to understand history the better;\n and every man who is a lawyer or a gentleman ought\n to obtain some acquaintance with these things, without\n which he can never read history to any great advantage,\n nor can he maintain his own station and character in\n life with honour and dignity, without some insight into\n them.\n</p>\n<p>\n XXXIX.

Yet there is\n such a thing to be found as an honest and sincere de\u00ac\n light in propagating truth, arising from a dutiful regard\n to the honours of our Maker, and a hearty love to man\u00ac\n kind. Now, if we would be successful in our attempts\n to convince men of their errors, and promote the truth,\n let us divest ourselves, as far as possible, of that pride\n and affectation which I mentioned before; and seek to\n acquire that disinterested love to men, and zeal for the\n truth, which will naturally lead us into the best meth\u00ac\n ods to promote it.\n</p>\n<p>\n And here the following directions may be useful:\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. If you would convince a person of his mistake,\n choose a proper place, a happy hour, and the fittest qpn-\n current circumstance for this purpose. Do not unsea\u00ac\n sonably set upon him when he is engaged in the midst\n of other affairs, but when his soul is at Kberty and at\n leisure to hear and attend. Accost him not upon that\n subject when his spirit is ruffled or discomposed with\n any occurrences of life, and especially when he has\n heated his passions in the defence of a contrary opinion;\n but rather seize some golden opportunity, when some\n occurrences of life may cast a favourable aspect upon\n the truth of which you would convince him, or which\n may throw some dark and unhappy colour or consequen\u00ac\n ces upon that error from which you would fain deliver\n him. There are in life some mollissima tempora fandi ,\n some very agreeable moments of addressing a person,\n which, if rightly managed, may render your attempts\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0244/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 203, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 350}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0244/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 406, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 701}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0244/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 813, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1402}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0244/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1626, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2804}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0244/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0244.jp2", "height": 2804, "width": 1626, "levels": 6, "size": 328419}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"244\">\n<p>\n 236 OF CONVINCING OF TRUTH, OR\n</p>\n<p>\n much more successful, and his conviction easy and\n pleasant.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2.

Truth and argument come with particular force\n from the mouth of one whom we trust and love.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The softest and gentlest address to the erroneous\n is the best way to convince them of their mistake.\n Sometimes it is necessary to represent to your opponent\n that he is not far from the truth, and that you would\n fain draw him a little nearer to it.

You must\n treat an opponent like a friend, if you would persuade\n him to learn any thing from you; and this is one great\n reason why there is so little success on either side be\u00ac\n tween two disputants, or controversial writers, because\n they are so ready to interest their passions in the sub\u00ac\n ject of contest, and thereby to prevent the mutual light\n that might be given and received on either side: ambi\u00ac\n tion, indignation, and a professed zeal, reign on both\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00bb\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0246/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 203, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 350}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0246/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 406, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 701}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0246/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 813, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1402}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0246/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1626, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2804}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0246/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0246.jp2", "height": 2804, "width": 1626, "levels": 6, "size": 340828}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"246\">\n<p>\n 238\n</p>\n<p>\n OF CONVINCING OF TRUTH, OR\n</p>\n<p>\n sides: victory is the point designed, while truth is pre\u00ac\n tended; and truth oftentimes perishes in the fray, or re\u00ac\n tires from the field of battle: the combatants end just\n where they began, their understandings hold fast the\n same opinions, perhaps with this disadvantage, that they\n are a little more obstinate and rooted in them, without\n fresh reason; and they generally come off with the loss\n of temper and charity.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.

In the affairs of practical godliness there should\n be much deference paid to persons of long standing in\n virtue and piety. I confess, in the particular forms and\n ceremonies of religion, there may be as much bigotry\n a\u00bbd superstition ' among the old as the young; but in\n questions of inward religion, and pure devotion or\n virtue, a man who has been long engaged in the sincere\n practice of these things, is justly presumed to know\n more than a youth with all his ungovemed passions,\n appetites, and prejudices about him.\n</p>\n<p>\n IV.

When he has thus done, two-thirds of\n the hour is spent, and his hearers are quite tired; then\n he begins to draw near to his doctrine or grand theme\n of discourse, and having told the audience with great\n formality and exactness in what method he shall man\u00ac\n age it, he names you one or two particulars under the\n first general head; and by this time finds it necessary to\n add, \u201c He intended indeed to have been larger in the il\u00ac\n lustration of his subject, and he should have given you\n some reasons for the doctrine, but he is sorry that he is\n prevented: and then he designed also to have brought ,\n it down to the conscience of every man by a warm ad\u00ac\n dress, but his time being gone he must break off.\u201d He\n hurries over a hint or two which should have been\n wrought up into exhortation or instruction, but all in\n great haste, and thus concludes his work. The obsti\u00ac\n nate and careless sinner goes away unawakened, un\u00ac\n convinced; and the mourning soul departs uncomfort\u00ac\n ed: the unbeliever is not led to faith in the gospel, nor\n the immoral wretch to hate or forsake his iniquities: the\n hypocrite and the man of sincerity are both unedified,\n because the preacher had not time. In shortj he hath fin\u00ac\n ished his work, and hath done nothing.\n</p>\n<p>\n When I hear this man preach it brings to my remem\u00ac\n brance the account which I have heard concerning the\n Czar of Muscovy, the first time his army besieged a\n town in Livonia: he was then just come from his trav-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0270/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 203, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 350}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0270/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 406, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 701}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0270/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 813, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1402}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0270/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1626, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2804}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0270/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0270.jp2", "height": 2804, "width": 1626, "levels": 6, "size": 309625}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"270\">\n<p>\n 262\n</p>\n<p>\n OF INSTRUCTION\n</p>\n<p>\n els in Great Britain, where he and his ministers of state\n had learned the mathematics of an old acquaintance of\n mine: the Czar took great care to begin the siege in\n form; he drew all the lines of circumvallation and con-\n travallation according to the rules of art; but he was so\n tedious and so exact in these mathematical performan\u00ac\n ces, that the season was spent, he was forced to break\n up the siege, and retire without any execution done\n upon the town.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ergates is another sort of preacher, a workman that\n need not be ashamed: he had in his younger days but\n few of these learned vanities, and age and experience\n have now worn them all off.

The fruit will feed the hungry, and\n the flower will refresh the fainting, which is more than\n can be said of the thickest oak in Bashan, when it has\n lost its vital juice; it may spread its limbs indeed far and\n wide, but they are naked, withered, and sapless.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0275/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 202, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 349}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0275/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 404, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 698}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0275/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 808, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1397}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0275/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1617, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2794}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0275/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0275.jp2", "height": 2794, "width": 1617, "levels": 6, "size": 319784}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"275\">\n<p>\n BY PREACHING.\n</p>\n<p>\n 267\n</p>\n<p>\n Sect.

There is confusion brought\n into our argument and discourse by too many or by too\n few of these. One author plunges his reader into the\n midst of things without due explication of them; another\n jumbles together, without distinction, all those ideas\n which have any likeness; a third is fond of explaining\n every word, and coining distinctions between ideas which\n have little or no difference; but each of these runs into\n extremes, for all these practices are equal hinderances\n to clear, just, and useful knowledge. It is not a long\n train of rules, but observation and good judgment, can\n teach us when to explain, define, and divide, and when\n to omit it.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the beginning of a treatise it is proper and neces\u00ac\n sary sometimes to premise some prsecognita, or general\n principles, which may serve for an introduction to the\n</p>\n<p>\n * It appears by the date at the bottom of this paper, in the manu\u00ac\n script, that it was written in the year 1718.

and it is sufficiently evident, from daily expe\u00ac\n rience, that many mischiefs attend this prolongation of\n controversies among men of learning, which, for thg\n most part, do injury to the truth, either by turning the\n attention of the reader quite away from the original\n point to other matters, or by covering the truth with a\n multitude of occasional incidents and perplexities, which\n serve to bewilder rather than guide a faithful inquirer.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sometimes, in these latter volumes, the writers on\n both sides will hang upon little words and occasional\n expressions of their opponent, in order to expose them,\n which have no necessary connexion with the grand point\n in view, and which have nothing to do with the debated\n truth.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sometimes they will spend many a page in vindica\u00ac\n ting their own character, or their own little sentences\n or accidental expressions, from the remarks of their\n opponent, in which expressions or remarks the original\n truth has no concern.\n</p>\n<p>\n And sometimes again you shall find even writers of\n good sense, who have happened to express themselves\n</p>\n<p>\n 24\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0286/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 203, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 350}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0286/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 406, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 701}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0286/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 813, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1402}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0286/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1626, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2804}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0286/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0286.jp2", "height": 2804, "width": 1626, "levels": 6, "size": 347467}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"286\">\n<p>\n 278 OF WRITING CONTROVERSIES.\n</p>\n<p>\n in an improper and indefensible manner, led away by\n the fondness of self-love to justify those expressions,\n and vindicate those little lapses they were guilty of,\n rather than they will condescend to correct those little\n mistakes, or recall those improper expressions.

II. Of reading Controversies.\n</p>\n<p>\n When we take a book into our hands wherein any\n doctrine or opinion is printed in a way of argument, we\n are too often satisfied and determined beforehand whether\n it be right or wrong; and if we are on the writer\u2019s side,\n we are generally tempted to take his arguments for solid\n and substantial.

Multitudes\n of common readers, who are fallen into any error, when\n they are directed and advised to read a treatise that\n would set them right, read it with a sort of disgust\n which they have before entertained; they skim lightly\n over the arguments, they neglect or despise the force\n of them, and keep their own conclusion firm in their\n assent, and thus maintain their error in the midst of\n light, and .grow incapable of conviction.\n</p>\n<p>\n But if we would indeed act like sincere searchers of\n the truth, we should survey every argument with a care\u00ac\n ful and unbiassed mind, whether it agree with our for\u00ac\n mer opinion or no: we should give every reasoning its\n full force, and weigh it in our sedatest judgment. Now\n the best way to try what force there is in the arguments\n which are brought against our own opinions, is to sit\n down and endeavour to give a solid answer, one by\n one, to every argument which the ' author brings to sup\u00ac\n port his own doctrine: and in this attempt, if we find\n there some arguments which we are not able to answer\n fairly to our own minds, we should then begin to be\u00ac\n think ourselves whether we have not hitherto been in\n a mistake, and whether the defender of the contrary sen\u00ac\n timents may not be in the right. Such a method as\n this will effectually forbid us to pronounce at once\n against those doctrines and those writers which are con\u00ac\n trary to our sent ; ments; and we shall endeavour to find\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0288/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 203, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 350}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0288/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 406, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 701}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0288/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 813, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1402}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0288/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1626, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2804}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:im:pr:ov:em:en:to:fm:in:00:wa:tt:_0:improvementofmin00watt_0:improvementofmin00watt_0_0288/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/im/pr/ov/em/en/to/fm/in/00/wa/tt/_0/improvementofmin00watt_0/improvementofmin00watt_0_0288.jp2", "height": 2804, "width": 1626, "levels": 6, "size": 345181}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"288\">\n<p>\n \u00a380 OP READING CONTROVERSIES.\n</p>\n<p>\n solid arguments to refute their positions, before we en\u00ac\n tirely establish ourselves in a contrary opinion.\n</p>\n<p>\n Volatilis had given ' himself up to the conversation\n of the freethinkers of our age, upon all subjects; and\n being pleased with the wit and appearance of argu\u00ac\n ment, in some of our modern deists, had too easily de\u00ac\n serted the Christian faith, and gone over to the camp\n of the infidels.
