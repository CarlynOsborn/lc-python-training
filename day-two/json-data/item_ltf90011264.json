Henry Ward\n Beecher. The plan contemplated the col\u00ac\n lection of all the books, engravings, pho\u00ac\n tographs, historical sketches and souvenirs\n generally that were worth preserving. The\n suggestion was soon acted upon, and a fireproof vault\n was provided for the purpose. The idea did not stop\n there, however, for the Rev. Dr. Hillis, pastor of Ply\u00ac\n mouth Church, started to push it, and to expand\n it, and the author of the original hint, approving of Dr.\n Plillis\u2019 plan of transferring the Beecher remains as a\n splendid amplification of his proposition, added: \u201cI\n would make a shrine of the big, unpretentious Quaker\n meeting house, which is in and of itself a memorial. This\n country has produced some remarkably gifted families,\n the Storys, the Kents, the Adamses, the Storrses, the Ab-\n botts, the Sillimans and the Dwights, but it was given\n to few if any of them to have their names associated with\n that which is as material as brick and stone, a fact which\n fortunately does not hold good in the case of the greatest\n of all of the stars in our intellectual firmament, Henry\n Ward Beecher.\u201d , \u25a0\n</p>\n<p>\n The success with which William F. Hammond\u2019s orig\u00ac\n inal hint has been followed is most remarkable. Perhaps,\n the crowning act of the movement now in progress should\n be regarded as the great gathering of people assembled\n in the Academy of Music on Sunday evening, March 8,\n 1903, who listened to Mayor Seth Low, who presided;\n former President of the Fnited States Grover Cleveland,\n Justice David J. Brewer of the United States Supreme\n Court, the Rev. F. W. Gunsaulus, D. D., of Chicago, and\n the Rev. Newell Dwight Hillis, D. D.\n</p>\n<p>\n In view of the magnitude of this movement, it has\n been deemed fitting that one issue of the Brooklyn Eagle\n Library should be devoted to the subject. Accordingly,\n most of the important deliverances in memory of Henry\n Ward Beecher have been collated and are now presented\n in a form which will surely be regarded as worthy of\n preservation for present and future use in families all\n over the land. Included will be found a sermon on\n \u201cPrayer,\u201d by Mr. Beecher himself, which emphasizes\n itself at once as an able exposition of a universally talked\n of topic and a specimen of the great preacher\u2019s happy\n style of treatment.

Dr.\n Newell Dwight Hil\u00ac\n lis, preached a ser\u00ac\n mon intended to\n further the project,\n first made public by\n the Eagle, of erect\u00ac\n ing a memorial building on the lots\n</p>\n<p>\n adjoining the church, on Orange street,\n and removing the body of Henry\n Ward Beecher from its inaccessible\n</p>\n<p>\n burial spot in Greenwood Cemetery and\n placing it in a tomb beneath, devoting the\n rooms above to the arrangement of all\n Beecher relics. The sermon was a beautiful\n eulogy. There was an old-time audience, all\n the seating capacity, including the aisle\n chairs, being occupied, a tribute to the one\n bringing the message as well as to the great\n man whose life inspired it. At the close of\n the sermon a wealthy woman, who desired\n her name withheld, contributed $10,000 to\n the fund, which is now about $25,000. At the\n close of the sermon a thousand persons par\u00ac\n took of the communion, individual cups being\n used for the first time. Dr. Hillis received\n seventeen persons into membership. The\n subject of Dr. Hillis\u2019 sermon was: \u201cFifteen\n Years After a Great Man s death. Ib\n P lymouth Church to Be Overshadowed by an\n Apartment Building? or Shall We Build a\n Shrine to One of the Nation\u2019s Heroes? What\n Brooklyn and the World Owes to Henry\n Ward Beecher.\u201d The text was from\n</p>\n<p>\n Ecclesiastes xliv: \u201cLet us now praise famous\n men. The Lord hath wrought great glory\n by them through His power from the begin\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n ning. Leaders of the people by their coun\u00ac\n sels, wise and eloquent in their instructions.\n These were honored in their generations and\n were the glory of their times.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Hillis said.\n</p>\n<p>\n This incitement toward reverence and ad\u00ac\n miration of great men furnishes us the secret\n of early Hebrew supremacy. The springs of\n national life were in the founders and\n fathers. Great men are the dynamic of so\u00ac\n cial progress. Rising up early and sitting up\n late, the Hebrew parents drilled their chil\u00ac\n dren in the knowledge and love of their illus\u00ac\n trious ancestors. From time to time the\n parent led the child up through a verbal pic\u00ac\n ture gallery of the heroes, ^nd, looking up\n toward the great men, slowly the children\n and youth were lifted to the fathers\u2019 level.\n These great men of yesterday had made vows\n for the children of to-day and furnished them\n standards and measurements of patriotism.\n Samuel, the child, recalls Moses, the law\u00ac\n giver, and becomes himself the great judge.\n The Psalmist feeds his genius upon the songs\n of Job. At last the Christ comes and goes\n again, and Paul and John and Peter are\n heroes that fulfill their great careers by look\u00ac\n ing toward Jesus. Lingering long before the\n portraits of the prophets and heroes, slowly\n the generation took on the hero\u2019s likeness.\n It is this reverence for famous men of old,\n this celebration of men who are wise and\n eloquent in their counsels and noble in their\n lives, that transformed the Hebrews from a\n race of feeblings into a race of giant3. That\n nation that forgets its founders and fathers\n has.entered upon its decline, and is journey\u00ac\n ing straight toward decay and final extinc\u00ac\n tion. The nation that celebrates its fathers\n and teaches its children to emulate their\n heroic incitements will go from strength to\n</p>\n<p>\n strength, from victory to victory. It is the\n Parthenon, with Pericles celebrating the\n heroes, that explains the freemen of Athens.\n So long as Rome remembered the heroes of\n her. Pantheon she prospered, and when she\n neglected their tombs and despised their\n spirit she miserably perished. It is not with\u00ac\n out reason, therefore, that the men whom we\n celebrate in our holidays are slowly molding\n the life and thought of the American people.\n James Bryce, in his \u201cAmerican Common\u00ac\n wealth,\u201d speaks of the ideal Americanism of\n Washington. The historian tells us that\n Washington\u2019s character is a kind of prophecy\n of the fundamental characteristics of the\n American, but what Mr. Bryce should have\n said is that the generation of to-day is a his\u00ac\n tory that was created by the ideal American\u00ac\n ism of Washington. Through much celebrat\u00ac\n ing and praising of Washington\u2019s qualities\n these qualities have reproduced themselve^,,\n and become set in the gristle and bone of\n America\u2019s children and youth. When we\n speak, therefore, of building a shrine to a\n hero and insist upon the duty of remembering\n famous men who were the glory of their\n times, we have the sanction not alone of\n experience and reason, but of history and of\n Scripture itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n America ' s Heroes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Measured in terms of centuries and in com\u00ac\n parison with the older nations, the history\n of the Republic is short and scant. But\n measured by the number of great men that\n it has produced, the life of the Republic has\n been long. When history calls the roll of\n the names that will live belonging to the\n last century that number will include Presi\u00ac\n dents, statesmen, jurists, inventors, editors,\n merchants\u2014Eames that will shine like the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0008/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 194, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0008/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 388, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 558}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0008/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 777, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1117}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0008/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1555, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2234}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0008/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3111, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4468}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0008/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/ec/he/rm/em/or/ia/la/00/un/se/beechermemoriala00unse/beechermemoriala00unse_0008.jp2", "height": 4468, "width": 3111, "levels": 6, "size": 1129651}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"8\">\n<p>\n 6 \u2018\n</p>\n<p>\n THE BEECHER MEMORIAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u25a0tars, and perhaps outlive them. Among the\n few supreme names that other nations rec\u00ac\n ognize are those of Washington, Webster,\n Lincoln, Grant, Emerson and Beecher. To\n four of these unique leaders shrines have\n been buHt. Washington stands for the ideal\n American and his tomb at Mount Vernon\n has become a national institution for pub\u00ac\n lic instruction. Lincoln is the emancipator,\n the man of sorrows, and though his tomb\n is in the very heart of the continent, still\n innumerable pilgrims make their way thither,\n year by year. The great soldier, Grant,\n sleeps on the heights above the Hudson,\n and already the people have worn deeply the\n path tbat4ead < j to his tomb. It is a national\n misfortune that Webster is buried at Marsh\u00ac\n field. He stands for the Constitution and the\n unity of the nation\u2019s life. It is not too much\n to say that it was Daniel Webster\u2019s reply to\n Hayne that was victorious at Appomattox.\n Edward Everett, his biographer, knew that it\n was Webster\u2019s wish to sleep in the Capitol,\n the scene of his battles, his defeats, his vic\u00ac\n tories\u2014but Webster\u2019s friends knew that such\n a movement would be generally opposed by\n the forces of slavery. But the time has\n fully come for Webster\u2019s dust to sleep in the\n city that was the scene of his suDreme elo\u00ac\n quence. It is not less unfortunate, for the\n children and youth of this country, that Mr.\n Beecher\u2019s tomb is not a shrine for Brooklyn,\n and the multitude that year by year makes\n its way to New York.\n</p>\n<p>\n By a singular fatality Mr. Beecher\u2019s work\n has been dissipated. In hymnology he\n founded the first of the great hymn books,\n and its name was finally changed. He\n founded a newspaper, the Christian Union,\n and that name also has ceased to exist,\n though his spirit lives in the great editor.\n Dr. Lyman Abbott. He was buried in Green\u00ac\n wood at a point remote, hidden, intricate,\n inaccessible. Indeed, there is scarecly a\n week but a score of people from Canada\n and England, less accustomed to American\n cities than we are, make their way to Ply\u00ac\n mouth Church to inquire for his grave, but\n that grave has been so deftly hidden that\n few pilgrims there be who can ever find it.\n And now conies the peremptory statement\n from leaders in the Board of Education that\n unless we use these lota next to Plymouth\n Church, the board will condemn them for a\n public school, or we are fronted with a worse\n alternative, namely, an overshadowing apart\u00ac\n ment house.\n</p>\n<p>\n An Imminent Crisis.\n</p>\n<p>\n The crlsto is Imminent and grave. Mr.\n Beecher ' s work hs t -o oe more and more over\u00ac\n shadowed and his church, little by little,\n strangled by incrowding buildings, and so\n his name and fame and work grow less and\n less, or those of this generation who loved\n him and are his debtors, must take steps to\n safeguard the building that he founded and\n to strengthen the work that was dearer to\n Vim than life itself. And so I am here this\n morping to propose to this, his church, to\n Brooklyn and New York, his city, and to his\n country, a plan that will bear witness to the\n love we bear him, and make his work to be a\n spring of inspiration to other generations.\n I am going to suggest to you that beneath a\n slab at this right hand corner of the church,\n with a memorial that represents the genius\n of some St. Gaudens above him, we bury the\n beloved leader, as Englishmen buried their\n Gladstone and Stanley in their great abbey.\n That on these lots that have been con\u00ac\n demned we build a hall dedicated to patriot\u00ac\n ism and Mr. Beecher\u2019s work; a noble room\n</p>\n<p>\n that shall hold all the Beecher relics, his\n great portraits, his pulpit, his old chair, the\n manuscripts of his sermons and lectures\n against slavery, the great manuscripts that\n contain his statements of the love of God,\n his first studies on Religion and Evolution,\n his early lectures on Preaching, the pulpit\n from which Lyman Beecher preached his\n sermon against dueling, after the death of\n Alexander Hamilton, and his five sermons\n against intemperance; the great relics of\n the work of Harriet Beecher Stowe, with\n her \u2018\u2018Uncle Tom\u2019s Cabin,\u201d together with cer\u00ac\n tain paintings. Boston enriches her public\n library with the work of Abbey and the\n studies of the Holy Grail. There are three\n supreme moments, and perhaps five, in the\n history of American eloquence\u2014Patrick\n Henry at Williamsburgh, Webster\u2019s reply to\n Hayne, Lincoln at Gettysburg, Wendell Phil\u00ac\n lips at Faneuil Hall, Mr. Beecher\u2019s selling\n of the slave girl, and the great oration in\n England, whose exordium was in Manches\u00ac\n ter, its successive arguments in Edinburgh\n and Liverpool, with its peroration in Ex\u00ac\n eter Hall in London. I want this church\n and community to raise the $50,000 neces\u00ac\n sary to secure some one like Mr. Abbey to\n paint these historic scenes, while other\n spaces are left vacant for the present, that\n other scenes like the landing of the May\u00ac\n flower, with certain great moments, may be\n depicted by the artist\u2019s brush and through\n richly colored glass. Then, with a new li\u00ac\n brary plan, the parish rooms, for a club\n for young men and women, w ' itk such ad\u00ac\n ditions to our plant as have already been\n planned, the work that Mr. Beecher founded\n will be established forever. In this city,\n whose homes and whose churches and w\u2019hose\n very streets he so dearly loved, we shall\n have built a shrine, and hither, through\n all generations, will come the multitude,\n the nation\u2019s children and youth, to gather\n inspiration from his life, to reread his words\n and to dedicate themselves anew to God, to\n home and to their country. As justifying\n these propositions, I am going to outline\n to you the career of Henry Ward Beecher,\n and what this \" city and nation owe to the\n great leader.\n</p>\n<p>\n Does Mr. Beecher\u2019s Work Justify This\n Movement?\n</p>\n<p>\n Before undertaking any movement, the\n reasons for the enterprise should be fully\n placed before the mind, that the grounds\n thereof may be scrutinized. We build tombs\n for our soldiers\u2014they keep the state in\n .liberty; to our jurists and Presidents\u2014they\n teach us justice; to our inventors and mer\u00ac\n chants\u2014they furnish us with the comforts\n and conveniences of life; to our martyrs\u2014\n they die to secure our happiness and moral\n welfare. What has Mr. Beecher done for\n Plymouth Church and Brooklyn and Amer\u00ac\n ica? Perhaps we are prejudiced by virtue\n of affection and his long career in our city.\n Let those who are not of us, therefore, go\n into the witness stand and give their testi\u00ac\n mony. Abraham Lincoln never belonged to\n Plymouth Church\u2014though Abraham Lincoln\n sat in yonder pew both the Sunday before\n and the Sunday after his address in Cooper\n Institute. But Abraham Lincoln once laid\n down his morning paper containing a ser\u00ac\n mon by our ascended Elijah, and said that\n he knew of no man of whose counsel, sym\u00ac\n pathy and daily friendship he would more\n gladly avail himself. Oliver Wendell Holmes\n lived in Boston, but Oliver Wendell Holmes,\n after Mr. Beecher\u2019s return from England in\n 1863, said in the Atlantic Monthly, \u201cthis\n minister has finished a more remarkable\n</p>\n<p>\n mission than any envoy who has represented\n us in Europe since Benjamin Franklin\n pleaded the cause of the young republic be\u00ac\n fore the court at Versailles. Unaided by\n any official title, he has reached nobles,\n courtiers, cabinets, and the throne itself.\n His influence in breaking the course of the\n rebellion can never be estimated.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n History a Faithful Judge.\n</p>\n<p>\n When these tributes were uttered Mr.\n Beecher was living, and of living men we\n have opinions; now Mr. Beecher is dead, and\n of dead men we form judgments. No man of\n his day was more misunderstood. Mr. Beech\u00ac\n er suffered on the one hand from indis\u00ac\n criminate eulogv, fulsome praise and an af\u00ac\n fection that could not blame. On the other\n hand, he suffered from malignant criticism,\n and even more from jealousy. But now, has\n come a time when it is possible to sift the\n wheat from the chaff, to estimate his virtues\n and his strength and also his mistakes and\n ignorance of men, for it has been wisely\n said, \u201cNo one ever knew more about man or\n less about men.\u201d Now that he has been fif\u00ac\n teen years dead, what do men say of him?\n The greatest leader in the Congregational\n Church in England has said: \u201cBeecher car\u00ac\n ried more genius than any other man of his\n century.\u201d Spurgeon called him \u201cthe Sfcaks-\n peare of the Christian pulpit.\u201d Dr. William\n Taylor, disagreed with Mr. Beecher in his\n theology, but after his death said of Beech\u00ac\n er\u2019s address in Liverpool, \u201cthe world has\n heard no such eloquence since Demosthenes.\u201d\n Among the private papers of Governor Oliv\u00ac\n er P. Morton of Indiana, whose untimely\n death was a national misfortune, is one\n paper in which he says he laid out his whole\n political life along lines pointed out by Henry\n Ward Beecher, in a ride the two young\n men took through the forests of Indiana in\n 1845. The great war Governor adds: \u201cI be\u00ac\n lieve him to be the broadest statesman the\n country has produced.\u201d Lying on his death\n bed, John C. Calhoun asked that Mr. Beech\u00ac\n er\u2019s article on \" Shall We Compromise?\u201d\n should be read to him a second time. \u201cThat\n man,\u201d he said, \u201cunderstands the subject and\n has gone to the bottom of it. He will be\n heard from again.\u201d Just before his death,\n in Boston, Phillips Brooks referred to Mr.\n Beecher and said: \u201cI regard him as the\n greatest preacher Protestanism has ever pro\u00ac\n duced.\u201d His lectures to young men have\n been translated into twenty foreign lan\u00ac\n guages. .Go into any cathedral or chapel\n or building where a minister of the\n established church preaches in England,\n and no matter w ' iio speaks Robertson\n alv/ays preaches the sermon. In our own\n country there are innumerable voices and\n many creeds, but I think there is no preach\u00ac\n er in our land but wmuld gladly confess\n that, some portion of his message he owes to\n this apostle of God and Jesus Christ. He\n sowed and reaped in many fields, he lec\u00ac\n tured often, but his pulpit was his real\n throne; he w.as a reformer, and killed many\n a nest of serpents, and sometimes fought\n with lions. He was an editor and strength\u00ac\n ened one great journal, the Independent, and\n founded the Christian Union. He became\n tongue for the dumb, and voice for the In\u00ac\n dian, the Chinese and the negro.

What\n man\u2019s life has been more fruitful of good?\n What man\u2019s influence has journeyed beyond\n the seas and been more permanent? Little\n wonder that the noble Boer generals now in\n our country wish to see his grave, as did a\n member of Parliament from Australia last\n week, just as twenty-five Englishmen came\n on a single Saturday and Sunday, from the\n steamers that landed in New York, to this\n church, to find the hero\u2019s tomb. These, in\n brief, are our reasons for believing that the\n time has come for us to build a shrine for\n Mr. Beecher and a temple of patriotism on\n these blocks that are condemned, a temple\n that will be worthy to rank with the tomb\n at Mount Vernon, at Springfield and only\n second to Faneuil Hall and Independence\n Hall, and the Old South, Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n Hedges, unable to restrain himself longer,\n cried out, \u201cWhat do you think of it, Dr.\n Beecher.?\u201d ' What do I think of it?\u201d cried\n Lyman Beecher, leaping to his feet, fling\u00ac\n ing wide his arms, and with flashing eyes,\n he shouted, \u201cWhat do I think of it? It\u2019s a\n red hot cannon ball, going through a bucket\n full of egg shells.\u201d Finer epigram there is not\n in all literature. But Roxana Foote was Ly\u00ac\n man Beecher\u2019s equal. She carried a large\n nature that was exquisitely organized, and\n touched with the finest features. Her love of\n the beautiful amounted to a passion, though\n Lyman Beecher scorned it. She had all the\n spiritual genius of a Madame Guion, with\n the refinement of Fenelon. She shot the\n Beecher type through and through with\n warm, rich, glowing tones. To have fallen\n heir to the intellectual wealth of the father,\n or the heart qualities of the mother, would\n have been rare good fortune, but Henry\n</p>\n<p>\n ^ --- ------t- muMppjj-\n</p>\n<p>\n was contend earnestly for the faith. And\n they fought vigorously and quoted Scripture\n as an excuse for fighting. Then, as now, the\n heresy hunters took off the wheels of the\n Lord\u2019s chariots instead of the enemies.\n Theology was the air the boy breathed, the\n food he ate, the poisoned water that he\n drank, and at last he rose up in utter revul\u00ac\n sion. He found that men were saved by\n bread, and not by fighting over the chemical\n formula that makes bread. And in the\n woods, kneeling in prayer, one day, the Vis\u00ac\n ion Splendid dawned. The sense of the love\n of God burst into his soul with all the glory\n of the inrushing sunshine, and for the next\n fifty years he had one theme\u2014man\u2019s sin,\n God\u2019s love. At 24 he took the first church\n that was offered, the church at Lawrence-\n burg. Made up, he tells us of nineteen\n women and one nothing, a man. He was his\n own sexton, swept the church, made the fires,\n did everything but listen to his own ser\u00ac\n mons. That the people had to do. Then\n came eight years in Indianapolis, where one#\n he preached daily for a period of eighteen\n months, and delivered his lectures to young\n men on industry, gambling, amusements, the\n causes of dishonesty\u2014the best book of its\n kind that ever was written. He was called\n to the old Park Street Church in Boston,\n when 34, and refused it, because it was\n Brimstone Corner; he accepted a call to\n Brooklyn in 1847. He found this church a\n handful; he carried you through three great\n revivals and built up a church of 2,500 mem\u00ac\n bers. He visited England in 1863, and thera\n met and vanquished his Goliath. He gave\n the Lyman Beecher Lecture series at Yale\n from 1871 to 1874, of which, when David\n Swing laid down the last volume, he said,\n \u201cThey may as well close the series. Every\u00ac\n thing has been said that can be said and bet\u00ac\n ter said also.\u201d From 1876 to 1880 he gave\n 300 sermons and lectures a year, probably\n the greatest physical and intellectual feat\n that has ever been accomplished. He revis\u00ac\n ited England in 1886, where he received a\n warm welcome. And here, in your midst, he\n died\u2014a long eventful life running through\n the most fiery and momentous period in our\n country\u2019s history.\n</p>\n<p>\n His Anti-Slavery Work.\n</p>\n<p>\n But our city and country owe him much\n for his anti-slavery work. When he came\n to Brooklyn the condition of the public\n mind was the condition \u201cof imprisoned moral\n sense,\u201d he tells us. Slavery is wrong, but\n our fathers have compromised it, and we\n must stand by the compromise of the Con\u00ac\n stitution. This was Webster\u2019s position, this\n was the position of the great W\u2019hig leaders.\n The North manufactured, the South raised\n cotton and slaves and bought from the North\n its manufactured products. The Southern\n merchants came North with their gold, and\n every merchant with his purse was a bribe-\n maker and the Northern manufacturers were\n bribe takers. The Southern merchants bribed\n the man who sold linen, wool and silk, who\n manufactured clocks and axes and organa.\n It was, Mr. Beecher tells us. the Egyptian\n era of American lire. For a man to ba\n \u25a0snown as an armittlonmi was for him to be\n avoided as though he had the plague.\n Churches in this city expelled men from\n their communion for speaking in the prayer\n meeting on slavery. The American Tract\n Society became the battle center. It would\n not send its Bibles or agents into the South,\n because the South did not want the slave to\n read. They said, it is our business to preach\n the gospel and not to meddle with lOliUM.\n</p>\n<p>\n What Lyman Beecher and Mrs. Stowe\n Have Done.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. As a prophet of the unseen God, Mr.\n Beecher has put the nation under obliga\u00ac\n tions. Great as orator, and lecturer, and\n statesman, his supreme gift was the gift of\n vision. The prophet, is a man v r ho sees the\n right clearly, who feels it deeply and who\n will die for those sublime convictions. Not\n many men of vision, and spiritual outlook!\n There are a thousand analytical intellects,\n cold and subtle, but their truth is always\n white light; it has no fertilizing power.\n There are ten thousand great workers in\n connection with material things, where there\n is one man of vision. Not many Pauls\u2014one\n in two thousand years. Not many Shaks-\n peares\u2014one in the history of the English\n race. It sometimes seems as if Mr. Beecher\n worked under a special dispensation. He\n himself once said that if you put a micro\u00ac\n scope over the stamen of the flower, what\n you see depends not on the flower, but on\n the power of the lenses. And when a mail\n turns his eyes toward the spiritual sky\n what he sees is determined by the spiritual\n lens that he carries. Perhaps what Mr.\n Beecher was came through the promise of\n God to the fathers for the children. Lyman\n Beecher was a moral hero, an intellectual\n giant. He was a reformer in theology and\n a prodigious force in national life. Only\n one other man lias been so idolized in New\n England\u2014Daniel Webster. For twenty years\n he was the first citizen of Boston. He had\n great clearness of statement, sure Logic, in\u00ac\n tense fervor, magnetic eloquence that car\u00ac\n ried all men away captive. His sermons on\n dueling after Burr\u2019s murder of Hamilton,\n put his name in every man\u2019s mouth. The\n temperance movement, started by his six\n sermons on temperance, is a movement\n that still continues. The eccentricity and\n originality that was in his distinguished son\n was quite as marked in the father, and he\n kept his church and deacons in hot water\n most of the time. Our New Englander loves\n Phillips Brooks not more ihan the New\n Englander cf yesterday loved Lyman Beech\u00ac\n er, whose symbol is a pen in the right hand\n and burning lamp in the left. Lyman Beech\u00ac\n er was a veritable Boanerges. His intellect\n flashed like a two-edged sword. One day\n he was visiting in Easthampton, where he\n was entertained by Judge Hedges\u2019 father.\n One morning in great excitement the host\n brought Mr. Beecher the full report of\n Webster\u2019s reply to Hayne. For two hours\n Lyman Beecher sat reading. At last Mr.\n</p>\n<p>\n Newell Dwight Hillis, D. D.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ward Beecher fell heir to the genius of both,\n and the two ancestral streams, like two\n great rivers, united, and swept him on to\n fame and fortune and lasting influence.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Achievements of Henry Ward\n Beecher.\n</p>\n<p>\n j\n</p>\n<p>\n Consider what Mr. Beecher has done for\n our country to deserve our praise, and the\n building of a memorial. Pass in review the\n leading events of his career. He was born\n in 1813, on the day dedicated to John the\n Baptist, who made Herod tremble. That\n was the annus mirabilis, for it was the birth\n year of Wendell Phillips, Charles Sumner,\n I Horace Greeley and Edwin Stanton. First\n came ten years in Litchfield, amid the hills.\n I where he grew a child of the open air and\n j nature; then eight years in Boston, in the\n j era of transcendentalism, and its rich stim-\n j ulus; then four years at Amherst College. At\n j 21 he entered Lane Seminary, where his\n father was professor of theology. The abo\u00ac\n lition reform was on. Some of the stu\u00ac\n dents were mobbed out of Kentucky. The\n atmosphere was rife with theological discus\u00ac\n sion. Old Dr. Wilson tried his father for\n heresy.

Every distiller from time to\n time, when his pastor preaches on intemper\u00ac\n ance, sends the preacher word that he wants\n the pure milk of the gospel, and not politics,\n in the pulpit. And that method prevailed in\n the ante-bellum days. In New Jersey, Mr.\n Beecher says, the church published an Epis\u00ac\n copal prayer book, with a frontispiece of\n Ary Scheffer\u2019s \u201cChrist the Consoler.\u201d About\n the Saviour were gathered \u201cthe poor, the old,\n the sick, the mother with her dead babe,\u201d\n bowed in grief, and among others a fettered\n slave, with his hands lifted to heaven crying\n for liberty; but this was too much, so they\n cut out the slave, and left the rest of the\n picture, and bound it into the Episcopal\n prayer book of New Jersey, \u201cI had a copy of\n the prayer book,\u201d Mr. Beecher adds, \u201cwhich\n I mean to leave to the Historical Society of\n Brooklyn.\u201d My understanding is that he\n loaned it, and next week I am going to ask\n it back again for Mr. Beecher\u2019s church. For\n many years, just prior to the renting of the\n pews, Mr. Beecher came out on the subject\n of slavery and warned the pew holders with\n reference to his abolitionism, and so it was\n that, broken in health, he went to England\n for what proved to be a triumphal tour. The\n history of eloquence contains no greater\n achievement. Mr. Beecher found the wealiny\n classes of England in favor of the South.\n The cotton mills were closed and the factory\n people reduced to starvation, because no cot\u00ac\n ton could be obtained. Our own country did\n not suffer more than did England, in the\n Lancashire district. Ships were being fitted\n out and sold to the South to help put clown\n the North. The strongest men in the British\n cabinet wished to recognize the South and\n help to end the war. A great leader said to\n Mr. Beecher, \u201cWhy don\u2019t you let the South\n go and take her slaves with her?\u201d and Mr.\n Beecher answered, \u201cIf you were a father and\n had hold of a mad dog that was struggling\n to get at a group of little children, would you\n let the mad dog go? We will not let the\n South go until we have killed slavery, in any\n event.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n A Hero\u2019s Work.\n</p>\n<p>\n The exordium of this speech was delivered\n in Manchester, the first argument was pre\u00ac\n sented in Glasgow^, the second in Edinburgh,\n the third in Liverpool, while the peroration\n was pronounced in Exeter Hall. For the\n first time in the history of the English press\n a lull page w r as telegraphed, and Mr. Beech\u00ac\n er\u2019s speeches were the theme of the hour in\n England. The- newspaper reports, with the\n interruptions baffle all description. Think\n of a man beginning to speak at 7 o\u2019clock,\n while the first hour and a half is represented\n by catcalls, hisses, groans, the flinging of a\n silk hat from one side of the gallery across\n to the other. With an important sen\u00ac\n tence interrupted and the interruption con\u00ac\n tinued for five minutes before the second\n half of the sentence was given. \u201cBut if the\n mob showed its teeth,\u201d Mr. Beecher says\n that in silence he said to himself: \" I will\n control you; I came here for victory, and\n by the help of God I will have it.\u2019\u201d The\n quiet of God\u2019s peace and an inner assurance\n of final victory stole in upon his spirit un\u00ac\n til, he said, it seemed as if he w r as sur\u00ac\n rounded by a burst of sunshine. At the\n end of the third half hour he said: \u201cGentle\u00ac\n men, you may break me down, but I have\n registered a vow that I will never return\n home until my country is vindicated. ' \u201d At\n 10 o\u2019clock he was the complete master of\n the situation. At 11 o\u2019clock, when a popular\n</p>\n<p>\n vote was called for, he says: \u201cIt was a\n tropical thunderstorm that swept through\n that hall as the \u2018yeas\u2019 were thundered, w ' hile\n the \u2018nays\u2019 were an insignificant and con\u00ac\n temptible minority. God was behind it all.\n I felt it, I knew it.\u201d In London, on the\n eleventh day, his voice was a whisper. \u201cI\n expect to be hoarse,\u201d he began, \u201cand I am\n willing to be hoarse if I can in any way help\n to bring the mother and daughter heart to\n heart and hand to hand together.\u201d And the\n present era of good will between the two\n countries is, to a large degree, the result of\n Mr. Beecher\u2019s influence. We all know that\n Mr. Lincoln felt that Mr. Beecher had helped\n the country at the most critical hour in our\n history. And as a result, at 5 A. M., imme\u00ac\n diately upon receiving news from Appomat\u00ac\n tox, he sent a telegram to Plymouth Church\n and Mr. Beecher announcing the end.\n</p>\n<p>\n Humanized Scholastic Theology.\n</p>\n<p>\n The world owes Mr. Beecher a great debt\n for his views of the love of God. Many of\n you are old enough to remember the medie\u00ac\n val theology. It was ultra Calvinistic. Its\n essence was that God made a man and wom\u00ac\n an and put them in a garden. Then He sent\n a tempter in, giving them inducements suffi\u00ac\n cient to break through all the hedges and\n buttresses of virtue, and ' break down the\n battlements of character. Then w ' hen the\n life of the first father and mother was un\u00ac\n clean, this spiritual taint was handed forward,\n to all the children, and spread like an awful\n plague in the blood. For 3,000 years God\n kept up his manufacturing of evil. He left\n Asia, and Africa, and most of Europe, dur\u00ac\n ing all this time, without a single temple,\n or teacher, while myriads poured over into\n a physical hell, with red hot flames gushing\n forth. Then after 3,000 years, He sent His\n Son into the scene to die for the elect only,\n leaving the non-elect to perish for this sin\n of Adam. And over against this Mr. Beecher\n placed the Gospel of Jesus Christ, God\u2019s love\n to the evil and the good, God\u2019s love to the\n just and unjust, God\u2019s love to the publican\n and harlot, God\u2019s love that will not break\n the bruised reed nor quench the smoking\n flax. Gods\u2019 love, that when the mother\u2019s or\n father\u2019s love, like a taper burns low in the\n socket, is a star of hope that burns eternal\n over the prisoner in his dungeon, and the\n prodigal amidst his desolation, his husks and\n swine. God\u2019s love, that is like a mother\u2019s\n care for her child. Why does God love bad\n men? Why is the rose sweet? Why is a\n rainbow beautiful? Why does the lover de\u00ac\n light to serve his beloved? Why is the\n mother glad to give life itself for her sick\n babe? Why does the sun shine for\n weeds as well as roses? Because all\n these have borrowed some little hint and\n glow and gleam from God, who loves be\u00ac\n cause it is His nature to love, who is toil\u00ac\n ing tirelessly to make bad men good, and\n good men better, and the best men heroe3\n and saints, and who will at last, here or\n there, bring judgment unto victory. Mr.\n Beecher made theology reasonable. He\n showed us the progressive revelation of God.\n He took the sting out of the atheistic evolu\u00ac\n tion, and showed us that evolution was God\u2019s\n way of doing things. He pointed out that\n every nation had its task, and every tribe\n its stint, and every individual its duty, and\n that all the hosts were marching upward\n toward an unseen goal, that there was a\n divine leader behind the clouds. He was a\n great optimist, because he believed in God.\n His earliest, latest and profoundest passion\n was his passion for Jesus Christ. His love\n for the poor and weak was a love unquench\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n able, but it was not like unto that immeas\u00ac\n urable love he cherished toward Jesus Christ.\n He taught us the \u2019joy of death. He put flow\u00ac\n ers instead of black on the house, in the\n hour when the angels of God\u2019s presence\n hovered about a home from which a little\n child slipped away. Leaving to some other\n time his other contributions and messages,\n his Yale lectures on preaching, his interpre\u00ac\n tations of nature\u2014for had he given himself\n to nature exclusively, he could have equaled\n John Ruskin; his occasional descriptions of\n character, for there was latent the qualities\n of one of our greatest novelists and humor\u00ac\n ists.\n</p>\n<p>\n The End of His Life.\n</p>\n<p>\n But it is enough for us here and now to\n remember his goodness. Let others praise\n him because he was great. We love him be\u00ac\n cause lie was good. The journal that he\n kept before and during his great trouble\n and trial holds pages of such spiritual fer\u00ac\n vor and exaltation as are found nowhere\n else in all the history -of devotional litera\u00ac\n ture. During those years what a life of\n prayer, morning after morning, during those\n awful years he came down to his room with\n the brightness and exuberance of a child.\n \u201cHow can you sleep, father?\u201d asked Dr.\n Scoville, after he (the son-in-law*) had had\n a week of sleepless nights. \u201cGod gave me\n the victory at the beginning of the trouble,\n and I have His pledge that it will all come\n out right.\u201d Some weeks before he died, in\n the presence of a little band of ministers in\n London, he was overwhelmed with words of\n kindness. He was an old man, nearly 74.\n He said to them that he wished to rehearse\n the story of God\u2019s goodness to one who began\n in the forests of Indiana, and had been led\n by God\u2019s providence into the great city, and\n on from task to task, unto hours when men\n attacked his reputation with reference to\n things of which he was innocent as a child.\n He w ' as an old man, and had lived down\n fifteen years before his troubles. He dragged\n in the reference to his trial. It was a mo\u00ac\n ment when he was talking of God\u2019s love to\n his ministerial brethren, and a few min\u00ac\n utes before he led them in that great prayer\n that has been preserved for us. In such a\n mood men do not tell lies. Therefore, he\n was what he said he was, innocent as a\n babe. Well, then, in retrospect, how pite\u00ac\n ous the tragedy, that a man should have\n been crucified and suspended on a cross,\n with bleeding heart, through four long\n years. He has gone from the scene of his\n troubles. At last the sun has cleared itself\n of clouds. Ah, Henry Ward Beecher, hero\n and now, we recall thy great love to God,\n thy Father, Christ, thy Saviour, to the slave,\n to the. poor, to the weak! We remember the\n days of darkness and the days of clouded\n battle and the days of final victory. We re\u00ac\n member thine oft repeated prayer, that God\n would make this church a place to which the\n multitudes, through all the generations and\n centuries should come, seeking bread for\n their hunger and light for their darkness,\n and life for their dead. Here and now we\n dedicate ourselves to God\u2014thy paths to\n Christ thy Saviour\u2014to thy brethren and\n ours, to this church thou didst found, that\n it may be an increasing power for good.\n May patriotism like thine descend to our\n sons.

At 7 o\u2019clock the doors were opened\n and it was but a short time before the large\n building was filled from auditorium to top\u00ac\n most gallery. Men of distinction in all walks\n of life were seated upon the platform and\n all the boxes were filled with men and\n women prominent in the city\u2019s life. All de\u00ac\n nominations were represented and enthusi--\n asm was manifested in the object of the\n meeting, the applause for the speakers was\n generous, and the movement for a shrine to\n the great preacher received an impetus which\n will, without doubt, result in the early com\u00ac\n pletion of the fund.\n</p>\n<p>\n There was an outburst of applause when\n Grover Cleveland, Mayor Seth Low, Justice\n David J. Brewer, the Rev. Dr. Frank W.\n Gunsaulus entered. W\u2019hen Mayor Low\n rose it was some moments before he\n could proceed with his address on\n account of the demonstration, and it\n was repeated in redoubled measure when\n Mr. Cleveland was announced, and again\n the applause rang out when Justice Brewer\n and Dr. Gunsaulus referred to the action\n of Cleveland\u2019s administration in standing\n by national honor and for national order. Mr.\n Cleveland was forced to rise in his place and\n bow his thanks. The Rev. Dr. Newell\n Dwight Hillis was heartily received and loud\n applause punctuated the many good points\n of Dr. Gunsaulus\u2019 address. The stage was\n set as a forest scene, and a large portrait of\n Beecher draped with the American flag oc\u00ac\n cupied a conspicuous place above the center\n of the stage.\n</p>\n<p>\n Elijah R. Kennedy, chairman of the ex\u00ac\n ecutive committee of the Beecher Memorial\n Fund, presided over the preliminary exer\u00ac\n cises. He asked the audience to rise, and\n the Lord\u2019s Prayer was repeated in unison,\n led by the Rev. Frederick Reese of Macon,\n Ga. The audience remained standing and\n repeated the Twenty-third Psalm, led by the\n Rev. Dr. Dickey of the American Church in\n Berlin. \u201cLove Divine, All Love Excelling,\u201d\n Beecher\u2019s favorite hymn, was sung, the\n choir of Plymouth Church leading.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Kennedy said: \u201cI have the honor of\n introducing the Mayor of the City of New\n York, who will take the chair for the even\u00ac\n ing, and who will now address you.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Address by Mayor Low\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLadies and gentlemen: Twenty years ago,\n when I was Mayor of Brooklyn, I had tbe\n happiness of presiding at a meeting, in this\n very building, held in celebration of Mr.\n Beecher\u2019s seventieth birthday. I am glad\n to be privileged, ' to-night, to ' preside, as\n Mayor of New York, over this great gather\u00ac\n ing, called to consider the erection of a\n suitable memorial of Henry Ward Beecher.\n</p>\n<p>\n Twenty years ago it was already clear that\n Mr. Beecher was a remarkable man. He had\n been, during a long life, a mighty influence\n among the people. To-day, it is equally clear\n that he was a great man, and that from hi3\n life have proceeded influences for good that\n are certain to endure.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cOn the afternoon of the day, twenty years\n ago, to which I have alluded, I met a gen\u00ac\n tleman who asked me whether I was in\u00ac\n tending to preside at the birthday celebra\u00ac\n tion to be held that evening. I said \u2018yes,\u2019\n and he then told me that he never could for\u00ac\n get the occasion on which he first saw Mr.\n Beecher. He said it was in the old Broad\u00ac\n way Tabernacle, on an occasion when Wen\u00ac\n dell Phillips had been advertised to speak.\n Mr. Phillips had scarcely come forward to\n</p>\n<p>\n Mayor Seth Low.\n</p>\n<p>\n address the audience, when Isaiah Rynders,\n followed by a gang of ruffians, jumped upon\n the platform and forbade him to speak.\n \u2018Quick as a flash,\u2019 my friend said, \u2018a spare\n man leaped upon the other end of the plat\u00ac\n form, and said to Mr. Phillips, in a voice of\n thunder, \u201cCome over to Brooklyn, Mr. Phil\u00ac\n lips, next Sunday, to Plymouth Church, and\n say what you please. In Brooklyn we have\n free speech.\u201d \u2019 (Applause.) I have often\n thought that that anecdote is singularly typi\u00ac\n cal of Mr. Beecher\u2019s whole career. From\n early manhood to old age, he was the fear\u00ac\n less and ready champion of freedom; of free\n thought, of free speech, and of free labor.\n Scarcely any one di^ more than he to create\n the condilion of the public mind which\n brought slavery to its doom; so making men\n .free and labor free, and no one, in his day,\n did more than he to substitute among clergy\n</p>\n<p>\n and people alike the idea of a God of Lov*\n for the idea of a God of Fear. The power\n of the man was the power of a great spirit,\n endowed with the gift of speech such as has\n been given to but few men. A powerful and\n discriminating intellect, a great fund of hu\u00ac\n man sympathy, a rare sense of humor, and\n a gift for illustration that charmed and\n delighted while illuminating every subject\n with which he dealt, made him an almost\n matchless orator. In the very best sense\n he was a popular orator, for he could reach\n the hearts of the plain people, as almost no\n man of his day could do. But this was not\n all, for he could also cast his spell over the\n highly educated few and carry them with\n him wherever he would. His great speeches\n in England, when the Civil War was at it3\n crisis and public opinion there was wavering\n between support of the North and support of\n the South, were not only masterpieces of\n eloquence, but, together, they constitute one\n of the greatest triumphs ever achieved by\n an orator. Evening after evening, those who\n were unfriendly to the cause of the Union\n endeavored by interruptions to break up the\n meetings, but, evening after evening, Mr.\n Beecher wore out his opponents, and, by\n sheer force of reasoning, carried audience\n after audience with him, as he demonstrated\n how the welfare of the whole race, and espe\u00ac\n cially the welfare of the laboring men of\n every land, were indissolubly bound up with\n the victory of the Union, which stood at\n once for free labor aind for free men.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt is to perpetuate the memory of such\n a man, or. rather. I will not say that\u2014for\n the memory of Henry Ward Beecher is se\u00ac\n cure, whatever we may do; but it is for the\n purpose of erecting a suitable memorial of\n such a man, that this meeting has been\n called. It is fitting that the pastor of Ply\u00ac\n mouth Church, one of Mr. Beecher\u2019s suc\u00ac\n cessors in the pulpit which he made illus\u00ac\n trious, should have given the impulse to\n this movement. It is equally fitting that\n such a memorial should take some perma\u00ac\n nent form which will make it of value to\n the church of which Mr. Beecher was the\n first pastor. It cannot be doubted, it seems\n to me, that, of s~ possible memorials, Mr.\n Beecher would have selected something that\n tended to enlarge tbe usefulness and to\n make permanent the church that prospered\n so greatly under his ministry. It may, in\u00ac\n deed, be said that Mr. Beecher needs no\n such memorial; that his fame and influence\n are secure without it. Very likely, that is\n so, and yet both his fame and his influence\n may ' be given a new and enlarged power of\n inspiration by being identified with and\n housed, as it were, in some, memorial built\n in recognition of his useful life. It is for\n our own sakes, ar.d for the sake of those\n who come after us, that this movement has\n been started; and I am sure I speak the\n voice of the city itself when I express the\n hope that it may be crowned with complete\n success.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In introducing former President Grover\n Cleveland, Mayor Low said: \u201cI have the\n pleasure of presenting to this audience\n Grover Cleveland, ex-President of the United\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0012/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 194, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0012/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 388, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 558}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0012/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 777, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1117}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0012/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1555, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2234}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0012/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3111, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4468}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0012/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/ec/he/rm/em/or/ia/la/00/un/se/beechermemoriala00unse/beechermemoriala00unse_0012.jp2", "height": 4468, "width": 3111, "levels": 6, "size": 1036179}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"12\">\n<p>\n io\n</p>\n<p>\n THE BEECHER MEMORIAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n States.

I am here\n in obedience to an impulse that will not be\n denied; and I am accredited to this assem\u00ac\n blage by a condition of heart, and by an in\u00ac\n fluence which have been strong within me\n for many years.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" It is now more than forty-nine years ago\n that I heard in Plymouth Church a sermon\n whose impressiveness has remained fresh\n and bright in my mind during all the time\n that has since passed. In days of trial and\n troublous perplexity its remembrance has\n been an unfailing comfort; and in every time\n of depression and discouragement the lesson\n it taught has brought restoration of hope\n and confidence. I remember as if it were\n but yesterday the fervid eloquence of the\n great preacher as he captivated my youthful\n understanding and pictured to my aroused\n imagination the entrance of two young men\n upon the world\u2019s jostling activities\u2014one\n laden like a beast of burden with avaricious\n plans and sordid expectations, and the other\n with a light step and cheerful determination,\n seeking the way of duty and usefulness and\n striving for the reward promised to those\n who love and serve God, and labor for hu\u00ac\n manity. I have never for a moment lost\n the impression made upon me by the vivid\n contrast thrlllingly painted in words that\n burned, between the two careers; nor have\n I ever failed to realize the meaning of the\n truths taught by the description given of\n the happy compensations in life and the\n peace and solace in death of the one, and\n the racking disappointments in life and the\n despair in death of the other. What this\n sermon has been to me in all these years I\n alone know. I present its recollection to\u00ac\n day as a personal credential of my own,\n especially entitling me to representation\n among those who meet to recall and memor\u00ac\n ialize the fame and usefulness of Henry\n Ward Beecher.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018\u2018I am not 1 re, however, for the purpose\n of only giving voice to a grateful recollection,\n nor solely to acknowledge the personal bene\u00ac\n fit and service I have received from the\n teaching of the illustrious dead. I have come\n to join in the kind of hero worship which is\n but another name for a reverent recognition\n of that greatness which manifests itself\n when humble faith and trust in God in\u00ac\n spires sincere and brave service in the cause\n of humanity\u2019s elevation and betterment.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" It has been wisely said that hero worship\n will endure while man endures. Let us ac\u00ac\n cept this as a pleasant truth, upon the con\u00ac\n dition that the man or qualities worshipped\n and the manner of their worship are of the\n very essence of the matter. Let us believe\n that there is no sadder symptom of a gener\u00ac\n ation\u2019s bad moral health than its lack of\n faith in its great men and its loss of rever\u00ac\n ence for its heroes; but let this belief be\n coupled with the reservation that those\n called great shall be truly great, and that\n the heroes challenging our reverence shall\n be truly heroic, measured by standards ad\u00ac\n justed to the highest moral conditions of\n man\u2019s civilization.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" .We cannot have the least misgiving\n</p>\n<p>\n concerning the completeness of the hero\n whose name is on our lips to-night and\n whose memory is in our hearts. Should a\n hero\u2019s aims and purposes be high and noble?\n Our hero devoted his life to teaching the love\n of God and pointing out to his fellow men\n the way of their souls\u2019 salvation. Should\n he be unselfish, self-sacrificing and generous?\n The self-sacrifice of our hero shone out con\u00ac\n stantly and brightly, and his life will be\n searched in vain for a selfish, ungenerous\n act. Should he be courageously and ag\u00ac\n gressively a lover of his country and a cham\u00ac\n pion of freedom? Our hero, in the days of\n his country\u2019s danger and trial, challenged\n all comers in defense of our national safety\n and unity. He stood like a rock against\n doubters at home, and he confronted angry,\n</p>\n<p>\n Grover Cleveland.\n</p>\n<p>\n threatening throngs abroad with a steady,\n unyielding courage which wrought triumphs\n for his country and for its consecration to\n manhood\u2014freedom not less imjortant than\n those of an army with banners. Should he\n be brave and patient under personal suffer\u00ac\n ing and affliction? Our hero, when afflic\u00ac\n tions came from heaven, submissively con\u00ac\n tinued to praise God; and when he felt the\n cruel siings of man\u2019s ingratitude and malice\n he serenely looke.d toward his heavenly Fath\u00ac\n er\u2019s face and kept within the comforting\n light of a pure conscience. Should a hero\n crown all his high moral attributes with\n great and beneficent achievements? Our\n hero led thousands upon thousands to the\n way of eternal life; he surrounded religion\n with cheerful brightness and taught that it\n grows best, not in the darkness of terror,\n but in the constant sunshine of God\u2019s unfail\u00ac\n ing love; he performed the highest service\n to his country in a spirit of absolutely pure\n patriotism and self-effacement. His daily\n life and influence were blessed benefactions\n to his countrymen far and near, and by no\n means the least of all he did he created\n Plymouth Church, and kindled there a light\n of Christian faith and hope whose unwaver\u00ac\n ing and unwaning warmth and light have in\n</p>\n<p>\n every corner of our land dispelled the chill\n and gloom of doubt and fear.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" What do we here? Do we seek to put\n in the way of constant remembrance the\n civic virtues of our hero, his contribution to\n the fame of the city he loved, and his dis\u00ac\n tinguished life among his townsmen? This\n has already been done, and an impressive\n monument recalls to those who pass along\n your streets the strong and loved person\u00ac\n ality of Henry Ward Beecher. It is fitting\n that such a monument should stand in your\n midst, not only as a reminder of the per\u00ac\n sonality of our hero, but as evidence that\n in its erection there has been stimulated\n and cultivated a wholesome appreciation of\n the greatness of genuine usefulness.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" We desire also to establish a memorial\n to our hero. We know that there is no\n need of duplicating a reminder that Henry\n Ward Beecher has lived and is no longer\n with us in body. We know that neither\n monument nor memorial avails to the dead;\n and we know that nothing more than the\n monument our hero has himself erected in\n the hearts of men is necessary to his re\u00ac\n membrance. And, yet, in loving honor to\n his name, we would erect a memorial,\n through which the living will be quickened\n and strengthened in the emotions and senti\u00ac\n ments so much a part of his life and death.\n We would make our memorial an agency\n for the continuation of the mission which\n he undertook when he consecrated himself\n to the service of God and the elevation and\n improvement of his fellow men; and by the\n love he bore toward God and man we would\n invoke his approval of our work. We seek\n to build a memorial which shall be a shrine,\n surrounded and pervaded by our hero\u2019s influ\u00ac\n ence and spirit, inspiring all who worship\n there to noble deeds. We would invite to\n his shrine from near and far those whose\n hearts have been touched by his earnest\n tones, or haply they might hear again his\n words of love and comfort; and we would\n invite those who have never known his min\u00ac\n istrations to come and, standing within the\n influence of that sacred place, to feel it3\n gentle leading to a better and more useful\n life.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Our hero has himself declared in what\n manner his shrine should be approached.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018When I fall and am buried in Greenwood\n let no man dare to stand over the turf and\n say, \u201cHere lies Henry Ward Beecher,\u201d for\n God knows that I will not lie there. Look\n up! If you love me, and if you feel that I\n have helped you on your way home, stand\n with your foot on my turf and look up; for\n I will not hear anybody who does not speak\n with his mouth toward heaven.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \" It would savor of hardihood if we who\n knew Mr. Beecher and his work, and who\n now contemplate the building of a memorial\n to the spirit and inspiration of his labors,\n should be content with a mere idle token of\n remembrance. Assuredly, if it is to typify\n his lofty intents and purposes, and if it is to\n memorialize his unsparing, constant useful\u00ac\n ness, and his fidelity in interpreting to his\n fellow men the messages of God, our me\u00ac\n morial must be a center of work which shall\n redound to the glory of God and the good of\n humanity It should never be forgotten\n that as truly as the life and labors of Henry\n tVard Beecher were devoted to serving God\n and making the condition and destiny of\n his fellow men better and happier, just so\n truly should our work, undertaken in his\n name, be entered upon with the same high\n intent and purpose.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" We must look up, as we build a shrine\n to our hero; and if we w r ould have him near\n</p>\n<p>\n t\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0013/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 197, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 280}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0013/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 394, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 560}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0013/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 789, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1121}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0013/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1579, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2242}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0013/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4484}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0013/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/ec/he/rm/em/or/ia/la/00/un/se/beechermemoriala00unse/beechermemoriala00unse_0013.jp2", "height": 4484, "width": 3159, "levels": 6, "size": 1024090}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"13\">\n<p>\n THE BEECHER MEMORIAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2019ll\n</p>\n<p>\n us as we invoke his favor we must speak\n with our mouths toward heaven.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" .It is also entirely manifest that we can\n build no memorial shrine to our hero which\n will attract his favor and the presence of\n his spirit, without making Plymouth Church\n a part if it.

My\n incapacity and insufficiency, none can feel\n so profoundly as I; and yet I have this wit\u00ac\n ness; that for twenty-five years I have not\n withheld my strength and have labored in\n simplicity and with sincerity of motive, for\n the honor of God and for the love that I\n bear to you, and for the ineradicable love\n that I have for my country and for the\n world.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIf our work of building a memorial to our\n hero is prosecuted in the spirit that charac\u00ac\n terized his work on earth, and if we mingle\n with the love we have for his memory a\n serious purpose to emulate his love for hu\u00ac\n manity, our hero worship will be inspiring\n and elevating. If, invoking his approval\n and in his name, we extend his life work,\n we shall not only exemplify our affection\n for him, but shall follow the designs of God\n as they were revealed to him; and if at\n the shrine we erect, humanity shall look up\n and shall cast off its burden of sin and\n selfishness and uncharitableness, we shall\n know that our hero is there, and that\n through his intercessions our efforts have\n received a divine blessing.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n At the conclusion of Mr. Cleveland\u2019s ad\u00ac\n dress there was another demonstration of\n applause. He showed signs of being deeply\n moved. Mayor Low said: \u201cThe Hon. David\n J. Brewer, justice of the Supreme Court of\n the United States, will now address you.\u201d\n Justice Brewer rose and was greeted with\n long continued applause.\n</p>\n<p>\n Address by\n</p>\n<p>\n Justice D. J. Brewer\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIn the marvelously transforming period\n from 1850 to 1880 Henry Ward Beecher was a\n man of prodigious influence. He may well\n be called its great preacher. He was the\n most conspicuous member of an illustrious\n family. We are here on this anniversary\n of his death to testify of him and to\n bear -witness to his memory. Only a\n few speak, but you are all witnesses. Each |\n</p>\n<p>\n heart testifies. Nay, more, the world is full\n of testimony. There is a cloud of witnesses.\n Some years since I stood by an open grave\n on the banks of the Mississippi and saw\n lowered into it the coffined body of one of our\n greatest jurists, Mr. Justice Miller. Not a\n handful of earth was thrown upon the cof\u00ac\n fin. but the school children of the city one\n by one marched by and each dropped a flower\n into the grave till it was filled to overflowing\n and a monument of flowers rose above the\n surrounding surface. Each flower was a wit\u00ac\n ness and testified to the city\u2019s love of its\n greatest citizen and its great jurist. By how\n many thousands of hearts is a flower placed\n this evening upon the memory of Henry\n Ward Beecher?\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHe was a child of nature, and in some re-\n</p>\n<p>\n Justice David J. Brewer.\n</p>\n<p>\n spects always a child. The overflowing spirit\n of the boy remained a perennial spring.\n He could not repress that overflow. In him\n pathos and humor were always at home.\n When some of his ministerial brethren\n gently expostulated with him for what they\n thought too much levity in the pulpit\u2014and\n you know that laughter in church was in\n those days a forbidden thing\u2014he promptly\n replied, \u2018Ah, brethren, you would forgive me\n if you knew how much I kept back.\u2019 He\n never placed his heart in a straitjacket nor\n let it be chilled by the cold touch of a busi\u00ac\n ness age. All through life he listened to its\n voice and followed its impulses.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt lia3 been said that he would have made\n a great actor. Doubtless he would, for the\n great actor is the one who fully and faith\u00ac\n fully interprets to us all the secret things\n of the heart and the deep things of\n the soul. Shakspeare is read where Lord\n Bacon is unknown. One felt while the other\n reasoned. The voices of the heart came from\n the one; the cold processes of the intellect\n from the other. So Mr. Beecher as a minis\u00ac\n ter of Christ\u2019s gospel will be known and\n loved long after he who fashioned into form\n the most logical creed has been buried, in\n the cold oblivion of unread history.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHe was pre-eminently a patriot, and\n patriotism is not an offspring of the\n intellect, but of the heart. It means\n love of country, and the most intense\n</p>\n<p>\n patriotism requires a nature capable of\n the strongest love. Hence it was that\n during the bitter hours of the Civil\n War, both at home and abroad, his voice\n rang out strongly, hopefully, triumphant\u00ac\n ly. He stood on English platforms and con\u00ac\n quered English prejudices. Pulpit and press\n were filled with his patriotic utterances.\n</p>\n<p>\n My country, \u2019tis of thee.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sweet land of liberty.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of thee 1 sing.\n</p>\n<p>\n was a song most dear. His country\u2019s flag\n was not a mere piece of cloth, worth so much\n a yard. He loved the Stars and Stripes. The\n sight of them brought tears to his eyes.\n They spoke to him of a glorious past, made\n glorious by toils and tears, by tribulations\n and deaths. He could not shut himself\n in his study and write articles on theology,\n or stand in a pulpit and denounce the exceed\u00ac\n ing sinfulness of sin when the very life of\n the republic was in peril. He was emphatic\u00ac\n ally a preacher in politics. It was fitting that\n when the flag lowered at Fort Sumter on\n April 12, 1861, was raised again on April 14,\n 1865, Mr. Beecher should be selected to utter\n for the nation its exultant, triumphant\n hallelujah. And yet, as he poured forth his\n song of joy hear these accompanying sym\u00ac\n pathetic words:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018For the people misled, for the multitudes\n drafted and driven into this civil war, let not\n a trace of animosity remain. The moment\n their willing hands drop the musket and they\n return to their allegiance then stretch out\n your own honest right hand to greet them.\n Recall to them the old days of kindness. Our\n hearts wait for their redemption. All the\n resources of a renovated nation shall be\n applied to rebuild their prosperity and\n smooth down the furrows of war.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWho does not know that if the great\n emancipator had not been laid low by the\n bullet of the assassin, or if men of Mr.\n Beecher\u2019s kindly heart had ruled the coun\u00ac\n sels of congress many of the saddest pages\n of reconstruction would never have been\n written. (Applause.)\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAgain, note his constant hostility to all\n forms of oppression. To him the Declara\u00ac\n tion of Independence meant all that it said.\n The consent of the governed was no glit\u00ac\n tering generality. He was a leader in the\n great struggle in the republic between lib\u00ac\n erty and slavery. He stood with those who\n had goods, but not consciences, for sale.\n And as faith without works is dead, Beech\u00ac\n er\u2019s bibles in Kansas became solid argu\u00ac\n ments for freedom. He sang with Whittier:\n</p>\n<p>\n We cross the prairies as of old\n Our fathers crossed the sea.\n</p>\n<p>\n To make the West as they the East\n The homestead of the free.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHe re?.d fr ' -n* i-rs 3 > ot the meaning of\n the great Civil War; not party supremacy,\n not sectional domination, but the transfus\u00ac\n ing into the lifeblood of the nation the vivi\u00ac\n fying spirit of Webster\u2019s prophetic words,\n \u2018Liberty and union, now and forever, one\n and inseparable.\u2019 (Applause.) After the firing\n upon Sumter his first sermon was from\n the text, \u2018Speak to the children of Israel\n that they go forward.\u2019 He shouted for joy\n when the emancipation proclamation was\n issued. It was the dawning of a new day,\n and he felt that the time was near when\n North and South, East and West, would\n mingle their voices on Independence Day\n in this cry of praise:\n</p>\n<p>\n One land, this land of liberty;\n</p>\n<p>\n One flag, this banner of the free.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWrong to the negro was not the only\n wrong that appealed to him.

Nor was his love\n of liberty and hatred of oppression\n bounded by the territorial limits of his own\n land. The oppressed everywhere were his\n friends. He welcomed Kossuth. Plymouth\n pulpit was open to every noble soul coming\n with an appeal for struggling humanity.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAnd in all this he was but following the\n leadings of his heart. He believed in lib\u00ac\n erty; nay more, he loved it, and loved it, not\n for himself alone, but for all the sons and\n daughters of earth.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cSo also his theology. It was condensed\n in a single sentence, God is love. Although\n brought up under the old New England\n theology, among whose affirmations the cer\u00ac\n tainty and place of endless punishment for\n unnumbered multitudes were conspicuous,\n and while perhaps he never wholly rejected\n Its affirmations, his sermons bubbled over\n with indications of a belief that the\n Almighty would prove to be more merciful\n than the Puritan and the Pilgrim were\n /^willing he should be. (Laughter.) While\n he may never have called himself a\n Universalist, yet many things he said\n suggest the epitaph facetiously pre\u00ac\n pared for Lord Westbury, after deliv\u00ac\n ering the judgment of the privy council\n in the case of the Bishop of Salisbury vs.\n Williams, to the effect that it was not penal\n for a clergyman to express a hope of the\n ultimate pardon of the w r icked, that he, the\n chancellor, had taken away from the ortho\u00ac\n dox members of the Church of England their\n last hope of everlasting damnation and\n dismissed hell with costs?.

Even to-day I fancy you can easily\n find many whose strict orthodoxy in theo\u00ac\n logical matters is seriously challenged, and\n and yet who are known to be constant bene\u00ac\n dictions. a comfort and help to all who hear\n them; and if I may step outside the realm\n or theology I may also say that we should\n not have to go far to find one whose views on\n political economy may be open to serious\n questiou, and yet whose unswerving loyalty\n to public duty and financial honesty has\n hercad glorified this republic.

He w-ho is most profound\u00ac\n ly moved Dy the great appeal which comes\n from human frailty and suffering is one\n whose words ever find glad response in all\n our hearts. Wo love the man who in our\n weakness and failure bids us look upward\n and have hope, and we feel that his words\n</p>\n<p>\n of encouragement are but the echo of\n grander voices that fill the universe with\n their music of cheer. The common people\n heard the Master gladly. Why; because they\n had seen his miracles? Nay, rather because\n his sympathetic words spoke hope and en\u00ac\n couragement to all, even the worst. She\n who had strayed far from the paths of recti\u00ac\n tude heard the promise of the water of life.\n \u2018Neither do I condemn thee\u2019 w r as but a pre\u00ac\n amble to the command \u2018Go, sin no more.\u2019\n The grave gave up its dead because a moth\u00ac\n er\u2019s and a sister\u2019s tears constrained Him,\n and \u2018Father, forgive them,\u2019 were the dying\n words of the crucified Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWhile Henry Ward Beecher thundered\n forth the inexorable depaands of justice and\n righteousness, there was a minor key which\n sweetly sang out blessed words of comfort,\n and bade all sorrowing and fallen ones to\n look to the heights whence cometh strength\n and peace.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt is fitting, then, that on this evening\n we gather to do homage to his memory;\n fitting that in this city, where his great\n work was done, there be erected a memo\u00ac\n rial building which shall speak his name to\n those who shall come after us.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBut is this all?

(Applause.) So shall it be that\n until struggling humanity no longer needs\n the uplifting power of love and sympathy,\n on its appealing heart will be seen in un\u00ac\n dimmed letters the name of Henry Ward\n Beecher.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cJesus, Lover of My Soul,\u201d was sung and\n Dr. Hillis was introduced and heartily re\u00ac\n ceived.\n</p>\n<p>\n Address by\n</p>\n<p>\n The Rev. Dr. Hillis\n</p>\n<p>\n This movement to build some memorial\n to Henry Ward Beecher grew out of a strik\u00ac\n ing emergency. As you all know, his old\n church, Plymouth, is in a down town district.\n While in the present the church is not suf\u00ac\n fering from the incoming of business, the\n time is not far off when commerce is to\n crowd out the churches back to the resi\u00ac\n dence district, several miles away, while\n there is imminent danger that the great\n apartment houses may overshadow a historic\n building. The speakers of the evening have\n outlined for us Mr. Beecher\u2019s work for this\n country and for the world. They have in\u00ac\n sisted that this generation that owes so much\n to him must hand forward to the next gen\u00ac\n eration his life and work. Thus far, strange\u00ac\n ly enough, a kind of fatality has attended h(s\n work. Mr. Beecher wrote the first of the\n great hymn books, and it was deemed best\n to change the name. He founded a great re\u00ac\n ligious newspaper, but the name of Christian\n Union was changed and the name of its\n founder and editor no longer appears. His\n church, Plymouth, was the scene of his great\u00ac\n est work, and there he taught men the love\n of God; there he made his protest against\n slavery; there he made his plea for liberty;\n there he taught us toleration and charity be\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n tween the churches; there he labored to\n overthrow the old Calvinism and to human\u00ac\n ize theology, and there he taught us the law\n of sympathy and service for the poor and\n weak alike. Looking forward into the future\n our committee forecast the day when Ply\u00ac\n mouth Church shall be to New York and\n Brooklyn what the Old South is to Boston.\n It is a historic building, and should be pre\u00ac\n served, but if it is to be preserved it must\n be done by those of us who love Mr. Beecher,\n for a generation will soon rise up who know\n not Joseph. This man\u2019s work and life are a\n part of the history of the republic and lib\u00ac\n erty. In a single week twenty-five men from\n abroad visited Plymouth, seeking for Mr.\n Beecher\u2019s grave. Every month, including the\n Sundays, it is believed, that not leas than\n a thousand people from the different states\n of our Union make their way to this historic\n spot. In the interest of patriotism we be\u00ac\n lieve the time has fully come to perpetuate\n this building, and to erect a suitable me\u00ac\n morial that will interpret to the succeeding\n generation what the public owes to Henry\n Ward Beecher.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Form of the Memorial.\n</p>\n<p>\n This memorial movement includes several\n different features. First of all the citizens\n of the Heights have petitioned the Board of\n Estimate and the Committee on Local Im-\n \u25a0piovements to condemn the whole or part\n of the block on which Plymouth Church is\n situated, as a little public park, to be named\n the Henry Ward Beecher Park. In view of\n the inaccessibility of Mr. Beecher\u2019s grave,\n and in view of his love of trees and flowers,\n many favor the removal of Mr. Beecher ' s\n remains to this park, associated with the\n great scenes of his life and the history of\n liberty. It should be said that those who\n favor this removal, and those who oppose it\n are in the proportion of about nine to one.\n It. is also proposed to erect a Beecher Me\u00ac\n morial Hall, for the people of the country, to\n contain the pulpit from which Mr. Beecher\n sold the siave girl, the pulpit from which\n Lyman Beecher preached his sermon on du\u00ac\n eling the Sunday after the death of Alexan\u00ac\n der Hamilton, and the sermon on \u201cTemper\u00ac\n ance,\u201d which developed into the Washington\n movement, with the manuscripts of Harriet\n Beecher Stowe, Mr. Beecher\u2019s sister, to\u00ac\n gether with the portraits, photographs,\n paintings of Mr. Beecher and the epochs in\n Bis life, of which, nearly one hundred exist;\n to overture some Abbey or Sargent for a\n series of paintings portraying the great\n scenes in the history of American patriot\u00ac\n ism. for example, Patrick Henry at Will\u00ac\n iamsburg, Lincoln at Gettysburg, Webster\u2019s\n reply to Hayne, some scene in the life of\n Alexander Hamilton and Mr. Beecher\u2019s sale\n of the slave girl in Plymouth Church. To\n make this memorial a hall of patriotism\n and to secure for it a small endowment fund\n by means of which the building may be sup\u00ac\n ported, and each winter a series of lectures\n given on the relation between Christianity\n and free institutions, to be published an\u00ac\n nually and sent broadcast for the incite\u00ac\n ment of the love of liberty in the children\n and youth of the country, and by bringing\n in various objects from time to time that\n are related to liberty, to so enrich this\n building until it becomes a kind of patriotic\n Mecca, to which the children and youth of\n neighboring states shall come to feed their\n love of liberty and pledge themselyes anew\n to the cause of home and native land.

Is this memorial movement\n In harmony with Mr. Beecher\u2019s temper and\n conviction? In a sermon on Charles Sum\u00ac\n ner Mr. Beecher once said: \u201cThe best gift of\n God to nations is the gift of upright men.\u201d\n And now that Mr. Beecher is gone we affirm\n that his memory is a national possession,\n and should become the dynamic of our civic\n and social life. Developing the importance of\n the influence of the great men of yesterday,\n he said: \u201cThe best men of the world have\n been the food of all after time. Children feed\n upon their parents, scholars lean upon their\n teachers, the pupil follows the artist master,\n aspiring soldiers look to the illustrious offi\u00ac\n cers that led them. The past is the granary\n of the soul, where the seed of ages is col\u00ac\n lected. Above our heads in the air dwell in\u00ac\n numerable souls, overhanging, and raining\n down influence upon us.\u201d When national life\n furnishes no histories worthy of record men\n feel the want of them, embellish stories and\n even invent them. The hunger of the soul\n will have some food. When men ask how the\n Jews have sustained themselves the reply is,\n by bringing their children up in the memory\n of the noblest heroic deeds of their ancestors.\n \u201cThe secret of Israelitish eminence was and\n is family life, feeding upon the sources of\n heroism\u2014the great men of yesterday.\u201d But\n it is not enough that Mr. Beecher affirmed\n the influence of the great man and good, and\n the duty of handing a great name and career\n forward. He tells us that two of his great\u00ac\n est spiritual experiences he owes to the\n shrines and graves of great religious teach\u00ac\n ers. In London he went to the graves of\n John Bunyan and John Wesley and the mar\u00ac\n tyrs at Oxford., He adds that he made his\n way to the church in Stratford. Regarding\n the influence of those shrines and graves\n upon his after life he says: \" I knelt down\n at the altar with the dust of Shakspeare be\u00ac\n neath my feet. I thought of it, as I thought\n of ten thousand things, without the least\n disturbance of the bosom. I saw upon the\n wall the well known bust of Shakspeare, and\n I knew that beneath the pavement, under\n that, his dust reposed.\u201d He says that in that\n hour he heard the prayers and the songs and\n the chants, not with the ear, but with the\n soul. \u201cI was dissolved: my whole being\n seemed to me like an incense wafted grate\u00ac\n fully toward God. I stood like a shrub in a\n spring morning, every leaf covered with dew,\n and every breeze shook down some drops. I\n trembled so much at times that I was obliged\n to sit down. There was a moment in which\n the heavens seemed open to me, and I saw\n the glory of God.\u201d Those two chapters in\n which Mr. Beecher tells us how much he\n owed to the shrines a: d grave of a great poet\n and three great preachers explain the anxi\u00ac\n ety of those of us who loved Mr. Beecher to\n convert the block where the hero did his\n work into a Beecher park, and there in a\n memorial building to continue his work, and\n there under the trees, amid the grass and\n flowers to bury his dust, at a place where the\n</p>\n<p>\n children and youth of our city and nation can\n associate the shrine, the worker and his\n work.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Beecher\u2019s Ideas of Death and the\n Body.\n</p>\n<p>\n The sixth and last feature in connection\n with this movement is to remove Mr.\n Beecher\u2019s body from Greenwood to this pro\u00ac\n posed Beecher Park. Just here, we must\n ask, whether Mr. Beecher would sympathize\n with this. Some say that this proposition\n is opposed to Mr. Beecher\u2019s teachings. It\n has been said that \u201cto build a tomb adjoin\u00ac\n ing Plymouth Church to hold his ashes would\n be to erect a monument to bear perpetual\n testimony against his life-long teaching con\u00ac\n cerning death and immortality. It would\n be as if Plymouth Church itself should be\n draped in black on the anniversary of his\n death. It would be to tell all the world\n that Plymouth Church loves a man and re\u00ac\n pudiates his message. The day of sacred\n relics has passed. Certainly for all Prot\u00ac\n estant Christendom; even more for all who\n accept Mr. Beecher\u2019s faith in the continuity\n of life.\u201d With great skill and with great\n eloquence this editor of a religious journal\n has opposed the removal of Mr. Beecher.\n But the real reason for this proposition for\n the park and the removal of Mr. Beecher\n thereto is based upon Mr. Beecher\u2019s own\n words and his own full and explicit and un\u00ac\n deniable emphasis of the importance of the\n tomb and the shrine. While a senior in col\u00ac\n lege, I read and preserved a sermon of Mr.\n Beecher\u2019s, which I now hold in my hand, in\n which he discussed this subject and on which\n I wrote these words: \u201cMr. Beecher here\n forecasts his death and burial, and indicates\n his wishes.\u201d His text was, \u201cJoseph, when\n he died, made mention of the departing ot\n the children of Israel, and gave command\u00ac\n ment concerning his bones.\u201d His theme\n was the sanctity of a good man\u2019s ashes, and\n his thought, Joseph\u2019s charge that his bones\n should be disinterred and carried to the sep\u00ac\n ulcher of his fathers, that he might slumber\n in the place made dearest to him by asso\u00ac\n ciation. Mr. Beecher begins by saying: \" A\n remarkable record of a dying statesman\u2014\n anxiety respecting his bones! In his dying\n hour Joseph asks for no history to be chis\u00ac\n eled on obelisk or temple facade, or written\n upon papyrus. Swear ' to me that you will\n carry my bones to the sepulcher of my\n fathers, to the cave of Macpelah, where\n Abraham and Isaac and Jacob rest. \u2018What?\u2019\n says the hard materialist: \u2018why should he\n want to take his bones from the sand of\n Egypt? What matter where the body sleeps?\n Should a man care for the old coat or worn-\n out shoe, which he throws into the heap?\n And what more is the body itself but an in\u00ac\n strument worn out? Let it go.\u2019 \u2018What mat\u00ac\n ter what becomes of my body?\u2019 say men.\n \u2018When I have done with it, any one can\n have it after that. Why should there be so\n much concern about where to sleep when I\n am buried?\u2019 \u201d Then, having stated the ob\u00ac\n jections to the removal of his body far bet\u00ac\n ter than can the editor, Mr. Beecher goes\n on to answer the objection. He says:\n \u201cWhile I am not one who believes in the\n resurrection of the material body, neverthe\u00ac\n less, there is a shock given to a superior\n sentiment when the body is discarded and\n thrown out, as something worn out and\n worthless. All that is highest, all that is\n noblest in human consciousness revolts at\n any indifference of this kind. How well has\n the body served us; our senses, as if they\n were so many ministers of God, bringing in\n treasures hour by hour, moment by moment.\n</p>\n<p>\n year after year, in their rounds, through the\n eye. Who can count what the ear has done\n for us\u2014the highway along which have\n trooped such thoughts, such feelings have\n been enunciated, such loves have whispered,\n such sweet sounds ministered to us. What\n joy have we had in the voice, how well has\n this strangely delicate, yet wonderfully en\u00ac\n during human body served us with its vari\u00ac\n ous implements and organs? What a serv\u00ac\n ice has it rendered to every one in life?\n Now, to those that talk so philosophically\n about the body, and say the body has served\n its purpose. Let it go. Swing it off into\n nature, to mingle and come back in some\n remote period. I answer, But what if it is\n your mother\u2019s body? Do you remember the\n twilight hours, when you sat on her knee,\n learned wondrous things from her? Do you\n remember your sickness, her soft and sweet\n tenderness? It is from her life that you\n dig gold and when she dies, is she nothing?\n Is it no matter, after her life is over, what\n becomes of the body, the fair form of your\n wife? She taught you the deepest lessons of\n love. Could you bear to see her cast out?\n Everything in a man revolts at that idea\n of the form that came to us as a temple\n of .God, sacred to us. Is it nothing to you\n where your baby sleeps? To desecrate that\n sacredness which we put upon things\u2014even\n things outworn\u2014seems blasphemous. Are\n these associations of the human body of no\n sanctity? And of no value whatsoever? Re\u00ac\n spect for one\u2019s body is a moral influence.\n Hold it in honor, therefore, in life, and for\n an honorable sepulcher in death. I pass\n over on to the artist\u2019s side, the poet\u2019s side,\n the prophet\u2019s side, and I discern, in the\n heavenly land, those whom I knew here. So\n the body becomes a kind of mnetechnic, or\n sort of emblem, or interpreter to us.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Then, having discussed the importance\n of the ashes, the sacredness of its dust,\n having insisted that it is the necessity of\n life that we should associate our dear\n ones with their graves and shrines, Mr.\n Beecher goes on to discuss another ques\u00ac\n tion, and in a single sentence determined\n my own view, that his shrine should be\n near Plymouth Church. \u201cWhat is there\n in science,\u201d he says, \u201cthat will help man\n in Greenwood. On one side it is a ground\n of wrecks, but in its nobler aspect it is\n more. Greenwood is to ten thousand\n thousand almost the opening of heaven\n itself, the very home of the heart. When I\n went back to Indianapolis, and would fain\n see my old parishioners, I was obliged to\n go to the beautiful cemetery that had been\n made there to find them. There they were,\n one by one (from the grave), I summoned\n them and they came. And when you go to\n Greenwood, do you never see the little chil\u00ac\n dren\u2019s burial ground there? An army of\n little cherubs? Are there no sounds\n there that are full of communications? Why,\n the very trees are full of murmuring mes\u00ac\n sages. The birds are singing, as it were,\n from afar, and are the voices of the gohe.\n That which makes Greenwood beautiful to\n us is not its science, but those glorious as\u00ac\n sociations which life has treasured up?\u201d And\n so, Mr. Beecher ends his plea for the sanity\n of the ashes, the importance of a shrine,\n with these words: \u201cThis respect for one\u2019s\n body and this desire that one\u2019s bones should\n rest amid congenial surroundings, are evi\u00ac\n dences of a very noble interior.\u201d In his Star\n Paper, he adds, concerning the grave of\n Bunyan and Wesley, that the place for a man\n to be buried is the place where a man has\n done his work. \u201cSo let us live,\u201d he adds,\n \u201cthat this body shall be itself a-cluster of\n associations and sanctities.\u201d When Mr,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0016/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 194, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0016/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 388, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 558}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0016/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 777, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1117}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0016/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1555, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2234}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0016/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3111, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4468}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0016/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/ec/he/rm/em/or/ia/la/00/un/se/beechermemoriala00unse/beechermemoriala00unse_0016.jp2", "height": 4468, "width": 3111, "levels": 6, "size": 1077200}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"16\">\n<p>\n 14\n</p>\n<p>\n TIIE BEECHER MEMORIAL,\n</p>\n<p>\n Beecher wrote this plea for the body, the\n importance of making those ashes a shrine,\n and said that the place for a man\u2019s burial\n should be the place where he had worked,\n he was then an old man.

Over against the Outlook affirmation\n that to build a shrine, to remove Mr.\n Beecher\u2019s ashes to Orange street, to\n feel any sacredness for the ashes\n of a hero, would be to bear per\u00ac\n petual testimony against Mr. Beecher\u2019s\n teaching, we set Mr. Beecher himself. And,\n the necessity of quoting Mr. Beecher is\n the stranger, by reason of this, that this\n sermon of Mr. Beecher\u2019s was published by\n the editor in the columns of the Christian\n Union, even as I shall now ask the Brooklyn\n papers to republish it, that Mr. Beecher\u2019s\n city may understand our desire to fulfill\n his wish.

It is obvi\u00ac\n ously impossible for the people of Plymouth\n Church to condemn this property and to pre\u00ac\n sent a public park to the people of Brook\u00ac\n lyn and New York. Thus far three-fourths\n of all the money that has been pledged has\n come from Plymouth Church, but the execu\u00ac\n tive committee believes that Mr. Beecher\u2019s\n name and work belong, not to one church,\n but to the churches; not to one denomina\u00ac\n tion. i\u00bbws to Christianity; not to the City\n oi Brooklyn, but to the towns and cities of\n the entire country. A man, formerly from\n Pittsburg, has just cabled a gift of $1,000\n for the movement from Colombo, Ceylon,\n and another from Bayfield, Wis., sent a gift\n of $500.\n</p>\n<p>\n We believe that there are 100 men in this\n country who owe to Mr. Beecher\u2019s sermons,\n lectures and books a debt which they can\n never repay, and who, having removed from\n New York to various cities and states, should\n emulate the example of these contributors.\n This Memorial Hall of Patriotism is to be\u00ac\n long to the people of Brooklyn and New\n York, to all citizens. Catholic and Protest\u00ac\n ant, Jew and Gentile, poor and rich alike.\n We hope there will be found in various parts\n of the country some men who will give $50,000\n or $20,000 or $10,000 each, more who will give\n $5,000 each, a hundred men who will give\n each, a thousand men who will give\n V50G, or $200. or $100, or $50 each. There are\n ministers and teachers and fathers and\n mothers who have received from Mr.\n Beecher words of comfort and inspiration,\n and if only they will not ask some one else\n to pay their debt, but will immediately sit\n down and send the committee $5 or $1 for\n themselves, the committee feels that it\n would have money enough to erect a series\n</p>\n<p>\n of buildings and memorials, and to carry on\n a national movement in the interests of the\n love of native land and country that would\n be of immeasurable benefit to this republic.\n One woman has already given $10,000, and\n the committee will gladly associate her\n name with one of these great paintings as\n her gift. The committee wishes it under\u00ac\n stood that it will associate the name of the\n donor with the window or painting, provid\u00ac\n ing only that it be understood that these\n windows represent a unit scheme planned\n for by artists of national repute. AH cor\u00ac\n respondence with reference to these matters\n will be in the hands of the art committee\n of the Beecher Memorial Fund.\n</p>\n<p>\n We earnestly commend this movement to\n the editors of all religious newspapers, to\n the weekly and daily papers of our country,\n to the editors of all magazines, to all teach\u00ac\n ers, priests and rabbis, to all teachers and\n professors in our schools and colleges. We\n would suggest that our young men and wom\u00ac\n en be urged to open again the pages of Mr.\n Beecher\u2019s Patriotic Addresses, containing\n orations absolutely unsurpassed in the his\u00ac\n tory of literature. We urge the republica\u00ac\n tion of his speeches in Great Britain that\n prevented the recognition of the South, con- '\n cerning which Mr. Lincoln once said that he\n wished the Secretary of War to ask Mr.\n Beecher to raise the flag at Fort Sumter be\u00ac\n cause, but for Mr. Beecher\u2019s speeches in\n England, there would have been no flag to\n raise. We would also suggest that the great\n clubs in our cities, political clubs and com\u00ac\n mercial clubs, set apart a night for the re\u00ac\n view of Mr. Beecher\u2019s career, his life and\n work. The committee will gladly put these\n clubs in the various cities in touch with\n men who will present such themes as \u201cThe\n Eloquence of Henry Ward Beecher,\u201d \u201cThe\n Peculiarity or the Genius of Beecher,\u201d \u201cMr.\n Beecher as an Exponent of Toleration and\n Charity,\u201d \u201cStories of Mr. Beecher\u2019s Wit and\n Humor, \" on \u201cThe Glory and the Sorrow of\n Mr. Beecher\u2019s Life\u201d\u2014themes that w e believe\n will offer an evening of unusual inspiration\n and instruction.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Rev. Dr. Frank W. Gunsaulus spoke\n as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n Address by\n</p>\n<p>\n %\n</p>\n<p>\n The Rev. Dr. Gunsaulus\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWith the echo of those eloquent words\n of Dr. Hillis, whom the generosity of the\n West gave to the benighted peoples of the\n East (laughter) still ringing in your ears\n I want to say to-night that I bring the\n heartiest concurrence of the Middle and\n Western States\u2014and the West to-night says\n to this great proposition, \u2018Yea and amen.\u2019\n (Applause.) It would be about time in the\n West to take a collection. (Laughter.)\n What you people will do here I do not know\n quite certainly, but I am sure that an\n audience like this in the West will be\n gathered within a few days and they will ask\n what you have done, not that they mean to\n do less, but because they shall exult and\n rejoice in the fact that Henry Ward Beecher\n belonged, not to the East or West, but\n to mankind and the world. (Applause.) He\n loved our part of the country and our part\n of the country loved him. He used to say\n he liked to get into the woods, for the soul\n of the naturalist, the spirit of the poet\n were all wakened again as he came into that\n \u25a0 W st where his youth dreamed dreams and\n where the deeper education of his heart and\n</p>\n<p>\n imagination was carried forward. I saw\n him once away out West and he stretched\n himself and sunned himself in those broad\n realms under those vast skies, and he said,\n \u2018There is something out here that widens and\n deepens and heightens me, and when I go\n home they are very glad indeed that I have\n gone West and have gotten back out of the\n West.\u2019 Well, there is an extensiveness that\n is very Beecher-like out there. I saw him\n once when he was in the West, and a man\n told him how hot it was a little farther\n South. Beecher was suffering from the\n density of the atmosphere, and this man\n told him that he ought to go South and see his\n ranch. \u2018Is it hotter there?\u2019 said Beecher.\n \u2018Yes,\u2019 said the man, \u2018it is so hot there that\n I have to go to San Francisco to get cracked\n ice to feed my hens with to keep them from\n laying boiled eggs.\u2019 (Laughter.) Mr.\n Beecher said that was an old story, but it\n had gained vastness and expansiveness which\n seemed to belong to the country he\n was in.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe believe in him in the West as an\n immortal son of God. The West is repre\u00ac\n sented here to-night by the distinguished\n jurist who has already spoken, who, if he\n were not so great in the law, would seem to\n me to be almost unapproachable in the\n Gospel, by the way in which he preached to\n us. (Applause.) This great jurist comes\n from a state which was redeemed from\n savagery and barbarism, its whole heart and\n conscience, lifted into the region of the\n throne of God by those Beecher Bibles. The\n boxes that contained them contained rifles\n and muskets, but they were called by the\n church militant and later by the church tri\u00ac\n umphant \u2018Beecher\u2019s Bibles.\u2019 It is that West\n that to-night listens as the telegraph wires\n shall report this great meeting. It is the\n West of John Brown. It is the West that\n stood shriveled before the curse of slavery,\n whose dark and forbidding figure came to\n drive out the spirit of liberty. It is that\n West once made up of territories over which,\n by the power of such men as Beecher, the\n curse and blight of liberty was forbidden to\n prevail. It is that West that stretches her\n great, warm hand to you to-night and with\n tears of gratitude to God says \u2018Let us at\n once go to work in the good Western w ' ay\n and build this shrine and memorial to\n Henry Ward Beecher. ' The West will like\n very much to come down here and see that\n there is a green spot in summer time on the\n Heights of Brooklyn. It will be a nice\n memorial to that green, beautiful West,\n out of whose bosom we gave to you Henry\n Ward Beecher. The birds will sing there as\n they used to sing in Lawrence Park in In\u00ac\n diana. The squirrels must play in the\n branches. All nature must open above this\n shrine, for it was Henry Ward Beecher\n more than any other poet\u2014naturalist, poet-\n orator, poet-preacher\u2014who gave to our\n thought an impulse in the direction Of nature\n study and nature interpretation. And as his\n friend, George Inness, gave new thoughts\n to the mind of man out of nature and left\n them depicted upon amazing canvases, the\n power of Beecher\u2019s sermons, carried with all\n the innocence of the sanctuary that fine in\u00ac\n terpretation of nature\u2019s heart that made\n one part of the divine revelation.

You\n know Mr. Beecher himself did not believe\n that the most juicy things of the world were\n sermons. You know the old story which\n Joseph Parker used to tell in London, with\n some assistance of the imagination, perhaps,\n how they went out to Princeton, that place\n least likely to interest Mr. Beecher\u2014how\n they visited Dr. Alexander, and how Mr.\n Beecher reminded him of his career in New\n York; and how Dr. Alexander showed him a\n beautiful cabinet in which were all the ser\u00ac\n mons of those years of his ministry in New\n York City. There they were, standing in\n stately form\u2014solemn enough, no doubt\u2014for\n the year 1848 and \u201949 and \u201950 and the rest,\n and he said, \u2018Mr. Beecher, this is a beautiful\n present made to me by some of my people.\u2019\n \u2018Yes,\u2019 said Beecher, \u2018I am glad to see this\n place.\u2019 \u2018Why?\u2019 said the doctor. \u2018Well, I\n am glad,\u2019 said Beecher, to know that this\n place is in existence. Dr. Alexander, if ever\n there is another flood I will start for this\n spot\u2014there will be one dry place.\u2019\n (Laughter.)\n</p>\n<p>\n The West gives to you to-night, my\n friends, after having duly celebrated the\n birth of Washington, perfectly confident that\n it is because of the existence of such men\n in our annals that we may expect, a round,\n full orbed, glorious Americanism. There is\n a sokemness about memoralizing such a char\u00ac\n acter as Beecher because of the variety of\n powers illustrated and inspired by a man\n whom Spurgeon described as \u201cthe most\n myriad minded man since Shakspeare.\u2019\u2019 It\n is of vast importance that in the forefront\n of our nation\u2019s annals there shall be a great\n statesman and a great soldier, like Washing\u00ac\n ton, the perfect roundness of whose char\u00ac\n acter, the completeness of whose powers, the\n fullness of whose manhood is such that we\n do not call.him a man of genius in this di\u00ac\n rection or that direction, but so thoroughly\n has he been said to represent the large sided\n common American\u2014the American at his best,\n with all the powers and all the energies\n gathered in one supreme personality\u2014that\n he is a kind of intellectual and spiritual\n fatherhood, and we ca]l him the Father of\n His Country. The West will be in favor of\n erecting this memorial, because it is a me\u00ac\n morial of one human life which was the ra\u00ac\n diance of a full orbed soul. Every American\n shall look up to Beecher and find the best of\n him accented and emphasized in the charac\u00ac\n ter of this heroic man. No instrumentality\n of the human soul, no agency of life, with\u00ac\n in the brain of an American that will not\n be strong and brought forth in majestic\n prophecy and influence by the very contem\u00ac\n plation of such a man. The wholesomeness\n comes from the wholeness, and the whole\u00ac\n ness is holiness, and holiness is health.\n \u201cWilt thou be made whole?\u201d said He in His\n ministry to the poor fragmentary humanity\n</p>\n<p>\n that thronged to His feet, \u201cWilt thou be\n made whole?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Western Enthusiasm Over the Memorial.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let me add to-night that it is the West\n which received with so much enthusiasm and\n joy a proposition like this, not only because\n of his influence upon its patriotism, but that\n we believe that he saw the truth when he\n said that all remedies in statesmanship, all\n methods of progress in pure politics, have\n their ground in religious sentiment and re\u00ac\n ligious ideas. He was a statesman, because\n he stood with the idea of the fatherhood of\n God and the brotherhood of man under which\n the flag was made so pure that it could not\n be floated in this land over the head of a\n bondman. (Applause.) So thoroughly did he\n believe in the proposition that institutions\n</p>\n<p>\n The Rev. Dr. E. W. Gunsaulus.\n</p>\n<p>\n belong to humanity and must serve humanity;\n that humanity does not belong to institu\u00ac\n tions, that it is not compelled to serve in\u00ac\n stitutions; that the question of questions be\u00ac\n fore every institution is, \u201cHow much d 0 you\n do in service for humanity?\u201d and saw that\n so clearly that the institution of slavery,\n with all its mass of arrogance, vanished be\u00ac\n fore the hand of himself and his compeers.\n He saw that liberty, true liberty, is a child\n of truth. He did not extract that opinion\n from long discussion or many volumes. With\n regard to liberty he saw it in One who said,\n \u201cYe shall know the truth and the truth shall\n make you free.\u201d He got at the truth about\n God, and men were no ' longer cringing\n slaves in the empire of the tyrant. He got\n at the truth with regard to man and man\n was not afraid of his brother. He got at the\n truth with regard to nature, and he saw a\n great reservoir of powers and potencies out\n of which man was to create the new day\n and the new world. Clearly, never did this\n man see the great truth of the absolute\n equality in privilege and opportunities of all\n men before any just government. He saw\n God\u2019s government. He saw that the great\n hour in the history of that government when\n its arm of power was most omnipotent was\n</p>\n<p>\n the hour of Calvary, when in Jesus of Nazar\u00ac\n eth God gave himself\u2014when love was God\n and God was love. He saw that that was\n the manifestation of God\u2019s theory of gov\u00ac\n ernment. He saw it so clearly that when\n black and white, bond and free, rich and\n poor, high and low, came to that one spot\n equal in necessity, equal in hope, equal in\n blessings he announced his sublime faith in\n the equality of all men before the law of\n their just human government. So to-nighjj\n I would bring here with joy and thanksgiv\u00ac\n ing all our whole country. He was a man\n whose political notions had such root in re\u00ac\n ligious enterprises and religious ideals that\n these theories cannot fade away. We are\n looking through all ages for men to inspire\n the race with such influences of pith and\n moment as Republicanism and Democracy.\n Mr. Beecher not only had the power to find\n great ideas and associate himself with them,\n but he had the power to associate himself\n with great men.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cNo voice to-night will speak praise of\n Mr. Beecher\u2019s relationship to one great man\n in this republic with more enthusiasm than\n the voice of the West. We remember when\n anarchy lifted its head in our states; when\n the red line of disorder was round about\n our city; w r hen false conceptions of respon\u00ac\n sibility urged their plea, paltry and small,\n upon Washington, insisting that there was\n no jurisdiction of a certain quality to put\n down riots and disorder in that city; that\n the mails of these great United States should\n be stopped in Cook County because we lacked\n the jurisdiction. Then it was that Beech\u00ac\n er\u2019s friend lifted up his voice and he told\n Chicago, while her heart was shivering in\n fear, and Illinois\u2019 Governor: \u2018We will settle\n the question of judisdiction later. Now there\n must be order in Chicago.\u2019 (Applause.)\n</p>\n<p>\n Days of Orators Not Past.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe are celebrating to-night, as we shall\n always celebrate, a great orator. We are\n told that religion is likely to fade. Not so\n long as men see this tomb. We are told\n that the days of great orators are past. Not\n so long as men can go to this shrine and\n hear the echo in their souls from this voice\n always perpetuated before the country.\n Think how this man, whose Anglo-Saxon\n blood rolled up in himself the history of\n eloquence and the history of freedom, think\n how this man held within his own brain\n all those movements of vast thought that\n lifted audiences to their feet, that had\n hushed the cry of tyranny and had spoken\n the music of patriotism. For those great\n state papers of the past in Anglo-Saxon his\u00ac\n tory were all of them the products of elo\u00ac\n quence. It was crystallized eloquence that\n gave to the world the treaty of Wexford.\n It was crystallized eloquence that enabled\n Alfred to write it. Behind the whole scene\n were the orators we do not know, and\n whose voices we ' may not hear, but the net\n result of whose enthusiasm is that memor\u00ac\n able treaty. There stood conservatives say\u00ac\n ing: \u2018This is the end.\u2019 There stood men like\n Beecher, saying: \u2018This is the stepping-stone\n to the future.\u2019 On that stone there stood\n the new race of orators, and the result of\n their eloquence was as much more sublime\n as the eloquence itself was more fine and\n exalted than that which preceded the treaty.\n Then, lo! came the Great Charter, when John\n at Runnymede signed it. \u00aeThere were men\n who said: \u2018This is the end surely.\u2019 But the\n radicalism of men like Beecher said: \u2018This\n is another stepping-stone forward.\u2019 And\n this will bring another race of orators with\n richer voice and larger scope of thouuh ' l\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0018/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 194, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0018/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 388, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 558}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0018/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 777, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1117}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0018/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1555, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2234}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0018/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3111, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4468}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0018/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/ec/he/rm/em/or/ia/la/00/un/se/beechermemoriala00unse/beechermemoriala00unse_0018.jp2", "height": 4468, "width": 3111, "levels": 6, "size": 1196418}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"18\">\n<p>\n 16\n</p>\n<p>\n THE BEECHER MEMORIAL\n</p>\n<p>\n and more ardent attack upon wrong.

And that wonderful walk from the\n church to the station, how can I ever for\u00ac\n get it? A carriage was waiting for him.\n He said to me after the lecture was over:\n \u2018Bradford, let the carriage go; come, walk\n with me.\u2019 It was a beautiful moonlight\n evening. He was in the melancholy mood\n which often characterized him. He threw\n his arm around my neck and walked all the\n way from the church to the station in that\n way, and just as we were leaving the church\n he said this: \u2018Just to think of it! I have\n been pastor of Plymouth Church for well\n nigh forty years; I shall not be much longer.\n I wonder who will be my successor.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAnd then I remember again being in the\n Plymouth Church when, in the midst of cir\u00ac\n cumstances of his most wonderful trial, he\n preached a sermon which possibly a few\n</p>\n<p>\n of you here may remember on \u2018Seek Ye\n First the Kingdom of God and His Right\u00ac\n eousness.\u2019 I have heard most of the great\n orators of the English speaking world who\n have lived during the last fifty years. 1\n never saw an audience moved in all my life\n M I saw the audience in this church. Every\n</p>\n<p>\n nook and corner of this great building was\n packed. It seemed as if the heads went\n down before the magnitude of that oratory\n as I have seen a field of wheat go down\n before a west wind.\n</p>\n<p>\n Beecher\u2019s Love for His Fellow Men.\n</p>\n<p>\n I think, if we were to ask ourselves what\n was the greatest characteristic in the life\n of Beecher, we should say it was his love\n</p>\n<p>\n The Rev. Willard P. Harmon,\n</p>\n<p>\n Assistant Pastor of Plymouth Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n for his fellow men, and there again he was\n a Puritan, a Puritan of the real old school.\n He believed in the fatherhood of God, and\n because he believed in the fatherhood of\n God he believed in the brotherhood of man.\n No man ever yet believed in the brotherhood\n of man and had a faith that would stand the\n test of time, who did not believe in the\n brotherhood because he believed in the\n fatherhood; no brotherhood without father\u00ac\n hood; we are brothers because we have a\n common Father; consequently Henry Ward\n Beecher was all the while preaching the\n fatherhood of God, and because he preached\n the fatherhood of God he preached the\n brotherhood of man. Oh, it seems to me we\n need some one like Beecher to come back\n again! Oh, for that glorious voice in these\n times! Oh, for the eloquence and bravery\n and enthusiasm of that man in these days\n when there is rising a tide of skepticism\n concerning brotherhood, when there are so\n many who say. We believe in brotherhood\n for the white man, we believe in brotherhood\n for men in our class, we believe in brother\u00ac\n hood for the rich, we believe in brotherhood\n for the poor, but we need some one to ring out\n so the echoes shall sound throughout the\n</p>\n<p>\n land, from ocean to ocean and around the\n world: \u201cWe have one flag and all we, black,\n white, red. yellow, rich, poor, we are all of\n one blood, all brothers.\u201d Do you doubt thar.\n Henry Ward Beecher would give to us that\n note in a way that we could not forget, it j f\n he were living now? I loved to see that eye\n flash fire. I loved to see him in that pulpit\n as he used to speak, running his hands\n through his hair and standing here and\n stamping his foot as he used to when he was\n thrilled with his own great thought\u2014plead\u00ac\n ing for a revival of the doctrine of brother\u00ac\n hood; no love for God except as that love for\n God is proven by our love for our fellow\n men. If you love not your brother whom you\n have seen, how can you love God whom you\n have not seen?\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cJust one other thought. Henry Ward\n Beecher was an optimist. Optimism is the\n monopoly of no class in the church or the\n nation. Henry Ward Beecher never be\u00ac\n lieved that God could be defeated. He\n preached a great deal on Epistle to the Ro\u00ac\n mans, almost more than from any other book\n of the Bible.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHe was a cdiild of the light and of the\n day. He loved truth and beauty as he hated\n lies % The great trunk of his life was im\u00ac\n bedded in the rock of his belief in God,\n which was a Puritan belief.

Horace Porter, assistant pastor,\n who has not been on the platform since he\n met with his accident about three years ago,\n also spoke.\n</p>\n<p>\n Tribute by\n</p>\n<p>\n The Rev. Horace Porter\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Anniversary memorials of Washington\n and Lincoln were in many places the nota\u00ac\n ble events of the past month. It is well\n that, following closely upon the tributes\n then paid to those great Americans, we\n should, on this 8th of March, the anniver\u00ac\n sary of his last earthly presence among us,\n recall and celebrate the life and deeds of\n that other great American \u2014 Henry Ward\n Beecher.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Beecher stood alone. Ah, how often was\n he alone, through his long and marvelous\n career. Almost alone ne stood the great,\n kindly friend of the slave, through long\n years of unpopular championship of that\n cause; as student in Amherst and in Lane\n Theological Seminary, and as minister in\n Indianapolis and in Brooklyn; even in Brook\u00ac\n lyn how he stood forth alone, among men\n and ministers of his time, for freedom among\n all men and for freedom among all churches.\n That ministers and churches should dare\n</p>\n<p>\n proclaim liberty to the captives; and that\n in national councils, slavery must be dealt\n with, not on mere makeshift compromises,\n but squarely on broad and high principles\n of Christian statesmanship.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" How much Beecher stood alone in those\n days, we of a younger generation can know\n only by going back to dig up the scathing\n criticism and opposition which he encoun\u00ac\n tered. and which reveal how utterly misun\u00ac\n derstood he often was in the loftiness of his\n principles and the breadth of his wisdom;\n and that his treatment of the great issues\n of the time was so deep set in the founda\u00ac\n tions of eternal truth and righteousness\n that Beecher could, indeed, dare stand alone,\n abiding the time when God\u2019s movements on\n earth would mightily justify the wisdom and\n the righteousness of his course.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" In theology Beecher stood alone, as often\n he did in politics. In things where to-day\n most ministers and many theologians (theo\u00ac\n logians are even slower than ministers), but\n where most would to-day stand with\n Beecher if one can imagine him as ever\n standing still long enough to be overtaken,\n he in his own day stood largely alone.\n</p>\n<p>\n Beecher the Prophet-Patriot of American\n History.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" As patriot and reformer Beecher had an\n intense love of country, together with a\n hatred of injustice and wrong if anything\n yet more intense. To the moral fire of Gar\u00ac\n rison and Phillips he added the sound com\u00ac\n mon sense of the common people at their\n best; the mental insight of a master intel\u00ac\n lect and steadfast adherence to the highest\n moral principle and religious ideals, which\n</p>\n<p>\n all, taken in their combination, made Henry\n Ward Beecher the great prophet-patriot of\n American history.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Porter quoted the address of Mr.\n Beecher at the May communion in 1858,\n which was recently published, and concluded\n as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" To-night, in the light of history, and in\n the light of this church\u2019s present life, we\n may declare that the impartial tribunal to\n which Beecher appealed, is finding that this\n church was indeed founded in love, and that\n it still stands \u2018notable and noticed\u2019 among\n men for the love of its members one for\n another. As a humble member of this church\n I stand here to-night to testify as few others\n have had opportunity and need to do, of the\n depth and the tenderness and the unfailing\n ministry of this church\u2019s love. And\n</p>\n<p>\n \" May we as a church indeed arouse our\u00ac\n selves to do for Beecher\u2019s memory something\n adequate to express what he did, and by his\n undying influence, still does for this church.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" May the City of Brooklyn that he so loved\n and on which he shed such glory, do as a\n city something worthy of her greatest citi\u00ac\n zen.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" And may the people of this nation, grate\u00ac\n fully remembering his gigantic labors for the\n nation\u2019s life, generously co-operate to help\n keep forever fresh and green the memory of\n Henry Ward Beecher, the American prophet-\n patriot.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It w r as expected that some of the speakers\n at the Academy would also speak at Plym\u00ac\n outh, but the time was too much occupied\n there to permit of it, and after the singing\n of tw ' o or three hymns the audience was dis\u00ac\n missed.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Fund After the Academy Meeting\n</p>\n<p>\n [Prom the Brooklyn Dally Eagle, Monday, March\n 16, 1903.]\n</p>\n<p>\n The Beecher memorial fund is growing\n daily, new subscriptions being constantly\n received. Subscriptions will be received\n by the Eagle. The executive committee, of\n which Elijah R. Kennedy is chairman, re\u00ac\n quests that checks be drawn to the order of\n Theodore F.

The story is\n the account of the occasion at the Acad\u00ac\n emy, last night (March 8). The audience\n was measured by the capacity of the\n edifice. There are larger buildings, but\n none anywhere better lends itself to the\n comfort of a multitude. None makes\n numbers more impressive to the vision\n or more stirring to the thought. None\n makes listening more pleasant or oratory\n more easy.\n</p>\n<p>\n Besides, the Academy is historically\n identified with many a commanding\n cause or issue in Brooklyn. It is most\n identified with the best. It is the birth\u00ac\n place or baptismal font of not a few fine\n endeavors. Its intellectual and emotional\n hold on Brooklyn is such as to make the\n occasional proposition of its sacrifice to\n commercial uses a shock to every mind\n of sensibility.\n</p>\n<p>\n In truth, not the least value of the\n occasion of Sunday night will be found\n in the strengthening of the sentiment that\n the Academy should be preserved for\n the purposes it has served and which\n have honored it in the past here. It\n will be harder\u2014it should be impossible\u2014\n after the occurrence of last night, and\n under the memory of it, to contemplate\n or tolerate the idea of the Academy\n changing its function in this community.\n</p>\n<p>\n This thought\u2014a thought which should\n be, which, we think, is in the mind of\n every person who was present last night\u2014\n sympathetically laps over on the purpose\n of the Academy demonstration. That\n was the insurance of the permanency of\n another and of an older plant of mental,\n moral and spiritual power in Brooklyn,\n by the happy intention to add to the\n Plymouth Church a Memorial which will\n always beautifully and educationally vi\u00ac\n talize the name and the work of Henry\n Ward Beecher. The several accordant\n forms and forces which that Memorial\n will assume need not be re-told here.\n They are contained and commended in\n the account of the meeting.\n</p>\n<p>\n By the uninformed and by the cynical\n Brooklyn is rated to be persistently pro\u00ac\n vincial or incurably local. That error\n cannot be wholly stopped. But last night\n should make the vogue of it less and\n the truthfulness of it doubtful for the\n future. National and international tribute\n was then paid to a man of Brooklyn who\n was recognized as an universal man. Ilis\n roots were here, but the strength he had\n and gave forth, and the inflences out\u00ac\n working from it, were so signal that it\n can be. not irreverently, said his lines\n went out through all the earth and his\n words unto the ends of the world. Dr.\n Hillis reported the testimony of some of\n the great minds of Christendom to that\n effect. His statement was clinched by a\n</p>\n<p>\n concurrence of American commendation\n that was unique. Dr. Hillis also did\n more. He frankly and bravely met the\n sometimes debated proposition to remove\n the bodies of Mr. and Mrs. Beecher from\n where they were placed to within a suit\u00ac\n able section of the proposed Memorial\n building. He showed that the idea was\n projected by Mr. Beecher himself, in an\n almost prophetic forecast of his own\n death. That was one of the most re\u00ac\n markable incidents of this remarkable\n meeting. Apropos of the proposition, the\n Eagle, on knowledge, is able explicitly\n to announce that the surviving relatives\n of Henry Ward Beecher approve the idea\n of the transfer of his body and of that\n of liis wife, as suggested by Dr. Hillis,\n and as contemplated by the movement\n now under way. They 7 not only approve\n of it, but they are grateful for it.\n</p>\n<p>\n But to the meeting a little in detail:\n Unable to be present himself, the Presi\u00ac\n dent of the United States, weeks ago,\n sent a salutation to the occasion and\n consented to the use of his name at the\n head of the general committee.\n</p>\n<p>\n The only living predecessor of the\n President, Grover Cleveland, made the\n first formal address.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Supreme Court of the United\n States was represented among the orators\n by one of its great Justices.\n</p>\n<p>\n The most brilliant orator of Congrega\u00ac\n tional Independency in the great middle\n West joined his heart to the cause.\n</p>\n<p>\n Brooklyn welcomed these men and sur\u00ac\n rendered the occasion to them. Brook\u00ac\n lyn but furnished the audience. Beecher,\n a precious asset of Brooklyn, held in\n trust for the race, was the theme. The\n chief spokesmen were not of Brooklyn.\n They incarnated the mind and heart of\n tlie nation. They represented the par\u00ac\n liament of man and the federation of the\n world. Nothing could have been more\n fitting. The opening proceedings were\n in absolutely correct taste. A distin\u00ac\n guished divine of Georgia, led in the in\u00ac\n vocation, called the Lord\u2019s Prayer, be\u00ac\n cause it is the prayer of all His people.\n A clergyman from Berlin, the seat of\n the nation of Luther, followed with the\n sweetest o < \u2018 David ' s psalms. The execu\u00ac\n tive of the city, Brooklyn born and.\n Brooklyn reared, the best chief magis\u00ac\n trate Brooklyn ever had. took the chair\n and employed those right words which\n carried In them the satisfaction supplied\n by the mayoralty of a scholar and a gen\u00ac\n tleman.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then followed the tenderest exhibition\n of the heart and of the mind of Grover\n Cleveland ever publicly revealed. There\n was behind his words and between his\n lines more than may have been real\u00ac\n ized. The note he sounded was broad,\n wise, fine, dominant. It was as catholic\n as it was gentle, as judicious as it was\n</p>\n<p>\n earnest, as commendable to men of every\n creed as it was to men of none. It was\n of the pure gold of essential religion and\n idealized humanity. It will be the model\n and the inspiration of all that will be\n w\u2019ell said on the Memorial, till it shall\n be completed with shoutings of grace,\n grace unto it!\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Justice Brewer succeeded Mr.\n Cleveland with a tribute which united\n learning and wisdom in equal measure.\n His stately 7 simplicity of diction, his ac\u00ac\n curate analysis, his warming eloquence\n and his Infusion of all with the quality\n of refined humor made his address a\n delight.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the few and fit words, to explain\n the scope and intent of the movement,\n Dr. Hillis was at his best. His plea and\n his personality united in the production\n of a high effect.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Gunsaulus closed the speaking w 7 ith\n a brilliant statement of the debt of the\n world to the epoch-making power of ora\u00ac\n tory. He has himself increased that\n debt. Every illustration or instance\n which lie employed w 7 as wrought up to a\n suggestion of Mr. Beecher\u2019s contribu\u00ac\n tion to causes by oratory and of the\n world\u2019s debt to him because of his ora\u00ac\n tory 7 . The world\u2019s debt to oratory is\n second only to its debt to literature. What\n Beecher\u2019s oratory has of itself added to\n literature Dr. Hillis\u2019 wonderful citations,\n which his delivery of them enhanced,\n superbly showed.\n</p>\n<p>\n This, with the familiar hymns and with\n the spontaneous outpouring of money for\n the Memorial, brought a remarkable oc\u00ac\n casion to an end. Those w 7 ho only read\n it will have to nobler living and to\n grander thinking an incitement which\n should suffice. But they can covet, with\u00ac\n out violating the Tenth Commandment,\n tlie greater pleasure of those who heard\n what was said. Reading will be arous\u00ac\n ing. But hearing was heartening. Not\n a single* mistake was made amid all the\n liabilities of mistake with which such\n an event is surcharged. Negative praise\n this, but high praise as well.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Memorial will be secured. Tlie\n movement has been inaugurated, an\u00ac\n nounced, launched, whichever word one\n may choose, under auspices of a char\u00ac\n acter almost as historical as the move\u00ac\n ment itself. The reception of it was un\u00ac\n mistakably favorable. The certainty of\n its growth and of its progress to success\n is evident. Tlie facts set forth in (he\n Eagle to-day will not be without influence\n : n accomplishing the result, and the\n Eagle is glad to sustain a relation of\n help and to become a vehicle of hope, in\n a cause entitled, as Abraham Lincoln\n said of another movement, \u201cTo the con\u00ac\n siderate judgment of mankind and to ih*\n gracious favor of Almighty God.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0023/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 197, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 280}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0023/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 394, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 560}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0023/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 789, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1121}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0023/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1579, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2242}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0023/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4484}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0023/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/ec/he/rm/em/or/ia/la/00/un/se/beechermemoriala00unse/beechermemoriala00unse_0023.jp2", "height": 4484, "width": 3159, "levels": 6, "size": 1008144}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"23\">\n<p>\n Expressions of Public Opinion\n</p>\n<p>\n A Tribute From the Heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n [From the Boston Herald (Ind.)].\n</p>\n<p>\n Grover Cleveland\u2019s tribute to Henry\n Ward Beecher reads as If it came right\n from the heart, particularly that portion of\n It in which reference is made to the time\n when afflictions came upon the great\n preacher and when he felt the cruel sting\n of man\u2019s malice and ingratitude.

It has suited the purpose\n of enemies in his own party to depict Mr.\n Cleveland as a monster of cold-blooded sel\u00ac\n fishness, incapable of a generous emotion.\n</p>\n<p>\n The fact is that he has a lot of human\n nature in him, just as Mr. Beecher had.\n The son of a Presbyterian minister, brought\n up in a parsonage and on the catechism, he\n has a substratum of religiousness in him\n which has survived many years of politics.\n A strong man, his likes and dislikes are\n strong. Exceptional men either attract or\n repel one another. In the case of Mr.\n Beecher and Mr. Cleveland the attraction was\n immediate and powerful. Mr. Beecher and\n his wife were good friends to Mr. Cleveland\n in 1384. He was grateful then, and he is\n grateful now. Probably one or two of the\n things he said in his speech Sunday night\n will give offense to Southerners who retain\n the old mistaken idea of Henry Ward\n Beecher, and probably Grover Cleveland did\n not give a.thought to the effect of the speech\n upon his personal popularity\u2014one way or the\n other. He was there to talk about his friend.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Cleveland\u2019s Sole Purpose.\n</p>\n<p>\n [From the Springfield Republican (Ind.)].\n</p>\n<p>\n The newspaper fakiring which has come to\n attend upon ex-President Grover Cleveland\u2019s\n visit to New York has grown familiar, not\n to say wearisome. It was the New York\n Press which exploited yesterday Mr. Cleve\u00ac\n land\u2019s cordial part In the Henry Ward Beech\u00ac\n er meeting in Brooklyn on Sunday as ac\u00ac\n companied by covert and important scheming\n</p>\n<p>\n with other influential Democrats. All this\n was concocted in cold ' blood, but it became\n necessary for the other papers to ask Mr.\n Cleveland about it, and he was quite ready\n to talk. His reply was frank and compre\u00ac\n hensive, as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI came solely for the purpose of attending\n the Beecher memorial meeting in Brooklyn\n last night. The reports that I had a political\n talk with Edward M. Shepard, William C.\n Whitney and others are untrue. I am not in\n politics. I am out for good. I only saw Mr.\n Shepard last night for two minutes, and poli\u00ac\n tics did not figure in our conversation. Poli\u00ac\n tics is furthest from my thoughts at present,\n although I am always ready to act in an ad\u00ac\n visory capacity, if so desired. As for taking\n any active part in politics, that is not to be\n considered. The objects of my visit to New\n York are always reported wrong.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Pray let all the quidnuncs accept this\n statement of the ex-President at its face\n value. But if they will not do so, let the\n public understand the truth when it is given\n to them. It will save the readers of newspa\u00ac\n pers from spending time In reading political\n prognostications that have no basis in fact.\n The ex-President is now \" the sage of Prince\u00ac\n ton,\u201d ready to advise his party along safe\n and sound lines, as he sees them, but not to\n lead through another candidacy, or the\n thought of one. We are told that the ex-\n President was given a great welcome in\n Brooklyn. \" As he walked upon the stage\n he saw the immense audience rise and ap\u00ac\n plaud, and again, when he was introduced,\n such was the ovation that his opening words\n were unheard.\u201d Rev. Dr. F. W. Gunsaulus\n of Chicago made a telling allusion to the ex-\n President, which was so long applauded that\n Mr. Cleveland was obliged to arise and bow\n again and again.\n</p>\n<p>\n Should Have Been Done Before This.\n</p>\n<p>\n [From the Toledo Blade (Rep.)]\n</p>\n<p>\n The movement inaugurated at Brooklyn for\n a monument to Henry Ward Beecher makes\n one wonder why it was not taken up years\n ago. Mr. Beecher was an unique personality.\n He impressed himself deeply upon the stir\u00ac\n ring times in which he lived, especially dur\u00ac\n ing the years of the anti-slavery struggle and\n of the Civil War. His splendid services to\n the cause of the Union in the dark days of\n the latter alone deserve an enduring monu\u00ac\n ment at the hands of the American people.\n It was no small thing for one man to go to\n England, and by his magnetic eloquence and\n vivid presentation of facts work a revolution\n in public opinion there in favor of the cause\n of the Union. Yet Henry Ward Beecher did\n that successfully. In his pulpit, his powerful\n oratory was a stimulus to thousands of\n young men, and the tribute paid him by ex-\n President Cleveland is heartily indorsed by\n thousands of others to whom Beecher\u2019s ser\u00ac\n mons were an inspiration to higher living\n and more earnest effort. The influence of\n Beecher on the generation in which he lived\n was mighty and uplifting: and the appeal\n made at the recent meeting for funds to\n erect a suitable memorial will meet with\n generous responses from all over the coun\u00ac\n try.\n</p>\n<p>\n Beecher\u2019s Influence Can Never Die.\n</p>\n<p>\n [From the Rochester Democrat and Chronicle\n (Rep.)]\n</p>\n<p>\n The great mass meeting held in the\n Brooklyn Academy of Music Sunday evening\n to further the movement for a memorial In\n honor of Henry Ward Beecher showed by\n the large attendance and the earnest feeling\n and utterances of the speakers how strong a\n hold the great Plymouth preacher and cham\u00ac\n pion of human freedom still has on the\n hearts of the American people. Former\n President Grover Cleveland never spoke to\n better advantage, with greater warmth of\n sentiment and eloquence of speech than he\n did on this occasion. He showed that he,\n like hundreds of thousands of other men who,\n as young men, were stimulated by Mr.\n Beecher ' s powerful oratory, had his own\n personal reasons for remembering the ap\u00ac\n peals from Plymouth pulpit to a broad and\n noble manhood to which he listened when a\n youth.\n</p>\n<p>\n The speeches of Justice Brewer, of Mayor\n Low and of Dr. Hillis, the present pastor of\n Plymouth Church, were all lofty, earnest and\n sincere in their tributes to Mr. Beecher\u2019s\n memory.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some generous contributions to the pro\u00ac\n posed memorial fund have already been\n made, and it is probable that as the appeal\n of Sunday evening is heard throughout the\n land many Americans in the Far West, as\n well as in thv East, and possibly in the\n South, will be moved by their recollections\n of Mr. Beecher\u2019s splendid services to the\n republic and humanity to respond with a\n liberal hand.\n</p>\n<p>\n The personality of Henry Ward Beecher\n was, perhaps, the most widely impressive of\n any in his generation. He was a tremendous\n storage battery of feeling, of sympathy, of\n subtle persuasiveness and of intellectual\n force. He aroused antagonism sometimes\n by his fearless championship of causes, but\n his personal presence possessed an almost\n universal and resistless charm which drew\n hearts to him as iron filings are drawn and\n attached to a magnet. The influence of such\n a man can never die in the lives of his own\n generation, and must be passed on to many\n generations that will follow him.\n</p>\n<p>\n Inspired by His Subject.\n</p>\n<p>\n [From the Salt Lake Tribune (Ind.

His very persist\u00ac\n ence in his policies seemed not so much the\n energy of a man as the inertia of a granite\n rock which simply planted itself and might\n be destroyed, but could not be moved.\n</p>\n<p>\n His public services, while they won that\n tribute of respect which steadfast power al\u00ac\n ways compels, never aroused affection. On\n at least two occasions he was seen to stand\n as a stone wall between his country and\n danger, but still he seemed rather wall than\n man.\n</p>\n<p>\n But the mass meeting held on Sunday in\n Brooklyn to promote a memorial to Henry\n Ward Beecher served to bring forward Mr.\n Cleveland in a light so new as to be to\n many almost bewildering. For in his ad\u00ac\n dress there Mr. Cleveland showed himself\n to be capable not only of convictions as to\n mankind at large, but also of a personal\n enthusiasm for a particular man and his\n memory.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI am not here for the purpose only,\u201d he\n began, \u2018\u2018of giving voice to a grateful recol\u00ac\n lection, nor solely to acknowledge the per\u00ac\n sonal benefit and service I have received\n from the illustrious dead.

Heretofore Grover Cleveland\n has seemed to have no hero. That he has\n one, and so worthy a one as Henry Ward\n Beecher, will be grateful news to his fellow\n citizens.\n</p>\n<p>\n The discovery seems in a way to humanize\n</p>\n<p>\n Grover Cleveland, and to put him in a light\n which shows him as not only a statesman\n whose services to his country must com\u00ac\n mand esteem, but also as a man deserving\n of affection.\n</p>\n<p>\n A Voice From Montana.\n</p>\n<p>\n [From the Anaconda (Mont.) Standard (Ind.).]\n</p>\n<p>\n There is more than common merit in the\n address delivered last night by Grover\n Cleveland. The occasion was a meeting held\n in Broklyn. The purpose of the meeting\n was to awaken interest in the Beecher\n memorial which, perhaps, will take the\n form of an added feature to Plymouth\n Church or an annex, founded for some use\u00ac\n ful purpose, under the auspices of that\n church.\n</p>\n<p>\n As a rule, Mr. Cleveland is not an enter\u00ac\n taining writer. He is apt to be turgid in\n his style, to write tediously interwoven\n sentences is characteristic of him, and his\n diction is not especially good. His Beecher\n memorial address, printed in the Standard\n this morning, is quite unlike Mr. Cleveland\n in respect to many of the features that\n usually distinguish his style in speech or\n writing. But it is an appropriate address,\n concisely put together, suggestive and in\u00ac\n teresting.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some time ago the suggestion was made\n that, in connection with the proposed memo\u00ac\n rial, the ashes of Beecher be removed from\n their resting place, in a retired spot in\n Greenwood, and that they he placed in some\n suitable receptacle in the memorial that is\n to be built. Mr. Cleveland quoted from the\n words of Beecher, in reference to the shrine\n the famous preacher and orator himself\n might choose.\n</p>\n<p>\n ,It was possible, however, to have quoted\n last night a sentiment more closely ex\u00ac\n pressive of Mr. Beecher\u2019s preference. Thi?\n would show that he would, wer < > he living\n not prefer the transfer of his burial place\n that has been proposed. Once he exclaimed\n In mention of Greenwood: \u2018\u2018Blessed portal*\n Only within these bounds do we seem to re\u00ac\n ceive from nature those lessons of death\n which we refuse to learn of Christianity.\n The very hills of life are here! Yonder,\n where men live; is only noise and dust, heat\n and smoke, canker and care! But here every\n curve and slope speaks of beauty and peace.\n Almost only here the sun falls tranquilly\n and flowers thrive and winds make harps of\n every tree, and birds, unblemished and un\u00ac\n terrified, rejoice. Surely these are the vales\n that speak of life! Cne must needs smile,\n and, in spite of our perverse education, feel\n some joy here as we lay down the weary\n body to its rest.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n And to this quoted paragraph should be\n added the words, uttered directly afterward,\n in which Mr. Beecher said: \u201cOh, may the\n sun pierce through the shade of trees, dear\n to many birds, to fall in checkered light upon\n my grave! I ask no stone or inscription.\n May flowers be the only memorials of my\n grave, renewed every spring and maintained\n through the long summer.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Beecher\u2019s Chivalrous Advocacy of Cleve\u00ac\n land.\n</p>\n<p>\n [From the Indianapolis News (Dem.).]\n</p>\n<p>\n In his address at the Beecher memorial\n meeting, last Sunday, Mr. Cleveland said\n many excellent things. There is no doubt\n that he felt a sense of personal obligation to\n the great Brooklyn preacher. No one who\n remembers the famous campaign of 1884 can\n ever forget the magnificent and chivalric ad\u00ac\n vocacy by Mr. Beecher of the candidacy of\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Cleveland. No more effective speeche-s\n wore made that summer on either side, and\n we do not believe that any other man at\u00ac\n tained the pitch of eloquence reached by Mr.\n Beecher. With all the earnestness, fire and\n power of his strong nature, he championed\n the cause of the Democratic candidate. His\n speeches undoubtedly helped to save New\n York to Mr. Cleveland. If that is so Mr.\n Cleveland owes to Beecher the chance that\n came to him to serve the country and to\n show to the people his great capacity and\n patriotism.\n</p>\n<p>\n But, of course, the speech of Sunday last\n was not made for the purpose of paying a\n debt. It was rather a tribute made by a man\n who, in a sense, represents the whole coun\u00ac\n try, to a man who greatly served the whole\n country. Mr. Cleveland spoke for all of us.\n And he said nothing truer than this:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLet us believe that there is no sadder\n symptom of a generation\u2019s bad moral health\n than its lack of faith in its great men, and\n its loss of reverence for its heroes, but let\n this be coupied with the reservation that\n those called great shall be truly great, and\n that the heroes challenging our reverence\n shall be truly heroic, measured by standards\n adjusted to the highest moral conditions of\n man\u2019s civilization.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Two charges are brought against democ\u00ac\n racies\u2014one is that they do not admit the\n existence of great men, do not care for them,\n and that their tendency is to crush out In\u00ac\n dividuality, and the second is that they are\n easily deceived in their heroes. We do not\n believe that either charge can be substan\u00ac\n tiated. All people, no matter what may be\n their form of government, are prone to be\n jealous of greatness ,and most men are easi\u00ac\n ly deceived. The failings are those, not of\n democracy, but of humanity. But at least\n the American people made no mistake about\n Beecher. He was indeed one of the great\u00ac\n est men that the country has produced. And\n to few men was it given to serve the state\n as signally and nobly. His church was the\n source of an inspiration that was felt every\u00ac\n where through the land. His sermons were\n appeals to all that was best in human nature.\n He had a direct relation to public affairs,\n and in lectures and addresses as well as in\n sermons he discussed the great issues of the\n day\u2014or rather the great issue, siAce slavery\n was the only issue there was\u2014in the most\n forcible and enlightening way. -Speaking of\n his more conspicuous services Mr. Cleveland\n said:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Our hero, in the days of his country\u2019s\n danger and trial, challenged all comers in\n defense of our national safety and unity.\n He stood like a rock against doubters at\n home, and he confronted angry, threatening\n throngs abroad with a steady, unyielding\n courage which wrought triumphs for his\n country and for its consecration to manhood\n freedom not less important than those of\n an army with banners.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Fef people of this generation realize\u2014\n or indeed know anything about\u2014what Mr.\n Beecher did for the cause of the Union in\n England. It is a brave story. But the key\n to his whole life was his desire to be of use\n to mankind. And it is this thought that Mr.\n Cleveland makes clear. Now at last it is\n proposed to build a memorial to this great\n man. It is time. We cannot afford to neg\u00ac\n lect or forget our great men. And how\u00ac\n ever great a man may be he Is in danger of\n being forgotten if he leaves little behind\n him but the memory of the spoken word.\n The whole country ought to be deeply inter\u00ac\n ested in the Beecher memorial.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0025/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 197, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 280}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0025/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 394, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 560}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0025/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 789, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1121}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0025/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1579, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2242}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0025/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4484}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0025/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/ec/he/rm/em/or/ia/la/00/un/se/beechermemoriala00unse/beechermemoriala00unse_0025.jp2", "height": 4484, "width": 3159, "levels": 6, "size": 1087268}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"25\">\n<p>\n THE BEECHER MEMORIAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n 23\n</p>\n<p>\n Beecher the Shakspeare of the Pulpit.\n</p>\n<p>\n [From the Boston Journal (Ind.).]\n</p>\n<p>\n While they are making ready, and that\n none too soon, for raising a monument to\n the memory of Henry Ward Beecher, at his\n old altars in Plymouth Church, in Brooklyn,\n there is a breathing spell to contemplate the\n Christianity of the new world in its present\n aspects, in its antecedents and in its out\u00ac\n looks.\n</p>\n<p>\n In our judgment Henry Ward Beecher is\n easily the Shakspeare of the world ' s pulpit.\n Sympathetic, dramatic intuitive, imagina\u00ac\n tive, resourceful\u2014Beecher is the evangelist\n who breaks all sectarian barriers and pre\u00ac\n sents the universality of what sects supply in\n segments.\n</p>\n<p>\n Beecher appealed to rich and poor, free and\n bond, learned and illiterate. He was an\n actor who embodied the part and then sus\u00ac\n tained it. He was a poet who saw the real\n objective secret and then gave it out as a\n message of objective and vital concern.

Since\n Beecher\u2019s death we have had at least one\n prophet; we reverently pronounce the name\n of Phillips Brooks.\n</p>\n<p>\n For denunciation, the world of the twenti\u00ac\n eth .century requires annunciation which it\n got In the first century.\n</p>\n<p>\n Henry Ward Beecher was critical, but con\u00ac\n structive. He invoked no ancient and per\u00ac\n emptory annals. He had no use for old\n junk in a platform. He could see the old\n truth and vitalize it in a new body. He\n easily held the people in the palm of his\n spontaneous benediction. They hung on his\n words; they went out to a larger empire\u2014\n the Empire of Self.\n</p>\n<p>\n We need to-day a more resolute social\n touch, a broader humane horizon. We are\n eaten up of the class bias, of the idolatry\n of the present moment.\n</p>\n<p>\n A prophet is due, yea, overdue; he must be\n</p>\n<p>\n now preparing. May he hasten out of the\n wilderness; for do not the masses anxiously\n await him? He must not only be void of\n demagogy, but he must be devoid of dogma.\n</p>\n<p>\n Whether sin is merely naughty or whether\n we have chances through or after Purgatory,\n or whether Draper found error in searching\n for truth, is of slight moment compared to\n the question: What shall we do to be saved\n just now\u2014saved from economic and social\n blunders, saved from servility to indigna\u00ac\n tion, saved unto sweet and sympathetic\n service?\n</p>\n<p>\n At Last We See the Real Cleveland.\n</p>\n<p>\n [From the Philadelphia Public Ledger (Ind.)].\n</p>\n<p>\n The popular demonstrations which have\n marked the recent public appearances, and\n even some of the private journeys, of Grover\n Cleveland reached a notable climax in the\n ovation spontaneously tendered the ex-\n President in the Brooklyn Academy of Music\n on Sunday evening. A meeting gathered to\n consider means for honoring the memory of\n Henry Ward Beecher turned again and again\n from its purpose under a realization of the\n presence of a living hero; successive speak\u00ac\n ers departed from their premeditated ad\u00ac\n dresses to pay him tribute, and every men\u00ac\n tion of his name evoked outbursts of enthu\u00ac\n siasm from the great audience. The propor\u00ac\n tions of the ovation, together with the na\u00ac\n ture and source of the eulogies which it ap\u00ac\n plauded, constituted a signal proof of the\n new and really phenomenal regard in which\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Cleveland has long been under the\n cloud of misunderstanding. He left office\n politically a well nigh friendless man, re\u00ac\n jected by the controlling element of his own\n party, and never, of course, given more than\n a grudging and left handed sort of commen\u00ac\n dation by ' the other. It is likely that Mr.\n Cleveland has suffered under the injustice\n and ingratitude of public opinion\u2014though\n no word of bitterness has escaped him. In\n the years that have elapsed since his\n retirement, it has never happened to be the\n interest of any political group to champion\n his just claims to public regard, neither have\n events engaged in any happy conspiracy to\n rehabilitate his fame. What has happened\n has happened undramatically, slowly, spon\u00ac\n taneously. Mr. Cleveland has emerged. The\n innate excellence of his character and the\n essential merit of his acts have quietly is\u00ac\n sued from eclipse. Slowly there has gath\u00ac\n ered in the public consciousness an appre\u00ac\n ciation of the fine integrity of the man, his\n sturdy honesty, his unspectacular but none\n the less splendid courage. Events have re\u00ac\n ceded, perspectives have altered, passions\n have died out, and at last the country very\n generally and with a singular forgetfulness\n of partisan prejudices sees in Grover Cleve\u00ac\n land, in the phrase of Justice Brewer\u2019s ex\u00ac\n temporaneous encomium, a man \u201cwhose\n stanch support of public honesty and of na\u00ac\n tional financial responsibility have glorified\n the history of this republic.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Beecher a Grand Figure.\n</p>\n<p>\n [From the Florida Times-Union (Dem.).]\n</p>\n<p>\n In his eulogy on Henry Ward Beecher\n President Cleveland is only paying his debts.\n Mr. Beecher championed his cause in 1884,\n when he was attacked with especial viru\u00ac\n lence by most of the leaders of religious\n opinion, though to champion it he had to\n fight the party with which he had affiliated\n for years. Too much cannot be said of the\n grandeur of Mr. Beecher\u2019s intellect. He was\n one of the most colossal figures of the cen\u00ac\n tury in which he lived.\n</p>\n<p>\n Should Meet With a Generous Support.\n</p>\n<p>\n [From the Minneapolis Times (Ind.)]\n</p>\n<p>\n The plan of a memorial to Henry Ward\n Beecher will probably meet with a generaus\n support. Beecher was one of the few orators\n whose magnetism stays with his hearers.\n The people who heard Beecher in his days\n of prime and greatest eloquence retain the\n memory of the man even as much as the\n recollection of his words. It would be a\n chance, however, it Beecher were to come\n back to his old place, whether the old power\n would be so impressive. This is such a\n blase world and, worst of all, it has not a\n great cause now to arouse the energies of\n any orator. Beecher was pre-eminently an\n optimist, with a constructive energy that\n seized on a great idea and built structures\n out of it so beautiful that there was nothing\n to do but to admire the result and make a\n fine creator out of the builder. And now his\n old hearers would raise him a temple.\n</p>\n<p>\n An Eloquent Reminder of the Greatest\n Preacher.\n</p>\n<p>\n [From the Chicago Record-Herald (Ind.).]\n</p>\n<p>\n The tribute of former President Grover\n Cleveland to the life and work of Henry\n Ward Beecher, tender in sentiment and most\n eloquently phrased, recalls to the public\n mind and conscience the debt of his coun\u00ac\n trymen to the world\u2019s greatest preacher.\n</p>\n<p>\n The graceful encomium that fell from the\n lips of the ex-President was not needed to\n fix the place of the great preacher in the\n annals of the Union, which he helped to\n save, or in the hearts of the thousands who\n at one time or another came within the\n range of his voice or influence. That place\n is fixed for all time. The fame of Beecher\n is secure. The popular conviction that he\n was the greatest pulpit orator the world\n has ever seen, that he profoundly influ\u00ac\n enced the political and religious thought\n of his time, that he turned the tide of senti\u00ac\n ment in Europe from hostility to friend\u00ac\n ship for the Union cause in time of war,\n grows stronger and deeper as the years\n roll by.\n</p>\n<p>\n At the same time It is well that the fer\u00ac\n vent testimonial of such a sturdy and seri\u00ac\n ous-minded personality as that of the ex-\n President should be invoked to remind us\n of our obligation to establish some endur\u00ac\n ing memorial of Beecher. It is proposed\n to make this memorial take the form of a\n public park in Brooklyn, to include Plym\u00ac\n outh Church, also a great hall to contain\n the pulpit from which he sold the slave\n girl, together with a hundred or more other\n mementoes suggestive of the various pe\u00ac\n riods of his remarkable career.\n</p>\n<p>\n In referring to this memorial Mr. Cleve\u00ac\n land happily voiced the sentiment of the\n people who revere the memory of Beecher\n when he said:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt would savor of hardihood if we who\n knew Mr. Beecher and his work, and who\n new contemplate the building of a memorial\n to the spirit and inspiration of his labors,\n should be content with a mere idle token of\n remembrance. Assuredly if it is to typify\n his lofty intents and purposes, and if it is to\n memorialize his unsparing, constant useful\u00ac\n ness, and his fidelity in interpreting to his\n fellow men the messages of God, our me\u00ac\n morial must be a center of work which shall\n redound to the glory of God and the good\n of humanity.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt is also entirely manifest that we can\n build no memorial shrine to our hero which\n will attract his favor and the presence of his\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0026/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 194, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0026/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 388, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 558}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0026/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 777, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1117}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0026/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1555, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2234}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0026/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3111, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4468}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0026/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/ec/he/rm/em/or/ia/la/00/un/se/beechermemoriala00unse/beechermemoriala00unse_0026.jp2", "height": 4468, "width": 3111, "levels": 6, "size": 905134}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"26\">\n<p>\n 24\n</p>\n<p>\n THE BEECHER MEMORIAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u25a0pirit without making Plymouth Church a\n part of It.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This is the spirit and purpose that should\n animate those who have undertaken the\n laudable work of rearing a memorial to\n Beecher.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Lior. of the Hour.\n</p>\n<p>\n (From the Columbia (S. C.) State (Dem.).]\n</p>\n<p>\n Grover Cleveland has again denied that he\n is bothered by political aspirations, alleging\n that he is willing only to act in \u2018\u2018an advis\u00ac\n ory capacity,\u201d but like other notables he\n cannot keep the papers from \u2018\u2018mentioning\u201d\n him as a possible candidate. At the Beecher\n memorial services Sunday the ex-President\n seems to have been the lion of the hour, who\n did not have to roar to attract attention and\n applause. Justice Brewer and Dr. Gunsaulus\n alluded in complimentary terms to Mr.\n Cleveland, their references eliciting ap\u00ac\n plause which was, so one reporter noted,\n joined in heartily by Mr. Edward M. Shepard.\n Mr. Cleveland was afterward the guest of\n Mr. Shepard at dinner. By the way, why is\n there not more talk of Shepard as a candi\u00ac\n date upon whom all factions of Democrats\n could agree? He enjoys the confidence of\n Cleveland and his followers, and after his\n stand in 1900 and his position in the municipal\n election of 1901 he should be acceptable to\n Mr. Bryan as well as to Tammany; he is a\n man of pre-eminent ability, strong convic\u00ac\n tions and unusual civic patriotism. It is true\n that Mr. Hill dislikes Mr. Shepard, but Hill\n has fought every other man who ever became\n prominent in the party in his day and his\n opposition to Shepard should not and will\n not count. The fact that Mr. Shepard was\n defeated for mayor of Greater New York\n should not be urged against him since the\n conditions of that campaign made his elec\u00ac\n tion impossible, and then other men defeat\u00ac\n ed for minor offices have been put up for the\n presidency with better success. Mr. Hill\n has himself been defeated more than once,\n as has Mr. Cleveland and Mr. Bryan. All\n In all it will be well to keep Edward M.\n Shepard\u2019s name on the list of eligibles.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018\u2018Through the lecture system he became\n known in person throughout the country,\n and his liberal sentiments, expressed as\n only he could express them, made an en\u00ac\n during impression on the people of his day.\n On every public question he had something\n to say, and it was always inspired by a\n noble spirit. No other preacher has ever\n deserved so well to be remembered by his\n</p>\n<p>\n country. That his enormous earnings should\n have gone mainly for charity is an evidence\n that k memorial which is In itself a charity\n would meet his own views.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n At a time when the public mind is so deep\u00ac\n ly engrossed with money making, and men\n are so prone to w\u2019orship the modern idol\n called Success, it is refreshing to find that\n there is still left in the world sufficient un\u00ac\n selfishness to honor the memory of one w r ho\n labored so bravely and unselfishly for hu\u00ac\n manity, for justice and fairness, as did\n Henry Ward Beecher. In the march of\n progress great wonders may be wrought,\n but the world\u2019s greatest achievement will\n be In the production of great men.\n</p>\n<p>\n A Notable Tribute to Beecher.\n</p>\n<p>\n [From New London Morning Telegraph (Dem.).]\n</p>\n<p>\n No doubt the most notable trjbute paid to\n Henry Ward Beecher ' s memory at the mass\n meeting in Brooklyn on Sunday night was\n that which came from the lips of Grover\n Cleveland\u2014notable especially because one\n would not expect it from that source. Some\u00ac\n how the impression which the country has\n of Mr. Cleveland is that of a hard headed,\n matter of fact man, one of the last in the\n world to have been moved by sentiment or\n to have been influenced in early life by the\n words of a great preacher. Yet here is what.\n Mr. Cleveland finds it in his heart to say of\n the great preacher whose work and w r ords\n do follow ' him:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018\u2018It is now more than forty-nine years\n ago that I heard in Plymouth church a ser\u00ac\n mon whose impressiveness has remained\n fresh and bright in my mind during all the\n time that has since passed.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018\u2018In the days of trial and troublous per\u00ac\n plexity its remembrance has been an un\u00ac\n failing comfort, and in every time of de\u00ac\n pression and discouragement the lesson it\n taught has brought restoration of hope and\n confidence.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI remember as if it were but yesterday\n the fervid eloquence of the great preacher\n as he captivated my youthful understanding\n and pictured to my aroused imagination the\n entrance of two young men upon the world\u2019s\n jostling activities\u2014one laden, like a beast\n of burden, with avaricious plans and sordid\n expectations, and the other with a light step\n and cheerful determination, seeking the way\n of duty and usefulness, and striving for the\n reward promised to those who love and serve\n God and labor for humanity.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018\u2018I have never for a moment lost the im\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n pression made upon me by the vivid con\u00ac\n trast thrillingly painted in words that burned\n between the two careers; nor have I ever\n failed to realize the meaning of the truths\n taught by the description given of the happy\n compensations in life and peace and solac9\n in death, of the one, and the racking dis\u00ac\n appointments in life and despair in death\n cf the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWhat this sermon has been to me in all\n these years, I alone know. I present it3\n recollection to-day as a personal credential\n of my own, especially entitling me to repre\u00ac\n sentation among those who meet to recall\n and memorize the fame and usefulness of\n Henry Ward Beecher.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Cleveland can say this now, and nobody\n who is worthy of notice will sneer. He has\n demonstrated by his course since he left\n the presidency his right to be taken serious\u00ac\n ly. But what a pity those who abused him\n so liberally and so indecently in his first\n presidential campaign could not have known\n these things.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of the World\u2019s Great Men.\n</p>\n<p>\n [From the Scranton Truth (Ind.).]\n</p>\n<p>\n The earnest spirit mantfested at the\n Beecher memorial meeting held in Brooklyn\n a few days ago proves how ' deep is the im\u00ac\n pression made by Henry Ward Beecher. The\n Philadelphia Record says: \u201cOf the great men\n produced by America at a time when the\n English w r ere disposed to sneer at the medi\u00ac\n ocrity of the prominent Americans, Mr.\n Beecher was one of the most eminent. What\n he did for the nation when he faced English\n mobs which were in sympathy with the Con\u00ac\n federacy and which attempted to force the\n British government to recognize the inde\u00ac\n pendence of the South can be appreciated\n only by patriots who lived at that time and\n knew how severe a blow ' such a recognition\n would have been to the Union cause.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cPresident Schurman of Cornell University\n has deplored the fact that the present gene\u00ac\n ration gives no promise of such men as the\n country could boast at the close of the Civil\n War and for a few years later. Of the great\n pulpit orators Mr. Beecher was the last, un\u00ac\n less Phillips Brooks is to be reckoned as\n an orator. No man of sympathies as broad,\n of an independence as superb, of a common\n sense as striking and a diction as brilliant\n has ever occupied an American pulpit. Com\u00ac\n pared with the notable preachers of England\n he was immense.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0027/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 197, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 280}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0027/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 394, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 560}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0027/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 789, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1121}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0027/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1579, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2242}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0027/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4484}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0027/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/ec/he/rm/em/or/ia/la/00/un/se/beechermemoriala00unse/beechermemoriala00unse_0027.jp2", "height": 4484, "width": 3159, "levels": 6, "size": 1065104}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"27\">\n<p>\n Mi?.

We desire\n to make mention of all Thy goodness; to ac\u00ac\n knowledge Thee as our sovereign Heart and\n Lord; to rejoice in Thee as our Father and\n our benefactor. We pray that Thou wilt\n accept our love. We mourn that it is feeble,\n that it is inconstant and that it hath in it\n so little of control. We pray for deeper sin\u00ac\n cerity and more earnestness of affection. We\n pray that we may have that faith which\n works by love; by which Thou shalt be\n brought nearer to us; by which Thou shalt\n be coupled with all our affairs; by which we\n discern Thee, not afar off, but near at\n hand, in ourselves, in all our affairs,\n in every surrounding circumstance.\n Grant, our Father, that w ' e may have\n in a richer and more perfect way the sense\n that we are in very truth Thy children\n \u2014the children of God, of the household of\n faith; and this, not because of our own mind\n and will, but because of Thy bounty and\n grace. For we love Thee because Thou first\n lovedst us. It was the outreaching of Thine\n arms that kept us around Thy feet. It was\n Thy voice that called us, and not ours that\n called Thee. And every thought and aspira\u00ac\n tion which we have toward Thee, our very\n importunity, is awakened in us by Thee.\n For the spirit maketh intercession within\n us and through us with groanings which can\u00ac\n not be uttered. The Spirit knows our want\n better than we, and understands the reason\n of our trouble better than we.

And as\n they are taught by their parents to call the\n name of God, so may they teach those pa\u00ac\n rents their relations to Thee in patience, in\n self-sacrifice in disinterestedness and in\n faith; and we pray that Thou wilt grant that\n those who are carrying up the young to\n man\u2019s estate may be saved from the tempta\u00ac\n tions which beat vehemently upon them.\n May they be able to gird themselves in the\n armor of God, and be proof against seduc\u00ac\n tions.

Grant to all\n who are in the midst of life, bearing the\n</p>\n<p>\n tests and conflicts which must needs come\n in this world, grace according to their time,\n that every day they may be equal to the\n emergencies thereof.\n</p>\n<p>\n We beseech of Thee that Thou wilt remem\u00ac\n ber any who are sick. Be with them very\n graciously, as an angel in their presence.\n And grant them strength, O Lord, that such\n as are appointed unto death may behold no\n gloomy exit, but rather the rising joy of im\u00ac\n mortality.\n</p>\n<p>\n Be with all who are mourning for their\n departed ones. Be with all who are bruised\n of heart, and to whom come many vague\n memories of days gone by, that come not\n again. Lift them above time and sense into\n the great realm which is above time and\n sense. Grant that they may walk with God\n to-day and be comforted-\n</p>\n<p>\n We pray that Thy blessing may be upon\n those who are, absent from us\u2014our dearly\n beloved\u2014upon the sea, in distant lands, or\n in our own land. Wherever they are may\n the blessing of the Sabbath and the Lord of\n the Sabbath be theirs.\n</p>\n<p>\n Remember, O Lord, thine own churches\n in this city, and all in them who are labor\u00ac\n ing according to their light and their\n strength for the cause of God and the wel\u00ac\n fare of men. Take away every root of bitter\u00ac\n ness, all alienations, all those secret and\n divisory influences which so often, through\n the conscience, lead to separation and harm.\n Bring together, in the simplicity of truth\n and love all those, of every name, who\n work in Thy cause, so that they may glorify\n Jesus Christ; so that the whole brotherhood\n of men may walk together in undivided\n ranks. We thank Thee for the influences\n that are tending toward greater unity.

Remember the citizens\n of this country. We pray that our laws may\n be just and that the execution of them may\n be impartial. May knowledge be spreaa\n abroad amidst all our people\u2014especially\n among those who are perishing for lack of\n vision.\n</p>\n<p>\n Deal gently, our Father, we beseech Thee,\n with any parts of our land where Thy hand\n afflicts with sorrow and grievous sickness.\n Be pleased to sustain the sufferers, and to\n raise up about them such sympathy as shall\n bring them all needed succor in the day of\n their fierce adversity. May we not take\n pride in our immunity, but look with tender\u00ac\n ness and compassion upon those who suffer,\n as suffering with them.\n</p>\n<p>\n We pray that Thy kingdom may come\n everywhere throughout the world; may those\n hateful dissensions, may that arrogance,\n may that domineering pride, may that cruel\u00ac\n ty and grasping selfishness which have so\n long been legalized among nations in their\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0028/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 194, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0028/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 388, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 558}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0028/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 777, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1117}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0028/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1555, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2234}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0028/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3111, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4468}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0028/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/ec/he/rm/em/or/ia/la/00/un/se/beechermemoriala00unse/beechermemoriala00unse_0028.jp2", "height": 4468, "width": 3111, "levels": 6, "size": 1057946}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"28\">\n<p>\n 80\n</p>\n<p>\n THE BEECHER MEMORIAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n intercourse with each other, pass away, and\n may the truth of the gospel of Christ, the\n power of God among men, be seen in all the\n peoples of the earth.

Amen.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Sermon\n</p>\n<p>\n Text\u2014I exhort, therefore, that, first of all, sup\u00ac\n plications, prayers, intercessions, and giving of\n thanks, be made for all men; for kings, and for\n all that are in authority; that we may lead a\n quiet and peaceful life in all godliness and hon\u00ac\n esty. \u2014I Timothy ii:l-2.\n</p>\n<p>\n I have selected this passage because in\n its phraseology it gives some idea of the\n breadth of the exercise of prayer which\n really belongs to it, and tends to lift it up\n out of that narrow, and I might say personal\n and selfish circuit in which it so often moves,\n and where it is so often contemplated by\n those who are arguing against prayer from\n grounds of material truth. For men have\n been too much accustomed to regard prayer\n as a mere profitable transaction; as a run\u00ac\n ning to God, as men run to the store, or to\n the doctor, or to the lawyer (never except\n when they lack something and wish to pro\u00ac\n cure it), making prayer a sort of serviceable\n errand business. They do not ask, therefore,\n that the ten thousand wants of daily life\n shall be supplied by vigilance and industry,\n nor through the methods of suffering and\n enjoying by which men are built up and edu\u00ac\n cated, but beg them of God offhand, as if\n it, were His business to supersede His own\n law, and set aside His own method of edu\u00ac\n cating the race, and to give a premium to\n self-indulgence and indolence, instead of\n adhering to His system of providing for the\n needs of men by the employment of a cer\u00ac\n tain economy.\n</p>\n<p>\n Prayer is ; in its fullest conception, the\n noblest parts of the soul in the noblest at\u00ac\n titude of communion or converse with God.\n It has in it an element of supplicattion; it\n has in it an element of intercession; it has\n in it a hundred elements, because the generic\n conception of it is the bringing of the soul\n in its higher faculties into immediate com\u00ac\n munion with God, and giving it perfect\n liberty. Of course, under such circum-\n Btances, in differing strains and in different\n emergencies, prayer will vary.\n</p>\n<p>\n Prayer is not, therefore, the voice of a\n beggar. It is not simply the expression of\n want. It is the expression, in our best hours\n and in our best moods, of the best thoughts,\n the best sentiments, the best emotions, the\n best aspirations, the best of everything. If\n the soul be a mighty estate; if it hath every\u00ac\n thing of flower and of fruit in it, we bring\n something of everything, and the best, and\n offer it to God. Prayer is not, then, simply\n a desire that we may have that which in the\n present hour we may need. It is a sense of\n our alliance with our Heavenly Father. It\n is an endeavor to be in such converse with\n Him as a child is during the hour of its joy\n or of its sorrow, or of its burden, in the\n presence of its earthly parent. It is lifting\n up the soul out of matter, and out of its poor\n surroundings, into the presence and sym\u00ac\n pathy of the Spirit of God, the great Love\n and Lover.\n</p>\n<p>\n From the material side prayer may be\n criticised philosophically, and has been, and\n is to-day; but if you look upon it from the\n material side alone, and criticise it, you only\n criticise its abuse; you only criticise what\n</p>\n<p>\n may be a disease, and not the thing itself\u2014\n not its full self\u2014not its ideal self. That is\n psychologic. In its last analysis prayer is\n a state of the soul in the presence of\n God. It is the radiancy, the communicative\u00ac\n ness, the aspiration, the spontaneous utter\u00ac\n ance, of thought or feeling or words, or all\n that which is in us in those moments when,\n separating ourselves from every other thing,\n we stand consciously in the presence of our\n Heavenly Father.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let us look, then, at prayer as it is pre\u00ac\n sented in the New Testament, and see if it\n has not something of this largeness\u2014If it is\n not essentially a condition of the soul in its\n best moments, open and disclosed before\n God. Look for one single moment at the\n construction of our Lord\u2019s prayer, which he\n gives, not as a form, but as a universal type\n of prayer;\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAfter this manner, therefore, pray ye.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Pray not in these words, necessarily, but\n according to the genius of this prayer. And\n what is it? Every word is a separate jewel.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cOur Father which are in heaven\u2014\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The One above limitation, above imperfec\u00ac\n tion, above the touch of sin and frailty; the\n Sovereign; the Lord God Almighty; He who\n is interpreted by the word \u201cFather\u201d and who\n is \u201cours\u201d to every man w ' ho utters it; the\n Being thdt is Father in the most exalted of\n all possible ways.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHallowed be Thy name.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The soul\u2019s highest and most disinterested\n aspiration, the glorying of a child\u2019s love for\n the honor of a father, is here indicated.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThy kingdom come, Thy will be done in\n earth as it is in heaven.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In uttering these simple sentences the soul\n finds itself walking in the procession of ages\n among invisible spirits and in that vast\n stream of tendencies which from eternity\n to eternity is rearing up the kingdom of\n God and perfecting it.\n</p>\n<p>\n After this communion with God, this utter\u00ac\n ance of all that is most disinterested and\n spiritual, then comes,\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cGive us this day our daily bread. And\n forgive us our debts as we forgive our\n debtors. And lead us not into temptation,\n but deliver us from evil.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n All of these petitions are of such a tone that\n they become specific of the generic phrases\n with which the prayer opens. For the honor\n of God, and for the advancement of His\n cause, specific things are asked\u2014support,\n forgiveness, defense.\n</p>\n<p>\n So, then, if you look into the Lord\u2019s\n Prayer, you shall find that it implies the\n noblest of all mental conditions and ex\u00ac\n periences. It is not a whine; it is not a long\n confession; it is not wrestling; it is the\n effluence of a blossoming soul on which has\n fallen the sense of God\u2019s love.\n</p>\n<p>\n If you look again at the prayer of our\n Lord which I read in your hearing as a part\n of the opening service, which he uttered near\n the close of his ministry and in which he\n besought God for His disciples, and for all\n who had caught the sacred contagion of love,\n or should do it through the ages, you will\n see how lofty that strain is. You will Bee\n how far it is removed from personal and\n selfish supplication in his own behalf. Yea,\n and when, in that mysterious trial of the\n Garden, he was borne down with woes un\u00ac\n described and indescribable, in that hour\n in which, pressed to the uttermost, He had\n recognition of His own suffering. He be\u00ac\n sought God that the cup might pass from\n Him, He sprang up from that personal peti\u00ac\n tion instantly, saying, \u201cNevertheless, not\n my will but Thine be done\u201d; thus joining, in\n a petition of the extremest anguish, His own\n</p>\n<p>\n welfare to the honor and glory of God\u2019s\n name.\n</p>\n<p>\n Consider the subject of prayer as it is laid\n out for us in the history of the Apostle\n Paul. In him it was the enthusiasm of fidel\u00ac\n ity, of admiration, of love, out of which he\n prayed, and from which, as from a central\n motive, he commands prayer upon all the\n disciples. He says:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cContinue in prayer, and watch in the\n same with thanksgiving.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n All his experience of day and night, every\u00ac\n thing that he had suffered, wrought out in\n him a sense of divine beneficence; and, when\u00ac\n ever, during his life, he came into the pres\u00ac\n ence of God, he had some reason for thanks\u00ac\n giving.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" In everything, by prayer and supplication\n and thanksgiving, let your request be made\n known unto God.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Go to God, not with an empty scrip, asking\n your daily crust; go to Him in the full\n recognition of His bounty and love and good\u00ac\n ness, and pour your prayer through the\n heart\u2019s warmth of admiration and adoration\n and thanksgiving.\n</p>\n<p>\n In another place he says:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cRejoicing in hope; patient in tribulation;\n continuing instant in prayer.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In still another place he says:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWithout ceasing I make mention of you\n always in my prayers.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Speaking in the language of personal\n friendship, and so revealing his daily life\u2014\n how he bore up his beloved ones incessantly\n in his thoughts, and communed with them\n in the presence of God, at the feet of the\n One who was pierced\u2014he says again:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI thank my God upon every remembrance\n of you, making request with joy.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Consider the whole state of mind implied\n by such language as that.\n</p>\n<p>\n In writing to Timothy he says:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI thank God that without ceasing I have\n remembrance of thee in my prayers night\n and day.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Take one other passage, which is recorded\n in Ephesians:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cFor this cause I bow my knees unto the\n Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, of whom\n the whole family in heaven and earth is\n named, that he would grant you, according\n to the riches of His glory, to be strength\u00ac\n ened with might by His Spirit in the inner\n man.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n He has risen up to the very highest at\u00ac\n mosphere of inwardness and spirituality.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThat Christ may dwell in your hearts\n by faith; that ye, being rooted and grounded\n in love, may be able to comprehend with\n all saints what is breadth, and length, and\n depth, and height; and to know the love of\n Christ, which passeth knowledge, that ye\n might be filled with all the fullness of God.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, I aver that in the most disinterested\n and the most resplendent friendships of the\n noblest natures there is room for an inter\u00ac\n change of offices\u2014for giving and taking; I\n declare that it is consistent with the very\n magnanimity of a true friendship to ask\n help, to ask sympathy, to ask succor; but\n what would be thought of a friendship that\n had gone down so low that the only sugges\u00ac\n tion which a person had of this relation was\n that it gave one the opportunity of getting\n indorsements in time of trouble, of getting\n nursing in time of sickness, or of getting\n a good word spoken from influential quarters\n in time of need? What if the mere begging\n or gift side was the only thing that came\n to our thought in contemplating friendship?\n What is there in the intercourse of true\n friendship that is so enriching as the cast\u00ac\n ing of one\u2019s self on another?

There is no treasure like that which\n the soul has.\n</p>\n<p>\n How sweet are gifts which come from love,\n whether they be of intrinsic value or only\n associational! When two persons have\n walked together and interchanged the high\u00ac\n est and purest and noblest things, if one\n plucks from the hawthorn or some other near\n bush a blossom for a memorial, how sacred\n it is, as though it had grown by the throne\n of God itself! That flower is of little in\u00ac\n trinsic value; yet how is it perfumed and\n stained through with the odor and color of\n heaven! And the memories of it\u2014how sacred\n they are! Or if, instead of that, one should\n take from the neck a simple locket and\n give it as a souvenir\u2014as a token of mutual\n pledges and aspirations and hopes\u2014how pre\u00ac\n cious would such a gift be beyond any other\n that the most exquisite skill, dealing with\n the rarest values, could construct! For it\n is the soul that gives value to these things.\n</p>\n<p>\n But what if love were to become so de\u00ac\n generate that the moment the friend left\n the house another should rush in and ask,\n \u201cDid he give you anything?\u201d and the an\u00ac\n swer being \u201cNo,\u201d should say, \u201cHumph! What\n is the use of his visiting here if he does not\n give you anything?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Our souls rise into the very personal pres\u00ac\n ence of God, and have the consciousness of\n God\u2019s life breathing through them; the\n nobler passages of our being are opened; the\n sense of eternal blessedness dawns on us;\n the favor of God, and the love of God, and\n the bounty of God, as expressed through\n Jesus Christ, come home to our realization;\n and there are men so degenerate in their\n conceptions of prayer that when we return\n to our consciousness after such high com-\n munings, they say, \u201cWhat is the use of pray\u00ac\n ing? Do you suppose that you will get\n loaves of bread by praying for them? Do\n you suppose that harvests will be given to\n you in answer to prayer? Do you suppose\n prayer will protect you against storms and\n relieve you from disease?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Is the hope of getting something the only\n thing for which men come into each other\u2019s\n presence? Is there nothing higher than\n gifts? Is there not something more royal\n than abundance? If the soul may lift itself\n up into the presence of God, so that it feels,\n \u201cI am a king, I am a priest, I am God\u2019s own\n child, and I am an heir of God and a joint\n heir with Christ in an eternal inheritance,\u201d\n is there no remuneration, no royalty, in that\n presence of God? I say that a true friend\u00ac\n ship must include the interchange of inter\u00ac\n est, of confidence and of love. There is, in\u00ac\n deed, also the advantage of a friend\u2019s kind\n offices; but that is lower down. It is the\n last and the least thing to be considered in\n connection with friendship. And often that\n is beneficial to us more on account of the\n testimony which it bears of the kind feeling\n of him who gives, than on account of the\n intrinsic value of the gift.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is right in me to say, \u201cGive me my\n daily bread,\u201d leaving it to God to give it in\n any way that it pleases Him\u2014to minister it\n through one agency or another. This point\n is never expounded. There is no word of\n philosophical explanation given in regard to\n the manner in which prayers shall be an\u00ac\n swered. The petition is, simply, \u201cGive us\n our bread; forgive us our sin; lead us away\n from tempting; deliver \u00bb\u2022- from evil.\u201d The\n</p>\n<p>\n language is given without comment. It does\n not imply whether the things asked are to\n be wrought ont by our being stimulated to\n work for them, whether we are to be in\u00ac\n spired to take care of ourselves or not.\n Paul and other eminent saints have been\n accustomed to plead with God for favors,\n doubtless; but it is in the higher atmosphere\n of the soul that those elements of prayer\n become lawful which imply intimacy with\n God.\n</p>\n<p>\n Therefore I hear the two extremes of this\n subject of prayer expounded. I hear men\n arguing, seriously and long, to show that\n God is a prayer-hearing God, and will answer\n prayer; and to prove it they cite instances\n which have come under their notice. Mr.\n So-and-so was on the point of starvation,\n and he prayed for food, and a sheep came to\n his door, and he ate it; and so his prayer\n was answered. Another man wanted wood,\n and he could not get any, and he prayed,\n and that night somebody came and left a\n load in his yard; and so his prayer was\n answered. Another man had a note to pay,\n and he could not get the money, and he\n prayed, and somebody came and brought him\n the money; and his prayer was answered,\n also.\n</p>\n<p>\n I do not doubt that there are answers of\n prayer on that lower plane; but this I say:\n it is an absolute vulgarization of the whole\n grand theme of prayer to represent it from\n that side. It is so low that it is a stench\n in the nostrils of any man who has a sense\n of what is the altitude and glory of prayer.\n I would not permit a man to call me his\n friend who had no other friendship for me\n but to bring me fodder and supply me with\n something for my body. The friend himself\n is the best answer to our wants. I do not\n disdain these lower offices, among others;\n but when prayer is argued as being true on\n this low ground, chiefly and continually,\n until men come to think that praying is like\n dropping orders into the post office, or send\u00ac\n ing around boys to the store, it is degraded\n far below its real character. True praying,\n beginning here, ends in the kingdom of God;\n and whatever comes short of that is such\n fantastic vapor, such effluvia, as to be un\u00ac\n worthy of the name. And anybody who rep\u00ac\n resents prayer as consisting in these lower\n and perishing elements demeans it, dis\u00ac\n honors God, degrades the soul and under\u00ac\n estimates that altitude which belongs to us\n in our better moods before our Heavenly\n Father. Prayer, chiefly, is the soul\u2019s com\u00ac\n munion with God. It is chiefly translation.\n It is chiefly transfiguration. It was worth\n more to Peter, James and John to stand for\n an hour and see the spirits dawn through\n the heaven, and talk with Christ, whose face\n shone as the sun and whose raiment was\n white as the light, than if the three taber\u00ac\n nacles which they craved had been built of\n diamonds and rubies on the mountain top. It\n is what we get by the soul that makes us\n rich.\n</p>\n<p>\n In regard to these lesser wants, it is not\n always best that they should be supplied. It\n is a great deal better for a man who wants to\n be relieved from pain to find that he can\n bear it tnan to have it taken away from\n him. It is a great deal better for one who\n wants to be relieved from sorrows to find\n that he can walk through sorrows unharmed,\n than to have them removed from him. It is\n a great deal better for one who suffers lack\n and wants abundance to have some invisible\n inspiration come into his soul by which he\n can say, \" I have all things even when I have\n nothing, if Gcd be mine,\u201d than to receive\n that abundance. When we have the inspira\u00ac\n tion of reason, and of faith, and of hope,\n and of conscience, and of love; when the\n</p>\n<p>\n influence of the higher sphere rests down\n upon us; when we are walking with God and\n abiding with Him, then we have everything\n that we want, and we do not feel the lack of\n these lower blessings. We are brought into\n such a state that we no longer crave them,\n or think about them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our wants, it seems to me, are very much\n like a dandelion blossom\u2014or rather that\n which follows the blossom. A man goes to\n God to ask for something the need of which\n is oppressing him; and when he has come\n consciously into the divine presence, he has\n forgotten what brought him there, and he\n pours out his soul in love, and thanksgiving,\n and hope and rapture, and goes away, and\n by and by remembers the circumstance, and\n says, \u201cWhy, I did not ask God for what I\n meant to; I meant to ask Him for such and\n such things, and I forgot all about them.\u201d\n The winds of the higher heaven blow away\n a thousand of men\u2019s petitions. There is no\n more occasion for them. When the presence\n of God makes the soul consciously rich, it\n no longer wants outward mercies. We live\n low down; and more than half of all the\n wants we feel, more than half of all the\n things which we dread, are the result of low\n living; so that anything which exalts us,\n delivers us from many peculiar necessities,\n and therefore from the need of prayer con\u00ac\n cerning them.\n</p>\n<p>\n You will find abundant confirmation of\n these thoughts in following out their lines\n in the New Testament. Take, for Instance,\n the experience of the Apostle Paul. He was\n fairly bedewed with prayer, if one might say\n so. Day by day prayers were to him what\n dew drops are on summer mornings to fra\u00ac\n grant bushes, all of whose leaves are wet.\n He was fragrant with prayer. It was the\n end of his living. He exhaled before God\n perpetually. His soul rose up out of care.\n He derived strength from weakness and\n wealth from poverty. No man ever extracted\n more than he from a life which was such\n a martyrdom as his was. He declared that\n he died deaths daily; and yet I affirm that\n human nature has nowhere else given utter\u00ac\n ance to such exquisite phraseology, repre\u00ac\n senting the soul\u2019s calmness, and triumph,\n and blessedness, and richness received from\n God, as that which came from the lips of\n that apostle. As birds that are low down in\n dusky forests, and are chased by owls, escape\n in the broad sunlight, so our souls, when\n they are in the low, dark places, flying away\n from these up toward God, find release, and\n sing for joy.\n</p>\n<p>\n Paul prayed for himself. I do not know\n what he did not pray for. He prayed for his\n friends; he prayed for churches; he prayed\n for communities that he wanted to see, but\n never had seen; he prayed for his associates;\n he prayed for magistrates; he prayed for\n rulers; he prayed for those that loved him,\n and for those that hated him; he prayed for\n God\u2019s cause and kingdom everywhere; he\n prayed day and night; he prayed in season\n and out of season. Prayer was the con\u00ac\n tinuous action of his soul.\n</p>\n<p>\n Praying, then, is not so much an office as\n it is the soul\u2019s whole attitude toward God,\n so that everything which one does he does\n in conscious communion with God.\n</p>\n<p>\n If these views be correct they will throw a\n great deal of light on the difficulties which\n lie in the way of men.\n</p>\n<p>\n First, consider speculative difficulties.\n There are many persons who study prayer\n altogether from the side of natural law,\n having taken the lower view of it; and they\n exercise themselves in questionings and\n arguments as to whether prayer can be an\u00ac\n swered or not. I say that prayer is the high\u00ac\n est psychological experience; that therefor*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0030/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 194, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0030/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 388, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 558}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0030/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 777, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1117}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0030/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1555, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2234}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0030/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3111, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4468}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0030/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/ec/he/rm/em/or/ia/la/00/un/se/beechermemoriala00unse/beechermemoriala00unse_0030.jp2", "height": 4468, "width": 3111, "levels": 6, "size": 1204213}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"30\">\n<p>\n 28\n</p>\n<p>\n THE BEECHER MEMORIAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n it runs outside of the range of material sci\u00ac\n ence; and that no man who Is only compe\u00ac\n tent to judge by the senses, and of the quali\u00ac\n ties of matter or material things, is in a\n position to judge of the nature of prayer, or\n of its reality, its scope, or its indirect con\u00ac\n sequences. This is a chain of argument that\n has not been enough brought out.\n</p>\n<p>\n A man asks in prayer that he may write\n a Novum Organum; and his friends say to\n him, \u201cOh, fool! Do you think that God is\n going to answer that prayer? Do you think\n that He is going to so operate on your mind\n that you, who never could write, who have\n no talent for writing, shall be able to .write\n a book like that? Do you think you are\n going to have a Novum Organum written\n and printed and given to you because you\n ask it?\u201d \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n But suppose a man, in offering such a\n prayer, comes into the presence of God, and\n attains a state of most ecstatic exalta\u00ac\n tion, so that every power of his nature is\n brought under the direct influence of the\n divine mind; and suppose that in this exalted\n state, which comes from love and communion\n and gratitude, his mind, eclaircised and stim\u00ac\n ulated, begins to act, and performs some\n noble literary feat, accomplishes some won\u00ac\n derful oratorical achievement or produces\n some sweet hymn or poem that charms the\n ages, does he not receive an answer to his\n prayer? Is not that an answer to prayer\n which, by inspiration, so empowers every\n part of a man\u2019s soul that he becomes re\u00ac\n duplicated in his forces, more unerring in\n his judgment, and more competent to think\n and do a thousand things which he could not\n otherwise think and do? Do you not know the\n difference between an army led by a man\n who has no courage and who inspires no con\u00ac\n fidence. and that same army led by a general\n whose very name makes every soldier\u2019s heart\n bound with zeal and enthusiasm? Do you\n not know that many and many a battle is\n lost because men are not themselves, or\n because that which is in them is not aroused\n and brought out; and that many and many\n a battle is gained because men\u2019s souls are\n fired, and they are made to feel that they\n are doubly men? Have you never noticed\n how strong the child becomes in the perform\u00ac\n ance of duty under the smiles of the parent?\n Did you never see how much better a boy\n fought when his companions clapped him on\n and encouraged him? Are you not aware\n how all the influences of society multiply\n the power of men and their successes? And\n shall the soul, that lifts itself into the very\n presence of Power, that is able to conceive\n of God, and that takes on the divine at\u00ac\n mosphere and stimulus\u2014shall it not, in its\n higher and normal action, be more and do\n more than it otherwise could be or do? And\n Is not the answer to prayer the result which\n is wrought out in those elevated conditions\n to which prayer leads?\n</p>\n<p>\n i pray to God, saying, \u201cGive me roses\u201d;\n and up come clouds. I pray for roses, and\n God sends rain. Very well; do not clouds\n and rain bring roses? They may bring them\n in circuitous ways that I do not expect them\n to come in, but they bring them, neverthe\u00ac\n less. The Opifex maximus, the Architect of\n the universe, works out our wants, not ac\u00ac\n cording to our ideas, but along the line of\n His own supreme knowledge. I think the\n answer to prayer is that which gives inspira\u00ac\n tion to the souls of men; and he who walks\n in the presence of God and lives under the\n inspiration of His down-brooding touch has\n in himself the great causes which will work\n out the answers of the prayer\u2014and that in\n the higher spheres, as well as in the lower.\n Are not sentiments realities as well as the\n</p>\n<p>\n physical objects? Is love, the ultimate of\n human life, nothing? Are not peace, joy and\n faith anything? Is the dirt that Wallace\n trod on a real, scientific, substantial reality,\n and shall the indomitable hope and courage\n that were in his soul go for nothing? Is all\n that exists outside of mere material facts of\n no account? Is there nothing but what the\n sensuous faculties can feel or see? Is there\n no God? Is there no invisibility? Is there\n nothing but body, matter, mud, very dust?\n I should think we had come from the dust,\n and that we had not got a great way from it\n yet!\n</p>\n<p>\n Another reason why prayer is not more in\n vogue and more in the faith of men is the\n low and selfish forms of it which are so\n prevalent. For what are your prayers?\n What is your daily habit of prayer? Is it\n the higher realms in which you are living in\n your thoughts? You need not say what they\n are; I know what they are; but take the daily\n round of men\u2019s prayers, and what is it but\n an extremely low, secular, materializing\n series of petitions?\n</p>\n<p>\n Where men begin their prayers by piling\n up old, long, familiar, worn, empty titles;\n where they commence their prayers by say\u00ac\n ing, \u201cO, thou omnipotent, omniscient, omni\u00ac\n present, all-seeing, ever-living, blessed\n Potentate, Lord God Jehovah!\u201d I should think\n they would take breath. \u201cWhy,\u201d it is asked,\n \u201care not such titles as these right?\u201d Yes;\n but what should be the state of a man\u2019s mind\n when he can fill up such big words as these\n with the reality of their meaning? That there\n are extreme moods, that there are great and\n critical times, when God has, by the breaths\n of heaven and the currents of earth, moved\n men in these higher elements; that there are\n periods when these words are as majestic\n as God himself in the souls of men, there is\n no doubt; but think of a man in his family,\n hurried for his breakfast or to get away to\n his business, praying in such a strain! He\n has a note coming due, and it is going to\n be paid to-day; and he feels buoyant; and\n he goes down on his knees like a cricket\n on the hearth, and piles up these majestically\n moving phrases about God. Then he goes\n on to say with hasty formality that he is a\n sinner. Yes, he is proud to say that he is\n a sinner. He goes with the multitude in\n this respect. Then he asks that he may be\n forgiven and that his heart may be changed.\n And then he asks for his dally bread. He\n has it, and he can always ask for it when\n he has it. After running on thus briefly, in\n the old stereotyped way, he winds up with,\n \u201cFor Thine is the kingdom and the power\n and the glory, forever and ever, amen.\u201d Then\n he jumps up, and goes over to the city and\n attends to his business affairs. At night he\n comes back, and ' if he is not disturbed by\n sleepiness, by company or by something else,\n he has \u201cevening prayers\u201d; but he never\n dreams of approaching his Father in heaven\n in any other than this hard, formal, matter-\n of-fact way. And he is called a \u201cpraying\n man\u201d! A praying man? I should sooner call\n myself an ornithologist because I ate a\n chicken once in a while for my dinner. In out\u00ac\n side affairs, does occasionally having some\u00ac\n thing to do with them constitute an ac\u00ac\n quaintance with them? Does any man really\n t > ray who does not know the inner man that\n belongs to his nature? Does any man pray in\n reality who has not a consciousness of God\n present with him? He that goes to God\n \u201cmust believe that He is, and that He is a\n rewarder of them that diligently seek Him.\u201d\n How large is the interpretation of that say\u00ac\n ing! He that goes to God goes to One whom\n the heavens cannot contain, nor the earth,\n which is His footstool. How lordly is the\n</p>\n<p>\n soul that mounts up into some sort of con\u00ac\n ception of the amplitude, the grandeur, the\n glory and the desirableness of the Father\n in heaven!\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, I do not wonder that, when men pray,\n as they often do, regulation prayers, they\n have a great deal of doubt whether prayer\n is anything more than a kind of punctuation\n in life, separating the different parts by\n commas, and colons, and periods, and other\n stops, so that they shall not huddle them\u00ac\n selves too closely together. Often it is a\n very vulgar and low life that they lead, and\n their living takes away not only their own\n but other men\u2019s faith in prayer. Yet I never\n found any man who prayed through sorrows,\n through great distresses, through darkness;\n I never found a man who prayed with a\n spirit that had life and power in it and who\n was by prayer lifted into his higher and\n nobler self\u2014I never found such a man who\n could bear to listen for a moment to any\n argument against prayer. If prayer has been\n to you like sparkling wine; if it has filled\n your soul with ecstatic joy, not once nor\n twice, but a hundred times; and if you bear\n witness, \u201cThy life which I now live jn the\n flesh, I live by the faith of the Son of God,\n who loved me and gave Himself for me,\u201d who\n can establish, a battering-ram against your\n experience? Who can take away the confi\u00ac\n dence which it breathes?\n</p>\n<p>\n Then, another reason why people doubt\n prayer is because, to a large extent,\n it is occasional. Men pray when they are\n pushed to it. Prayer is not life to them; but,\n to be efficacious to you, prayer, pre-emi\u00ac\n nently, must be your very life.\n</p>\n<p>\n Who could write poetry that had never\n practiced writing? If a man who for twenty-\n five or thirty years had not taken up a pen,\n thinking it convenient to write a poem,\n should sit down and try to write one, w\u2019ould\n he succeed? Suppose a man who had never\n addressed an audience or framed a sentence\n should undertake to deliver an oration,\n would he succeed? Could a man be a writer\n or an orator under such circumstances? A\n man cannot write until he has learned and\n practiced writing; and a man cannot speak\n until he has learned and practiced speaking.\n The mechanic, if he is to succeed, must have\n experience in his business, and so must the\n merchant. We know that education and\n training are essential to the attainment of\n the lower objects of life; and shall those\n which are unspeakably higher and which call\n into play the nobler faculties and laws of\n our being be had just for the trying? You\n can draw a stop of an organ, and it will give\n the sound which belongs to that stop; but\n you cannot do the same thing with the soul.\n If you would enjoy the richest fruits of\n prayer you must abound in prayer; you must\n live in the conscious presence of God; you\n must be in constant and intimate communion\n with Him. Then there can be no doubt, no\n skepticism in your mind as to the efficacy\n of prayer. It is the infrequency of prayer,\n as well as the economic view which is taken\n of it, that breeds doubt in the minds of so\n many men on this subject.\n</p>\n<p>\n The unwise use of forms is also a reason\n why so many doubt the efficacy of prayer. I\n do not disesteem forms, but I think they are\n like walking chairs that are used for teach\u00ac\n ing children how to walk, but which are dis\u00ac\n pensed with as soon as they have served that\n purpose. I do not say that there are not\n emergencies when persons might much better\n pray in the language of another than in their\n own language; but certainly precomposed\n forms of prayer are not the best. They may\n be relatively good, they may be better than\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0031/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 197, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 280}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0031/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 394, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 560}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0031/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 789, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1121}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0031/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1579, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2242}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0031/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4484}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0031/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/ec/he/rm/em/or/ia/la/00/un/se/beechermemoriala00unse/beechermemoriala00unse_0031.jp2", "height": 4484, "width": 3159, "levels": 6, "size": 782522}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"31\">\n<p>\n THE BEECHER MEMORIAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n 29\n</p>\n<p>\n nothing under given circumstances; but they\n are not to be preferred.\n</p>\n<p>\n I see a man take out from his pocket a\n spelling book in his intervals of leisure, and\n spell \u2018\u2018a-b, ab; b-a, ba; h-a-y, hay,\u201d and so\n on; and I say, \u201cA person ought not to be\n carrying around a spelling book all his life\u201d;\n and he says, \u201cWhy, how could a person learn\n to spell without a spelling book? If it were\n not for this old book I could not get along.\u201d\n Now, a spelling book is useful for children\n to learn to spell from; but when they have\n learned to spell, it is to be left behind. And\n in respect to precomposed forms of prayer,\n in the beginning they may help, but as soon\n as a person limits his spiritual flight by the\n range of fixed words or thoughts or feelings,\n that moment he has of necessity dwarfed\n himself. There may be reasons of order and\n decorum why it is proper that public prayers\n should be read; I do not deny that there\n are strong reasons on that side; but if that\n is so, then all the more thg heart ought to\n develop itself in private, not by employing\n precomposed forms of prayer, but by exer\u00ac\n cising the largest liberty in praying. When\n persons go privately into the presence of\n God, there should be the utmost freedom in\n the outflow of their emotions. It may be\n indecorous for a man to parade his weakness\n in oral prayer before a great congregation\n who would be led into a misapprehension by\n that weakness; but a man who is weak in\n prayer going alone into the presence of God\n should go, not walking as if he were the\n prophet Isaiah or the seer John or the\n apostle Paul, but just as he is, in his igno\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n rance, in his inferiority, in his perpetual\n stumblings. The very thought of prayer is\n that it is something by which a man may\n lift himself up out from under the dominion\n of physicalness, of materiality, and become\n baptized into the presence and power of a\n serene and spiritual God, where he shall find\n himself wrought upon by influences such\n that he shall be able to carry himself as a\n man, and not as an animal. The imposition\n of set forms of prayer upon a man girds him,\n laces him, cramps him, confines him. No\n man can be free in prayer who prays\n habitually and always according to precom\u00ac\n posed forms.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let me say further that where the habit\n of prayer is such as I have described, where\n it is the flight of everything in us into the\n presence of God; where it is abiding there;\n where it is sunning one\u2019s self in the light\n of God\u2019s countenance; where it is walking\n in sweet familiarity hand in hand with the\n Saviour; where it is enduring \" as seeing\n Him who is invisible\u201d\u2014where this is the\n habit of prayer, it should be encouraged. It\n is that which we should seek. And this being\n true, it becomes necessary that we should\n everywhere carry it out into our pleasures\n and our business avocations. And either our\n living will correspond with our praying, or\n our praying will be such as we dare not take\n into the presence of our God. Prayer works\n not on narrow lines. It consists not simply\n of asking for something. It works through a\n celestial magnetizing of the whole soul. It\n lifts a man above the infirmities of the flesh.\n It brings him into the region of supernal\n</p>\n<p>\n power. It gives him the inspiration of God\n himself.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sometimes prayer may be answered by the\n granting of the specific thing asked for\u2014if\n it is best. Sometimes it may be answered by\n the taking away of the desire. Sometimes\n it may be answered by that bright shining\n of hope and love which comes down on the\n soul. God answers prayer just as in nature\n he answers the wishes of the husbandman.\n He makes the clouds to rain and the sun to\n shine; and forth from the earth come ten\n thousand voices of birds and insects, sing\u00ac\n ing and chirping, making the air vocal and\n filling our hearts full of song.

What\u00ac\n ever may be the experience of the younger\n generation who have come upon the stage\n of life since Plymouth\u2019s first pastor passed\n from earth, there is a little minority of us\n yet left to whose thought he is still a liv\u00ac\n ing presence. We know but too well that\n he is no longer a dweller on the earth. Yet\n there are moments when recollection over\u00ac\n masters consciousness; and we look and lis\u00ac\n ten if mayhap we may see that benignant\n face again and hear the voice, long silent,\n which aforetime made these walls reverber-\n r.te with brave testimony.\n</p>\n<p>\n Alas! the illusion is but momentary. It\n vanishes like a mirage at the relentless\n touch of truth; and memory, while brimful\n of blessed inspiration, is after all but a\n sepulcher of our dreams.\n</p>\n<p>\n The words of loving tribute which I have\n to offer will be largely reminiscent; and if\n I say again some things which I have said\n before, either in speech or print, concerning\n my beloved pastor and friend, the fact need\n excite no surprise, in view of a comparative\u00ac\n ly new audience represented in this assem\u00ac\n bly. The story of such a life as we com\u00ac\n memorate this evening is worthy of fre\u00ac\n quent repetition.\n</p>\n<p>\n I recall, as if it were a vision of yester\u00ac\n day, the face and figure of the young West\u00ac\n ern missionary whom I saw more than half\n a century gone on the platform of the old\n Broadway Tabernacle as he made his debut\n before an Eastern audience.\n</p>\n<p>\n I can almost hear now the resonant tones\n in which he pleaded for the evangelization of\n the vast areas of territory already subsi\u00ac\n dized to the rule of mammon.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ke seemed at that supreme moment to\n my boyish thought like au ambassador of\n heaven ordained to celebrate the wedlock\n of Christianity and commerce. Alas! that\n the nuptial tie was so loose\u2014a slip-knot\n shall v/e call it?\u2014and the divorces so fre\u00ac\n quent!\n</p>\n<p>\n The great preacher w ' as a candidate then,\n though he know it not. For there was a\n vigilance committee from Plymouth Church.\n Jlen a featherless chick just pecking out of\n the shell, who had avaricious eyes on this\n Western gold nugget, with half formed in\u00ac\n tent to transmute it into coin! If you will\n ftllow me to carry out the simile I will say\n</p>\n<p>\n BY JAMES L. CORNING, SR.\n</p>\n<p>\n that the nugget was rough, as all nuggets\n are apt to be!\n</p>\n<p>\n But a prophetic gift was vouchsafed to\n the vigilance committee; and they thought\n they saw in this unkempt and rugged cru\u00ac\n sader the essential elements of divine\n apostleship.\n</p>\n<p>\n A \" call\u201d to Plymouth Church to-day is a\n grand affair compared with what it was in\n that primitive age. It is probable that\n Plymouth\u2019s first pastor\u2019s first constituency\n could all have been comfortably seated in an\n omnibus. But the quality was good, and so\n far as memory serves me, the call w r as\n unanimous.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was mutually agreed between the young\n Western missionary and the omnibusful of\n men and women calling themselves \" Ply\u00ac\n mouth Church\u201d that the twain should join\n hearts and hands in holy wedlock. There\u00ac\n upon a meeting of clergymen and lay dele\u00ac\n gates from far and near was called to as\u00ac\n semble in the lecture room of the old First\n Presbyterian Church, then located on Orange\n street, w T here this great edifice now stands,\n for what purpose do you think/ To cele\u00ac\n brate the nuptials, one would naturally con\u00ac\n jecture, which nuptials had already been\n decided upon by the high contracting parties\n most intimately concerned. No misappre\u00ac\n hension could be wider of the mark. These\n clerical and lay guests, it turned out, came\n from far and near not to celebrate the nup\u00ac\n tials already decided upon between the par\u00ac\n ties, who alone had a right to decide, but to\n deliberate upon the question whether, after\n all, the w ' edding had better take place!\n After one such social impertinence as that,\n one would think that an invitation to an ec\u00ac\n clesiastical w ' edding in Plymouth Church\n should read about in this form: \u201cThe Rev.\n Mr. So and So, w r ith a lay delegate, is in\u00ac\n vited to the marriage of our elected min\u00ac\n ister and ourselves.\u201d And then, in a foot\u00ac\n note, a gentle reminder something like this:\n \u201cInvited guests w ' ill please bear in mind\n that this is a wedding and not an inquest.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n One of the most interesting memories ot\n my boyhood is the so-called \u201ccouncil\u201d gath\u00ac\n ered more than fifty years ago on the very\n spot w ' here we are now sitting, albeit in a\n building long since destroyed, for the exam\u00ac\n ination of the candidate for the first pas\u00ac\n torate of Plymouth Church. Time would\n fail me to give a full and detailed descrip\u00ac\n tion of that memorable conclave and its\n transactions, of which I was an attentive\n witness.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the domain of systematic theology it\n might bo called a coroner\u2019s inquest, for the\n candidate, while not quite a bankrupt in\n this relation, was certainly in very strait\u00ac\n ened circumstances.\n</p>\n<p>\n For example, when he was asked by the\n moderator\u2014the Rev. Dr. Hewitt of Bridge\u00ac\n port\u2014what were his \u201cviews\u201d concerning the\n doctrine of \u201celection,\u201d he gave answer that\n he had been so busy in trying to save souls in\n the West that he had had no time to go into\n</p>\n<p>\n an arithmetical calculation as to the pro\u00ac\n portion of the elect and non-elect.\n</p>\n<p>\n Again, questioned as to his \u201cview ' s\u201d con\u00ac\n cerning the doctrine of \u201cthe saints\u2019 perse\u00ac\n verance,\u201d he said, with a mischievous twin\u00ac\n kle of the eyes, that he used to believe that\n saints w ' ould persevere; but, having in the\n West seen so many Eastern saints who did\n not persevere, he had come to be somew ' hat\n of a skeptic as to the doctrine.\n</p>\n<p>\n The facial rigidities of these grave ecclesi\u00ac\n astics experienced a thaw about that time,\n but they soon froze up again. As before re\u00ac\n marked, the examination thus far was a cor\u00ac\n oner\u2019s inquest.\n</p>\n<p>\n It would certainly have seemed the height\n of impertinence to suppose that one so\n poorly equipped with theology could possi\u00ac\n bly be possessed of anything deserving the\n name of personal religious experience. But\n the council, in the exercise of sovereign\n mercy, gave the candidate the benefit of the\n residual doubt, and asked him, through its\n moderator, for an account of his conversion\n and call to the ministry. Words would fail\n me should I attempt to describe this pathetic\n chapter in the transactions of that Congre\u00ac\n gational Sanhedrim.\n</p>\n<p>\n One doctor of divinity who was a guest in\n my father\u2019s house on Willow street, with\n more realism than rhetorical taste, said of\n the grave members of the council that the\n young Western missionary, in the recital of\n his personal religious experience, \u201cmade all\n their tearpans slop over.\u201d I was only a\n college boy then, but I dared to think that\n I could have put the case in better phrase.\n</p>\n<p>\n Only a word as to the outcome of those\n solemn deliberations. It transpired that in\n secret session the council, by a large ma\u00ac\n jority, voted that the examination of the\n candidate w r as unsatisfactory, and the in\u00ac\n stallation ought not to be proceeded w ' ith.\n Only through the tearful intercession of the\n elder brother of the candidate w r as it at last\n decided, almost under protest, that the cere\u00ac\n mony of uniting pastor and people might\n take place. So much for ecclesiastical\n councils w ' hich have a flavor of medieval\n hierarchies. *\n</p>\n<p>\n Just at this point in the course of my story\n of the genesis of Plymouth Church I beg\n you to allow a parenthesis for a word of\n practical comment on what may be called the\n politics of ecclesiastical conventionalism and\n the possible outcome thereof in the moral\n welfare of humanity through religious or\u00ac\n ganizations and pastoral ministry.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let us imagine a quite supposable thing\n that the voice of that council convened to\n decide the marital fate of Plymouth Church\n and its elected minister had prevailed and\n the union between pastor and people had not\n been consummated in the only way authenti\u00ac\n cated by the ecclesiastical ethics prevailing at\n the time; in these circumstances can we\n guess what would have happened? Perhaps\n the omnibusful of men and women calling\n themselves \u201cPlymouth Church\u201d would have\n sent the council home about their own busi\u00ac\n ness and had a marriage ceremony after th\u00ab\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0033/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 197, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 280}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0033/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 394, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 560}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0033/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 789, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1121}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0033/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1579, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2242}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0033/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4484}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0033/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/ec/he/rm/em/or/ia/la/00/un/se/beechermemoriala00unse/beechermemoriala00unse_0033.jp2", "height": 4484, "width": 3159, "levels": 6, "size": 1034983}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"33\">\n<p>\n THE BEECHER MEMORIAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n 31\n</p>\n<p>\n fashion of the Quakers, with possibly a tea\n party to accentuate it.

The installation service, which was\n held on the same evening in the building\n which stood where Plymouth lecture room\n now stands, may be passed over with a brief\n word.\n</p>\n<p>\n I remember the installation sermon well,\n preached by the candidate\u2019s elder brother,\n Edward, a performance kiln-dried with\n metaphysical philosophy and top-heavy with\n encyclopedic erudition. If that initiative\n discourse was designed to give the keynote\n of the future deliverances of Plymouth pul\u00ac\n pit it was egregiously out of tune, for no\n two men were wider apart in their pulpit\n methods than were these two brothers.\n</p>\n<p>\n And now I recall a bit of homiletical his\u00ac\n tory which took place a good many years\n ago, when in Judea an obscure carpenter\u2019s\n son emerged from His workshop and startled\n the conventionalisms of His time with such\n strange speech that it became the talk of\n the street, the shop and the market place that\n \u201cno man ever spake like this man.\u201d I recall\n also that it was said of this rhetorical icono\u00ac\n clast that \u201cwithout a parable he spoke not,\u201d\n and that \u201cthe common people heard him\n gladly.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In nothing did this Master of Assemblies\n more mercilessly antagonize the Pharisaic\n code than in His methods of appeal in public\n speech; and the Pharisaic code in this, as\n in many another relation, is endowed with\n a longevity extending down through the ages\n to this twentieth century of grace.\n</p>\n<p>\n There never was a bolder and more start\u00ac\n ling defiance of ecclesiastical tradition than\n that which was witnessed in Brooklyn when\n the first pastor of Plymouth Church gave\n in his own person an object lesson in the\n methods of pulpit appeal.\n</p>\n<p>\n Old Thomas Fuller, more than two cen-\n uries and a half ago, in his quaint descrip\u00ac\n tion of the fabric of effective preaching, had\n a prophetic eye upon this new dispensation\u2014\n a renaissance of the Prophet of Nazareth\n shall we call it? Likening the sermon to a\n piece of architecture old Fuller says that\n \u201cthough reasons are the pillars of the fabric,\n yet similitudes are the windows which give\n the best lights.\u201d Most shocking was it to\n the conservators of ceremonial and literary-\n tradition in the elder days to hear a preacher\n without Rabbinical or Greek culture illus\u00ac\n trating his sermons with similitudes bor\u00ac\n rowed from flowery meadows and the deni\u00ac\n zens of the barnyard.\n</p>\n<p>\n And nineteen centuries later there was a\n kindred constituency here in Brooklyn and\n across the river, in what is now known as\n the annex of Brooklyn, the Borough of Man\u00ac\n hattan, who were loud and nearly unanimous\n in their condemnation of the self-same homi\u00ac\n letic methods in the preaching of Plymouth\u2019s\n first pastor.\n</p>\n<p>\n The concerted protestations of the con\u00ac\n servators of ecclesiastical conventionalism\n against the peculiar pulpit methods of the\n</p>\n<p>\n great Plymouth preacher, I remember well;\n and I confess to have had a suspicion of\n something abnormal in pulpit methods which\n were antagonized by such a mighty and re\u00ac\n spectable army of dissenters. But the multi\u00ac\n tudes who flocked to Plymouth Church from\n the very beginning to listen to its new min\u00ac\n ister seemed to revive in memory the an\u00ac\n cient record, \u201cThe common people heard him\n gladly.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n And here again the conservators of ec\u00ac\n clesiastical tradition elected themselves to\n the prophetic function and predicted that\n as soon as the novelty of this homiletic in\u00ac\n novation became a thing of the past the\n crowded audiences of Plymouth Church would\n melt away, a result for which they waited\n for forty years, and would be waiting yet,\n only that they are all dead!\n</p>\n<p>\n And now that we come to think of it, who\n can tell but from some hilltop of the in\u00ac\n visible Canaan the protesting Sanhedrim are\n waiting yet, to see the vanishing throngs and\n empty seats of this memorable conventicle?\n</p>\n<p>\n Not a great while after Plymouth\u2019s first\n pastor entered upon his ministry in Brook\u00ac\n lyn he added to his stated obligations of\n publilc service the function of professor of\n homiletics. This will be news to most of my\n hearers, and a word of explanation will justi\u00ac\n fy this little biographical episode. At the ad\u00ac\n vent of the great preacher to Brooklyn there\n was a small group of college students, of\n which I was a member, all looking forward to\n the ministry, and all instantly taken captive\n with admiration of the wonderful success of\n Plymouth pulpit in attracting great throngs\n of hearers and holding them with magic\n thrall. Anticipating a time not far distant\n when a similar problem would confront our\u00ac\n selves, albeit in an humble fashion, we were\n naturally anxious to know how this surpris\u00ac\n ing result was attained. It seems to me\n now a huge piece of effrontery to have asked\n such a question of the greatest master of\n pulpit oratory that the nineteenth century\n (shall I not say any other century?) has\n produced. It was somewhat like asking\n Shakspeare how he wrote \u201cHamlet,\u201d or Ra\u00ac\n phael how he painted the \u201cSistine Ma\u00ac\n donna.\u201d But we went in a body to the great\n master with our inquest, and were received\n with the kindest consideration. A weekly,\n or semi-weekly meeting, was proposed in\n the pastor\u2019s study for a series of familiar\n lectures on the art of preaching, and thus\n it came to pass that Plymouth\u2019s first pastor\n became our first professor of homiletics at\n least a year before we passed from college\n into the theological seminary.\n</p>\n<p>\n A little incident of this series of lectures\n in the pastor\u2019s study came back to my recol\u00ac\n lection while I was writing this story of mv\n youthful intercourse with the great preacher\n in these early days of Plymouth\u2019s history.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sitting in his study one morning, waiting\n for our lecturer to come in, my eye was at\u00ac\n tracted- by a freshly written sheet of paper\n lying on the table. Stretching the ethics of\n propriety a little, I allowed myself to glance\n at the paper sufficiently to ascertain its\n general purport, and discovered that it was\n a rough draft of a letter to some college,\n real or imaginary, which had offered the\n young preacher the degree of doctor of di\u00ac\n vinity. The letter, I recollect, respectfully\n declined the honor, for reasons of which but\n a single one has lodged itself in my memory.\n The great preacher confessed himself to the\n collegiate board of trustees to be very fond\n of whistling, a recreation which he consid\u00ac\n ered to be too undignified for a doctor of\n divinity to indulge in.\n</p>\n<p>\n The document was evidently in an unfin \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n ished state, but the one little fragment\n which I am able to recall convinces me that,\n could it be recovered, it would make a pre\u00ac\n cious addition to the posthumous writings of\n this great man.\n</p>\n<p>\n Truth to tell, the first pastor of Plymouth\n Church was somewhat of an iconoclast in\n the domain of ministerial ethics. The gossip\n of bitterness and intolerance which assailed\n him for the crime of rolling tenpins in the\n private alley of one of his church members\n is one of the vivid memories of my youth.\n And in those verdant days I must confess to\n have had serious doubts whether in this\n style of recreation my pastor was not wick\u00ac\n edly trampling under foot a whole decalogue\n of ecclesiastical proprieties.\n</p>\n<p>\n In a brief talk upon the memorabilia of\n Plymouth\u2019s first pastor, which I gave in the\n lecture room of this church two years ago,\n I cited an illustration pertinent to my theme\n from the story of art which, although famil\u00ac\n iar to some, will no doubt be new to many.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of the most precious masterpieces of\n painting in the National Gallery of London\n represents the \u201cRaising of Lazarus.\u201d It is\n credited to Sebastian del Plombo, a pupil of\n Michael Angelo, and it was painted by com\u00ac\n mission of a princely personage in competi\u00ac\n tion with the immortal \u201cTransfiguration\u201d of\n Raphael. Its powerful lines, as well as its\n wide renown, are considered to be chiefly\n due to the genius of Michael Angelo, who\n touched it up after his pupil had exhausted\n his limited resource of talent upon it. Re\u00ac\n calling the familiar lessons in homiletics\n from our great master in the study of the\n old First Presbyterian Church, I am forcibly\n reminded of Michael Angelo and his pupil.\n We listeners were small-sized Piombos,\n whose sermons would have amounted to\n something if our great master could have\n touched them up with his pencil before we\n delivered them. He did his best with us, the\n only drawback being that nature had been\n rather stingy in furnishing him with the\n raw material.\n</p>\n<p>\n Imagine, if you can, a learned and digni\u00ac\n fied professor in one of our great theological\n seminaries, such as Union or Princeton or\n Andover, prescribing for a text book to his\n classes Combe\u2019s \u201cTreatise on Phrenology\u201d!\n I conjecture that a professor who should do\n that thing would be voted by his board of\n trustees to have outlived his usefulness.\n This, however, was the very thing which this\n great master of the preaching art did to the\n little group of college students who sat at his\n feet as humble learners in these Socratic\n lectures in the study, of the old First Pres\u00ac\n byterian Church. I must explain, however,\n that he did this, not in the interest of crani-\n ology, but of mental classification.

Enough to\n say that the little class in homiletics soon\n dispersed; and after that we were beholden\n for our advancement in the science of\n preaching to the weekly object lessons of\n Plymouth pulpit, which were ' of more practi\u00ac\n cal worth to us than a university curriculum.\n</p>\n<p>\n And now we have reached a point in our\n narrative at which more than a passing con\u00ac\n sideration of the elements of the great\n preacher\u2019s wonderful power over men is man\u00ac\n ifestly called for. Let me detain you for a\n few moments with a picture of my beloved\n pastor and friend as he appeared on this\n platform in my youthful days.\n</p>\n<p>\n First of all, here was an object lesson of\n physical vigor as a fundamental factor of\n oratorical power. It is reported that a dis\u00ac\n tinguished professor of phrenology once took\n in hand an examination of the great preach\u00ac\n er\u2019s cranial conformation, with its diversified\n scenery of hills and valleys. Before, how\u00ac\n ever, putting his fingers on the skull of his\n subject he walked leisurely around him sev\u00ac\n eral times, surveying him from head to foot,\n and then exclaimed with admiration, as If a\n prize quadruped of a cattle show were before\n him, \u201cWhat a wonderful animal you are!\u2019\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n I am not ignorant of the fact that emi\u00ac\n nent oratorical gifts have co-existed with\n frail physical organizations; but they\n have been like the machinery of an ocean\n liner in a light timbered yacht; and such\n unnatural and abnormal companionship\n leads speedily to physical collapse.\n</p>\n<p>\n The great preacher once told a little group\n of us, who inquired of him what was the\n secret of his power, that first of all he had\n a strong heart, which pumped blood up to\n his brain as fast and as plentifully as occa\u00ac\n sion required; and we know well enough what\n enormous exactions his manifold public serv\u00ac\n ice impost d.\n</p>\n<p>\n One peculiarity of his physical make-up\n excited my admiration and envy in those\n early days, and that was the extraordinary\n nervous equilibrium which marked his pub\u00ac\n lic speech.\n</p>\n<p>\n Plymouth Church was liberally equipped\n with zephyrs and cyclones during the admin\u00ac\n istration of its first pastor; and both were\n promptly available as occasion demanded.\n</p>\n<p>\n The preaching from this platform often\n flowed as softly as a meadow rill which scarce\n bends a bulrush; and then in a moment be\u00ac\n came a roaring mountain torrent, carrying\n the fabrics of iniquities and lies, personal\n and public, in iis foaming path. This is a\n possibility only to men of great physical\n resource and abounding health.\n</p>\n<p>\n P\u2019eeble men, if they are calm in their pub\u00ac\n lic deliverances, lapse into chronic dullness,\n and their sermons are sedative powders; or,\n if they rise to oratorical fervors, easily get\n into the chronic insanities of.rant. The fact\n that Plymouth ' s great preacher avoided both\n of these extremes was due in chief degree\n to his wonderful physical endowments.\n</p>\n<p>\n These fragmentary hints must suffice-to\n give us an idea of the vast and almost ex\u00ac\n haustless wealth of physiological equipment\n which distinguished the great Plymouth\n preacher, which, with anything like the av\u00ac\n erage exactions of a public teacher in any\n relation, would have insured a longevity\n climbing up into the nineties. During a per\u00ac\n iod extending over many years the great\n preacher and reformer was an immensely\n overworked man; and it was a most natural\n outcome of his life of noble self-sacrifice\n to his church, his country and humanity,\n that the final and too premature collapse\n</p>\n<p>\n should locate Itself in the brain, which\n aged, as regarded vital resource, long before\n any other portion of his physical organism.\n</p>\n<p>\n Contemplating that noble physical wreck\n as the outcome of self-forgetting consecra\u00ac\n tion to beneficent ends, I put the name of\n my beloved pastor and friend high in the\n roll of the most illustrious Christian mar\u00ac\n tyrdom.\n</p>\n<p>\n And now let us consider for a little space\n the spiritual and intellectual endowments of\n Plymouth\u2019s first pastor.\n</p>\n<p>\n If 1 should speak of \u201cemotional truths\u201d to\n a philosopher or scientist, the phrase would\n be considered as impertinent if not positive\u00ac\n ly ridiculous. But this was a phrase which\n was often on the lips oT the great preacher,\n whose rich contribution to human weal we\n are commemorating this evening. Perhaps\n the phrase is as good as any to individu\u00ac\n alize a realm of conviction in which all the\n faculties of the moral and affectlonal nature\n are the essential factors, a realm which we\n briefly denominate the \u201creligious senti\u00ac\n ment.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It is fashionable with a certain class of\n thinkers, as you are aware, to entirely dis\u00ac\n trust the affirmations of this department of\n mentality; and I suppose that nearly every\n man inohis emergence from traditional faith\n passes through this period of distrust, if\n he does not permanently abide in it. With\u00ac\n out entering into any argumentation from\n a scientific or philosophic point of\n view to substantiate the authority of\n the moral and effectional nature In the\n domain of credible truth, I would like\n you to think for a moment what the postu\u00ac\n lates of the moral and affectional nature\n have wrought in the history of the human\n race. Let us group all the faculties of the\n soul together and call the group the \u201creli\u00ac\n gious sentiment.\u201d To be brief, this has been\n the great motive force in human history.\n It has created and molded civilizations; it\n has inspired patriotism, it has been the life\n blood of heroes and martyrs.\n</p>\n<p>\n It gave Marathon to history, the \u201cIliad\u201d\n to literature, the Parthenon and the cathe\u00ac\n drals of the glorious Gothic age to architec\u00ac\n ture, the sculptures of Phidias, the Sistine\n frescoes and the breathing canvases of Ra\u00ac\n phael to art. It composed the psalmody and\n the chorals of the Christian centuries and\n has been the grandest and mightiest ethical\n impulse in the annals of personal and public\n virtue. These poor fragmentary words must\n suffice for the moment to give at least a\n hint of a conjecture that we have in the\n religious sentiment something which stands\n for objective truth, however far such truth\n may be removed from ' the possibility of\n demonstration and formularization.\n</p>\n<p>\n The being and fatherhood of God and the\n soul\u2019s personal continuance after the dissolu\u00ac\n tion of its material tenement are postulates\n neither of philosophy nor science. They re\u00ac\n fuse the confinements of syllogistic demon\u00ac\n stration; and yet they have been the greatest\n moving forces in human history. A man may\n be a philosopher or a scientist without them,\n but never a preacher.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe fool hath said in his heart There is\n no God.\u201d saith the Scripture. But there Is\n another fool of about the same size; and that\n is the man who undertakes to imprison the\n Supreme Being inside of a definition or a\n book of definitions.\n</p>\n<p>\n The first pastor of Plymouth Church had\n no kinship with either one of these fools.\n The testimonies of conscience, hope, adora\u00ac\n tion and affection he put into the loom of\n his wonderful imagination and wove them\n into the fabrics of great epic and lyric prose\n poems, whose stanzas we listened to from\n</p>\n<p>\n Sunday to Sunday In these seats, and which\n were mightily helpful to sin and sorrow\n smitten souls. But we do not look for geo\u00ac\n metrical demonstrations in the \u201cParadise\n Lost\u201d of Milton, nor for philosophical syllo\u00ac\n gisms in the \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d of Tennyson.\n In the thought of the great Plymouth\n preacher the postulates of the moral and\n affectional nature were not only objectively\n true, but they were verities of supreme im\u00ac\n port in comparison with which the deduc\u00ac\n tions of science and philosophy are insig\u00ac\n nificant. To attempt to formularize these\n grand faiths with exact verbal statement and\n definition were like essaying to confine the\n vast spaces of landscape and firmament with\n wooden frames. When he spoke to us from\n this desk, his great heart sang forth the\n stanzas of jubilant psalmody whose measures\n were as unfettered as the song of birds. It\n was this abounding fullness of faith and\n spontaneity of utterance, united with an ex\u00ac\n traordinarily fertile imagination and affluence\n of verbal resource which made him one of\n the foremost preachers of the age, aye, as\n I fully believe, upon studious and candid\n comparison, the foremost example of pulpit\n eloquence that Christianity has produced.\n</p>\n<p>\n But the preaching gift in this man did not\n represent the inner sanctuary of his moral\n and spiritual resource. Wonderful as he was\n in his addresses to men, he was, if possible,\n still more wonderful in his intercessions for\n human help, poured forth from his great,\n tender heart to the Infinite Father of All.\n Who that ever listened to the public prayers\n of Plymouth\u2019s first pastor will ever forget\n them? In these utterances, which it seems\n almost sacrilege to attempt to describe, he\n swept the whole keyboard of human experi\u00ac\n ence. He carried our joys and sorrows, our\n victories and our defeats up to the throne of\n grace with jubilant thanksgiving and tearful\n intercessions.\n</p>\n<p>\n If the expression may be allowed, there Is\n a genius for public prayer, which is a most\n rare endowment; and this gift was the\n coronal one in the mental and spiritual\n equipment of this wonderful man.\n</p>\n<p>\n The intellectual endowments and acquisi\u00ac\n tions of Plymouth\u2019s first pastor were a\n worthy counterpart of his rich moral and\n religious nature. Most men are hemi-spher-\n ical in their mental development. If they\n are generously endowed on the moral and\n affectional side, they commonly exhibit a\n comparative infirmity in intellectual re\u00ac\n source. If, on the contrary, they possess\n great intellectual gifts and acquisitions, and\n attain high altitudes in science, philosophy\n and erudition, they commonly disappoint ex\u00ac\n pectation on the emotional and sentimental\n side of their natures. But here was a\n spherical man, whose mentality was rounded\n out to something at least approaching ideal\n completeness.\n</p>\n<p>\n I count it a supreme advantage to his in\u00ac\n tellectual equipment that culture never\n alienated him from nature. In fact, he\n lived so close to nature that his literary\n acquisitions, which\u2019were many and varied,\n were at least partly lost sight of in popu\u00ac\n lar appreciation. I know by personal ac\u00ac\n quaintance that he possessed a rich library,\n representing all the great departments of\n literature and that he had an intimate ac\u00ac\n quaintance with the contents thereof. I\n have heard him (to cite a single example)\n rehearse details of the story of ancient art\n which gave evidence of careful culture in\n this relation; and this was at least two\n score years ago, when the little that was\n known of art-history in this country was im\u00ac\n ported from abroad.\n</p>\n<p>\n He had a student\u2019s acquaintance with the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0035/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 197, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 280}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0035/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 394, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 560}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0035/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 789, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1121}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0035/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1579, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2242}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0035/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4484}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0035/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/ec/he/rm/em/or/ia/la/00/un/se/beechermemoriala00unse/beechermemoriala00unse_0035.jp2", "height": 4484, "width": 3159, "levels": 6, "size": 1115583}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"35\">\n<p>\n THE BEECHER MEMORIAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n 33\n</p>\n<p>\n great masters of English style; but they\n never damaged by a hair\u2019s breadth the\n robust individuality of his own style. But;\n though his debt to books was wide and\n varied, he never ceased to be a child and a\n reverent pupil of nature; and from her afflu\u00ac\n ent stores he gathered the largest part of\n his intellectual equipment. He was an obedi\u00ac\n ent follower of the great Teacher of Naza\u00ac\n reth in this regard. Beasts and birds, trees\n and flowers, meadows and gardens were his\n boon companions and told all their secrets\n in his listening ear. He was fully competent\n to teach natural history and horticulture,\n and did so in an eminent degree in the il\u00ac\n lustration of his sermons.\n</p>\n<p>\n Fortunate was it indeed for him, and for\n the world, in this regard, that his child\u00ac\n hood and youth were spent away from the\n distractions and conventionalisms of city\n life. In the plastic period of his mental de\u00ac\n velopment a life in cities might have spoiled\n the great preacher, as it has spoiled many a\n preacher of lesser mental stature.\n</p>\n<p>\n A brief word in passing concerning one\n minor auxiliary of the great preacher\u2019s in\u00ac\n tellectual gifts. This was his delicate and\n overflowing instinct of humor. I have a\n vivid recollection of the concerted cry of\n horror from contemporary pulpits and pews\n in my youthful days at the so-called sacri\u00ac\n legious sallies of wit and humor which were\n occasionally heard in Plymouth pulpit. A\n symphony of alarm was sounded from the\n whole surrounding neighborhood against\n this iconoclast who ruthlessly trampled\n upon the institutes of rhetorical taste and\n the sanctities of pulpit decorum. But the\n alarmists, both lay and clerical, were pow\u00ac\n erless to abolish or modify the great preach\u00ac\n er\u2019s methods in public speech. He had a\n psychological theory of his own concerning\n the reactionary influence of humor upon\n pathos in the relation of moral appeal; and\n he used his rare gift with the spontaneity\n of nature, as well as with most undeniable\n results in popular power.\n</p>\n<p>\n But this dangerous gift was with him the\n overflow of inborn genius, and was never\n forced or perverted to unworthy ends. He\n gave to the humorous instinct occasionally\n a free rein, when, as a subordinate auxiliary\n factor, it could be made the servant of con\u00ac\n science and earnest moral persuasion. But\n he never tried to be funny, as I fear some\n of his small sized imitators have done in\n the disheartening endeavor to supplement\n the infirmities of pulpit commonplace.\n</p>\n<p>\n During the later years of my career as a\n pastor, especially during the six years of my\n ministry in Poughkeepsie, my intercourse\n with the great Plymouth preacher was of a\n character such as is alone possible under\n the inspiration of filial affection. At my\n entrance upon the pastorate over the Con\u00ac\n gregational Church in Poughkeepsie two\n score years ago, he preached my installation\n sermon, whose closing passages, in which\n he addressed me as \u201cthe son of my revered\n friend, son of my heart,\u201d are among the\n most precious and sacred memories of my\n life.\n</p>\n<p>\n The installation service was preceded by\n the traditional examination of the soundness\n of the candidate\u2019s orthodoxy by an ecclesi\u00ac\n astical council of neighboring pastors and\n lay delegates.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of course my old Plymouth pastor, the\n elected preacher of the occasion, was a mem\u00ac\n ber of that council of inquest; but he never\n came near it, but spent the hours of its\n session in making notes for the sermon of\n the evening, which filled several sheets of\n</p>\n<p>\n foolscap ' and which he kindly gave to me\n at the close of the service. This precious\n manuscript I presented several years ago\n 1o the public library of the city of Buf\u00ac\n falo, in whose conservatory of illustrious\n autographs it is sacredly kept in a binding\n of morocco as a relic of inestimable worth.\n</p>\n<p>\n I have \" never been able to find a perfectly\n satisfactory explanation of my old pastor\u2019s\n non-attendance at the preliminary council\n for the examination of the candidate\u2019s the\u00ac\n ology upon this occasion. Possibly the\n preparation of his sermon offered a suffi\u00ac\n cient excuse. But I half suspect that the\n recollection of his own examination on a\n similar occasion, whose story I have related,\n might have made him reluctant to partici\u00ac\n pate in another coroner\u2019s inquest! During\n the concluding period of my ministerial\n career, before my prolonged exile in Europe\n began, I occasionally occupied Plymouth\n pulpit on the pastor\u2019s invitation either on\n exchange or temporary supply. Recalling\n these incidents, I am forcibly reminded of\n Dr. Holmes\u2019 reply on being asked who was\n going to fill Rufus Choate\u2019s place as com\u00ac\n mencement orator in Dartmouth College.\n \u201cNo one is going to fill it,\u201d said the witty\n autocrat, \u201cbut I am going to rattle around\n in it for an hour or so.\u201d On these occasions\n of pulpit exchange to which I have alluded\n one of the pulpits was a rattle box and the\n other was a casket bursting its sides with\n the amplitude of its contents.\n</p>\n<p>\n Before closing up this fragmentary bud\u00ac\n get of memories which connect my life with\n that of the great Plymouth preacher, I\n must recall one incident of monu\u00ac\n mental significance. An event in our na\u00ac\n tional history of moral and political import\n corresponding to the Declaration of Inde\u00ac\n pendence was the raising of the flag of the\n Union at Fort Sumter at the close of the\n Civil War. It was the announcement to the\n world of America\u2019s second birth, as the\n Declaration of Independence was of her first.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was a serious question with our first\n great martyr President and his great War\n Secretary what man of the select apostlcship\n which had been the mouthpiece of the na\u00ac\n tional conscience in that memorable\n struggle, and the long years of moral con\u00ac\n flict which preceded it, should be put for\u00ac\n ward as the fittest orator on that great\n occasion. The result of that deliberation\n has gone into one of the most luminous\n chapters of American history. Of all men\n fitted by eminent oratorical gifts, and brave\n consecration through long years of self-\n sacrifice to voice the nation\u2019s thanksgiving\n at its second birth, Plymouth\u2019s great preach\u00ac\n er was selected as entitled to first place.\n A government steamer was placed at his\n disposal to carry him with his invited guests\n to Charleston for the great celebration and\n return them to New York upon its con\u00ac\n clusion. Having been one of a little group\n of friends whom the orator of the occasion\n invited to accompany him on this memorable\n pilgrimage, I can rehearse its story from\n personal knowledge.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is probable that the speaker selected by\n the government to voice the nation\u2019s thanks\u00ac\n giving on the memorable day never had a\n deeper and more solemn sense of responsi\u00ac\n bility to God and his country for the words\n which he uttered in that address. Con\u00ac\n trary to his usual habit in addressing pub\u00ac\n lic assemblies, both in the pulpit and else\u00ac\n where, he wrote out his oration and read it\n almost verbatim from the manuscript.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is undeniable that the great preacher\n sometimes committed verbal indiscretions\n in his extemporaneous speech, owing to an\n impulsive temperament and the exigencies\n of rapid and unpremeditated utterance. But\n no such transgression could be laid to his\n charge on this great occasion. He had be\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n fore him and around him, crowding in a com\u00ac\n pact mass the blackened and battered walls\n of Fort Sumter, as motley a multitude prob\u00ac\n ably as ever was assembled in a single au\u00ac\n dience. All shades of political opinion,\n from those of the most radical abolitionist\n to those of the most rabid secessionist, were\n represented. There were sullen masters and\n jubilant freedmen, their black faces efful\u00ac\n gent with the joy of this festal day. Rich\n ard poor, learned and illiterate, contrib\u00ac\n uted to swell the mighty multitude. Sol\u00ac\n diers in their soiled and tattered uniforms\n and civilians in their trim holiday attire\n joined hands and htarts and voices in this\n celebration of the nation\u2019s new birth. Never\n was a man more honored, and deservedly\n honored, than was my beloved pastor and\n friend in being elected to voice a nation\u2019s\n thanksgiving on a day and before an audi\u00ac\n ence like unto this. I stood close beside him\n as he read his oration from the manuscript,\n whose leaves fluttered in the sea wind which\n swept over Charleston harbor and bore the\n dear old flag straight out against the blue\n sky. It was a noble testimony, of whose\n grand sentences, uttered with solemn de\u00ac\n liberation and tremulous pathos, I will only\n recall the keynote which dominated the\n whole as one royal tone dominates a mighty\n symphony. That keynote was magnanimity;\n and it was not only the keynote of the Fort\n Sumter oration, but of all the political ut\u00ac\n terances of the great preacher after the\n conclusion of the war of emancipation.\n</p>\n<p>\n This mailed knight, who smote the slave\n power with wrath which knew no mercy,\n knew how to be generous to a vanquished\n foe. We know but too well how tongues of\n slander, like vipers\u2019 fangs, were thrust forth\n at him by reason of this attitude, and how\n magnanimity was called by the odious names\n of political trimming and moral cowardice.\n But whatever were the misinterpretations\n of the heated passions of those fiery days,\n no sane man now believes that Plymouth\u2019s\n first pastor was, or could be, a coward. He\n was of such noble stuff as the confessors\n and martyrs of the ages were made of, and\n not a microscopic particle of a coward\u2019s or\n a political schemer\u2019s mental organism was\n ever detected in his public career. Who\n can recall the courage and self-abnegation\n with which he defied the mobs of America\n and England in defense of his dismembered\n country and the rights of man, and doubt\n for a moment that this governmental dis\u00ac\n tinction at Fort Sumter, which crowned his\n life, was the just reward of unwearied con\u00ac\n secration, through long years of toil and\n patient waiting, to the behests of patriotism\n and humanity?\n</p>\n<p>\n This crowning incident in the public life\n of my beloved pastor and friend must con\u00ac\n clude this fragmentary recital.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of the most precious works of art on\n Manhattan Island is s. painting in a private\n mansion representing the entrance of Duther\n into Y/orms. The great reformer is pictured\n standing with uplifted and defiant face in a\n common market wagon, escorted by a throng\n of unkempt peasants. lie has evidently just\n uttered the battle cry which has resounded\n through the centuries: \u201cir there were as\n many devils in Worms as there are tiles on\n the housetops I would go!\u201d The scene is\n true to history; for a market wagon was\n Luther\u2019s triumphal chariot, and rugged peas\u00ac\n ants were his escort and body .guard on that\n terrible judgment day of ancient hierarchies.\n In that great historical painting I sae a\n symbol of the brave knight of liberty whom\n we commemorate this evening. He sought\n not the patronage of the great in Ills noble\n testimony.

DR. HILLIS,. FEBRUARY 9, 1903.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Hillis, in Plymouth Church, preached\n on the educational value of the Old Testa\u00ac\n ment, taking as his text \u201cOpen Thou Mine\n Eyes,\u201d Psalms xix.\n</p>\n<p>\n This cry for vision power is the cry of all\n truly great natures. As men go toward\n strength, they go toward vision. This is the\n inventor\u2019s cry, open thou mine eyes, that\n I may behold the secrets of fire and steam.\n This is the scientist\u2019s cry, open thou mine\n eyes that I may perceive the typical forms\n in creation. This is the statesman\u2019s cry,\n open thou mine eyes, that I may understand\n the trend of events in the nation. This is\n the artist\u2019s cry, open thou mine eyes that\n I may see ideal beauty. Tell me how many\n window ' s a man has in his soul house, and\n I w : ill tell you his value to the world, and\n the number and richness of his contribu\u00ac\n tions. For the great men are not the speak\u00ac\n ers. proclaiming the truth. The great men\n are not the thinkers, giving the truth sys\u00ac\n tematic form. The great men are not even\n the doers, putting the truth into terms of\n wood and stone and steel. The truly great\n men are the seers, who discover the truth\n as a fresh, new revelation. Once that truth\n lies fully revealed, it is the speaker\u2019s place\n to publish it, the thinker\u2019s place to system\u00ac\n atize it. the doer\u2019s task to work the truth\n into material forms. This gift of visiou,\n therefore, is the supreme gift of God. Only\n an occasional man is born with it. All the\n other talents are susceptible of education,\n but the seer is born, not made. It has been\n beautifully said that w ' e find the diamonds,\n do not make them; uncover the gold, do not\n create it; and society can only accept the\n man of vision, cannot educate him, or build\n him. Unfortunately, when these men appear,\n they are generally set to hewing wood, and\n drawing water, until they break their hearts\n and quench the liame of their genius. But\n their visions mark epochs. That was a great\n moment for society when Darwin saw that\n every glow-worm has a form that is typical\n of the highest life, pointing to evolution.\n That was a great moment for the tenement\n district, when Arnold Toynbee saw what Uni\u00ac\n versity bred men could do by coming to live\n among the poor in Whitechapel. That was\n a ' great\u2019moment for the young men in Re\u00ac\n gent street, London, when Quintin Hogg saw\n what he could do by opening a group of\n rooms for evening classes, that he might in\u00ac\n struct. poor young men, and show them how\n to double their wages. All about us are\n fort;: a oi social 111 and unhappiness. Would\n mat some youth, this day, would cry out,\n \u201cOpen thou mine eyes, that I may discern the\n secret of social reform, and so lessen the\n sorrows of the poor and weak. But righteous\u00ac\n ness and character are like gold uncovered,\n and feeling that personal manhood is like\n deepest treasure, the Psalmist cries out,\n \u201cOpen thou mines eyes, that I may know the\n aecrets of happiness, peace, and character.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Great Book and the Great Things.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our world holds only a few really great\n things. It holds one great name, the name\n of God; one great power, the power that\n makes for righteousness; one great law, and\n leader, the law of love, and Christ; one\n great book that teaches these great truths,\n the Bible. Take it all in all, this divine\n Book holds more condensed wisdom than all\n other books whatsoever. Its theme is that\n this is God\u2019s world, that all events are mov\u00ac\n ing upward; that the tendency of society is\n toward betterment, and that the movement\n among men is like the movement of the\n sea, toward full growth and fruit\u00ac\n age, under the oversight and the presence of\n God. This book is made up of law ' s and\n moral precepts, and poems and prophecies,\n of spiritual principles, with an outlook upon\n the life immortal. To its pages have come\n the heroes, the statesmen, the martyrs and\n the founders of nations. It has been bread\n for the leaders in the hour of hunger; it\n has been a pillar of cloud for the pilgrim\n band by day, in marching through the wil\u00ac\n derness. Strengthened by its spirit, the peo\u00ac\n ple have gone through the seas, as if dry-\n shod. It has been a kind of university for\n the education of the family of man. To it\n the generations have gone as to a treasure\n house, and never once has the pilgrim re\u00ac\n turned empty handed. In an era of tyranny\n this book has been an armory, furnishing\n the oppressed with weapons. In the age of\n superstition and sin, when men have been\n wounded, they have gone to this Book as to\n a hospital, and found medicines. Its prov\u00ac\n erbs alone hold more sound wisdom with\n reference to the buying and selling, and the\n right conduct of life, than the wisdom of the\n entire generation. For into these proverbs\n has been condensed the wisdom of the wis\u00ac\n est men of all the generations. Little won\u00ac\n der, therefore, that this book outsells the\n popular novels. If the new story, every\u00ac\n where advertised, sells by thousands, this\n old Bible sells by tens of thousands. If the\n new tale of love and battle is bound in pa\u00ac\n per, and once read, is quickly forgotten,\n this book is bound in morocco, printed on\n India silk and handed forward from genera\u00ac\n tion to generation. Because of its practical\n value, therefore, when the youth goes forth\n to make his fortune, the mother\u2019s latest,\n last, and richest gift to her boy is the gift\n of his Bible. Understanding its value, there\u00ac\n fore, a poet like Tennyson fills his mind\n with its texts, and his \u201cIn Memoriam\u201d con\u00ac\n tains some three hundred references to these\n pages. The orators, also, feather their ar\u00ac\n rows with its truths, and the editor adorns\n his paragraphs with its principles. No other\n book is so dearly loved. Innumerable\n widows and orphans and men, despoiled and\n broken hearted, have, in the hour of dark\u00ac\n ness, opened these pages, and reading, lo,\n the tears have dried upon the cheeks. Cour\u00ac\n age has come back again upon the heart,\n the hills of difficulty have been leveled and\n</p>\n<p>\n the valleys of defeat have been filled up. It\n has been the poor man\u2019s book, the slave\u2019s\n book, the orphan\u2019s book, while it is none\n the less the book of the prosperous and for\u00ac\n tunate. In the hour of death it is the one\n book that men, who have had it in their\n hands living, have asked for their pillows in\n the hour of dying;.\n</p>\n<p>\n A Handbook of Great Men.\n</p>\n<p>\n Great is the inspirational value of the\n Old Testament, for the reason that it holds\n the portraits of earth\u2019s greatest men. It\n has \u2019been beautifully said that the Bible is\n a kind of Westminster Abbey, in which none\n but the great do sleep. And if it be true,\n that the great institution comes from the\n heart of the great man, if all learning and\n politics, and art and religion represent foot\u00ac\n prints which the giants of intellect have left\n behind, then this book holds the life story\n of earth\u2019s greatest spirits. What a roll call\n of heroes are these men, from Abraham to\n Paul and John. Opening these pages, in that\n far oft age we see Moses, toiling upon the\n foundations of law and liberty. A man who\n seems like some Titan of intellect, a kind\n of demi-god, lifting into place the very\n foundations of society. We see the philos\u00ac\n opher Job justifying the ways of God to man.\n He was the first of the poets who stated\n the problem of suffering, a thinker, who\n tells us that fire sets the colors in the clay,\n that character, like the marble, is slowly\n chiseled by blows, that Job who gives to\n Kant himself the statement that the starry\n heavens and the moral law are the two\n great facts in life. And here is Isaiah, with\n his majesty, and sublimity of spirit, with an\n intellect as lofty as a mountain, with chap\u00ac\n ters as full of great thoughts as the sky\n is full of stars, with a sublime outlook up\u00ac\n on the future of society. Here is Paul,\n unique in his heroism, who has given to us\n the. principles of democracy, equality, lib\u00ac\n erty and charity. And here is John, apostle\n of love, teacher of sweetness and light, with\n his dreams of the soul\u2019s summer land, and\n the new ideal commonwealth, and an era\n when the city of God shall be set up in the\n cities wherein men dwell. Here, also, is\n that divine carpenter\u2019s Son, who spake as\n never man spake, who lived as never man\n lived and loved, who died a death in which\n He forgives His enemies, and who, in going\n away, leaves behind an influence that has\n sweetened the world. What, a company of\n heroes, what models of patriotism and jus\u00ac\n tice, what fidelity to duty, what iucit^wis\n they offer to right living, what food no\n their lives offer to the nation\u2019s youth! Lifted\n up into the heights, these noble spirits seem\n to rain sacred influences upon all toilers\n in the earthly arena below. The inspira\u00ac\n tional value of the great men of the Bible\n is beyond all measurement. Best of all, the\n spirit of this book carries power to re\u00ac\n produce these heroes in the youth of to\u00ac\n day. It has been said that Buddha and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0037/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 197, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 280}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0037/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 394, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 560}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0037/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 789, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1121}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0037/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1579, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2242}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0037/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4484}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0037/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/ec/he/rm/em/or/ia/la/00/un/se/beechermemoriala00unse/beechermemoriala00unse_0037.jp2", "height": 4484, "width": 3159, "levels": 6, "size": 1072924}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"37\">\n<p>\n THE BEECHER MEMORIAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n 35\n</p>\n<p>\n Seneca are solitary in the sky of Rome and\n India, like a single star shining in the night,\n with an awful solitude between. It has been\n said that Marcus Aurelius seems like a\n single palm tree, waving in the desert. But\n it must also be said that Christianity has\n power to propagate itself. That it can take\n its great men and reproduce them in others.\n Thus Jesus Christ repeats Himself in the\n apostles, and the apostles repeat themselves\n in the seventy, and the seventy repeat them\u00ac\n selves in the five thousand, and the five\n thousand repeat themselves in the millions\n of every nation, and country and tribe. The\n great men never die. History stores up\n their noble deeds as food for coming genera\u00ac\n tions. And looking toward these great men\n in the Bible, we ourselves are lifted to their\n , level..\n</p>\n<p>\n The Educational \" Value of the Old Testa\u00ac\n ment.\n</p>\n<p>\n Consider the educational value of the Old\n Testament. It is not too much to say that\n this book is the world\u2019s handbook of peda\u00ac\n gogy. Its favorite word is wisdom, its fun\u00ac\n damental method is education. The figures\n It uses are all seminal. Thus the soul is\n a seed that expands and takes on the stature\n of a tree. The truth is leaven that lends\n sweetness and light to the whole lump. In\u00ac\n fluence is like the little stone cut out of the\n mountain, that swells until it fills the whole\n earth. Even from the commercial stand\u00ac\n point, wisdom is better than rubies, and\n knowledge more precious than fine gold. In\n no other book does the word education bulk\n so largely. The very institutions that it\n founds are educatory. Witness the Sabbath,\n which is really the day for the intellect\u2014the\n library day, the gallery day, the day for\n solitude, self-culture and personal growth.\n Indeed, there is not one single educational\n Institution emphasized, but that we can trace\n It back to the Old Testament. The greatest\n Institution we have is the family. The father\n and mother are the first teachers in this\n school; rising up early and sitting up late,\n they drill their children in the principles\n and duties of right living. Every Jewish\n family teaches the child a trade and occupa\u00ac\n tion, so that in the event of financial re\u00ac\n verses he will not be stranded. The very\n words pauper and beggar were unknown\n words In this book, and when father and\n mother had reached their limit in the home\n school, the teacher was brought in with his\n questions and answers and lectures. He\n gives to us the basis of the common school,\n the lecture hall and the library. Singularly\n enough, the Old Testament holds the begin\u00ac\n nings of the modern lyceum, the Chautauqua\n system and the University Extension method.\n A recent book on pedagogy takes no account\n of this fact, but fact it is.\n</p>\n<p>\n Three times a year the Jewish race went\n up to Jerusalem for two weeks. Sometimes\n the pilgrims numbered a million. The mul\u00ac\n titude assembled on the hillside, that made\n a natural amphitheater. The wisest men,\n men with the power of instruction, speakers,\n poets, prophets, arose and expounded the\n principles of religious truth, and social\n truth, and political truth, and spiritual\n truth. These bands of pilgrims from the\n North of Palestine took four days Jor the\n journey to Jerusalem. They journeyed in\n groups of twenty families. When the dark\u00ac\n ness fell they set up their tents and lighted\n the camp fire. Then, seated around the fire,\n the fathers rehearsed the story of God\u2019s\n dealing with the nation\u2014the career of the\n heroes and martyrs\u2014and while the wise men\n talked, often some young Samuel crept closer\n</p>\n<p>\n to his mother\u2019s arms and with tears and sobs\n dedicated his life to the service of his peo\u00ac\n ple. Thus the peripatetic lectureship was\n slowly developed, and the influence of these\n pilgrimages to Jerusalem was immeasurable.\n It made the peasant to be a citizen of the\n universe. It brought the boy from the shop\n in Nazareth into touch with the greatest\n bankers and soldiers and business men of the\n cities of the Euphrates on the east, and of\n Ephesus on the west. One knows not what\n other plan could have been devised for de\u00ac\n veloping patriotism and culture that was\n half so efficient. We all know what the\n world\u2019s fair did for our country. The mil\u00ac\n lions went to Chicago, to that feast of the\n beautiful. What art! What architecture!\n What a temple of honor! What products\n from the loom and shop! What pictures!\n What models for homes! Little wonder that\n within a year the architects of the North\u00ac\n west found their business quadrupled. From\n that event dates a new and higher grade of\n clothing and furniture demanded by the peo\u00ac\n ple who purchase. What immeasurable good\n would result if all the people of this country\n could make their way to the great center for\n a fortnight, three times a year. If all the\n Southern people, black and white, could come\n to New York for six weeks, it would go far\n to settle the Southern problem, and if all the\n people of New York who in a single hour\n could settle the Southern question could go\n South for six weeks, that Southern problem\n would not be settled for some time to come.\n If all the provincial Western people could\n come East, they would change their accent,\n and if all the provincial people in the East\n could go West, they would learn how to\n speak good English. Dublin needs London,\n and London needs Dublin. That was the\n value of the Lyceum founded by Emerson,\n and his co-workers. It was a peripatetic\n lectureship. And that was the value of the\n great, feasts that assembled the Jews in Jeru\u00ac\n salem. From that Feast of Tabernacles we\n have the lyceum, the lecture hall, the college\n class rooms, the Chautauquas, the University\n Extension lectures. The very singing school\n and the higher music we owe to the Old Tes\u00ac\n tament. After the public addresses in Jeru\u00ac\n salem, the elders assembled the people in\n tho evening for worship. Then a thousand\n priests on the one side chanted \u201cThe Lord of\n Hosts is With Us.\u201d Then a hundred and fifty\n worshippers chanted back, \u201cThe God of Jacob\n is our refuge.\u201d \u201cWherewithal shall a young\n man cleanse his ways?\u201d chanted the multi\u00ac\n tude of priests, and then, with a voice like\n the voice of many waters, the people an\u00ac\n swered, \u201cBy taking heed thereto according\n to Thy word.\u201d The solemn chords were\n strengthened by cymbals and flutes and\n horns, and thus the Jewish faith was sung\n into the minds and hearts of the Jewish peo\u00ac\n ple. And those great scenes in that old He\u00ac\n brew city are among the most striking and\n memorable that our earth has ever wit\u00ac\n nessed. Little wonder that the nation whose\n children and youth were trained therein be\u00ac\n came the most influential nation in history.\n What would one not give for one church that\n trained its sons and daughters in patriotism,\n in ' heroism, in liberty and in religion after\n the methods of education that are set forth\n in this old book.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Old Testament and Law.\n</p>\n<p>\n Consider the light that the Old Testament\n throws upon our laws and political institu\u00ac\n tions. Our jurists love tp emphasize our in\u00ac\n debtedness to the old Roman law. They\n never tire of quoting from Marshall, and\n Story, and Blackstone. They remind us that\n Louisiana has the Code Napoleon. That\n</p>\n<p>\n Napoleon\u2019s code was based upon the old\n Roman law, with its study of the law of per\u00ac\n sons, the law of property and the law of\n things. But the Roman law very largely\n perished during the Middle Ages. When the\n Holy Roman Empire fell, the Roman law\n fell with it. When the darkness of the\n Middle Ages cleared away, and society once\n more emerged into the light, the leaders of\n the people bore in their hands the Old Testa\u00ac\n ment long before Augustine had dreamed\n his dream of the city of God into the ideal\n commonwealth. But that new city, whose\n streets are to hold no pauper, no drunkard,\n no slave, no transgressor, was founded upon\n the laws of Moses. It was to these laws\n also that Calvin went, speaking the prin\u00ac\n ciples of representative government. It was\n to the Old Testament that Cromwell and\n Hampden and Pym went, Just as the builder\n of a cathedral goes to the quarry for hie\n material. To-morrow, when the jurist writes\n his decision, it will be upon the ba6ia of\n Mosc-s\u2019 commandments.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Old Testament and the Welfare of\n the People,\n</p>\n<p>\n Consider the relation between the Old Tes\u00ac\n tament and government in the interests of\n the welfare of the people. Strictly speaking,\n there have been two theories of govern\u00ac\n ment. One theory believes In giving man\n the least possible government, the other be\u00ac\n lieves in giving him much government, but\n making that government relate to his trade\n and commeroe. But the government, of the\n Old Testament was always with reference to\n the welfare of men\u2014the manufacture of\n souls of a good quality was the object of its\n legislation. Mother Nature gives us the\n laws of the rain, but those laws are at\u00ac\n tended with all manner of good fortune\n through the upspringing grass and flowers\n and the ripening fruits. She gives us the\n laws of heat and light, but these laws are\n attended with color, in the rose, in the\n landscape, in the evening clouds. Nature\n is not contented with negatives that hold\n men back from wrongdoing; she sets cer\u00ac\n tain positives that cause the barn to over\u00ac\n flow with abundance and the life to be\n blessed with abundance and prosperity. But\n too often our government seems like a mere\n device for caring for everything excepting\n men. The Cuban question is settled in terms\n of sugar. The Philippine question is settled\n in terms of territory. The great debate is\n on the River and Harbor bill. Some years\n ago, a congressman, having voted for In\u00ac\n numerable bills, grants, subsidies, bounties,\n gifts, loot for the others, wanted a bill for\n his own constituents. He brought In a bill\n to improve a river in his own county. When\n the bill was passed it became necessary to\n find the river on the map.

The\n way to quadruple wealth is to double the\n power of intelligence and manhood.

London has just passed a new\n law that is somewhat grandmotherly. When\n a man is found drunk, he is photographed,\n his photograph is manifolded and sent to\n all the innkeepers. Henceforth, if any inn\n keeper sells that man liquor, he loses his\n license. In the second week after that law\n was passed London suddenly found herself\n sober. But all the laws in the Old Testa\u00ac\n ment days W ' erc in the interest of men. They\n believed that in manufacturing men of a\n good quality, these men would take care of\n their trade and commerce. Our legislatures\n begin at the other extreme, and say that if\n we can take care of the mud in rivers and\n of the tariff on sugar and cotton and iron,\n that men can take care of themselves. As\n if there was any excuse for this world, save\n man, and man building! As if there \" were\n anything save man that was dear unto God!\n Some day, legislators will reopen the Old\n Testament and read the laws in this Divine\n Book, and find in it the models of their\n state enactments. And when they do so,\n the state will go forward in wealth and\n prosperity by leaps and bounds, and once\n more there will be happiness in the home\n and abundance in the fields.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Old Testament and Philanthropy.\n</p>\n<p>\n Consider the influence of the Old Testa\u00ac\n ment upon the institutions that make for the\n</p>\n<p>\n amelioration of human sorrow. It was\n through this book that the heart has entered\n the world\u2019s arena. Hitherto the intellect\n had been supreme. It was intellect that\n built the pyramids, upon which an hun\u00ac\n dred and twenty thousand slaves wrought\n and shed their life blood. It was intellect\n that fashioned the Panthenon, at a time when\n the white slave was contemptible. Intellect\n fashioned the Coliseum at a time when art\n and blood and poetry and lust and luxury\n and murder went hand in hand. In that era\n the life of a slave, a wife or a child was\n held at a trifle. Caesar slew the Gauls to\n win honor and fame, and his friends in turn\n slew him that they might have fame and\n place. One emperor butchered twenty thou\u00ac\n sand men in a single feast to make a Roman\n holiday. One of the good emperors was so\n good and kind that he limited the number\n of gladiators that could be killed on a sin\u00ac\n gle afternon to an hundred and twenty and\n was called \u201cthe tender hearted emperor.\u201d\n But there are eight thousand men and wo\u00ac\n men pulling and hauling and clamoring for\n their tickets in the Coliseum, to feast their\n eyes on the bloody spectacle. Indeed, so\n wise a man as Pliny wrote a letter to a\n friend, praising his thoughtfulness in having\n a gladiatorial fight at his wife\u2019s funeral,\n saying that \u201cWe all forgot our tears and\n sorrow in that hour of pleasure.\u201d So long\n as his own tears were forgotten it was\n nothing to him that the homes of twenty\n gladiators were filled with mourning if only\n he had a little amusement. For that reason,\n an actor said, that if a Booth, or a Forrest,\n a Cushman or a Siddons could have appeared\n in the Coliseum they would not have re\u00ac\n ceived even a passing glance. But when this\n Old Testament came in, soon all was changed.\n Was a man a debtor? The creditor must\n not take away his cloak or tool. Was a\n woman a widow, or orphan? Boaz must al\u00ac\n low young Ruth to glean and pick up many\n handfuls of wheat. Was a pilgrim returning\n home from a far journey? Passing through\n the orchard or fields he could satisfy his\n hunger, though he must not carry anything\n away in his sack. From that hour the\n</p>\n<p>\n prophets began to build asylums for the\n poor, the apostles took the orphan children\n into their homes, the missionaries lifted the\n shield above the slave, the blind and the\n lame. At length a day came when the genius\n of the great, like Dickens and Stowe, was\n consecrated to the life of the slave.\n</p>\n<p>\n Conclusion.\n</p>\n<p>\n The world is growing old. But the world\n will never outgrow either the message or\n mission of this book. If a thousand genera\u00ac\n tions from now there is a heart that aches,\n a prodigal whose feet have stumbled, if then\n the tears fall like rain, if man remains man,\n and love remains love, and death remains\n death, this book will remain, shining like\n the all-lustrous sun. Read this book, there\u00ac\n fore, for life and liberty. Read it for refine\u00ac\n ment and culture. Read these pages that\n once were wet with your mother\u2019s\n tears. Read these precepts your\n father dearly loved, and by which\n he guided his life. Stoop to these\n life springs, where the patriots and reform\u00ac\n ers and the heroes of lime knelt to cool their\n parched lips. This book holds youth for old\n men. It holds maturity for children and\n youth. It is medicine for the heartbroken,\n the bankrupt and the dismayed. It\n is life for those trembling on the\n brink of death. If for one day in each week,\n through a period of five years, the children\n and youth of this city could be induced to\n read and obey its principles, and to nourish\n life upon its truths, all danger of anarchy\n and revolution would pass away forever. The\n jails would be closed, the saloons would be\n deserted. The schools would be crowded. A\n new glory would fall ' upon the library and\n forum. A new era would dawn for music\n and poetry. Architecture would tax itself\n for glorious temples, art would enter upon\n a new epoch and liberty find a new mean\u00ac\n ing. All society would enter upon a great\n forward movement. For God\u2019s book of light\n and mercy for the intellect is His book of\n hope and progress for society and civiliza\u00ac\n tion.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0039/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 197, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 280}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0039/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 394, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 560}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0039/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 789, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1121}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0039/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1579, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2242}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0039/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4484}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0039/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/ec/he/rm/em/or/ia/la/00/un/se/beechermemoriala00unse/beechermemoriala00unse_0039.jp2", "height": 4484, "width": 3159, "levels": 6, "size": 937658}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"39\">\n<p>\n ike Beatity of Cfwist*$ Character\n</p>\n<p>\n SERMON BY THE REV. DR, HILLIS, FEBRUARY 16. 1903.\n</p>\n<p>\n Text, \" We have found the Christ,\u201d John 1.\n</p>\n<p>\n Next to tales of heroism and martyrdom\n come tales of discovery. Children and men\n alike want to know how the inventor dis\u00ac\n covered his tool, how the miner found his\n treasure, how the chemist discovered his\n new light; how the physician discovered his\n ether. Indeed, a book rehearsing the hero\u00ac\n ism of the great discoverers and the romance\n of the great inventions would be a book that\n would outsell all the novels. Among these\n stories of the great discoveries four are of\n the first order of interest. One is in Xeno\u00ac\n phon\u2019s \" Retreat of the Ten Thousand\u201d and\n this is the story of the discovery of the sea.\n The Greek army was defeated, the handful\n of soldiers were a thousand miles in the in\u00ac\n terior; they had rivers to swim, mountains\n to scale, forests to thread\u2014the battle lasted\n a hundred days and a hundred nights. One\n day, coming to a hilltop, they looked down\n and beheld the waters of the Black Sea at\n their feet. At that moment they forgot their\n rags, their wounds, their starvation. In a\n delerium of joy exulting they shouted: \" The\n sea! the sea!\u201d and running down they cast\n themselves in the blue waters that were\n to bear th ' em home. Though a hundred\n times I have read that story of the moment\n when the sea broke in upon their vision,\n yet a hundred times, also, the cold thrill\n has swept over me. In the realm of as\u00ac\n tronomy the next great discovery is the\n discovery of that star. An astronomer had\n noted the perturbations of Uranus. He\n could account for this only by the existence\n of a planet hitherto unknown and he sug\u00ac\n gested that the astronomers study that part\n of the heavens where that planet was likely\n to appear. To one astronomer the existence\n of this new planet seemed an all but incred\u00ac\n ible thing, yet that night he began to search\n the sky. Suddenly, the light that he saw\n struck him, he says, \" like a blow in the\n face.\u201d He stared and could scarce believe\n his senses. Then, putting his finger upon his\n lips, he arose and uncovered. A new planet\n bad rolled solemnly into the sight of man;\n all Lhe old astronomies had to be rewritten.\n The third discovery is from the viewpoint\n of the geographer. The historians have\n made us all familiar with the moment when\n Columbus sprang from his boat, knelt down\n upon the shore, took possession of the new\n world in the name of his king. But we now\n understand that that moment of discovery\n had its greatness, not because a new path\u00ac\n way to India had been found, but because\n God had given the race one more opportunity\n to lay the foundations of liberty. But great\n as was the discovery of that star and of the\n sea, which was to bring the soldiers home,\n and of the continent where a new experi\u00ac\n ment was to be made in the interests of\n liberty, we must all confess that this dra\u00ac\n matic moment, when these Hebrews returned\n</p>\n<p>\n saying: \" We have found the Christ, for\n whom all the world doth seek,\u201d was the\n most dramatic moment in the history of\n society. That was the watershed in history.\n Toward the hour of that discovery all pre\u00ac\n vious events had sloped. From that point\n all modern institutions take their rise. The\n discovery was a world discovery, the cry,\n \u201cWe have found Him for whom all the world\n seeks,\u201d was a world cry. It was as if they\n were pupils and said: \" We have found the\n world Teacher; when He speaks the clouds\n of error dissolve and the darkness disap\u00ac\n pears. We have found the world Leader;\n His music is world music; His song has a\n charm beyond Apollo\u2019s lute, and He will yet\n lead us out of the wilderness. We have\n found the world Example: He makes\n goodness alluring; He discloses perfect man\u00ac\n hood; He hath revealed ourselves unto our\u00ac\n selves.\u201d What a moment was this, when the\n Hebrew seer and the Greek scholar and the\n Roman soldier and the world merchants had\n but onq cry, \" We have found Him for whom\n all the world doth seek.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Beauty and Perfection of Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n Consider the beauty of Christ, for whom\n the world naturally seeks- Gone forever the\n day when men are ignorant of Christ\u2019s story.\n For fifty years His name has been the center\n of interest. Literally He has been as one\n walking through the flames of criticism. The\n life and work of no other teacher has been\n subjected to such pitiless scrutiny. Once\n men said that. He was a myth, that His\n words were wonder tales, that His story was\n a gradual growth, a legend, and the response\n was the investigations of the scholars. They\n have searched His career with lighted can\u00ac\n dles. Every word and every sentence has\n been pulled in pieces. The fire with which\n gold is tested and the acids with w ' hich met\u00ac\n als were tried are simple tests in comparison\n with these in which the Gospels have been\n tried. After fifty years His story stands.\n We now know that it was the era of lawyers\n like Cicero, that the rules of evidence were\n never better known. All along the line He\n has been victorious. No scholar is any\n longer ashamed of Christ\u2019s story. No infidel\n livds to-day who is willing to stain the fair\n name of Christ. I know of no publishing\n house that will blacken a page and no hand\n that will write a line that contains an asper\u00ac\n sion of Christ\u2019s career. This is a world of\n testimony: \u201cWho is there that convicteth\n this Divine Carpenter of sin?\u201d His prayer\n is the universal prayer. His name for God,\n Our Father, is becoming the universal name.\n His law of love is the universal law. So\n beautiful are His parables that from the\n viewpoint of literary art they are the despair\n of all authors. So inclusive were His pleas\n for the poor and 3 weak, the orphan, the\n children, the prodigals, the lame, the sick,\n the halt, the blind, as that He anticipated all\n</p>\n<p>\n the reforms and philanthropies. Above all\n else His character has a marvelous perfec\u00ac\n tion. Other men have slowly grown, learn\u00ac\n ing through mistake; in the light of to-day\u2019s\n experience yesterday\u2019s wisdom becomes fool\u00ac\n ishness for other men. Our heroes all have\n to retrace their steps and confess that \" here\n I erred, and there I was mistaken.\u201d But\n Christ never retraces His steps. His prog\u00ac\n ress is an orderly growth. He was perfect\n as a child. How beautiful that scene in the\n temple that exhibits His perKct youth. And\n how glorious the perfection of His manhood.\n In April the bud is perfect as a bud, un\u00ac\n blown. In May the bough of blossoms bursts\n into full bloom and is perfect in the bloom\u00ac\n ing. In June the young fruit is perfect as\n growing fruit. In August the fruit is ripe,\n struck through and through with richness,\n and is perfect in its maturity. But this\n fruit never has to retrace its steps, to correct\n the previous mistake. The growth marches\n straight from the bud to the full-orbed fruit.\n It is an ordered development and a perfect\n growth. Not otherwise was it with Christ,\n whom we cannot convict of sin or imperfec\u00ac\n tion, as He moves from the perfect childhood\n toward the perfect man. Of no other leader\n in his chosen department can we speak in\n this way. Grant was a great general, but\n he must divide his name and fame with Lee;\n Darwin is a great philosopher, but he must\n share his laurels with Wallace and Spencer;\n Tennyson is a great poet, but there are a\n score of poets between Wordsworth and Ho\u00ac\n mer. But Christ is a star that is solitary.\n All about Him dwells a great silence. His\n name never shines so brightly as when we\n put beside it other great names. The time\n was when men spake of Confucius, and Bud\u00ac\n dha, and Mahomet, and Christ. But that\n time has gone forever- The Chinaman of\n to-day is the fleshed copy of Confucius\u2019 teach\u00ac\n ings, and the best Chinaman that lives fails\n as an ideal even for the worst man. Max\n Muller\u2019s translations of the Indian books\n and the expurgated pages pricked the Indian\n bubble of Buddha. Mahomet\u2019s harems, trans\u00ac\n planted to heaven, have ended Mahomet\u2019s ca\u00ac\n reer. To-day he would be a brave man who\n could look into a pure American woman\u2019s\n eyes and deliberately say that he reverenced\n the character of Mahomet. A little wisdom\n is a dangerous thing, but much knowledge\n in comparative religion has made it impos\u00ac\n sible to mention Confucius and Mahomet\n with Christ. It is like saying \" the Atlantic\n and the Pacific, and the Erie Canal.\u201d It Is\n like saying \u201cthe electric bulb and the Wels-\n bach burner and the summer\u2019s sun.\u201d We\n all understand that there is one supreme\n name, because there is ne perfect body of\n teaching, the teachings of Christ; one perfect\n manhood, Christ\u2019s manhood; cne who has\n revealed God\u2019s fatherhood and His love; and\n this one is the person whom all the world is\n seeking.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0040/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 194, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0040/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 388, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 558}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0040/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 777, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1117}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0040/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1555, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2234}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0040/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3111, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4468}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0040/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/ec/he/rm/em/or/ia/la/00/un/se/beechermemoriala00unse/beechermemoriala00unse_0040.jp2", "height": 4468, "width": 3111, "levels": 6, "size": 1116847}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"40\">\n<p>\n 88\n</p>\n<p>\n THE BEECHER MEMORIAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Beauty of the Christian Life.\n</p>\n<p>\n Consider the beauty of a Christian life.\n When this ideal example and teacher calls\n men unto Him He calls them to His own\n perfect manhood. All His overtures are\n overtures toward strength, toward growth,\n toward fullness and beauty of manhood.\n Other standards and measurements of perfec\u00ac\n tion there may be, but in comparison all\n these are imperfect. It is a singular fact\n that the flesh and blood heroes are all made\n to seem real because the novelist includes\n some weakness and imperfection. If he is a\n perfect man he is held to be unnatural, not\n true to our race. Perhaps it could not be\n otherwise. Is the hero a soldier? When\n Robert Bruce leads his men into battle he\n cannot keep his plume white or his linen\n spotless. When he returns from the strife\n his shield is dented, his sword nicked, his\n garments begrimed, his body full of bloody\n gashes. Excess is in the very nature of the\n soldier\u2019s fight, it is a struggle unto death.\n Is the hero a leader? In the revolt against\n tyranny a man of oak and rock, like Oliver\n Cromwe ) in try ng to go far enough, goe3\n too far, and falls upon error. Is the hero\n a moral leader, like Martin Luther? A man\n who reforms evils must be as full of moral\n indignation as the storm is full of thunder\u00ac\n bolts. There are hours for Luther when he\n rages like a lion. The command is that the\n man is to be angry and sin not, but when\n Martin Luther was angry he sinned. Some of\n you, I discern, are Calvinists; but Calvin\n was no man of perfection. He was all in\u00ac\n tellect, cold as steel, bloodless as marble.\n He could burn Servetus without a single\n throb of pity, for he was a kind of animated\n Intellectual philosophy. He was great in his\n own realm, but he was a fragment, an arc,\n a segment, not the circle. And where will\n you go to find the man who is not a frag\u00ac\n ment? If you seek the strength of Samuel\n Johnson, lo, he is gruff and rough. If you\n seek the refinement and delicacy of the\n patrician gentleman, lo, he is dilettanti, too\n soft for this rough world\u2019s work. But when\n you come to the character of Jesus Christ,\n how are all the contradictory traits united\n in one full-orbed excellence. He can speak\n tenderly to children, and not too tenderly.\n He can speak sternly to Pharisees and hypo\u00ac\n crites, and yet not close the door of hope. He\n can cling to the past with all that is good in\n Jewish history as conservative. He is the\n great reformer, with His face toward the\n future, marching toward new achievements\n and leading the hosts toward the heights.\n He is the friend of the strong, the rich,\n the rulers, for He understands them. He\n is the friends of the ignorant, the poor\n and the slave, for He sympathizes with their\n sorrows. He gathers unto Himself every\n conceivable excellence and therefore is the\n Son of Man. But He is the living Christ;\n what He was to those disciples of old He\n is to men now. I do not know how, I cannot\n explain His method, but some of us know\n the fact that be walks with us, talks with us\n and teaches us; that all we are and all we\n hope to be we owe to Him; that from Him\n we have borrowed our little wisdom, that\n He has lent us our little sweetness and\n light; that when our hearts beat high with\n hope it is the result of a new strength that\n He has infused; that it is His ideal for us\n that ever tempts and allures us upward.\n How great a promise is this, \u201cI have come\n that ye may have life.\u201d Life! That is what\n all the world\u2019s a seeking. More life and sap\n in the vine, that will grow to clusters. More\n life and sweeter and richer in the tree, that\n it may ripen the golden treasure named the\n</p>\n<p>\n orange. More life, arterial blood in the body\n for the athlete. More life for the intellect of\n the scholar! More life and love of beauty\n for the imagination of the artist. We faint\n because we fail in life; we stride on up t*he\n hill of difficulty when the life currents run\n strong. Oft we faint and sicken and are\n ready to fall, but if we only had life, and lo,\n He is the life giver, deepening, sweetening\n and enriching. Therefore this is a world\n cry, We have found Him whom all the world\n doth seek.\n</p>\n<p>\n Misconception of the Christian Life.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some there are who, misunderstanding,\n have misinterpreted the beauty of the Chris\u00ac\n tian life. They think of it in terms of lim\u00ac\n itation. To go toward the Christian life is\n to give up this pleasure, to give up that\n amusement, to close that open door, and to\n narrow themselves into a dungeon. Their\n interpreter of the Christian life is John the\n Baptist. He exchanged soft raiment for\n liair-cloth, good food for locusts, and his\n home for a cave in the desert. And they find\n certain words of Christ that seem to sup\u00ac\n port that theory of the Christian life. Did\n not Jesus say, \u2018\u2018If thine eye offend thee, pluck\n it out; if thine hand offend thee, cut it off?\u201d\n And did He not bid men forsake father and\n mother, and wi\u00a3e and children and land? Is\n not this an inlunction toward asceticism?\n Therefore Simon Stylites climbed his column\n in the desert. Then the hermits left the\n cities and dug caves in the desert, the monks\n refused marriage, the men of the Middle\n Ages rolled themselves in mud and refused\n cleanliness, and bed, and food, and raiment.\n At last even the great Catholic church made\n religion to be of two kinds, a religion that\n is \u201csufficient\u201d for the merchants, that God\n will accept for the time being, and \u201ctrue\n religion and pure,\u201d as represented by the\n monk and the nun. In a later reaction,\n Tolstoi goes a step farther, and announces\n that he will eat nothing but dry bread, wear\n nothing but a peasant\u2019s cloak, go barefooted,\n give up his pictures, his horses, his rare\n books, his mansion, his lands, because this\n is what Christ commands. Professor Har-\n naclt thinks that the great world will eager\u00ac\n ly clutch at Tolstoi\u2019s interpretation, and for\n good reason. They say, this ascetic inter\u00ac\n pretation of Christianity is the true one, and\n therefore Christianity in no way concerns\n us. It is not practical, and it does not rep\u00ac\n resent God or His world. God made the\n ores, the forests and the harvests, and the\n trees for us to tend and use and enjoy. And\n since Christ\u2019s philosophy of life forbids the\n tending this world garden to use it or enjoy\n it, Hi3 gospel in no wise concerns us. So\n multitudes gladly welcome this ascetic the\u00ac\n ory. But Christ taught no such view of life,\n lie calls mer not to narrowness and limita\u00ac\n tion. H. does not exclude the great world,\n but He includes it. Consider the contrast\n between John the Baptist and Christ. John\n is a hermit; Jesus Christ is a radiant, genial\n companion. John eats locusts, but men said\n of Jesus, when He went to Simon\u2019s house,\n that He was a glutton and a wine-bibber.\n John withdraws into the desert from men,\n like the monks; Jesus goes straight into the\n homes of the poor, into the market place,\n where the people are. With the people Jesus\n lives, and with the people He dies. He went\n to the wadding, and rejoices at the be\u00ac\n trothal service. He is in the fields when\n the men separate the poppies from the yel\u00ac\n low wheat. He mingles with the men in the\n market place ,and with them studies Caesar\u2019s\n image in the gold coin. He is oft in the\n boats on the lake with the fishermen. He\n</p>\n<p>\n loves the children. He lingers in the homes\n of the poor, He attends the banquets of tho\n great. Whatever concerns His fellowmen is\n of interest to Him. He loves birds, He\n loves the wild lilies in the field, He watches\n the clouds, drifting home, He keeps His\n tryst with God midst the corn sheaves. Oft\n when men go to their houses He makes His\n way to the Mount of Olives. Looking toward\n the stars, He questions those who dwell\n above and beyond them. Oh, what fullness\n of life! He is the universal man, in His\n culture, and His followers must be cosmic in\n their development. The world has never yet\n seen the ideal Christian. The scientist tells\n us that these new discoveries in Holland,\n where these new species of flowers are now\n being developed, that the world is on the\n era of finding new species of fruits, hither\u00ac\n to undreamed of; that we do not know what\n fruit is, as yet; that we are going to have\n an apple, with all its qualities, that is afi\n juicy as the grape fruit; that we are goin*\n to have a pineapple that will be as delicate\n and rich in its dripping aroma, as the peach;\n that the combinations are to bring the race\n foods and fruits hitherto supposed impossi\u00ac\n ble. I know nothing about that, but one\n thing is certain, the Christian disciple is yet\n to come, and when he comes he will realize\n that God and Christ stand back of all cul\u00ac\n ture. This Christian disciple will love mu\u00ac\n sic, and all sweet sounds; he will love color\n and form, with everything that makes for\n the beautiful in art and marble and architec\u00ac\n ture. He will love invention, and under\u00ac\n stand the charm of the factory and shop.\n He will love the mart of busy men, where\n men crowd and throng. He will love the\n library, and take all wisdom for his prov\u00ac\n ince. He will stand under the stars, that\n over him are silent; he will stand beside the\n graves, that under him are still. He will\n go through the fields and the thoughts of\n God\u2019s presence will spring up about_himjas\n thick as the flowers in the grass, but more\n beautiful; and he will look up toward the\n stars in the sky, and the lights will glow\n brighter than these stars. He will be a\n planetary man, but full-orbed in his culture;\n he will be radiant with beauty, because he\n has caught the likeness of his master, and\n has repeated in himself the qualities of this\n perfect man, for whom all the world doth\n seek. How great is Christ\u2019s goodness, yes,\n but how great is His beauty also!\n</p>\n<p>\n The Attractiveness of the Christian Life.\n</p>\n<p>\n Consider, then, the attractiveness of the\n Christian life. How strange that all men do\n not press and throng into this way that Christ\n called narrow. The time has come when that\n path that leads to the lecture hall and library\n is full of allurement. The nsultitudee no\n longer go with lagging steps, flogged toward\n the temple of knowledge, and yet that way\n that is named Christ is a thousand-fold more\n beautiful. It is a quiet way\u2014as tranquil as\n Addison\u2019s Walk in Magdalen grounds in Ox\u00ac\n ford. It is a winsome path, as winsome\n association, as rich as that path where Dante\n walked, and dreamed of that Beatrice who\n was in the sky. It is a noble way, historic,\n like that Appian Way that hath resounded\n with innumerable triumphal processions. It\n is a way that leads toward beauty and sub\u00ac\n limity like those steps that led toward the\n Parthenon, for which men prepared by put\u00ac\n ting on white robes, and cleaning their per\u00ac\n sons, and perfuming their garments, and\n lighting the torch upon which exhaled sweet\n incense. But all ways whatsoever united fail\n to interpret to us the way of the Christ\n \u2022 and the Christian life. He who walks therein\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0041/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 197, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 280}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0041/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 394, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 560}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0041/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 789, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1121}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0041/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1579, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2242}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0041/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3159, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4484}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:ec:he:rm:em:or:ia:la:00:un:se:beechermemoriala00unse:beechermemoriala00unse_0041/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/ec/he/rm/em/or/ia/la/00/un/se/beechermemoriala00unse/beechermemoriala00unse_0041.jp2", "height": 4484, "width": 3159, "levels": 6, "size": 753419}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"41\">\n<p>\n THE BEECHER MEMORIAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3D\n</p>\n<p>\n will have a hungry heart, thirsting for right\u00ac\n eousness, will have eyes that are pure, con\u00ac\n taining no mud, eyes that are homes of silent\n prayer, and a pure heart that sees God.\n And he would he pure in spirit, modest and\n gentle, preferring others to himself, he will\n be meek and quiet, with the meekness of\n majesty and the quietness of one who is\n conscious that he is a king. He will endure\n persecution for righteousness\u2019 sake, for he\n is fully conscious of his reserves, and that\n he is equal to any emergency, for he can do\n all things through Christ who strengtheneth\n him. And all this inner strength of manhood\n blossoms into beauty.\n</p>\n<p>\n Character and Beauty.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the vineyard, when the clusters are ripe,\n they take on a purple beauty. In the fields,\n when the sheaf is mature, it takes on a\n golden luster. In the forest, when the sum\u00ac\n mer is ended, the bough takes on the au\u00ac\n tumnal splendor. In the cradle, when the\n babe is healthy; its cheek takes on the tints\n of rose and pearl. And in the Christian\n life, when the disciple takes on Christ\u2019s like\u00ac\n ness, his strength blossoms into beauty.\n Then the homeliest face shines, then the\n humblest talent becomes radiant. Then the\n peasant takes on the dignity of a prince,\n and the son of God. Oh, how beautiful this\n lif\u00a3! Paul characterizes the Christian by the\n fruits of Christ\u2019s spirit. Christ\u2019s love is the\n sun and the warm atmosphere in which the\n disciple grows and ripens. Love is one kind\n of fruit, and joy is another, and long suffer\u00ac\n ing is another. Are not these beautiful qual\u00ac\n ities? Do you see ihis youth and maiden,\n unto whom love hath come? Oh, wonder of\n wonders! Every hour now has doubled its\n value. Ambition has become higher and\n finer. Love has made their burdens light.\n Love has cast a sacred light and spell over\n</p>\n<p>\n their little house, and lent a glory to all\n their duties. Love has doubled the wisdom\n in the books they read together. Love doubles\n the sweetness of the songs that now\u2019 together\n they sing.\n</p>\n<p>\n There was a day when prayer meant some\u00ac\n thing to them, but now\u2019 when they kneel and\n pray that God may grant that they may grow\u2019\n old together, they are so bow ' ed wdth weight\n of joy that they cling to one another, and\n in the silence and the darkness cannot rise\n from their knees or speak, but only pray,\n w\u2019hile joy sings in the heart. And if that\n love goes on, until they totter down the hill\n together, and together sleep at the foot\n thereof, it will turn life into perpetual sum\u00ac\n mer. And this love is one of the fruits that\n Christ ripens in men, and radiant happiness\n is another.\n</p>\n<p>\n A Trait of the Christian Life.\n</p>\n<p>\n And long-suffering is a fruit. Is there any\u00ac\n thing more to be desired? Among all the\n noble traits that lend glory to man and man\u00ac\n hood, what quality more admirable? Here\n is a hoy w\u2019ho has gone astray. An hundred\n times he has promised, and a hundred times\n he has broken his pledges, and at last he\n breaks his father\u2019s heart. His father grows\n bitter, and will not forgive. But his mother,\n oh, his mother forgives and forgets, and the\n lower he sinks the stronger she is to descend\n for his recovery. His father dies, borne\n dowm by weight of sorrow and trouble, and\n the mother lives, the stronger, because the\n greater is her boy\u2019s need. One by one his\n friends desert, him, and he sinks so low\u2019 that\n his name becomes a hissing, and his body is\n full of sickness and his bones are full of sin.\n And when at last he falls into an untimely\n grave, this mother takes her stand beside\n his bier like an angel, and her love becomes\n a tw\u2019o-edged sword. She guards his bier\n</p>\n<p>\n against those who would speak.one harsh\n word, or spot hi sname. Yet some hope deep\n in her heart again begins to sing. She trans\u00ac\n fers her ambitions to heaven. There, now\n that he has lost the body that fettered hint,\n he will recover. There he will take up his\n task. There he will hold his tool and do his\n work. Not here, but there; not now, but\n then; not in man\u2019s world, but in God\u2019s. And\n she breathes one prayer, that to-night. God\n may give her to fall on sleep that to-morrow\u2019\n she may take her poor boy\u2019s hand., anil lead\n him toward the all-pitying Christ, and plead\n the boy\u2019s weakness, and tell his life, story.\n And now ' , at last, her love, suffering long,\n will take this sinful youth, and purity and\n sin go hand in hand up the steps of heaven,\n that innocence and the mother heart may\n tell the boy\u2019s story unto an all pitying God.\n Oh, beautiful love that suffers long! C\u00bbh,\n beauteous Cbrist, that can ripen such love.\n Oh, all ye hearts, hungry for wisdom, and\n hungry for beauty, and hungering for perfect\n manhood, I call you unto Christ! Come unto\n Him, that your reason may become full.\n Come unto Him, that you may find yourselves\n and go toward full growth. Come unto Him,\n as the flower comes to the sun, to borrow\n loveliness. Come unto Him as the sand\n comes to the sun, that it may be changed to\n opal, as the clay comes to the sun that it\n may have the tints of the sapphire! Come\n unco Him as the soul comes to a great teach\u00ac\n er, as the young knight comes to a great\n king! You will never understand yourselves\n until you see the ideal manhood He plans for\n you. You will never know what heights you\n can climb until you know what time and all\n the resources of His love can work.
