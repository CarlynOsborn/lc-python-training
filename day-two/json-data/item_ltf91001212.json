published in\n 1908; but, on going over that book for revision,\n I found it necessary to alter it so very materially,\n that it has been determined to publish a new\n book on the game, under the present title. A\n certain amount of the old book remains, but the\n chapters dealing with the declaration have been\n re-written entirely, and the principles of declaring\n now advocated are very different from, and in\n some cases diametrically opposed to, those recom-\n mended in my first book.\n</p>\n<p>\n I make no apology for this change of front,\n because it is none of my doing. The change has\n been brought about, almost entirely, by the new\n Law limiting the loss on a declaration of \u201c One\n Spade\u201d to 100 points. As long as the loss was\n unlimited, the best players adopted a certain line\n of play, which was fully described in my first book.\n On page 67 of \u201cAuction Bridge\u201d I said: \u201cThe\n new rule has not become law at the time of\n writing, so I can say nothing as to the operation\n of it.\u201d It has since become law, and I can now\n speak as to the operation of it. It has transformed\n the methods of declaring rudimentally. The\n methods which were in vogue eighteen months\n ago are now out of date, and the new methods\n will be found fully described in the following\n pages.\n</p>\n<p>\n W.

Several varia-\n tions of the game were tried and rejected, until\n at last one of them conceived the idea (probably\n borrowed from Vint) of bidding for the declara-\n tion, and it caught on at once. On that basis a new\n game was formulated, and it was, then and there,\n christened \u201cAuction Bridge.\u201d It was exclusively a\n three-handed game. The idea of adapting it for\n four players was of much later date, and does not\n seem to have occurred to the original inventors.\n</p>\n<p>\n The exact date of its birth is somewhat uncertain.\n The first record which we have of it is a letter from\n the late Mr. Oswald Crawfurd, which appeared in\n The Times of January 16th, 1903.

As soon as\n the deal is completed, the dealer looks at his cards,\n and is obliged to make a declaration of some kind.\n He has no option of deputing the call to his\n partner, as at ordinary Bridge; he is obliged to\n declare something. A common first call by the\n dealer is \u201cOne Spade,\u201d which means that he\n contracts to win one odd trick, or, in other words,\n seven out of the thirteen tricks, with spades as\n trumps, playing his own hand and his partner\u2019s\n combined, as at ordinary Bridge. The player on\n the dealer\u2019s left can then double the spade call, or\n he can make any declaration of a higher value\n \u2014 that is \u201c One Club,\u201d or one diamond, or one\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:au:ct:io:nb:ri:dg:eu:pt:00:da:lt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt_0068/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 225, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 371}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:au:ct:io:nb:ri:dg:eu:pt:00:da:lt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt_0068/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 451, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 742}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:au:ct:io:nb:ri:dg:eu:pt:00:da:lt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt_0068/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 903, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1484}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:au:ct:io:nb:ri:dg:eu:pt:00:da:lt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt_0068/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1806, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2968}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:au:ct:io:nb:ri:dg:eu:pt:00:da:lt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt_0068/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/au/ct/io/nb/ri/dg/eu/pt/00/da/lt/auctionbridgeupt00dalt/auctionbridgeupt00dalt_0068.jp2", "height": 2968, "width": 1806, "levels": 6, "size": 357931}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"68\">\n<p>\n AUCTION BRIDGE UP-TO-DATE.\n</p>\n<p>\n heart, or one \u201cno trump,\u201d or he can simply pass\n the spade declaration, if he does not wish to\n make any declaration of his own.

The\n guiding principle of the one school was to conceal\n their strength as much as possible, in the hope\n of inducing their opponents to declare above the\n value of their hands, when they would pounce\n down upon them, and double them, and probably\n score a very substantial sum above the line. The\n aim and object of the other school was to win\n the game and the rubber as quickly as possible,\n with no beating about the bush at all, and these\n players always declared up to the full value of\n their hands straight away.

If the dealer\n has such a good all-round hand that he wishes for\n a \u201cno trump\u201d declaration, why should he not de-\n clare it himself? The accepted meaning of the\n original call of \u201cTwo Spades,\u201d apart from any\n special conventions, is that the dealer has pro-\n nounced strength in the spade suit, and very little\n strength outside it\n</p>\n<p>\n The most important phase in the tactics of the\n third player arises when his partner, the dealer, has\n declared \u201c One No Trump,\u201d and the second player\n has passed.

At ordinary Bridge, doubling is of rare\n occurrence, except on a spade declaration. At\n Auction Bridge it is an integral part of the bidding\n for the declaration, and it has a very important\n bearing on the game itself. The primary object\n of a player in bidding up the declaration is, or\n should be, not to win the game as quickly as\n possible, but to endeavour to induce his opponents\n to declare above the value of their hands, until\n they reach a point when their declaration can be\n doubled with advantage.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is one very important feature about\n doubling, in regard to which Auction Bridge and\n ordinary Bridge are very different.

The most common\n basis of an original \u201c No Trump \u201d call by the dealer\n is that he is well guarded in both red suits, and not\n very strong in one or both of the black suits, and\n he calls \u201c No Trumps \u201d at once in order to prevent\n his opponents making a call in a black suit.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:au:ct:io:nb:ri:dg:eu:pt:00:da:lt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt_0198/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 225, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 371}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:au:ct:io:nb:ri:dg:eu:pt:00:da:lt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt_0198/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 451, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 742}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:au:ct:io:nb:ri:dg:eu:pt:00:da:lt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt_0198/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 903, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1484}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:au:ct:io:nb:ri:dg:eu:pt:00:da:lt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt_0198/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1806, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2968}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:au:ct:io:nb:ri:dg:eu:pt:00:da:lt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt:auctionbridgeupt00dalt_0198/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/au/ct/io/nb/ri/dg/eu/pt/00/da/lt/auctionbridgeupt00dalt/auctionbridgeupt00dalt_0198.jp2", "height": 2968, "width": 1806, "levels": 6, "size": 366255}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"198\">\n<p>\n t 82\n</p>\n<p>\n AUCTION BRIDGE UP-TO-DATE.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many good Bridge players, when they have to\n open the game from a hopeless hand, occasionally\n depart from the rule of opening their numerically\n strongest suit, and lead what they hope will be a\n strengthening card for their partner.
