Of course, on a re\u00ac\n view, there will always be enough of deficiency,\n at any period of life, to call for the deepest hu\u00ac\n mility.

These are met with\n in every community; and, I suppose, have to be\n borne with, and kept along as well as may be.\n It is perhaps better to be religious spasmodically\n than not at all ; and perchance these characters\n may at last stumble into the heavenly world\u2014\n perhaps there to be remodeled into infantile\n natures, as it were, to begin the eternal life with.\n But sometimes they do much harm here by\n bringing reproach upon religion through their\n wretched vacillation, and deterring some thereby\n who otherwise could be brought into the Re\u00ac\n deemer\u2019s fold. One great trouble is that they\n are always very conspicuous when they have the\n devotional fit on them, unless they are made to\n take a back-seat, and then they are entirely killed\n off. So that the treatment of such cases becomes\n a source of the greatest perplexity, sometimes, to\n the earnest minister, anxious to remove all stum\u00ac\n bling-blocks out of the way.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:my:un:cl:et:ob:yh:is:ta:00:un:se:myuncletobyhista00unse:myuncletobyhista00unse_0254/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 240, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 398}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:my:un:cl:et:ob:yh:is:ta:00:un:se:myuncletobyhista00unse:myuncletobyhista00unse_0254/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 481, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 796}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:my:un:cl:et:ob:yh:is:ta:00:un:se:myuncletobyhista00unse:myuncletobyhista00unse_0254/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 962, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1593}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:my:un:cl:et:ob:yh:is:ta:00:un:se:myuncletobyhista00unse:myuncletobyhista00unse_0254/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1925, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3187}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:my:un:cl:et:ob:yh:is:ta:00:un:se:myuncletobyhista00unse:myuncletobyhista00unse_0254/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/my/un/cl/et/ob/yh/is/ta/00/un/se/myuncletobyhista00unse/myuncletobyhista00unse_0254.jp2", "height": 3187, "width": 1925, "levels": 6, "size": 181945}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"254\">\n<p>\n 248 MY UNCLE TOBY\u2019S TABLE-TALKS.\n</p>\n<p>\n I was gratified with this talk, because it re\u00ac\n stored my equanimity, and, besides, made me feel\n somewhat more charitable toward my client\u2014\n who, however, continued to give me considerable\n trouble in the same way.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:my:un:cl:et:ob:yh:is:ta:00:un:se:myuncletobyhista00unse:myuncletobyhista00unse_0255/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 240, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 398}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:my:un:cl:et:ob:yh:is:ta:00:un:se:myuncletobyhista00unse:myuncletobyhista00unse_0255/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 481, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 796}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:my:un:cl:et:ob:yh:is:ta:00:un:se:myuncletobyhista00unse:myuncletobyhista00unse_0255/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 962, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1593}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:my:un:cl:et:ob:yh:is:ta:00:un:se:myuncletobyhista00unse:myuncletobyhista00unse_0255/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1925, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3187}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:my:un:cl:et:ob:yh:is:ta:00:un:se:myuncletobyhista00unse:myuncletobyhista00unse_0255/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/my/un/cl/et/ob/yh/is/ta/00/un/se/myuncletobyhista00unse/myuncletobyhista00unse_0255.jp2", "height": 3187, "width": 1925, "levels": 6, "size": 319071}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"255\">\n<p>\n XXXIII.\n</p>\n<p>\n ON PUNCTUALITY.\n</p>\n<p>\n OLLY received a tardy-mark at school,\n much to her mortification, such a thing\n being quite out of the ordinary line of\n things with her.
