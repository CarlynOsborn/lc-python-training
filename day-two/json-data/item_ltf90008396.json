lectures on elementary liturgies,\n or, \u201con such topics of the subject as an intelligent\n rendering of our order of worship demands acquaint\u00ac\n ance with.\u201d The \u201cPropositions\u201d and \u201cNotes\u201d pub\u00ac\n lished in these pages were prepared to serve as an out\u00ac\n line to the course, and were so employed. The greater\n part of the material thus collected and arranged has since\n appeared in The Columbus Theological Magazine , extend\u00ac\n ing through several numbers of this periodical. The\n whole is now presented in book-form for the more con\u00ac\n venient use of students, ministers, and church-members,\n who \u2014 lacking the inclination or the opportunity to make\n a thorough study of liturgies \u2014 yet desire to inform them\u00ac\n selves on the more general truths and facts treated of in\n this science.

In a fair and favorable discussion of the subject\n before us, much importance is necessarily attached to forms\n and actions, symbols and ceremonies, that have been handed\n down by the Church of the past to that of the present.

That men accept God and any spiritual good He is\n pleased to bestow on them, is not by any human power; so\n too, that any offering of men is as a sweet smelling savour\n accepted by God, is not due to any human worthiness. It\n is the gracious power of Christ\u2019s love that prevails on men\n to have themselves divinely blest; and it is His intercession\n that avails with God for His pleasure in anything that men\n may be and do and have. Just as every seed begets fruit\n after its own kind, and like powers produce like results, so\n can human powers\u2014and these are corrupt\u2014only produce\n human, that is corrupt results; never such as are spiritual\n and divine.

Conversely,\n when men bring their gifts to Him, God is sure to bless\n them ; and to bless them in blessing transcending by far\n anything that may have been brought to Him. \u201cIt is more\n blessed to give than to receive.\u201d Acts 20, 35. Strictly\n speaking, to give is divine, to take is human.

Private devotions are, nevertheless, of such great\n importance that the Church should under no circumstances\n neglect to make ample provision for them. Her members\n should be furnished with the richest material and the best\n forms available, and be instructed how to use them. A\n good order of family worship is of incalculable value; and\n it would not be out of place at all for Liturgies to pay more\n attention to this subject than is usually given it.

The\n Church Year is the foundation-stone of liturgies; removing\n it, the super-structure falls to the ground. Nor is there any\n adequate substitute for it; without it, or something very\n much the same thing, no established order and annual\n round of services is possible. It is an idea, and therefore it\n may impress some with the thought that we make too much\n of it both in our claims for it and in the use we put it to.\n However, it only seems so; for the Church Year is not an\n abstract but a very concrete idea. It is governed by and it\n comprehends, in general outline, the life of Christ; and it\n aims to satisfy, in the most approved order, the needs and\n wants of Christians.

More\u00ac\n over, these days are again so grouped as to form cycles,\n somewhat analogous to the seasons of the civil year; this\n adds another and very pleasing diversity to the year\u2019s course.\n Mere preconception has led to strong prejudices against Ser\u00ac\n vices arranged on such a basis; the verdict of experience is\n that they are delightful, and that the longer a person partici\u00ac\n pates in them, the more they grow into his favor.\n</p>\n<p>\n The minister, as liturgist no less than as preacher,\n should have a fair understanding of the Church\u2019s year, and\n the idea running through it.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00a7 16 .\n</p>\n<p>\n The Science of Liturgies treats of the fixed parts of Divine Service, and\n of their orderly arrangement. With the free and variable parts it\n has nothing to do, except that it assign to them their place, re\u00ac\n strict their number and length, and demand that they be in har\u00ac\n mony with its own appointments.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. The entire material constituting a Service, and its\n ordering, are thus assigned: the prescribed and fixed, to\n Liturgies; the free and variable, to Homiletics.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. From what was said in support of the preceding\n section, it follows that, as a rule, the minister as priest or\n liturgist, not as pastor or preacher, determines the character\n and scope of the regular services; really and in the end, it is\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0034/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 307, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 509}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0034/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 615, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1018}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0034/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1231, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0034/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2462, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4075}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0034/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/fo/re/al/ta/ro/rs/er/00/sc/hu/beforealtarorser00schu/beforealtarorser00schu_0034.jp2", "height": 4075, "width": 2462, "levels": 6, "size": 459113}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"34\">\n<p>\n 22\n</p>\n<p>\n BEFORE THE ALTAR.\n</p>\n<p>\n the Church herself that does this through the liturgy she\n places into the hands of her servants.

In the line of\n faith-standards and their purpose, there is nothing that can\n be made so generally useful as the regular church-services to\n which everybody has access. This however can only be\n done by having the services characterized by a certain dis\u00ac\n tinctive uniformity and stability \u2014 that is, by making them\n typically liturgical.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Another feature that must commend established forms\n to all thoughtful and fair-minded men, is their rigid imper\u00ac\n sonality.

Before long, and without such warrant,\n sacramental efficacy seems to have been ascribed to it, as\n also to the anointing shoved in between these two acts, to\n wit, the imposition of hands and baptism. This proved de\u00ac\n rogatory to the sacrament, which was in consequence held\n to have only a negative effect \u2014 the \u2018 \u2018 putting off of the\n flesh\u201d; whilst the ceremonies were esteemed to have posi\u00ac\n tive powers: chrism, the conferring of the priesthood, 1\n Pet. 2, 9; and the imposition of hands, the bestowal of\n the Holy Ghost. (See Kurtz Ch. Hist. \u00a7 32.)

Among the parts that pertain to the administration\n of the Supper, three belong to the category of the sacra\u00ac\n mental; the prefatory Exhortation; the words of Institu\u00ac\n tion; and the form and act of Distribution.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0063/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 307, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 509}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0063/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 615, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1018}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0063/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1231, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0063/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2462, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4075}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0063/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/fo/re/al/ta/ro/rs/er/00/sc/hu/beforealtarorser00schu/beforealtarorser00schu_0063.jp2", "height": 4075, "width": 2462, "levels": 6, "size": 496975}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"63\">\n<p>\n MATERIAL ELEMENTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 51\n</p>\n<p>\n a) The Exhortation usually sets forth the unspeakable\n grace manifested in the offering of the Son of God by His\n death on the cross and in the communication to us of His\n body and blood by means of the Sacrament; and farther,\n that by the grace thus manifested and by the heavenly good\n thus bestowed the spiritual man is to be comforted, nour\u00ac\n ished, strengthened, filled with gratitude, hope, courage and\n joy, and assured of final victory and eternal glory.

Regarding these words in this con\u00ac\n nection, there might be some doubt whether they should be\n regarded as sacramental. It certainly would be false to do so\n on the Romish figment that the priest, by their use, effects\n the presence of the body and blood of Christ. Such preten\u00ac\n sions we repudiate.

The Confession of Sin, and the Kyrie. The latter is\n obviously a development of a cry for help, \u201c Have mercy on\n me, O Lord.\u201d Ps. 51, 3; Matt. 15, 22; Mark 10, 47. Its spe\u00ac\n cific content must be ascertained from the occasion of its use.\n The Apostol. Const, prescribe that to every prayer of the\n deacon the congregation shall respond: Kyrie E/eison ! This\n is its most primitive form. In the times of Gregory the\n Great (end of 6th cent.) it was enlarged to its present form.\n By over-use\u2014e. g. its ninefold repetition\u2014it has been much\n abused. It is the penitent sinner ' s cry; and our Liturgies\n have assigned its place accordingly. The confession of sin\n on the part of the congregation first expresses itself through\n the words of the pastor, and is then made its own and given\n full expression by the congregation singing the Kyrie.*\n</p>\n<p>\n The general confession preceding it\u2014an outgrowth of\n and substitute for the confitior of the Romish priest and,\n it may be, of the silent prayer said by the worshiper on enter\u00ac\n ing the Church\u2014was introduced sometime in the 16th cent.\n (Mecklenburg K. C. 1552.) It happily makes prominent the\n confession of sin implied in the Kyrie, gives emphasis to the\n element of confession and absolution, and impresses the\n worshipers with a sense of the need of pardon before entering\n into fuller communion with God. The form of the conf. is\n not always the same.\n</p>\n<p>\n *The use made of the Kyrie by the Eastern Church was certainly\n unique.

In\n most, if not in all, of the Orders when the former are used,\n the latter are placed immediately before the Collect of the\n day. According to this scheme, the Service is invariable for\n all the days of the year, including the festivals, until the\n special Introit so placed is reached.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The old-church conception of worship as an action\n participated in by all in abundant measure , realized itself\n quite naturally and happily by means of the responsive\n method and its accessories. To this end the already ex\u00ac\n isting divisions of the priest, the ministrants, the lector, the\n people and the choir were made available; and in addition,\n the congregation itself was at times separated into parts for\n interaction. In deference to art, the parts were rendered,\n some in full and others in hypophonic song.\n</p>\n<p>\n With this idea of the Service in view, we can readily\n</p>\n<p>\n * Luther\u2019s SCReffe: $m 31ttfang fingen fair ein geiftf Sieb ober eittert\n beutfdjert $fdm.\n</p>\n<p>\n ** Strasburg and Erfurth K.

It is necessary to call attention to the facts set forth\n in this proposition in order to see clearly what the Church\n and her ministers have to do with the subject. As a divine\n institution it is of the same class with another appointment\n of God that pertains primarily to the affairs of this earth,\n to-wit, the power of government. (Gen. 1, 26-28. Matt.\n \u201822, 30.) In essence, therefore, marriage is simply a union\n of man and woman; more particularly a union between\n them of a specific physico-psychical kind, and nothing more.\n If such a union is at the same time a sanctified one, this its\n godly character is an accident and not an essential con\u00ac\n stituent. Were it otherwise, then would the marriage of\n heathens be no marriage at all\u2014a judgment entirely foreign\n to Scripture.\n</p>\n<p>\n Natural fitness and the principle of monogamy assumed,\n marriage is contracted by mutual consent, and is effected at\n the time fixed for it by that consent and by its public reitera\u00ac\n tion. Betrothal, therefore, in so far as it fixes upon the\n future, is not the consummation of marriage but the promise\n of it. Both the promise (sponsalia de futuro) and the efficient\n consent (sponsalia de praesenti ) by which the union is actu\u00ac\n ally executed, depend for their character of lawfulness on\n the ordinances of God and of the State; and the contracting\n parties are accountable to both of these authorities.\n</p>\n<p>\n Whether a union entered into in contravention to divine\n and to human laws is a marriage notwithstanding, is to be de-\n 5\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0078/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 307, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 509}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0078/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 615, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1018}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0078/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1231, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0078/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2462, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4075}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0078/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/fo/re/al/ta/ro/rs/er/00/sc/hu/beforealtarorser00schu/beforealtarorser00schu_0078.jp2", "height": 4075, "width": 2462, "levels": 6, "size": 457075}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"78\">\n<p>\n 66\n</p>\n<p>\n BEFORE THE ALTAR.\n</p>\n<p>\n termined by the nature of the law or laws set aside; if these\n are laws on essence, there is no marriage; if laws on acci\u00ac\n dental qualities merely, then there is a marriage, but one of\n a sinful character.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Since the marriage can be, and be lawful in every\n way, without let or hindrance by the Church, it may be\n asked what the latter has to do with it. The answer is,\n Much in everyway. In the first place, the State is accus\u00ac\n tomed to delegate to her the authority to execute the act;\n in the second place, she is charged of God to see to it, by\n means and methods peculiar to her, that obedience be ren\u00ac\n dered to God and to Caesar in all things, marriage included;\n and in the third place, the holy estate of matrimony being\n the common seminary wherein the citizens of State and\n Church are brought up, she can under no circumstances\n assume toward it an attitude of indifference and inaction.\n</p>\n<p>\n It thus appears that when a minister performs a marriage\n ceremony, he acts in a double capacity; to wit, as the servant\n of the State and of the Church. In his former position he\n joins the persons and introduces them into the conjugal\n relation*; and acting for and in behalf of the State, lie\n secures to the bond effected by him the property of public\n validity and the claim to public recognition. What he does\n in his latter position, is reserved for the next section to\n Lell us.\n</p>\n<p>\n * In full accord with this view of the transaction it will be found\n that in the earliest days of the Christian Church the matter of regu\u00ac\n lating marriage and its execution was entirely in the hands of the\n civil authorities\u2014the Church interfering only in the case of her own\n members where these acted in defiance of Cod\u2019s law on the subject.\n</p>\n<p>\n Benediction ceremonies were indeed introduced quite early, but\n the validity of the marriage itself was not considered dependent on\n it. See Kurtz\u2019 Ch. Hist. # 36, 1. Pope Alexander III.

It is plain that Christians cannot avail\n themselves of a government license in any matter declared\n unlawful by their Lord. Acts 5, 29. If then a person is\n about to act contrary to this rule, pleading in excuse of it\n the license of men against the laws of God, it becomes the\n duty of Christians to prevent him if they can; at all events,\n they dare not in any way connive at or abet him in his sin.\n We thus arrive at the conclusion that, in the matter of mar\u00ac\n riage, the authorization issued by the State is to the Church\n and her ministers 7iot a?i all-s7ijficie7it crede7itial to act 071 .\n True, such a paper exempts from liability of prosecution on\n the part of the human magistrate, but not from accounta\u00ac\n bility before the higher forum of conscience and of God.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0081/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 307, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 509}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0081/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 615, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1018}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0081/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1231, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0081/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2462, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4075}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0081/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/fo/re/al/ta/ro/rs/er/00/sc/hu/beforealtarorser00schu/beforealtarorser00schu_0081.jp2", "height": 4075, "width": 2462, "levels": 6, "size": 481400}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"81\">\n<p>\n MATERIAL ELEMENTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 69\n</p>\n<p>\n By the performance of the ceremony the minister\u2014and\n the Church through him\u2014bears testimony to the entire law\u00ac\n fulness of the marriage then and there taking place.

On\n the score of custom it may be said that burial is \u2018 \u2018 Chris\u00ac\n tian,\u201d cremation is \u201cheathenish\u201d; besides, the former is in\n keeping with the resurrection idea, the latter is not.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0086/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 307, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 509}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0086/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 615, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1018}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0086/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1231, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0086/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2462, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4075}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0086/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/fo/re/al/ta/ro/rs/er/00/sc/hu/beforealtarorser00schu/beforealtarorser00schu_0086.jp2", "height": 4075, "width": 2462, "levels": 6, "size": 479115}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"86\">\n<p>\n 74\n</p>\n<p>\n BEFORE THE ALTAR.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the second place, the language and symbolism of all\n Scripture appertaining to this and other subjects are built\n up on the idea of burial.

Then the words of Eliphaz the Temanite to\n Job, \u201cThou shalt come to thy grave in full age, like as a\n shock of corn cometh in in full season,\u201d Job 5, 26; and c. 19,\n 26. 27, the triumphant song of this godly sufferer,\u201d \u201cFor I\n know that my Redeemer liveth, and that He shall stand at\n the latter day upon the earth: and though after my skin\n worms destroy this body, yet in my flesh shall I see God.\u201d\n Passing over to the New Testament we have, first, the beau\u00ac\n tiful figure of our Lord, \" \u201cVerily, verily, I say unto you,\n Except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die, it\n abideth alone; but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit;\u201d\n John 12, 24; and then this same figure taken up again by\n Paul 1 Cor. 15, 35 sq. Moreover, and one of a different\n sort, \u201c Therefore we are buried with Him by baptism into\n death: that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by\n the glory of the Father, even so we,\u201d etc. Rom. 16, 4 sq.\n So also the symbolism of rest is associated with the grave,\n Heb. 4, 10 and Rev. 14, 13.

He seeks his happiness, and if he would\n seek it truly he would look for it to God, and having found\n it, to the God of his salvation he will give the praise. His\n search for happiness he means to prosecute in whatever he\n undertakes, but at no time and place is he intent on it with\n such singleness of heart as when engaged in Divine Ser\u00ac\n vice. It is therefore but natural that the worshiper should\n conceive of this rite as an act in which he both gives and\n takes\u2014and so far he is not mistaken. So far, I say, for\n whether he is right in anything beyund what these words\n say, depends on the view he takes of the gifts and of the\n motives and means of their bestowal and acceptance on both\n the side of God and his own.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0094/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 307, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 509}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0094/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 615, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1018}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0094/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1231, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0094/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2462, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4075}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0094/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/fo/re/al/ta/ro/rs/er/00/sc/hu/beforealtarorser00schu/beforealtarorser00schu_0094.jp2", "height": 4075, "width": 2462, "levels": 6, "size": 495166}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"94\">\n<p>\n 82\n</p>\n<p>\n BEFORE THE ALTAR.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. As regards the specific nature of the communion of\n person and gifts taking place in Divine Service, there are\n irreconcilable differences in part of a very radical sort; and\n the same is true even to a greater extent as to the means of\n communication. But before we take up their discussion we\n deem it necessary to substantiate more definitely the terms\n sacramental and sacrificial \u2014terms we have already made\n free use of, but noj: for purposes so critical of opposing\n opinions, to whose exposure we shall use these now.\n</p>\n<p>\n With us, these terms have symbolic import and author\u00ac\n ity. On the question, What a sacrifice is, and how many\n kinds there are, the Apology says:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018 \u2018 Theologians are rightly accustomed to distinguish\n between a sacrament and a sacrifice. Therefore, let the\n genus comprehending both of these be either a ceremony or\n a sacred work. A sacrament is a ceremony or work in\n which God presents to us that which the divine promise\n annexed to the ceremony offers, as baptism is a work, not\n which we offer to God, but in which God baptizes us, i. e. a\n minister in the place of God; and God here offers and pre\u00ac\n sents the remission of sins, etc., according to the promise\n (Mark 16, 16): \u2018 He that believeth and is baptized shall be\n saved.\u2019 A sacrifice, on the contrary, is a ceremony or work\n which we render God in order to afford Him honor. More\u00ac\n over the proximate species of sacrifice are two, and there are\n no more. One is the propitiatory sacrifice, i. e . a work\n which makes satisfaction for guilt and punishment, i. e. one\n that reconciles God, or appeases God\u2019s wrath, or which\n merits the remission of sins for others. Another species is\n the eucharistic sacrifice, which does not merit the remission\n of sins or reconciliation, but is rendered by those who have\n been reconciled, in order that we may return thanks or\n return gratitude for the remission of sin that has been\n received. * * * But in fact there has been only one\n</p>\n<p>\n propitiatory sacrifice in the world, viz.: the death of Christ,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0095/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 307, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 509}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0095/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 615, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1018}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0095/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1231, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0095/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2462, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4075}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0095/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/fo/re/al/ta/ro/rs/er/00/sc/hu/beforealtarorser00schu/beforealtarorser00schu_0095.jp2", "height": 4075, "width": 2462, "levels": 6, "size": 473622}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"95\">\n<p>\n CONSTRUCTIVE LAWS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 83\n</p>\n<p>\n as the Epistle to the Hebrews teaches, which says (10:4):\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018 It is not possible that the blood of bulls and of goats\n should take away sins.\u2019 And a little after, of the will of\n Christ, v. 10: \u2018By the which will we are sanctified by the\n offering of the body of Jesus Christ once for all.\u2019 * * *\n</p>\n<p>\n Now the rest are eucharistic sacrifices, which are called sac\u00ac\n rifices of praise (Eev. 3, 1 sq; 7, 11 sq; Ps. 56, 12 sq.), viz.:\n the preaching of the Gospel, faith, prayer, thanksgiving,\n confession, the afflictions of saints, yea, all good works of\n saints.

Now a common liturgy for the use of the three grand\n divisions of the Church is simply impossible because they\n differ fundamentally in their notion of the sacramental and\n the sacrificial, if not as to their nature, then as to the means\n of their communication, or as to both.

The atoning\n self-sacrifice of Christ, as she will have it, avails for original\n sin in particular, and for the actual only in so far as it takes\n away the eternal punishment of sin in general; for so-called\n actual sin man\u2014in part at least\u2014himself must atone, either\n in person or by the mediation of others.

CHURCH-EDIFICE.\n</p>\n<p>\n It will be conceded that in the erection of churches, as\n also in the construction and location of its furniture, the\n builders should be governed throughout by the fundamental\n idea of Christian worship and its holy purpose. The utter\n disregard of this self-evident principle by so many \u201c Build\u00ac\n ing Committees\u201d is certainly deplorable. Let us bear in\n mind that there is such a thing as a Lutheran church archi\u00ac\n tecture ; and that this should and must be just as long as we\n have a distinctive doctrine of worship; for this latter is en\u00ac\n titled to expression in the way we build our churches and\n arrange their more important belongings. For the altar to\n constitute, or appear to constitute, a part of the tramping\n floor of the man in the pulpit above and behind it, is, to say\n the least, not in keeping with our doctrine of the eucharist;\n neither is justice done to the Word by hanging the pulpit to\n the corner of the altar recess: a pendant, moreover, which is\n anything but appropriately placed from an architectural point\n of view. From Supplement I. it maybe learned that \u201cread\u00ac\n ing desks \u201d are not at all a \u201csectarian innovation\u201d; with this\n fact in view, I submit\u2014in a tentative way\u2014a diagram show\u00ac\n ing how, in my judgment, the altar, pulpit, font and lec-\n torium might be placed in keeping with the true laws both\n of worship and of architecture.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0165/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 307, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 509}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0165/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 615, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1018}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0165/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1231, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0165/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2462, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4075}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:be:fo:re:al:ta:ro:rs:er:00:sc:hu:beforealtarorser00schu:beforealtarorser00schu_0165/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/be/fo/re/al/ta/ro/rs/er/00/sc/hu/beforealtarorser00schu/beforealtarorser00schu_0165.jp2", "height": 4075, "width": 2462, "levels": 6, "size": 310071}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"165\">\n<p>\n SUPPLEMENT.\n</p>\n<p>\n 153\n</p>\n<p>\n Three forms of constructing altar recess are here suggested,\n</p>\n<p>\n 1) a, b, c, d, or the simple rectangular,\n</p>\n<p>\n 2) a, e, f, g, h, i, k, d, or the polygonal; of\n</p>\n<p>\n 3) 1, m, n, o, p, or the triple polygonal, the arcs showing the\n lines within w\u2019hich the sides of the polygons are to be constructed.\n The tapering in all three is the gothic.
