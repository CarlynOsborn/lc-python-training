This has been\n often the subject of eulogy. The first permanent estab\u00ac\n lishment was at Plymouth: But the pilgrims, as they are\n styled, had nothing to do with the colony which sat down in\n Boston. These came from England in the ship Arabella, and\n several other vessels in company with her. After landing at\n Naumkeag, (Salem,) most of them removed to Charlestown,\n and many of them crossed the river to Shawmut, which had\n received the appellation of Trimontane, and soon after was\n named Boston. This was in the year 1630, ten years after\n the settlement of Plymouth. The two colonies were every way\n unconnected, excepting by the ties of friendship, for many\n years. In a short time after possession was taken of Boston,\n a house was erected for the public worship of God. It was of\n wood, with a thatched roof. By tradition we learn, that it\n was situated between Devonshire and Congress Streets, on the\n south side of State Street.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the number of inhabitants had increased, so as to ren\u00ac\n der it inconvenient to assemble in one house, a second was\n built in the year 1650, on that part of the town sometimes de\u00ac\n nominated the Island of North Boston . By this name was\n known all that part of the peninsula to the northward of the\n canal, which was for many years called the Mill Creek. The\n land here was very low, and being overflowed at high water,\n it then formed a complete island. In process of time, this\n house obtained the name of the Old North Meeting House.\n It stood upon the square, called, to this day, the Old North\n Square. The first house was destroyed by fire in the course\n of a few years; the second building was taken down for fuel,\n by order of the British General Howe, in 1775 or 1776. It\n was a specimen of the original architecture of this country,\n and, from the durability of its materials, might have remained\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:no:ti:ce:00:el:io:historicalnotice00elio:historicalnotice00elio_0006/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 141, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 276}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:no:ti:ce:00:el:io:historicalnotice00elio:historicalnotice00elio_0006/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 283, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 552}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:no:ti:ce:00:el:io:historicalnotice00elio:historicalnotice00elio_0006/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 567, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1105}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:no:ti:ce:00:el:io:historicalnotice00elio:historicalnotice00elio_0006/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1135, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2210}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:no:ti:ce:00:el:io:historicalnotice00elio:historicalnotice00elio_0006/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4421}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:no:ti:ce:00:el:io:historicalnotice00elio:historicalnotice00elio_0006/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/ic/al/no/ti/ce/00/el/io/historicalnotice00elio/historicalnotice00elio_0006.jp2", "height": 4421, "width": 2271, "levels": 6, "size": 723852}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"6\">\n<p>\n 6\n</p>\n<p>\n many years.

Their first meeting was at the house of\n Matthew Butler, whose descendants have formed a part of the\n society to the present time. In conformity to the custom of\n those days, they petitioned the North Church for permission\n to form themselves into a church fellowship, which was grant\u00ac\n ed in the month of March of that year.\n</p>\n<p>\n The projectors were joined by others, and obtained liber\u00ac\n ty of the General Court to erect a wooden building, as the law\n of 1711 prohibited the erection of any house of other mate\u00ac\n rials than brick or stone.

He was a member of the Old North Church,\n and looked up to Dr. Increase Mather as a parent. Whether\n Dr. Cotton Mather was afraid to have him for so near a\n neighbour, or for some other cause, which is not known,\n through his influence Mr. John Webb was brought forward as\n a competitor, who was then chaplain at Castle William, now\n Fort Independence.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the 5th of May, 1714, the house was dedicated. The\n two Mathers officiated in the ceremonies of giving the\n right hand of fellowship to the new church, and the prayers\n usual on such occasions; and Mr. Barnard preached the\n sermon.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the 2d of August following, the church came to the\n choice of a pastor. At the first trial, the suffrages were divid\u00ac\n ed between Mr. Barnard and Mr. Webb; the majority was\n for Mr. Webb.

The society\n suffered a very considerable loss in numbers and in property;\n but it was soon repaired, as Mr. Thacher and Mr. Webb were\n very popular preachers, and greatly beloved.\n</p>\n<p>\n This matter has been minutely narrated, as it is one of the\n most singular transactions in the history of the New England\n churches. If contrary to the platform, the ministers ought to\n have met in council with their messengers, and there, in a digni\u00ac\n fied and solemn manner, borne their testimony against the pro\u00ac\n ceedings of the church and the conduct of the candidate ; and\n then to have refused to sanction them by assisting in the instal\u00ac\n lation. But instead of that, we have seen them shrinking from\n what they claim as their sacred duty, and by a verbal message,\n begging not to be sent for; which was complied with, but very\n reluctantly, by the church, as the records testify. And what\n reason was given for their request ? \u201c Lest it should cause unea\u00ac\n siness among the brethren of their churches The dishonour\n they were doing to God, and the discredit they were bring\u00ac\n ing upon religion, were not mentioned, and probably not\n thought of.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Thacher was an ordained minister at Weymouth; he\n was beloved by his people and respected elsewhere. What\n methods were taken to dissolve his first connection, is not said.\n He was afflicted with the asthma, which was attributed to the\n local situation of that place. The air of Boston was more con\u00ac\n genial to his health. His enemies affected to believe that his\n disease was not very alarming, till he was tampered with about\n changing his parish. This is probably incorrect. Although his\n parishioners were dissatisfied, he obtained a regular dismission\n from the church as a member. But his opponents stated that\n his pastoral relation was never dissolved according to the plat\u00ac\n form. This may have been the case, and would have been a\n good ground to have made a stand upon, instead of taking the\n violent measures which they adopted.\n</p>\n<p>\n They also contended, that there was illegality in the choice ;\n or rather his friends were charged with unfair dealing.

It is likely that those persons,\n who had been their advisers and supporters, expected they\n would return to the places from which they had before sepa\u00ac\n rated. If so, they were disappointed.

The crying sins were in-\u2019\n temperance, fornication, (sometimes called scandal,) and con\u00ac\n tempt of the church, with disturbances in religious assemblies.\n Many members were suspended, and many were restored\n again, upon confession and repentance. In some cases of ob\u00ac\n duracy and contumacy, excommunication was resorted to.\n After this time , people grew better , or the instances of crimi\u00ac\n nality were not so regularly recorded as in former days. But\n in June, 1747, a new matter of complaint was brought against\n several brethren and sisters, viz. 1st. That some, absenting\n themselves from our communion, had gone over to the Church\n of England ; others, renouncing their infant baptism, had join\u00ac\n ed the Baptist Church. Whereupon it w r as voted, \u201c That this\n church will no longer consider them as members with us ; and\n therefore are freed from the obligations of care and watchful\u00ac\n ness, under which, hitherto, we have held ourselves towards\n each other.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The expenses of supporting the ministers had been defray\u00ac\n ed by a voluntary contribution made every week.

From long habit, no con\u00ac\n fusion took place ; but it took up much time; the contributions of\u00ac\n ten fell short, and frequent calls were made upon the generosity\n of the members of the society, to make up deficiences. It was\n therefore voted, on the 14th of December, 1749, that a com\u00ac\n mittee should be chosen to assess the pews in a sum sufficient\n to defray all the expenses of the society that could be calcu\u00ac\n lated ; and that they take into consideration the circumstances\n of the occupants, as well as the situation of the pews.

It had heretofore been done before the whole\n assembly, the person standing up in full view, all the congre\u00ac\n gation being seated, while the minister read the confession.\n In the earliest settlement of the country, females were obliged\n also to wear a white sheet over them, while it was reading.\n Also, that two members, who are not in full communion, might\n be admitted into the standing committee for managing the tem-\n poral affairs of the society. Before this the whole committee\n must be church members. This alteration caused much de\u00ac\n bate, but passed, November 11, 1752. Alexander Sears and\n Jonathan Snelling were the first who were chosen. The first\n gentleman was probably a son of one of the seceders from this\n church, when Mr. Thacher was installed. Mr. Samuel Holland\n was chosen a deacon at this meeting.\n</p>\n<p>\n A proposal was made at a meeting on the 14th of April,\n 1755, to exchange the New England version of Psalms, which\n had always been used in singing, for one more modern. It\n was opposed at several meetings, and caused much debate be\u00ac\n fore the church would consent to it.

This was read before the members of the church , nomi\u00ac\n nally, but in fact before the whole of the society; as curiosity\n prompted most of the congregation, especially of the softer\n sex, to tarry, in order to hear what they had to say upon the\n matter. It had become a mere form, and was said to prevent\n many from joining the church; so that the pastor, thinking\n there was no direction in the scriptures therefor, recommended\n that it should not be required ; but if it should be the desire of\n any persons to make such relation, the church will attend to\n it.

From the nu\u00ac\n merous funeral sermons preached upon that event, they selected\n one which was delivered by the Rev.Peter Thacher of Malden on\n the day of the doctor\u2019s decease, and printed it. As if they had\n determined to visit the iniquity of the father upon the children,\n not one of them was presented with a copy of it, and the only\n one at that time in the family was given to the widow by Capt.\n John Simpkins, one of the deacons. The society had been at\n considerable expense in putting the female part of the doctor\u2019s\n large family, and the youngest son, Avho was a lad, into very\n handsome mourning. But this was done by a vote of the so\u00ac\n ciety at large, who were always devoted to the family. They\n also continued his salary to the widow (deducting the expense\n of supplying the pulpit) for a considerable time. The opposers\n of Mr. John Eliot affected to look towards Mr. Thacher as their\n future minister. He was a very popular man, a warm friend to\n Mr. John Eliot, and if any overtures were privately made to\n him, they were not acceded to. The pulpit was supplied by\n various candidates till the 13th of May, 1779. It was then\n voted that Messrs. John Eliot, William Greenough, Jonathan\n Allen and John Prince should each be heard a certain number\n of Sabbaths on probation. The last gentleman declined the\n invitation ; the others officiated. On the 22d of August it was\n determined to come to the choice of a pastor on the next day ;\n and they requested such members of other churches as were\n constantly in the habit of attending communion with them, to\n join in the election. They met accordingly, and Mr. Eliot had\n thirty-one out of forty-four votes. The congregation met on the\n 29th, and concurred in the choice, Mr. Eliot having eighty-four\n out of eighty-nine votes. At this time no other qualification was\n required of the members of the congregation, than being of lawful\n age and constant attendants on public worship with this church.\n Mr. Eliot presented a dismission and recommendation from the\n church in Dedham, and was admitted a member of the New\n North; also a confession of his faith, which was accepted.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was by the persuasion of his friends, and with the advice\n of many ministers in and out of the town, that Mr. Eliot was\n induced to accept the call; but it was with great reluctance. He\n could have been settled more to his own mind. He was aware\n of the invidious reflections to which he would be subject in\n settling with a society in which he had been brought up, and as\n successor to a man of his father\u2019s established reputation.

As they always had a sufficient sum allowed to sup\u00ac\n port them handsomely, it will serve as a clew to trace the de\u00ac\n preciation of money for more than a century past. The sala\u00ac\n ry voted to Mr. Webb, at his settlement, was one hundred and.\n four pounds, and wood for his study. This was about twelve\n years after the first emission of paper bills of credit, called af\u00ac\n terwards old tenor . Mr. Webb had in addition to it twenty-five\n pounds to pay for an assistant. The depreciation it had suf\u00ac\n fered at the time, taking silver money as the standard, cannot\n now be ascertained; but taking this first sum for a standard,\n we shall see its decline hereafter. Mr. Thacher\u2019s first salary\n is not set down in the records. In 1728 a grant was made to\n each of the pastors, of twenty-five pounds, in addition to their\n salaries. In February, 1730\u201431, and in February, 1731\u201432,\n there was a contribution made in order to give the ministers a\n more comfortable support. The amount of either is not\n known. Afterwards, the sum of five pounds per week, equal\n to two hundred and sixty pounds per annum, was voted to each\n of them. In 1737, it was augmented to six pounds and ten\n shillings, or three hundred and thirty-eight pounds a year; in\n 1738, to seven pounds and ten shillings, viz. three hundred and\n ninety pounds a year. This sum was continued to Mr. Thach\u00ac\n er\u2019s widow, after his death, till all the Boston ministers had\n preached.\n</p>\n<p>\n When Mr. Andrew Eliot was settled, in 1742, his salary was\n fixed at fifty pounds sterling per annum, say two hundred and\n twenty-two dollars tio in silver.

The money\n then in circulation was the old continental bills, for which there\n was no time of redemption stipulated, and no resources to be\n applied for that purpose. It was therefore in a state of con\u00ac\n stant depreciation. To guard against his suffering from that\n circumstance, Mr. Eliot\u2019s salary was to be adjusted according\n to the quantity of wheat reckoned, at five shillings the bushel.\n Had he insisted upon a literal adherence to this rule, his income,\n during a great part of his life, would have been very large. He\n was urged to do so by some brethren of the cloth. This he\n declined, under a consideration that it had been complied with\n according to its meaning; which was, that he should not suffer\n by being obliged to take a depreciated currency. The society\n never required to be prompted to raise his stipend. They\n always took into consideration the increasing price of the ne\u00ac\n cessaries of life, and either by raising his salary, or special\n grants, from one hundred and fifty to two hundred dollars, al\u00ac\n ways afforded to him a comfortable support. Proposals for\n these were always made unknown to him, and there was never\n a dissenting voice to their adoption. While the new meeting\u00ac\n house was building, these grants were suspended ; but after his\n decease, the sum of five hundred dollars was given to his widow\n to make up for them. In the year 1794, his salary was raised\n to fifteen dollars per week, equal to seven hundred and eighty\n dollars annually.

The plan ap\u00ac\n peared impracticable to most people who were consulted;\n but by his individual perseverance, it was afterwards accom\u00ac\n plished. It was first proposed at the annual meeting in May,\n 1801. Some desultory conversation took place, and the\n standing committee was directed to consider of the subject,\n obtain plans, make the proper estimates, and present then)\n at the next annual meeting. In May, 1802, a partial report\n was made, and advice given that a select committee should be\n chosen to confer with each proprietor separately. Messrs.\n Elisha Sigourney, Thomas Page and John Wells were\n chosen for that purpose. They attended to the business.\n All the proprietors but five agreed to give the pews they own\u00ac\n ed in the present house; most of them subscribed for pews in\n that which should be erected, and advanced more or less\n money, while the work was going on, in order to purchase ma\u00ac\n terials, & x. for it. A respectable committee was chosen to ask\n the assistance of gentlemen whose estates were in the neighbour\u00ac\n hood. The removal of so large a wooden house warranted an\n expectation that something handsome might be obtained, con\u00ac\n sidering that, if it should take fire, great danger would arise of\n a desolation of that part of the town, and that there had been\n many attempts to set fire to that and other parts but a short\n time before. A small sum was subscribed, but it was short of\n four hundred dollars.* Taking down and rebuilding a meet\u00ac\n ing-house was then a very uncommon thing. The society\n hesitated from a fear that they should not be able to complete\n the work. As more than seven thousand dollars had been ob\u00ac\n tained to demolish a large wooden theatre near the common,\n on the plea of the danger the town, if it should take fire,\n and from gentlemen in various parts of the town; it was\n suggested that help might be afforded by enlarging the sphere\n of solicitation. The committee were instructed to make trial\n if any help could be obtained in that way.

How^\n ever, the seals were soon filled again, and \" it continued a\n very large congregation until his death. Another cause, which\n has contributed to change the face of the assembly, has been\n the local situation of the meeting-house. The young gentle\u00ac\n men, who have married wives in other parts of the town, have\n found it difficult to persuade them to become so ungenteel as\n to attend worship at the north end ; while the ladies of the\n society, as they have become wives, have affected to consid\u00ac\n er it a mark of taste to change their minister. But as one\n generation has passed away, another generation has come\n forward. Even the clergymen have abandoned that part of\n the town. There are six large congregations to the north\u00ac\n ward of the canal which divides the town, and only one of\n their ministers resides there. The Methodists are not reck\u00ac\n oned, as their preachers are frequently removed.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Where ministers and people live happily together, some\n credit is due to both.\u201d The Eliots, father and son, sat an\n example worthy of being followed. They lived in the midst\n of them; they associated with them, not only when duty\n called them, as in cases of marriages, sickness and death, but\n in a social manner as friends. Their parishioners returned\n their visits, especially on the evenings of Lord\u2019s day, at\n which times their studies were filled with them, not for the\n sake of religious conversation only, but here the common\n topics of the day were talked over, much information given\n and received relative to the politics of the times, and the in\u00ac\n terest of the country. This constant intercourse made them\n acquainted with each other, and cemented a friendship which\n was pleasant and useful to both. Many gentlemen of the\n town, not belonging to the parish, were, in the habit of join\u00ac\n ing these social circles.\n</p>\n<p>\n In some respects these men were very much alike.

The doctor said, Tell the woman, if he calls again, to invite\n him to see me. Mr. John Eliot replied, Sir, he has been so assiduous and\n attentive, suppose that I call on him and thank him, and tell him you\n will be happy to see him. I think he will be pleased. Right, said the doc\u00ac\n tor. Mr. John Eliot went immediately. Soon after, Mr. Stillman came into\n the chamber. On coming to the bed side, he extended his hand to the doc\u00ac\n tor, and in a loud voice addressed him, My Christian friend, how do you?\n He was answered, Rejoicing in the light of God\u2019s countenance. They shook\n hands cordially. Mr. Stillman then sat down, and after a short conversation,\n was asked to make a prayer, as had been done to all the clergyman who had\n visited there. He did it with much fervency, and soon after they took an\n affectionate leave of each other. They had no other interview. Dr. Eliot\n lived till the next Sabbath.\n</p>\n<p>\n NOTE O.

They both had degrees ot\n Doctor in Divinity, by purchase, at the University of Edinburgh. In the\n year 1767, Deacon John Barrett sent to that University and obtained a\n diploma for Mr. Andrew Eliot, the expenses of which were defrayed by the\n deacon. Mr. Eliot set no other value upon it, than as it was a mark of\n affection from a very dear friend.\n</p>\n<p>\n A few years after Mr. John Eliot\u2019s settlement, diplomas were procured in\n the same manner for Rev. Simeon Howard and Rev. John Lathrop. Soon\n after, the late Sir John Temple, a friend to Mr. Eliot, proposed to his kins\u00ac\n man, the late Samuel Eliot, Esq. to procure the same for him, the expenses\n of which Mr. S. E. offered to pay. Upon consultation with Mr. J. E. he\n put a stop to it. He then agreed with his friend, Rev. John Clarke, that they\n would not accept of a diploma procured by purchase. The University of\n Cambridge were not then in the general practice of granting those degrees,\n as they have since been.\n</p>\n<p>\n Soon after Rev. Mr. Thacher removed from Malden to Boston, he was\n complimented with a diploma by the late Thomas Russel, Esq. By the per\u00ac\n suasion of Mr. Thacher, Mr. Clarke consented to receive the same compli\u00ac\n ment from the same gentleman. Some persons friendly to Mr. J. Eliot wish\u00ac\n ed to favour him in that way, but he always declined it, observing that he\n had rather th\u00a3 question should be Why is not Mr. Eliot a Doctor,\u201d than\n 44 wliy is he ?\u201d At one time, the writer found that a plan was projecting to pro\u00ac\n cure his brother the title privately, through the agency of Dr. Thacher, and\n checked it. At length, the late Deacon Samuel Barrett, sen. wishing to do\n as much for his minister as his uncle John Barrett had done for his father,\n contrived with Dr. Lathrop to procure a degree for him. The diploma\n arrived, and Mr. Eliot\u2019s first notice of it was, by being hailed Doctor at a\n meeting of the Historical Society. When the matter was explained, he was\n much disgusted, and his first determination was, to return the diploma ; but\n he considered afterwards that by so doing he should offend the deacon, who\n was one of his best friends, and grieve Dr. Lathrop. They really thought\n they were doing him a favour. Thus the title was imposed upon him so\n contrary to his inclination, that he probably never looked over the diploma.\n He deposited it in the hands of a friend, who handed it to his family after his\n decease.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Eliot\u2019s reason for declining the offers which were made to him for this\n purpose was, that a title which might, by a little address, be procured for\n any ope, conferred no honour, and was not worth an acceptance.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:no:ti:ce:00:el:io:historicalnotice00elio:historicalnotice00elio_0051/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 147, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 276}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:no:ti:ce:00:el:io:historicalnotice00elio:historicalnotice00elio_0051/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 295, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 553}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:no:ti:ce:00:el:io:historicalnotice00elio:historicalnotice00elio_0051/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 591, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1107}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:no:ti:ce:00:el:io:historicalnotice00elio:historicalnotice00elio_0051/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1182, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2215}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:no:ti:ce:00:el:io:historicalnotice00elio:historicalnotice00elio_0051/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2364, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4430}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:no:ti:ce:00:el:io:historicalnotice00elio:historicalnotice00elio_0051/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/ic/al/no/ti/ce/00/el/io/historicalnotice00elio/historicalnotice00elio_0051.jp2", "height": 4430, "width": 2364, "levels": 6, "size": 452228}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"51\">\n<p>\n 51\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Andrew Eliot published twelve single sermons, in the course of his\n ministry, upon various occasions ; and, a few years before his death, a volume\n of twenty sermons, most of which his hearers had urged him to have printed,\n when first delivered.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. John Eliot published a sermon and charge to Free Masons, and five\n sermons on different occasions, with many communications in the Collections\n of the Historical Society and other periodical works; also, The New England\n Biographical Dictionary.
