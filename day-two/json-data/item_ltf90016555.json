One\n day, at dinner, she said, with a sweet smile, \u201cI am\n an old woman, but I believe I do not look it,\u201d and\n in truth she did not. There was nothing of the\n decrepitude of age about her. And so we continued\n our pleasing intercourse through the winter and\n spring. Presently all Paris was alarmed by un-\n happy rumors of war. The French, alas ! were con-\n fident and vain-glorious, sure of success ; but it was\n frightful. Such a spirit was manifested in the moral\n world there as in the natural world before the ex-\n plosion of a volcano. Wrathful mutterings and a\n dread apprehension filled many minds, and then\n came at last that declaration of war, which intoxi-\n cated one half of France, and filled with sorrow the\n other. At the morning receptions of the dear Mar-\n quise, I would overhear grave and threatening, as\n well as arrogant, if not vindictive talk by the gentle-\n men, all of whom were so sure of victory that the\n whole thing seemed an excitement to them.\n</p>\n<p>\n At these receptions, at this beautiful season of the\n year, the Marquise shared with her friends the mag-\n nificent fruits of her belle Luciennes. Such straw-\n berries I had never seen, \u2014 many of them as big\n as good-sized tomatoes, \u2014 they were prodigious. La\n belle France had everything but tranquillity. Splen-\n did flowers and fruits came not only from Luciennes,\n but poured into Paris from all parts ; and with these\n came tidings of preparations for a cruel war that was\n to be a snare and a scourge for this unhappy people.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:co:ll:ec:ti:on:so:ft:00:sm:it:recollectionsoft00smit:recollectionsoft00smit_0068/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 271, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 447}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:co:ll:ec:ti:on:so:ft:00:sm:it:recollectionsoft00smit:recollectionsoft00smit_0068/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 542, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 894}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:co:ll:ec:ti:on:so:ft:00:sm:it:recollectionsoft00smit:recollectionsoft00smit_0068/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1085, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1789}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:co:ll:ec:ti:on:so:ft:00:sm:it:recollectionsoft00smit:recollectionsoft00smit_0068/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2171, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3579}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:co:ll:ec:ti:on:so:ft:00:sm:it:recollectionsoft00smit:recollectionsoft00smit_0068/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/co/ll/ec/ti/on/so/ft/00/sm/it/recollectionsoft00smit/recollectionsoft00smit_0068.jp2", "height": 3579, "width": 2171, "levels": 6, "size": 390751}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"68\">\n<p>\n 46\n</p>\n<p>\n TWO DISTINGUISHED PERSONS.\n</p>\n<p>\n I was preparing to return to America, the Mar-\n quise was making arrangements to go to her home\n in Italy ; when we met, care and anxiety were upon\n us both.

Yes,\n dearest, you are right in speaking of his industry\n and perseverance. I am greatly in hopes he will\n live long enough to see crowned with success the\n drawings he commenced, and the dear old gent is\n very deeply engaged in revising the text, which is a\n real casse-Ute. The 16th of this month he entered\n his 109th year. We gave a soiree. How much I\n wished you had been amongst us ! The party broke\n up at near three in the morning.
