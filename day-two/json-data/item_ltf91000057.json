From this point to Troy, a distance of about forty miles, its course is much\n broken by rapids; but at the latter place, one hundred and fifty-one miles from its mouth, it is af\u00ac\n fected by the tide, and becomes a broad and deep river.\n</p>\n<p>\n The navigable Hudson is a small river, as regards its length, when wp compare it with the Mis\u00ac\n sissippi, the Missouri, the St. Lawrence, the Rhine, or the Danube ; but no stream excels it in interest,\n and few unite so deep and broad a current with shores so grand and bold. There is, indeed, no gain\u00ac\n saying the surpassing beauty of the Hudson. No river in Europe equals it in varied, picturesque\n charm. Some are inclined to place a higher estimate upon the Rhine on account of its ruins and old\n towns ; but the Rhine is monotonous compared with the Hudson. Its course is winding, but its\n shores are uniform in character, and the hills are denuded of trees, while the river has not that vary\u00ac\n ing succession of broad expanse and narrow pass that gives to the Hudson a peculiar and untiring\n charm.\n</p>\n<p>\n The best way to see the Hudson is from the deck of one of the fine steamboats that daily ascend\n and descend its current. Let the traveler get a position if possible on the forward-deck, inasmuch as\n the scene is far more striking and effective when both shores can be taken in at once; while the\n traveler thus placed has the opportunity of enjoying a succession of surprises that, amid the High\u00ac\n lands specially, give zest to the picture. It sometimes happens that the boat appears land-locked on\n</p>\n<p>\n Castle Hill, Hoboken.\n</p>\n<p>\n all sides; it is, apparently, a lake and not a river that it is traversing; when suddenly a turn is made,\n and a superb stretch of the river is opened to the view. This very striking characteristic of the\n river is lost to one who is contented to simply watch the shore as the boat glides by it. The day-\n boats on the Hudson are large and fine vessels, but the night-boats are larger\u2014massive floating pal\u00ac\n aces. A moonlight journey upon the Hudson, in one of these sumptuous boats, is an experience to\n remember, and we recommend those who have taken the day journey to make a second trip on a\n soft, summer, moonlight night, when new and wondrous charms of the river will be unfolded to them.\n</p>\n<p>\n The traveler, indeed, should remember that effects of scenery depend very much upon the hour in\n which they are seen, and the conditions of the sky. A really grand mountain looks dwarfed at mid\u00ac\n day, with the sun pouring down a blaze of light upon it, without a shadow to relieve its surface; the\n same mountain towers nobly with the sun shining behind it, and its top purpling in the twilight. On\n cloudy days, mountains and hills take a monotonous gray, and lose that brilliant vivacity which on a\n fair day shadow and sheen will give them. No one, in truth, knows what any scene really is for beauty,\n unless he looks upon it with the sun sufficiently low to make deep and long shadows; for a scene that\n is commonplace at noon becomes radiant with many charms at a later hour.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0007/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 201, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 307}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0007/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 403, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 615}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0007/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 806, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1231}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0007/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1613, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2462}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0007/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3226, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4925}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0007/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hu/ds/on/ri/ve/rb/yp/en/00/un/se/hudsonriverbypen00unse/hudsonriverbypen00unse_0007.jp2", "height": 4925, "width": 3226, "levels": 6, "size": 1000854}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"7\">\n<p>\n THE HUDSON RIVER .\n</p>\n<p>\n 5\n</p>\n<p>\n But let us begin our tour. It is a noble scene which the grand steamer sails out into from her\n wharf. The river here has broadened into a bay some miles wide ; it is covered with craft of many\n kinds\u2014with great steamships from the harbors of the Old World, with sloops and schooners from the\n towns far up the river, with snorting little tug-boats rushing hither and thither in obedience to various\n summons, with ferry-boats hurrying from shore to shore, with yachts and pleasure-boats, with fishing-\n craft, and great tows of canal-boats and barges under careful charge of stately and sturdy steamboats.\n</p>\n<p>\n No harbor anywhere exhibits such a variety of craft, or presents so stirring and animated a scene, as\n that of New York; it only needs the feluccas of the Mediterranean to make it supremely and unap\u00ac\n proachably picturesque in the variety of its craft.\n</p>\n<p>\n The New Jersey shore here forms the western bank of the river. A little way below, toward the\n bay, is Jersey City; just north of it lies Hoboken, famous for its Elysian Fields, its German beer-gar-\n dens, and its sea-side walks. Just between the village and the Fields, on an elevation known as Castle y\n Hill, are the grounds and residence of the late R. L. Stevens, once principal owner of all the land now( '\n forming the town, and distinguished for several inventions in steam navigation, among which is th$t\n unfinished but famous iron-plated battery with which hq hoped to create a revolution in naval warfare.\n The house is choicely situated, and the grounds around it are beautiful with lawn, meadow, and grove.\n Just below the hill is a walk along the river-edge, by which the Elysian Fields, just above, are\n reached\u2014a walk that in former times was daily thronged to excess with pleasure-seekers, and which,\n though now no longer a fashionable resort, has still its groups of festive people enjoying the air from\n the river. The glory of the Elysian Fields is almost gone ; wharves encroach upon them ; and the\n Weehawken hills, that follow next in succession, are becoming crowded with villages and with lager-\n beer breweries. The huge, many-storied building that attracts the curious attention of every traveler\n is a gigantic brewery at Guttenburg; its roof is on a level with the hill-top, and here is a beer-garden\n where, on summer afternoons, our Teutonic friends come in great number to smoke, drink, and enjoy\n the cool evening air. But as we glide along the shore, noting the little clusters of houses that glitter\n amid the foliage, the mind forgets for a moment the spectacle before it, and recalls the day when the\n report of a pistol was heard at the base of these hills, the reverberation of which still fills the world\n with horror.

These places attract the traveler, not merely because they open to him the picturesque\n</p>\n<p>\n Fort Washington.\n</p>\n<p>\n vista of the river ; they are historical spots, and for this reason, if for no other, excite his interest. Fort\n Washington lies between One Hundred and Eighty-fourth and One Hundred and Eighty-fifth Streets,\n near the upper boundary of New York island. Washington Heights, just below the site of the\n fort, are covered with beautiful villas; this, indeed, is one of the most elegant and fashionable suburbs\n of the metropolis. Fort Washington was an extensive earthwork occupying the crown of the heights ;\n its possession was retained after the retreat of the American army into Westchester County, subsequent\n to the battle of Long Island, but it fell into the hands of the enemy in November of 1776, its garrison\n of three thousand men becoming prisoners of war. Four days after the fall of this fort, Lord Cornwal\u00ac\n lis, with six thousand men, crossed the river above at Dobb\u2019s Ferry, and attacked Fort Lee, then under\n the command of General Greene, The American garrison made a hasty retreat to the encampment of\n the main army, under Washington, five miles back at Hackensack, and the fort became an English\n possession. Fort Lee was named after the eccentric General Charles Lee, and stood upon the lower\n boundary of the Palisades, those high, perpendicular cliffs which, beginning at this point, stretch in an\n unbroken line for twenty-four miles along the western shore of the river, varying in height, it is said, from\n three hundred to five hundred feet, although possessing apparently a very uniform altitude. Nothing,\n we believe, remains of the old fort. The place is now a famous pleasure-ground. A fine new sum\u00ac\n mer hotel has been erected half-way up the hill, and on summer days boats bring crowds of excur\u00ac\n sionists from the city, many of whom ascend to the top of the cliff, and distribute themselves along\n the broken and picturesque escarpment, enjoying the superb views of river and shore, and distant bay,\n that it affords. .Just below the high grounds of Fort Washington is a point of land known as Jeffrey\u2019s\n Hook. f A redoubt was erected here at the time of the Revolution, remains of which are still to be\n seen ; it fell into the hands of the English at the time of the capitulation of the fort above it, as did all\n the defenses of the Whig patriots standing upon the island.\n</p>\n<p>\n Two miles above Jeffrey\u2019s Hook, we reach the well-known Spuyten Duyvel Creek, which marks the\n northern limits of Manhattan Island.

Lands were purchased here from the\n Indians, by some of the Dutch West India Company, as early as the beginning of Peter Stuyvesant\u2019s ad\u00ac\n ministration of the affairs of New Netherland. There was an Indian village here, named Nap-pe-cha-\n mak, signifying rapid water, and the name of Neper ah, derived from this, was applied to the rapid\n little stream upon which the town is built, now, however, known by the prosaic appellation of Saw-Mill\n River. Yonkers remained for many years nothing more than a slow and t pld-fashioned Dutch town,\n until the opening of the Hudson River Railway, some forty years ago, when suddenly it sprang into\n importance, and rapidly became a thriving suburb of the great metropolis. It is now chartered as a city.\n A very large proportion of its citizens are business-men of New York. It contains many handsome\n residences, from the grand villa down to the pretty cottage, with not a few imposing churches, and in\n all particulars is a first-rate specimen of a prosperous American semi-rustic town. For the antiquary,\n there is one notable attraction, this being the Philipse Manor Hall, a spacious stone edifice, that once\n belonged to the lords of Philipse Manor. The older portion of this building was erected in 1682 ; the\n present front, forming an addition, was built in 1765. The rooms are large and wainscoted, with lofty\n ceilings. The principal one has some elaborate ornamental work in high-relief. Some of the fireplaces\n are surrounded with borders of ancient Dutch tiles, and in the grounds there is a well, it is said, with a\n subterranean passage leading from it, nobody knows to where. It has been recently converted to mu\u00ac\n nicipal uses, the city offices being located within its walls.

It is massive in form, sharp in outline, and has no peculiar likeness to the feature\n after which it is named; but it is the subject of one of the legends recorded by Irving, which add so\n much to the pleasure of the traveler. Be it known, then, that the nose of Anthony, Governor\n Stuyvesant\u2019s trumpeter, was decked with the true regalia of a king of good fellows. \u201c Now it happened\n that, bright and early in the morning, the good Anthony, having washed his burly visage, was leaning\n over the quarter-railing of his galley, contemplating it in the glassy wave below. Just at this moment\n the illustrious sun, breaking in all his splendor from behind a high bluff of the Highlands, did dart one\n</p>\n<p>\n of his most potent beams full upon the refulgent nose of the sounder of brass\u2014the reflection of which\n shot straightway down, hissing-hot, into the water, and killed a mighty sturgeon that was sporting be\u00ac\n side the vessel. This huge monster being, with infinite labor, hoisted on board, furnished a luxurious\n repast to all the crew, being accounted of excellent flavor, excepting about the wound, where it smacked\n a little of brimstone; and this, on my veracity, was the first time that ever sturgeon was eaten in these\n parts by Christian people. When this astonishing miracle became known to Peter Stuyvesant, he, as\n may well be supposed, marveled exceedingly; and, as a monument thereof, he gave the name of An\u00ac\n thony\u2019s Nose to a stout promon\u00ac\n tory in the neighborhood, and it\n has continued to be called An\u00ac\n thony\u2019s Nose ever since that time.\u201d\n This mountain is tunneled at the\n river-edge, for the Hudson River\n Railway.\n</p>\n<p>\n From Fort Montgomery,\n across the river to Anthony\u2019s Nose,\n a heavy boom, at the time of\n the Revolution, formed of an\n immense iron chain on timber-\n floats, extended. This, it was\n thought, would effectually prevent\n the ascent of a hostile fleet to\n West Point; while the two forts,\n which were commanded by the\n brothers, Generals George and\n James Clinton, were thought to\n be impregnable on the land-side.\n On October 6, 1777, Sir Henry\n Clinton, the British commander,\n sent a strong detachment over the\n Dunderberg to attack the two\n forts in the rear. A preconcerted\n demonstration on the east side of\n</p>\n<p>\n the river induced General Putnam to believe that the attack would be made on Fort Independence, near\n Peekskill, and he accordingly withdrew part of the garrison at Fort Montgomery to strengthen the\n former. Approaching Fort Montgomery, the British had a sharp skirmish with an American detach\u00ac\n ment at Lake Sinnipink, which is still known as Bloody Pond, and then advanced toward the two forts.\n The garrisons fought desperately till evening, when it became evident that they could not hold out, and\n they retreated in good order, after losing, in killed, wounded, and prisoners, about three hundred. The\n British loss was about one hundred and forty.\n</p>\n<p>\n The river now bends to the northeast. On the right is the symmetrical cone of Sugar-Loaf Moun\u00ac\n tain.

Another\n grand view of the Catskills is obtained from its summit.\n</p>\n<p>\n Less than a mile above is the city of Hudson, lying upon a bold, rocky promontory, fifty feet high.\n The town was founded in 1784 by thirty proprietors, chiefly Quakers from New England. \u201c Never in\n the history of cities,\u201d says Lossing, \u201chas there been a more extraordinary example of rapid growth\n than that of Hudson. Within three years of the time when the farm on which it stands was purchased,\n over fifteen hundred persons had settled there, and the land was covered with wharves, storehouses,\n workshops, and barns. The population is now about fifteen thousand, and the principal street extends\n from the slopes of a lofty eminence called Prospect Hill, nearly a mile to the brow of a promontory\n fronting the river, where a pleasant public promenade was laid out more than fifty years ago. Directly\n opposite the city is the thriving village of Athens, which was first named Lunenberg, then Esperanza,\n and finally incorporated under its present name. Behind it spreads a country inhabited by a population\n consisting chiefly of the descendants of the Dutch, and all through the region, from Coxsackie to Kings\u00ac\n ton, the old language is still used in many families.\n</p>\n<p>\n Still a little higher up, on the west bank, is Four-Mile Point, marked by a light-house, from which\n we glance down on the city of Hudson farther down, and above Four-Mile Point is the village of Cox\u00ac\n sackie, which means \u201c cut banks.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Until we reach Albany the scenery is now monotonous. We successively pass the village of Stuy-\n vesant, New Baltimore, noticeable for its ship-yards, and, near Coeyman\u2019s (pronounced Queman\u2019s), a\n high, rocky island, on which the boundaries of four counties meet\u2014Albany, Greene, Columbia, and\n Rensselaer. This was formerly named Bear Island, and on its summit was the castle of Rensselaer-\n stein, from the walls of which the agent of a potentate called the \u201c Patroon \u201d demanded tribute from\n passing vessels.\n</p>\n<p>\n Castleton, on a steep hill-side of the eastern bank, is the next village in our route. Near here there\n is a serious impediment to navigation in the Overslaugh, a bar in the river; but of late years the chan\u00ac\n nel has been much improved by a system of dikes, which stretch for several miles along the course.\n Greenbush is on the eastern bank, and once was the site of extensive military barracks, whence troops\n were forwardfed in 1812 to the Canadian frontier. But we have now reached Albany, the capital of the\n State, and a city rich in historical associations, yet alive with the prosperous traffic of to-day. The\n student will find little difficulty in repeopling some of the curious old houses with the Knickerbocker\n magnates who so faithfully transplanted all their manners and customs, even in matters of architecture,\n to the new country, while the bustling commercial man will discover a fine example of an American\n city in the busy streets, the lofty buildings, and the crowded wharves, on which a very large proportion\n of all the produce conveyed through the Erie Canal is emptied.\n</p>\n<p>\n Before Albany was incorporated, it was variously known as Beverwyck, Williamstadt, and New\n Orange. Its growth was exceedingly slow, as was proper in a city of Knickerbockers, and in a hun\u00ac\n dred years from the time of its incorporation it could only boast of a population of ten thousand. But\n when Fulton succeeded in his experiments, and the steam-navigation of the Hudson became an accom\u00ac\n plished fact, and when the Erie Canal was completed, and discharged immense loads of produce in the\n great basin, which is now the harbor of hundreds of boats, Albany attracted an increase of more than\n fifty thousand to its population in less than fifty years. Two hundred years ago it was surrounded by\n wooden walls, with loop-holes for musketry, and six gates, the ruins of which were in existence until\n 1812; but now, with a population of nearly seventy thousand, it is laid out with handsome avenues\n and drives, and will soon possess one of the most magnificent legislative buildings in the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n Eight railways terminate in it or pass through it; its manufactories consist principally of stove-\n founderies and breweries ; its sales of barley amount to over two million bushels a year, and its trade\n in lumber and cattle is equally large. The public buildings, besides the Capitol, include the celebrated\n Dudley Observatory, the State Arsenal, the State Library, and the University. On the flats above the\n city is the Schuyler House, the home of the first mayor of Albany, and in the northern part is the Van\n Rensselaer Manor, the home of the first Patroon\u2014two of the most interesting historic houses of\n America.\n</p>\n<p>\n Six miles above Albany is Troy, a city with a population of nearly fifty thousand. It is an active,\n thriving city, with many large manufactories, handsome churches, and elegant private residences.\n Poestenkill, a small creek, breaks through the city in narrow ravines and in a series of cascades, which\n 4\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0052/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 196, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 305}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0052/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 392, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 610}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0052/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 785, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1220}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0052/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1570, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2441}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0052/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3140, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4882}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0052/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hu/ds/on/ri/ve/rb/yp/en/00/un/se/hudsonriverbypen00unse/hudsonriverbypen00unse_0052.jp2", "height": 4882, "width": 3140, "levels": 6, "size": 781924}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"52\">\n<p>\n 5 \u00b0\n</p>\n<p>\n THE HUDSON RIVER.\n</p>\n<p>\n supply power to numerous mills.

The road lies on the eastern bank of the river, touching its waters continually, and ever and anon\n crossing wide bays and the mouths of tributary streams. Great difficulties were surmounted in its\n mountain, rock, and water passage, and all so successfully and so thoroughly, that it is one of the\n securest routes on the continent. Opened 43 miles to Peekskill, September 29, 1849, and opened\n through, October 8, 1851. It has eight tunnels, with an aggregate length of 3,595 feet. The total\n amount expended in building and equipping the line was $12,700,000. With its heavy business, its\n history is happily free from any considerable record of collision or accident. This is owing as much to\n the vigilant management and the admirable police as to the substantial character of the road itself.\n The flag-men are so stationed along the entirj line, at intervals of a mile, and at curves and acclivities,\n as to secure unbroken signal communication from one end to the other. There are several through\n express trains daily from Grand Central Depot, Forty-second Street, Time, 4^ to 5-^ hours.\n</p>\n<p>\n Stations. \u2014Spuyten Duyvel, 13; Riverdale, 14; Mount St. Vincent, 15 ; Yonkers, 17 ; Glenwood,\n 18; Hastings, 21 ; Dobb\u2019s Ferry, 22 ; Irvington, 24 (ferry to Piermont, terminus of Piermont Branch\n of Erie Railway) ; Tarrytown, 27 (ferry to Nyack) ; Scarborough, 31 ; Sing Sing, 32 ; Croton, 36 ;\n Cruger\u2019s, 37 ; Montrose, 41; Peekskill, 43 ; Fort Montgomery, 47 ; Garrison\u2019s, 51 (ferry to West Point) ;\n Cold Spring, 54; Cornwall Station, 56; Fishkill, 60 (ferry to Newburg, terminus of Newburg Branch\n of Erie Railway); Low Point, 64; New Hamburgh, 66; Milton Ferry, 71 ; Poughkeepsie, 75 ; Hyde\n Park, 80; Staatsburg, 85; Rhinebeck, 90; Barrytowo, 96; Tivoli, 100; Germantown, 105; Catskill\n Station, in ; Hudson, 115 (connects with Hudson and Boston Railway) ; Stockport, 119; Coxsackie\n Station, 123; Stuyvesant, 125; Schodack, 132; Castleton, 135; East Albany, 144; Albany (connects\n with New York Central and Albany & Susquehanna Railways); Troy, 150 (connects with Troy &\n Boston and with Rensselaer & Saratoga Railways).\n</p>\n<p>\n BY WEST SHORE & BUFFALO RAILWAY.\n</p>\n<p>\n A new, attractive, and popular route for Hudson River travel was opened in the summer of 1883,\n by the completion of the New York , West Shore Buffalo Railway. This double-track line extends\n from Weehawken, by ferry from West Forty-second Street, back of the Palisades to Haverstraw, thence\n along the picturesque west shore of the river, skirting the foot-hills of the Catskill Mountains, and con\u00ac\n necting in Albany in a union passenger station with trains on the Delaware & Hudson Canal Com\u00ac\n pany\u2019s Railroad for Saratoga, Lakes George and Champlain, Adirondacks, Montreal, and all points in\n the provinces. Summer tourists will be especially pleased to learn that the points of interest along the\n west shore of the Hudson River are rendered speedily accessible by the completion of this line. So\u00ac\n journers among the Catskills, or transient visitors to that delightful mountain-region, have a personal\n interest in the provisions made for their especial accommodation and comfort. At Kingston, union depot\n facilities enable trains to make direct connection with trains of the Ulster & Delaware Railroad, thus\n obviating the transfer of passengers or baggage ; and at Catskill, connections are made with the Cats\u00ac\n kill Mountain Railroad.

This superbly built railroad has been justly named the \u201c Picturesque Route,\u201d\n traversing as it does the west shore of the historic and world-famed Hudson River,\n skirting the toot-hills of the Catskill Mountains, famous in Washington Irving\u2019s\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Rip Van Winkle,\u201d and passing through\n the beautiful Mohawk Valley. .By this\n route three express trains are run daily,\n in each direction, between New York,\n Albany, Utica, Syracuse, Rochester, Buf\u00ac\n falo, Niagara Falls, Toronto, Detroit,\n Chicago, St. Louis, and the West. Palace\n sleeping-cars are attached to these trains,\n and run through without change between the points named. The West Shore, in connection with the Fitchburg\n Railroad, is also the shortest line between Boston and Chicago. It is the only all-rail line to the Catskill Moun\u00ac\n tains, and the only line by which drawing-room cars are run through to the heart of the Catskills. During\n the season of summer travel fast Catskill Mountain express trains are scheduled. Attached to these trains are\n drawing-room cars, which run through without change between Philadelphia, Jersey City, New York, and Cats\u00ac\n kill Mountains. Saratoga limited express trains are also run by the West Shore during the summer season, and\n have drawing-room cars at\u00ac\n tached which run through with\u00ac\n out change between Washing\u00ac\n ton, Baltimore, Philadelphia,\n</p>\n<p>\n Long Branch, Jersey City, New\n York, and Saratoga. Buffet\n smoking-cars, with revolving\n chairs, are a special feature of\n the splendid service on the\n West Shore. Drawing-room\n cars are also run between Saratoga and Niagara Falls. The West Shore also runs special trains between New\n York and New Paltz during the summer season for the accommoda tion of travel to and from Lakes Mohonk and\n Minnewaska, Shawangunk, and all points in the Walkill Valley. The connection in Jersey City station with\n the Pennsylvania Railroad will be appreciated by travelers to and from the South and the resorts of central New\n York State, as the long transfer through New York is thereby avoided. Passengers and baggage from Brooklyn\n are taken direct from the foot of Fulton Street by Annex boat to Jersey City station. Tickets via West Shore\n can be purchased at ticket-offices of all connecting lines, and they are sold and baggage checked through to\n destination from all stations of the West Shore Railroad.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0057/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 192, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 308}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0057/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 385, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 616}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0057/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 771, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1233}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0057/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1543, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2467}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0057/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3086, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0057/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hu/ds/on/ri/ve/rb/yp/en/00/un/se/hudsonriverbypen00unse/hudsonriverbypen00unse_0057.jp2", "height": 4935, "width": 3086, "levels": 6, "size": 584642}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"57\">\n<p>\n AD VERTISEMENTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Tl\\e Grfkqd Tfui)k Railway,\n</p>\n<p>\n IN CONNECTION WITH THE MAGNIFICENT PALACE STEAMERS\n</p>\n<p>\n OF THE\n</p>\n<p>\n RICHELIEU & ONTARIO NAVIGATION COMPANY,.\n</p>\n<p>\n FORMS THE GREAT PLEASURE ROUTE\n</p>\n<p>\n OF THE AMERICAN CONTINENT.\n</p>\n<p>\n PULLMAN PALACE, SLEEPING, AND PARLOR CARS ARE ATTACHED TO\n all Express Trains and run through on quick time.\n</p>\n<p>\n An Extensive Variety of Tourist Tickets on hand at all Principal Offices,\n comprising all the Most Popular and Interesting Routes, including\n</p>\n<p>\n LAKE ONTARIO AND THE RIYER ST.

They were delighted\u2014charmed. All make the\n same report and tell the same story of the matchless grandeur of the trip, of the midnight sun, of the placid waters, of the\n aurora borealis, of the majestic mountains, of the island seas, of the mighty glaciers, of the thundering iceberg plunging into the\n sea and floating off in its glory of inimitable splendor, of the wealth of fish, timber, and mineral, of the queer customs of the na\u00ac\n tives, of novelty, and startling incidents that may well make the trip the object of a lifetime. There is nothing like it.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is the intention of the Company to run two steamers to Alaska this season, making fortnightly trips. These will be\n the large side-wheel steamer Ancon and the fine iron propeller Geo. W. Elder. They will connect at Port Townsend with the\n San Francisco steamers. The Ancon will make Tacoma her starting-point, calling at Seattle, Port Townsend, and Victoria,\n while the Elder will start from Portland calling at Seattle, Port Townsend, and Victoria, but not at Tacoma.\n</p>\n<p>\n Canadian passengers can take the Alaska steamers at Port Townsend or Victoria. Northern Pacific passengers or passengers\n by rail from or via Portland can take the Ancon at Tacoma or either the Ancon or Elder at Seattle, Townsend, or Victoria.\n</p>\n<p>\n Tickets will be sold from San Francisco good either via the Columbia River, Portland, and Tacoma, or via the Straits of\n Fuca and Victoria to go one way and return the other. Passengers from the East holding through tickets to Alaska via Portland\n can take the Alaska steamer (the Elder) direct from Portland or go from Portland to Puget Sound by rail and take steamer there.\n</p>\n<p>\n Further and full information can be obtained by writing to\n</p>\n<p>\n GOODALL, PERKINS & CO., General Agents,\n</p>\n<p>\n No. 10 Market Street, San Francisco,\n</p>\n<p>\n Or to any of the Pacific Coast Steamship Company ' s Local Agents.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0060/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 196, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 305}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0060/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 392, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 610}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0060/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 785, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1220}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0060/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1570, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2441}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0060/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3140, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4882}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hu:ds:on:ri:ve:rb:yp:en:00:un:se:hudsonriverbypen00unse:hudsonriverbypen00unse_0060/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hu/ds/on/ri/ve/rb/yp/en/00/un/se/hudsonriverbypen00unse/hudsonriverbypen00unse_0060.jp2", "height": 4882, "width": 3140, "levels": 6, "size": 630249}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"60\">\n<p>\n A D VER TISEMENTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n flPPLETONS\u2019 GUIDE-BOOKS.\n</p>\n<p>\n yQ^ppletons\u2019 General Guide to the United States and Canada\n</p>\n<p>\n Compiled on the plan of the famous Baedeker Hand-Books of Europe.

Y.\n</p>\n<p>\n OPEN JUNE 20th TO SEPTEMBER 20th.\n</p>\n<p>\n This well-known Summer Hotel is situated on one of the eastern ledges of the summit of the Catskill Mountains, 2,250\n feet above tide-water, and by reason of its peculiarly advantageous location, on the front of the range, is the only hotel\n that commands the famous view of the Hudson Valley, which stretches out from the base of the mountains below, to the\n Adirondacks in the north, the Green Mountain and Berkshire Hills in the east, and the Highlands in thj south, embracing\n an area of 12,000 square miles, with sixty miles of the Hudson River in the foreground.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE MOUNTAIN-HOUSE PAI^K\n</p>\n<p>\n Has a valley frontage of over three miles in extent, and consists of 3,000 acres, or about five square miles, of magnificent\n forest and farming lands, traversed in all directions by mapy miles of carriage-roads and paths leading to various noted\n places of interest.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Crest, Newman\u2019s Ledge, Bears\u2019 Den, and Prospect Rock on Nonb Mountain, and Fagle Rock and Palenville Over\u00ac\n look on South Mountain, from which the grandest views of the region are obtained, are included in the property.

The atmosphere is delightful, invigorating, and pure, the great elevation and surrounding forest rendering it\n absolutely free from malaria. It affords relief to sufferers from Chills and Fever, Asthma. Hay-Fever, T oss of Appetite,\n and General Debility. The temperature is always fifteen to twenty degrees lower than at Catskill Village, New York\n City, or Philadelphia. The location and surroundings are in all respects the most desirable in the entire range of the\n Catskills, and no hotel similarly situated is so easy of access or so near in time to New York City.

Accessible via\n</p>\n<p>\n CATSKILL MOUNTAIN RAILWAY,\n</p>\n<p>\n From Catskill Landing on the Hudson River, to Mountain-House Station (six trains each way daily), and thence by car\u00ac\n riage to the hotel, it is nearer in time to New York, Albany, or Saratoga than any other hotel m the mountains of equal\n elevation. It is also accessible by the Kaaterskill Railroad, the terminus of which, at the western end of South Lake, is\n but one mile, or ten minutes\u2019 drive, from the Mountain House. Time from New York City, via Catskill Mountain Rail\u00ac\n way, via New York Central and Hudson River Railroad, or via West Shore Railroad, 5 )\u00a3 hours.
