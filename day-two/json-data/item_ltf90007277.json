Divine purposes work long unseen, and divine\n principles are embodied often long before their source and\n portent are acknowledged.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is explained in this volume that by the New Jerusalem is\n meant a new dispensation of the Church and of Religion, which\n shall be truly Christian; in which it shall be allowable to enter\n intellectually into the things of faith, and be possible to\n develop a fuller spiritual and rational life; that this dispensa-\n tion of the Church is inaugurated by new revelation from the\n Lord opening the spiritual sense and divine meaning of the\n Sacred Scriptures; and that it was preceded by a last judgment\n in the world of spirits from which results a new freedom of\n willing and thinking among men; and that in it is to be ful-\n filled the divine promise, \u201cBehold, I make all things new.\u201d This\n new dispensation is the re-establishment and crowning of the\n Christian Church in that fullness of revelation foretold by all the\n prophets and promised by the Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n But before truth, rational and luminous, attesting its Divine\n origin and power, could descend from heaven to set up the\n tabernacle of God with men, order and obedience had to be\n founded, rationality established and freedom constituted. In\n the 144,000 and in the great multitude picked out of every nation\n and kindred and tongue, John saw the first fruits of the Lord\u2019s\n redemption; but for the establishment of the self-perpetuating\n kingdom of Divine truth upon earth, the nations of the earth\n had to be educated.\n</p>\n<p>\n It has been a principle of Divine Providence from of old to\n break the lust of universal dominion by rivalry of selfishness.\n The evils of personal dominion are mitigated by the struggles of\n persons for mastery. We may see thus the hand of God in the\n overthrow of the Roman empire and the rise of feudalism. It\n brought the hand of authority nearer to the people and trained\n them in obedience and self-interest. The Church entered into\n the struggle with its witness to divine authority and opened to\n the masses the thought of the King of Kings. It demanded\n obedienpe from the lords of the obedient, and lent its authority\n</p>\n<p>\n is\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0018/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 285, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 463}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0018/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 571, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 926}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0018/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1143, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1853}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0018/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2287, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3707}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0018/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wj/er/us/al/em/in/wo/00/me/rc/newjerusaleminwo00merc/newjerusaleminwo00merc_0018.jp2", "height": 3707, "width": 2287, "levels": 6, "size": 597766}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"18\">\n<p>\n X\n</p>\n<p>\n INTRODUCTION\n</p>\n<p>\n to whomsoever would serve it. A larger order succeeded. The\n king subdued the lords, and monarchy succeeded feudalism. It\n founded and endowed universities and encouraged commerce.\n It conceded no political privileges to the people, but prepared\n its subjects to demand them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then came the revival of learning. No further step towards\n the manhood of men could be taken without the enfranchise-\n ment of the intellect. The longing of the universities and of\n the learned for the treasures of ancient wisdom, \u201chidden and\n yet insecure in monastic cells and libraries,\u201d drew down those\n currents of inspiration that waited to direct the invention of the\n printing press. With its advent was shown the Divine hand\n which had been over-ruling in the civil and social revolutions of\n Europe. \u201cIts first service was to the people; its first fruits the\n printed Bible.\u201d The story of the revival of learning we need\n not repeat. It constituted the second step in the preparation of\n mankind for manhood; first, social order and obedience; second,\n the enfranchisement of the intellect. But until this last shall\n become common, and the masses of men rational in their power\n to think for themselves and with each other, there can be no\n self-government. Nor was this possible under the despotio hand\n of custom and privilege entrenched in the monarchies of\n Europe. Humanity must burst forth at the sides into a new and\n boundless theater of ambition and enterprise in order to learn\n its powers of thinking and its capacities for individual charac-\n ter and self-control. Columbus was in training and America\n was found. How that event opened a new theater for the experi-\n ment of civil and religious liberty, and changed the face of\n every European institution as certainly as it founded the most\n prosperous people and most beneficent civil government in the\n world, is familiar history. Without that opening of providence,\n the progress of science, the growth of humanities, the populariz-\n ation of education and participation in natural plenty had not\n been possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n What concerns us now to note is, that the discovery and\n colonization of America, together with the new reformation in\n Europe, made possible the final step in the natural man\u2019s devel-\n opment, \u2014 that of self-government.

all men form one Greatest Man; as all times and con-\n ditions and modes of life are parts of the growth and experience\n of universal man; as the advancement of the whole depends\n upon universal respect for every part, and the good of each\n subsists in subordination, not to prejudice and tradition, but to\n the highest good of the whole; it was, therefore, of all things fit\n that the Exposition should show the result, not of the rivalry\n and competition, but of the co-operation and combination of\n the best results of ages and nations, as the Parliament of\n Religions was to be a friendly conference of the lovers of right-\n eousness, bringing out of their treasure \u201c things new and old,\u201d\n not for controversy, but for comparison; not to establish the old,\n but to

C. Bonney, president of \u201cThe World\u2019s Congress\n Auxiliary,\u201d has prepared, at the request of the editors of\n The New- Church Review , on account of the doctrinal\n basis in his own mind, the practical inception, and the\n organization and conduct of the Religious Congresses,\n which, as the whole movement under Divine Providence,\n originated with him, and grew out of his conception of\n the New Jerusalem, belongs here. He has revised that\n account for this publication, making some changes and\n additions, the better to adapt it to the present purpose.\n Speaking as to friends, he writes in the first person of\n the preparation which his life experience had furnished\n for the conception and direction of the Congresses, and\n especially of Religious Congresses which were central in\n his concern. After referring to his early interest in the\n study of comparative religions, he says:\n</p>\n<p>\n This first stage of preparation was followed by\n another of still higher significance, under the influence\n of the Church of the Holy City, New Jerusalem. At the\n age of nineteen I removed to Peoria, 111., and there, for\n the first time, saw a New-Church congregation and heard a\n New-Church sermon. My previous information of the\n system of Swedenborg had given me the impression that it\n was a religion for literary and scientific persons, and I was\n therefore surprised to find that this congregation had no\n member eminent in scholastic attainments, excepting the\n pastor.

Thus I came into a state of charity,\n not only toward the various religious denominations of\n Christendom, but also in regard to the different religions\n of the world.

This is borne out by the fact that no\n Christian denomination makes provision in its liturgy or\n discipline for so extensive and constant a use of the\n sacred Scriptures as does the Church of England, both\n in private and public worship, and no other agency in the\n world equals those of the British and the American\n Foreign Bible Society in distributing Bibles throughout\n the world.

The great body of worshipers\n acquiesced in silent deference to the leader; but for once\n only; for when on a subsequent day Monsignore Seton\n led in the prayer and again stopped with an amen after\n the petition for deliverance, the great sea of voices rolled\n on unchecked in massive concert: \u201cFor thine is the\n kingdom, and the power, and the glory, forever.

What was\n noticeable besides the close and earnest attention given\n to every speaker was the applause, as an indication of\n the popular sentiment there represented. But once was\n there an outcry of disapproval, and that was when the\n advocate of Mohammedanism uttered what was taken to\n be an approval of polygamy, when a cry of No! No!\n came from many sides.

Dr. Briggs in the\n ante-room of the Parliament, before going upon the plat-\n form, I remarked to him that we were to speak on the\n same subject, but perhaps from different standpoints, I\n being a New- Churchman and holding to the teachings of\n Swedenborg, with which I supposed he was acquainted.\n \u201cWhy, of course,\u201d he replied; \u201cthe Church has always\n held them; the symbolic language of the Bible has been\n recognized from the beginning; a revelation of the\n infinite truth must be a limitation and so involve imper-\n fections.\u201d \u201cBut stop, Doctor,\u201d said I, interrupting him,\n \u201cAre you going to say all this in your paper ?

In the course of his eloquent oration\n on the opening day, he uttered in the original Greek the\n address of Paul to the Athenians on Mars Hill, regarding\n their worship of the Unknown God and the declaration,\n \u201c Whom ye ignorantly worship Him do I declare unto\n you!\u201d (Acts xvii : 23.) It seemed to me that here was\n really struck the keynote of the whole Parliament; the\n revelation in Christianity, not of a God and of a Religion\n to exterminate all others as hostile and opposed, but as\n only really revealing more fully the God whom all the\n world heretofore has been ignorantly worshiping.

Those who have no religious worship, in con-\n sequence of their being born in this or that country, are also\n trained after death like infants, and according to their civil and\n moral life, they receive the means of salvation. I have seen such\n persons, and at first they had not the appearance of men; but\n afterwards I saw them as men, and heard them speak sensibly in\n accordance with the commandments of the decalogue. To train\n such persons is the inmost joy of the angels. Hence it is evi-\n dent that the Lord provides that every man should be capable of\n being saved. (Ath. Cr. 72.)\n</p>\n<p>\n The Lord provides for every nation a universal medium of\n salvation. For in every Religion a man is acquainted with the\n evils and the falsities arising from them which are to be shunned,\n and when he shuns them he becomes acquainted with the goods\n which are to be done, and the truths which are to be believed.\n The medium exists in all its fullness with Christians; it exists\n also, although not in fullness, with the Mahometans and the\n heathen. All other points which form the distinction between\n them are either matters of ceremony, in themselves indifferent,\n or they are goods and truths which may either be done and\n believed or not, and man yet be saved.

In\n this view, it is not rational to believe that that part of man\n which is for his brief use in this world only, and is left\n behind when he passes out of this world, is the most real\n and substantial part of him; every rational mind per-\n ceives that it can not be so. That is more substantial\n which is more enduring, and that is the more real part\n of a man in which his characteristics and his qualities are.\n All the facts and phenomena of life confirm the doctrine\n that the soul is the real man. What makes the quality\n of a man? What gives him character as good or bad,\n small or great, lovable or detestable? Do these qualities\n pertain to the body ? Everyone knows that they do not.\n But they are the qualities of the man. Then the real\n man is not the body, but is \u201cthe living soul.\u201d The body\n has absolutely no human quality but what it derives from\n the soul, not even its human form; and all that is human\n about it departs when the soul leaves the body \u2014 even its\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0097/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 276, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 462}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0097/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 552, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 925}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0097/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1105, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1850}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0097/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3700}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0097/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wj/er/us/al/em/in/wo/00/me/rc/newjerusaleminwo00merc/newjerusaleminwo00merc_0097.jp2", "height": 3700, "width": 2210, "levels": 6, "size": 469610}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"97\">\n<p>\n PAPERS PRESENTED\n</p>\n<p>\n %\n</p>\n<p>\n human form quickly vanishes, and it returns to its com-\n mon dust.

What,\n for example, do we know of electricity except by its\n wonderful phenomena? Its phenomena, its wondrous\n power in and upon things visible and tangible, give proof\n of it. But what are these to the stupendous and varied\n powers of the spiritual within the natural universe\n which we see about us in all the phenomena of vegetable\n and animal life, and even in the inorganic things of\n nature, which as servants of the Divine Creator, Him-\n self invisible, inspire and effect the numberless and mar-\n velous activities which make an otherwise inert and dead\n material world to be quick, and living, and filled with all\n things beautiful and desirable by man.

Both\n are the involution of the Divine and Infinite in a series\n of veils or symbols, which become more and more gross\n as they recede from their source. In revelation the veil-\n ings of the Divine truth of the essential Word follow in\n accordance with the receding and more and more sen-\n sualized states of mankind upon earth.

After the Eden days of\n \u00a9pen vision, when \u2018heaven lay about us in our infancy,\u2019\n followed the Noetic era of a sacred language, full of\n heavenly meanings, traces of which occur in the hiero-\n glyphic writings and the great world -myths of most ancient\n tradition; then came the visible and localized Theocracy\n of a chosen nation, with laws and ritual, and a long his-\n tory of its war and struggle, and victory and decline,\n with the promise of a final renewal and perpetuation: all\n being at the same time a revelation of God\u2019s providence\n and government over man, and a picture of the process\n of the regeneration of the human soul and its prepa-\n ration for an eternal inheritance in heaven.

The human\n mind wants reaching in its depths. The motives behind\n our thinking want renewal, else mind- life is like John\n Randolph\u2019s mackerel in the moonlight, which stank as it\n shone. So was man in the sad days of Roman sensuality\n and Jewish hypocrisy, and so do our daily chronicles\n testify to-day. The cure for the lost sheep is to seek for\n it till it is found.

Our answer is in general to say that\n the remedy was within the keeping of the infinite love\n and wisdom which had so far made and conducted man,\n or we must hold some view which limits the Holy One\n of Israel. If God would come with any mercy He must\n descend to the place of the fallen. If he would conquer\n the evil without destroying them, He must contend with\n them on their own plane. To take upon Himself the\n nature born of woman would be His means of redemp-\n tion. He must take on the office of Joshua, who led the\n people out of the wilderness into their inheritance. And\n a virgin conceived and bore a son, and called his name\n Jesus \u2014 that is, Joshua. The Wisdom or Word of God\n was made flesh, so that we behold the glory of the\n Father.

It was the act of God Himself\n to restore the vital union between man and Himself, that\n union which man had severed by increasing self-asser-\n tion, waywardness, and wickedness, and which could only\n be renewed by contrition and return and reconciliation.\n In the case of the man healed of his blindness, in the\n ninth chapter of John, we have first the evil condition,\n then the remedy offered, next the remedy accepted, at\n once the cure effected, and finally a vital union of safety\n for him established with the Lord, as shown by his say-\n ing, \u201cLord, I believe,\u201d and by his worshiping Him. In\n more difficult cases, as we know by some experience, the\n knowledge of the remedy may be cold and unfruitful in\n the memory until in seeking to lead a less selfish life, to\n be worthy of a loving wife or a trusting child, or to con-\n secrate our lives in full to the Lord\u2019s service, we begin to\n form new motives with the Divine aid; to hate what we\n once wickedly loved, and to love what we once wickedly\n hated; and so, little by little, born from above, a new\n heart is formed within us, and we come to act as faith-\n ful rather than as unfaitful servants of the Lord, as\n friends rather than as enemies.

If he sets the Hebrew and Christian\n Word above all other sacred Scripture, it is because it\n brings, as now opened in its spiritual depths, the Divine\n sanction to all the rest, and gathers their strains into its\n sublime symphony of revelation.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0143/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 276, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 462}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0143/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 552, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 925}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0143/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1105, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1850}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0143/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3700}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0143/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wj/er/us/al/em/in/wo/00/me/rc/newjerusaleminwo00merc/newjerusaleminwo00merc_0143.jp2", "height": 3700, "width": 2210, "levels": 6, "size": 468458}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"143\">\n<p>\n papers presented\n</p>\n<p>\n 121\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c So much for the indication of what Swedenborg\n does for catholie enlightenment in spiritual wisdom.\n As for salvation, he teaches that God has provided with\n every nation a witness of Himself and a means of eternal\n life.

In the preliminary address, after explaining\n the scope and aim of the Congresses, the Committee said:\n</p>\n<p>\n Such an Ecumenical Conference acquires additional import-\n ance to the mind of a New-Churchman from the fact that it is a\n principle of faith with him that \u201cthe Lord provides with every\n nation a universal medium of salvation,\u201d and that the essential\n saving truths of faith are common to all Religions; and that he\n who, in any Religion, \u201cfeareth God and worketh righteousness,\u201d\n is capable after death in the world of spirits of receiving\n instruction and faith in Jesus Christ as \u201cthe only wise God our\n Savior;\u201d and from the further principle of faith among us that\n the written Word of God is given on our earth, because \u201cin con-\n sequence of the communication opened here among all nations,\u201d\n it can be \u201cconveyed from one nation to another and taught in\n all places.\u201d Perhaps no such opportunity for the full, free, and\n friendly realization of this end of Divine Providence could\n under any other circumstances be presented.\n</p>\n<p>\n It devolves upon the New Church to see that those truths,\n which it distinctively holds in trust to teach for the help of man-\n kind, are fitly and adequately set forth in this Parliament of\n Religions, especially the following, namely: \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. The Second Advent of the Lord Jesus Christ in the open-\n ing of the Spiritual sense and Divine meaning of the Word of\n God, through the human instrumentality of Emanuel Swedenborg.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The relation of this fact to the whole history of Religion\n in the progress of the ages, and the Divine Dispensations of the\n Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

Many\n of the papers, however, treated of themes, or presented\n views worthy of consideration, but which could not be\n called representative.

The meaning is this: Religion is the Divine\n instinct of the human race. It is the touch of sympathy\n which makes the whole world kin.

Finally, as culmination and comple-\n tion of the grand and universal circle of thought, the\n Parliament of Religion takes its place, the grandest\n parliament ever assembled upon this earth. A priest of\n Buddhism has told us that a Congress of Religion was\n held in the Island of Ceylon twenty-one centuries ago;\n but this is the first Congress wherein all Faiths of the\n world are represented, and where both men and women\n make up not only the audience but the Congress itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n No natural event can take place without its spiritual\n cause.

Every man\n and woman bears within him and within her the Divine\n attributes of truth and love; but in man the truth or\n reason leads, and in woman love.

The point of division between\n them is the coming of Jehovah, the Heavenly Father,\n clothed in Humanity for the redemption and salvation of\n men from captivity to evil. All other events of the\n Church center around that pivotal event which conjoined\n men with their Heavenly Father. All before that look\n forward to it, foreshadow it, and are fulfilled and ended\n in it. All after that take their rise from it, have their\n beginning in it, and are effects of causes which set it in\n motion. They are the working out of perfections which\n it made possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n We may call these two epochs of the Church by a\n name signifying the relation they bear to this event, thus:\n The Church before, and the Church after the advent of\n Christianity.

The\n Noites had thought and talked of self sacrifice for others\u2019\n happiness. They had thought and talked of offering the\n hearts\u2019 best loves to their Heavenly Father, and to His\n child, the brother. They had thought and talked of the\n good and innocent creatures which were forms embody-\n ing these loves. They grew in successive generations\n more and more material, and at last became impelled to\n enact all this in material form, and to make sacrifices\n and offerings of their symbols.

Says Swedenborg: \u201cThat\n which constitutes heaven with man, also constitutes the\n Church; for as love and faith constitute heaven, so also\n love and faith constitute the Church.\u201d Where the Lord\n is acknowledged, and where the Word is, the Church is\n said to be; for the essentials of the Church are love to\n and faith in the Lord, from the Lord; and the Word\n teaches how man is to live in order that he may receive\n love and faith from the Lord. In order that there may\n be a Church, there must be doctrine from the Word,\n since without doctrine the Word is not understood. But\n doctrine alone does not constitute the Church with man,\n but a life according to it. (H. D. 241, 242, 243.)\n</p>\n<p>\n If we bear in mind this definition and apply it to the\n Church of the First Advent, we see that the coming of\n the Lord into the world had the effect of producing a\n new love and faith, which gave birth to that Church.\n This is an evident historical fact. The Jewish Church\n had come to its end. Such love and faith as it originally\n received had died out. The Jews were still in possession\n of the Word, or Divine Revelation as embodied in the\n Old Testament; but they had falsified and perverted it.\n Instead of imbibing its true teachings, they taught for\n doctrines the commandments of men. Instead of paying\n the Lord the sincere homage of a genuine worship, they\n fulfilled the prophetic saying, \u201c This people honoreth me\n with their lips, but their heart is far from me.\u201d Where-\n fore it became necessary that a New Church should be\n established, unless all love and faith were to perish from\n among men.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0186/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 276, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 462}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0186/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 552, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 925}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0186/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1105, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1850}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0186/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3700}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0186/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wj/er/us/al/em/in/wo/00/me/rc/newjerusaleminwo00merc/newjerusaleminwo00merc_0186.jp2", "height": 3700, "width": 2210, "levels": 6, "size": 534921}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"186\">\n<p>\n 162\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW CHURCH CONGRESS\n</p>\n<p>\n By the Lord\u2019s life and teachings, this needful object\n was effected. He rekindled the expiring flames of a true\n Religion. He revealed a new convenant or testament, and\n breathed fresh meaning into the Old. He gave the\n impulse which resulted in a new phase of spiritual\n 1 bought and life on earth. The faith of this New Church\n was belief in the One God made manifest in Jesus Christ;\n its love was a life of obedience to His Commandmenls.\n The early Christians cherished the Divine Word and\n valued its teachings as above all price. The essentials of\n the Church from the beginning of time had been belief in\n One God, the Creator and Preserver of the universe, and\n the keeping of His precepts as the means of coming into\n just and orderly relations with Him. Inseparable from\n these, was a belief in the revealed Word, which tells men\n all they know about the Lord and about His precepts; so,\n when the Christian Church was formed, there was sub-\n stantially a renewal of the ancient covenant with the\n Gospel supplementing the Law and the Prophets.\n</p>\n<p>\n But the purity and simplicity of the primitive Chris-\n tianity did not long continue. Metaphysical subtleties\n arose and clouded the minds of men. Dogmatic differ-\n ences concerning the nature and person of the Savior\n obscured and weakened the direct relationship which the\n Church had borne to Him. As the latter gained in pub-\n lic recognition, and grew more prosperous in a worldly\n way, it drifted farther off from its first principles. It\n was already rent with dissensions, when the Emperor\n Constantine avowed himself a Christian, and brought it\n under his powerful protection.

But, just as neither the Jews nor even the\n apostles saw anything of the J udgment executed at His\n First Coming, so little will men on earth see, or per-\n ceive anything of the Last Judgment; for it is executed\n not on the bodies of men, but on their spirits, which,\n unseen to us, inhabit the spiritual world around us.\n</p>\n<p>\n When this great truth concerning the Last Judgment\n is realized men may receive with something of patient\n attention the statement that the Last Judgment has taken\n place in the spiritual world, and that the Lord, with\n the angels of heaven, made His Second Coming visibly\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0193/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 276, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 462}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0193/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 552, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 925}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0193/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1105, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1850}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0193/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3700}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0193/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wj/er/us/al/em/in/wo/00/me/rc/newjerusaleminwo00merc/newjerusaleminwo00merc_0193.jp2", "height": 3700, "width": 2210, "levels": 6, "size": 453402}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"193\">\n<p>\n DISPENSATIONS OF THE CHURCH\n</p>\n<p>\n 169\n</p>\n<p>\n before the countless spirits assembled in the world of\n spirits below the heavens of the angels, and that this\n took place and was witnessed in the year 1757, by the\n servant of the Lord, Emanuel Swedenborg, whose spiritual\n eyes were opened for that purpose.\n</p>\n<p>\n As at His First Coming, so also at His Second, the\n Lord made a new revelation of Divine truth and a new\n Church founded on such revelation was raised up by Him\n in either case ; at His First Coming the Lord revealed the\n Word of the New Testament which completed and\n finished the Word of God; and on this revelation He\n founded the First Christian Church which has since\n spread over so large a part of the earth.

There are\n no limits set to the Divine love, and salvation is not\n proclaimed as the result of subscribing to a mere creed,\n neither are the gates of heaven closed to those who are\n outside the pale of the Church.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0204/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 276, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 462}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0204/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 552, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 925}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0204/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1105, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1850}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0204/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3700}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0204/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wj/er/us/al/em/in/wo/00/me/rc/newjerusaleminwo00merc/newjerusaleminwo00merc_0204.jp2", "height": 3700, "width": 2210, "levels": 6, "size": 395894}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"204\">\n<p>\n 180\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW- CHURCH CONGRESS\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c All religion has relation to life, and life of religion\n is to do good.\u201d \u201c The first thing of charity is to shun\n evils as sins, and the second thing of charity is to do\n good.\u201d These statements involve catholic or universal\n principles, and are applicable to all Religions.

There is nothing in\n the Divine infinity which contradicts this Divine Humanity.\n God does not live for Himself, for He is infinite unselfish-\n ness, but for His children, who are made in His own\n image.

Not only\n is man a spirit, but in point of fact, all life is spiritual.\n What we see in this natural world is not life, but\n simply material substance, clothing an inner spiritual\n life, which moulds, arranges and animates all the varied\n forms of earth. Plants, trees and animals are outward\n forms of spiritual life.

But this would not be possible, unless man\n had a spiritual as well as a natural body. The spiritual\n body, while not in any sense material, or subject to the\n limitations of the material world is nevertheless, most\n real and substantial, and since it formed the material\n body, it has all the parts and capabilities which char-\n acterize that, only in greater fullness and perfection.

Thou fool, that which\n thou sowest is not quickened except it die ; . . . thou\n sowest not that body that shall be, but bare grain. . . .\n So also is the resurrection of the dead.

Mountains, rivers, trees, houses, horses\n and chariots, armies and the like are spoken of in\n the Word as being seen in the realm of the spirit.\n Accordingly, when Swedenborg, after nearly thirty years\n of actual experience in the spiritual world, tells us that\n it is similar to the natural world, and characterized by all\n the forms of life which we see here, we do not accept it\n on his unsupported word merely, but find that such is\n the teaching of the Bible, and, furthermore, that it\n appeals as could no other idea to our rationality.\n</p>\n<p>\n The question \u201c where is the spiritual world\u201d has\n been one of the puzzles of the ages.

There is, in fact, under the impulse of the\n recent studies, a growing recognition of the truth that the\n forms of the Bible, its stories, its prophecies, its laws\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0240/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 276, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 462}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0240/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 552, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 925}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0240/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1105, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1850}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0240/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3700}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0240/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wj/er/us/al/em/in/wo/00/me/rc/newjerusaleminwo00merc/newjerusaleminwo00merc_0240.jp2", "height": 3700, "width": 2210, "levels": 6, "size": 496408}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"240\">\n<p>\n 216\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW -CHURCH CONGRESS\n</p>\n<p>\n and its Psalms, although in the language of men, and\n founded throughout upon the experience of men mostly\n of Semitic race, are in some wonderful way types of\n spiritual experiences which are common to mankind, to\n men of Aryan, Mongolian, African, as well as of Semitic\n origin; and that it is of the Divine Providence and by\n the Divine inspiration, that this was brought to pass, in\n order that, by means of the Bible, God might teach the\n universal truths of Divine and human life to his\n children.\n</p>\n<p>\n The interpretation of these types with a view to\n learning their spiritual lessons has not gone very far.\n In our day indeed it is less confident, and perhaps less\n enlightened, than it was in the Primitive Christian\n Church.

There must needs be day and night. There must\n needs be times of peace and of unrest.

But\n when the times of discontent come, when the night\n shadows the earth of the mental world, when the spirit\n is touched with the keen sense of its own unrest, then\n arise the problems of life; and first and chiefest among\n them, the eternal question: \u201cWhat shall I do to obtain rest,\n contentment, peace?\u201d Here it is that the answers of\n religious philosophers begin to differ. From the far\n north comes one answer. To overcome the thought of\n unrest, saith the philosopher of that region, sink the\n mind in oblivion. Sink it into the heaviness and stupor\n of the sense world. Let the mind be blunted by such\n sense impressions as will dull its pain. \u201cGo, see, hear,\n satisfy the cravings of the senses, forget yourself in the\n beauties of the world and in its allurements. And so will\n you be lifted beyond the thought of pain. You will for-\n get pain.\u201d But the sense-world of man is represented\n in the science of correspondences by the serpent. Hence,\n the north puts wings on the serpent, and we have the\n dragon born, the dragon whom St. George fights, the\n dragon which attacks the woman of the Apocalypse of\n John; the dragon and the griffin of the Saxon; the drink-\n evil of the modern temperance reformer, the great ser-\n pent, which to him arises from the wine cup and is called\n \u201cthat old serpent, Satan,\u201d ready to deceive and destroy\n a whole world, yea, and to pull down one-third of the\n stars in heaven. When the difficulties of life are\n overcome by any activity of the senses, whether in the\n pleasant form of change and travel, in the more vicious\n form of drug or alcohol, in the yet more vicious form of\n sexual crime, then are wings put on the serpent.\n</p>\n<p>\n But other philosophers found other answers to the\n question. Sinking care in pleasures of sense does not\n overcome care. It does not strike at the root of the evil.\n And Assyria voices another thought.

That the Lord manifested Himself\n before me, His servant, and sent me to this office, and\n that He afterward opened the sight of my spirit, and so\n has intromitted me into the spiritual world, and has\n granted me to see the heavens and the hells, also to con-\n verse with angels and spirits, and this now uninterrupt-\n edly for many years, I testify in truth.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Second Coming of the Lord ought to be accom-\n panied by a \u201clast judgment;\u201d such a one as took place at\n the Lord\u2019s First Coming, as the Lord says: \u201cNow is the\n judgment of this world\u201d (St. John xii :41) ; and Swedenborg\n testifies that such a judgment has taken place at the end\n of every \u201cage\u201d or dispensation of the Church. Such an\n event cannot take place in this natural world of ours,\n but in the spiritual world, where we go by what we call\n \u201cdeath,\u201d the death of the material body. But the effects\n of such a judgment are to be seen in this world in forms,\n especially of new light and new liberty. And I think we\n may, if we like, see those effects of the judgment both at\n the Lord\u2019s First and at His Second Coming. The latter,\n Swedenborg says, took place in the year 1757.

A revelation\n of new truth had to be made, as we should expect, before\n the judgment. And so it was. Before the year 1757\n Swedenborg published (in London) his first and largest\n theological work, Arcana Coelestia. This work, eight\n large quarto volumes, is to be considered as a fountain\n work in which all his later writings, in a certain\n sense, are enclosed, and from which they are brought\n forth, some of them almost verbatim, others in their main\n principles. Arcana Coelestia or Heavenly Secrets is an\n exegetical or explanatory work, giving the inner meaning\n of Genesis and Exodus, but in such a way that in a\n manner the whole Word is explained, Swedenborg always\n following that recognized principle to let Scripture\n explain Scripture. In that work, of course, we have the\n common law laid down according to which the whole\n Word is written, the law of correspondences between\n natural things as effects and spiritual ones as causes.\n Besides in Arcana there are especially between the chap -\n ters interpersed doctrinals and other things of use for\n knowledge, faith and life. Thus we say, the Word has\n been opened in that grand work; and the opening of the\n Word constitutes the Lord ' s coming again as the Word\n to His Church. For in the open Word we see the Lord\n Jesus Christ as the one only God in heaven and on eartb,\n the Word in its innermost sense treating only about the\n Lord. But created as we are, images of the Lord, we\n have in the lower senses of the Word, according to the\n law of correspondences, expositions of the regeneration\n of man and of the Church here and in heaven, as the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0269/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 276, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 462}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0269/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 552, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 925}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0269/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1105, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1850}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0269/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3700}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0269/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wj/er/us/al/em/in/wo/00/me/rc/newjerusaleminwo00merc/newjerusaleminwo00merc_0269.jp2", "height": 3700, "width": 2210, "levels": 6, "size": 449328}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"269\">\n<p>\n PLANTING THE CHURCH\n</p>\n<p>\n 245\n</p>\n<p>\n Kingdom of our Lord.

As is the case\n with all Biblical Prophecies, they cannot be fully under-\n stood before their fulfillment, so, also, with this last pro-\n phetical book in the Word.

He refers to a place in that\n work and says: \u201cHis Excellency Count Ekeblad and His\n Excellency Count Bjelke possess the book.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Noteworthy is it that Swedenborg sent copies of the\n said letter to the King, to the Chancellor of Justice, and\n to the three Swedish Universities. In April, 1771, he\n wrote from Amsterdam to Dr. Beyer, \u2014 \u201c I wonder that\n they keep stirring up this affair at Gottenburg.

The\n sowing of the seed proceeded in this manner, with very\n great activity from 1778, when the Rev. T. Hartley,\n rector of Winwick, translated Heaven and Hell , followed\n by the True Christian Religion in 1781, translated by the\n Rev. John Clowes, M. A., rector of St. John\u2019s, Manchester,\n Mr. Clowes was indeed the Apostle Paul of the New\n Church, not as an organization, but as a heaven-given\n system of doctrine.

Thus, as early as 1818,\n Societies began to multiply so rapidly that ministers\n adequately trained could not be provided for them. The\n consequence was a proposal to raise a literary fund for\n the education of young men for the ministry. When\n first suggested, it was regarded as impracticable. But it\n was not forgotten, its need was indeed more acutely felt,\n and in the end it was attained. In 1852 a college was\n founded, which, in addition to handsome buildings, has\n acquired an endowment of nearly \u00a38,000. It is now\n able to provide well and adequately for the education of\n future ministers and missionary preachers. The Students\u2019\n Aid Fund, established in 1854, provides for the main-\n tenance during their years of study of all those whom\n Conference adopts as students for its ministry.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another want which made itself felt was that after\n being trained, ministers were often placed in small Socie-\n ties which could not adequately maintain them. Hence\n there was founded a Ministers\u2019 Aid Fund in 1854, and\n as the conception grew, an Augmentation Fund in the\n year 1877. Another want was that ministers thus inade-\n quately maintained could not provide for old age and for\n their widows. Many who adopted the ministerial career\n in the past, and these by far the finest men of all, were\n actuated by love of the Church rather than a love of\n reward. The Pension Fund was founded to provide for\n such cases, and now the annual outgo is about \u00a3450.\n</p>\n<p>\n 18\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0290/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 276, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 462}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0290/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 552, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 925}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0290/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1105, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1850}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0290/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3700}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0290/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wj/er/us/al/em/in/wo/00/me/rc/newjerusaleminwo00merc/newjerusaleminwo00merc_0290.jp2", "height": 3700, "width": 2210, "levels": 6, "size": 472724}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"290\">\n<p>\n 266\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW-CHURCH CONGRESS\n</p>\n<p>\n Later still (1881) an Orphanage was established, the\n requirements of the Church and the philanthropic spirit\n of its members again suggesting it as a work which\n should be undertaken.\n</p>\n<p>\n The first centenary of the New Church as an external\n body was held by the Conference at Camden Road\n Church, London, August, 1883.

This society, the object of which\n was to publish the writings of Swedenborg in the Swedish\n language, and to collect documents respecting him, counted\n 200 members, amongst them men of learning and high\n social position, also outside of Sweden.

Many of the Gentiles have myths or tradi-\n tions respecting the creation of the world, and the first\n men, the Garden of Eden and the Flood. All these and\n similar things the New Church can fully and rationally\n explain. The New Church can tell the Gentiles that the\n Lord received all their forefathers in the spiritual world\n after death, and by his angels instructed them in the\n genuine truths of a heavenly and eternal life. The New\n Church can unfold to the Gentile world a complete sys-\n tem of information respecting life, death, resurrection,\n judgment, heaven and hell, to take the place of the\n unsatisfactory and, in many ways, false teachings they\n have possessed on these subjects. The New Church can\n teach the Gentiles the origin and meaning of their\n altars, sacrifices, idols, temples, sacred fires, fasts, festi-\n vals, and various rites and formalities of external\n worship.\n</p>\n<p>\n Suppose there were published to the Gentile world,\n the first one thousand pages or more of Swedenborg\u2019s\n \u201c Arcana Coelestia,\u201d explaining the Creation, Garden of\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0337/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 276, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 462}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0337/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 552, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 925}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0337/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1105, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1850}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0337/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3700}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0337/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wj/er/us/al/em/in/wo/00/me/rc/newjerusaleminwo00merc/newjerusaleminwo00merc_0337.jp2", "height": 3700, "width": 2210, "levels": 6, "size": 413515}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"337\">\n<p>\n MISSION OS\u2019 THE CHURCH\n</p>\n<p>\n 813\n</p>\n<p>\n Eden, Serpent, Flood, Tower of Babel, and the call of\n Abram, together with what is said concerning the state\n of man after death, especially of the Gentiles themselves,\n would not an intelligent Gentile be able to quickly and\n easily realize the true character of the first chapters of\n Genesis as portraying the spiritual history of all the\n races and Churches of men for a long period of time, and\n would he not rejoice to perceive how good and merciful\n the Lord has been in providing both in this world and\n in the world to come for the salvation of all His children ?\n</p>\n<p>\n Surely this is the mission of the New Church to the\n Gentiles.

Sometimes the Word, or message\n of God, comes in a vision or dream, as to Abram, with\n whom God makes a covenant, to Moses standing with\n bare feet before the burning bush and receiving his com-\n mission as the liberator of his people, to Elijah standing\n at the opening of the cave in Horeb, and burying his\n face in his mantle, as the \u201c still small voice \u201d speaks to\n his soul, to Ezekiel, gazing upon the great white temple.\n Sometimes the Word comes in audible messages, which,\n whether the hearer understands them or not, or whether\n they can be heard by others or not, are too real to be\n mistaken.

Philosophy does not seek to pacify the long-\n ings of the heart. That is the province of religion.\n Neither does ' it endeavor to satisfy man\u2019s thirst for\n knowledge of facts. This is done by science. Nor does\n it mean the fusion of the senses in the intellectual and\n ideal. That is achieved by art. The precise function of\n philosophy is to give such an intellectual apprehension\n of truth as will satisfactorily meet the questions of the\n rational understanding. Without this rational element\n which philosophy is designed to supply, religion, science,\n art, life are unrelated objects of thought. They are in a\n more or less chaotic condition. The true end of philos-\n ophy is to introduce a principle of unity into this unre-\n lated and unordered world of the mind, so that the mind\n may become a veritable microcosm finding in itself a self-\n conscious response to the rhythmic order of a divinely\n governed universal cosmos.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the first place, the New Church has a mission to\n philosophy which can be fulfilled only by bringing in the\n element of unification in regard to the Divine and the con-\n flicting aims and speculations of the several schools of\n current philosophy.

It has seemed to them that the\n idea of Divine revelation is inseparable from gross and\n carnal dogmas concerning creation and consciousness.\n In thus denying the possibility of Divine enlightenment,\n philosophy has done in the rational world precisely what\n a man would do in the physical world who should\n exclude the light of the sun and depend on his unaided\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0369/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 276, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 462}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0369/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 552, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 925}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0369/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1105, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1850}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0369/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3700}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0369/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wj/er/us/al/em/in/wo/00/me/rc/newjerusaleminwo00merc/newjerusaleminwo00merc_0369.jp2", "height": 3700, "width": 2210, "levels": 6, "size": 458773}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"369\">\n<p>\n Mission of the church\n</p>\n<p>\n 845\n</p>\n<p>\n imagination for a representation of the phenomena of\n the universe.

This\n was found in a recognition of the spirit, in a rational\n idealism. In spite of all the vagaries which prevailed in\n the Romantic School of Fichte and Schell ing and the\n Schlegels and Novalis, we cannot deny that they labored\n for the transcendance of the spirit over the flesh, and that\n the outcome of the storm and stress was more intelli-\n gent and more resolute thinking for humanity. When\n Swedenborg was born in 1688, philosophy had formed\n three schools, \u2014 the skeptical, represented by Hume and\n Hobbs, the mystical, of Eckhart and Behmen, and the\n moralist of Cudworth and Shaftesbury. Descarts and\n Bacon and Spinoza and Locke and Leibnitz had labored ;\n Kant and Hegel and Jonathan Edwards and Lotze were\n to enter into those labors^ and do new work. As Pro-\n fessor Seth says in his volume \u201cFrom Kant to Hegel,\u201d\n \u201cHegel restored spirit to its place.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n While in the present generation, the old is constantly\n reappearing in skepticism or pantheism or theosophic\n magianism, yet there is a slow upbuilding of a truly\n spiritual philosophy, based upon a carefully ascertained\n psychology.\n</p>\n<p>\n At the same time a new field has opened in the intel-\n ligent application of philosophy to the dealings of men\n with each other. In politics we have an increasing recog-\n nition of the rights of every man, while in the former\n time, only one man was free in a nation, and he was the\n sovereign.

While some have effectively\n used our teachings in constructing noble romances, yet,\n as a rule, fiction waits to be raised to that standard of\n child life and adult life and especially of married life\n which our principles clearly set forth.\n</p>\n<p>\n Under this head I would enumerate, in closing, certain\n books issued within this century, and showing the new\n</p>\n<p>\n spirit:\n</p>\n<p>\n 1830 Ly ell\u2019s Geology\n</p>\n<p>\n 1833 Agassiz\u2019s Fossil Fishes\n</p>\n<p>\n 1846 Grote\u2019s Greece\n</p>\n<p>\n 1856 Lotze\u2019s Microcosm\n</p>\n<p>\n 1861 Muller\u2019s Lectures on Language\n</p>\n<p>\n 1871 The Recovery of Jerusalem\n</p>\n<p>\n (By Wilson and Warren.)\n</p>\n<p>\n 1880 Wallace\u2019s Ben-Hur\n</p>\n<p>\n 1880 Geikie\u2019s Life of the Christ \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n 1883 Drummond\u2019s Natural Law in the\n</p>\n<p>\n Spiritual World.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1889 Le Conte\u2019s Evolution and Its\n</p>\n<p>\n Relation to Religious Thought,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0395/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 276, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 462}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0395/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 552, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 925}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0395/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1105, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1850}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0395/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3700}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0395/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wj/er/us/al/em/in/wo/00/me/rc/newjerusaleminwo00merc/newjerusaleminwo00merc_0395.jp2", "height": 3700, "width": 2210, "levels": 6, "size": 386425}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"395\">\n<p>\n MISSION OF THE CHURCH\n</p>\n<p>\n 371\n</p>\n<p>\n Of the books issued by our own people I find but\n one of general reputation: Grindon\u2019s \u201c Life; Its Nature,\n Varieties and Phenomena,\u201d which appeared in 1875.\n</p>\n<p>\n As the early light at dawn catches the mountain tops,\n so some men have caught the light of the new day,\n which in due time will shine for many more, though that\n time is not yet.

The\n intellectual is that which is commonly known as the\n ideal, which produces the beautiful by transforming\n itself into a fantastical type through the aid of the\n imagination. Wherefore this type, being purely an\n internal sensibility, or, it may be, a modification of our\n mind, does not exist outside of ourselves. For example,\n the conception of a picture is an internal sensibility, a\n phantom of the imagination, because it is the imagina-\n tion of the desire of a person, or of a corporeal entity,\n which does not exist outside of the fancy of the artist,\n before he has drawn it on his palette or canvas or wall.\n</p>\n<p>\n ********\n</p>\n<p>\n In short, the perfect beauty is the ideal, which,\n dwelling no more among earthly things, must arise in\n the minds of the poet and of the artist.

In this\n doctrine we have a conception of society in which each\n has all the share in society privileges the communist could\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0412/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 276, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 462}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0412/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 552, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 925}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0412/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1105, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1850}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0412/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3700}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0412/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wj/er/us/al/em/in/wo/00/me/rc/newjerusaleminwo00merc/newjerusaleminwo00merc_0412.jp2", "height": 3700, "width": 2210, "levels": 6, "size": 486404}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"412\">\n<p>\n 388\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW-CHURCH CONGRESS\n</p>\n<p>\n ask, and in which individual rights to personal posses-\n sions are preserved as well ; in which each is individually\n as free as the anarchist could demand, and yet in which as\n perfect a society is constituted as the socialist could demand.\n</p>\n<p>\n We can not in this brief treatment of the subject bring\n out exhaustively the great principles which are involved\n in this doctrine, but I will enumerate a few which will\n enable us to see the scope of what the New Church has\n to contribute to the science of sociology and government,\n and to the solution of the urgent problems now agitating\n man in social and governmental reforms.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. The first great principle is, that in society rela-\n tionships man not only is to realize his highest destiny,\n but that only in such relationships can any of his pur-\n poses be successfully carried out. All achievements of\n our earthly life, great and small, can only be fully\n accomplished by organic bodies of men; and at the\n same time the very height of heavenly life is to be\n attained through this organic brotherhood. The higher\n the heavenly state of men is, so much the more perfect is\n their realization of organic brotherhood. As the late\n Henry James expressed it, \u201cSociety is the redeemed form\n of man.\u201d In his devotion to society, therefore, and in his\n looking to society for the supply of his needs, does the\n individual accomplish all the purposes of his being. This\n principle places the questions of sociology and government\n upon their true bases, and tells us where to look for light\n in their consideration. This doctrine, it will be observed,\n is the opposite of solitairism, or of the conception that the\n greatness of life\u2019s rewards are to be secured by individual\n heroism or separation from fellow man. The most\n absolute indentification with one\u2019s fellows is the only true\n road to the realization of the purposes of our creation.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2.

Social varieties\n are not done away with, but the basis for their existence\n is changed. They can rightly exist only as the external\n expression of grades of uses. All men are not made alike;\n nor would it be desirable that they should be. But dif-\n ferences in the way that men are made are expressed in\n corresponding differences in the uses they severally per-\n form, and thence in similar differences in the society\n positions they severally hold.

These differences in a true society are not, as\n is too often the case in this world, based on arbitrarily\n established differences in the privileges of life, but arise\n from differences in disposition, talent, tastes and power,\n and thence differences in use, by which some, for use\u2019s\n sake, will have more, and others also for use\u2019s sake will\n have less \u2014 but never from externally devised differences\n will any one have either more or less than his neighbor.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0414/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 276, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 462}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0414/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 552, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 925}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0414/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1105, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1850}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0414/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3700}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0414/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wj/er/us/al/em/in/wo/00/me/rc/newjerusaleminwo00merc/newjerusaleminwo00merc_0414.jp2", "height": 3700, "width": 2210, "levels": 6, "size": 521251}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"414\">\n<p>\n 390 NEW-CHURCH CONGRESS\n</p>\n<p>\n While every member of society, therefore, partakes equally\n of the right to its happiness, its glory and its wealth, each\n practically and actually partakes of that glory and wealth\n according to his capacity for service and for reception.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. To the question of government, and of vesting\n power in certain duly appointed men to make and to exe-\n cute laws, the doctrine of the organic solidarity of man\n brings us this principle; that to administer the functions\n of government is neither a right nor a privilege, but is a\n use and a service. To hold official positions in the gov-\n ernment may require higher than ordinary faculties, and\n should command a deference \u2014 which is extended to the\n use through the person; but the service itself does not\n essentially differ from other uses either professional or of\n labor; and official honor is never extended to the person.\n As one manufactures goods, and another distributes them;\n as a third teaches, and a fourth labors with his muscles;\n so others administer the government by devising, exe-\n cuting and interpreting the laws \u2014 laws which should not\n be expressions of the wishes of those who govern, nor\n enactments for the upbuilding of their interests, but\n should express their best understandings of the princi-\n ples of justice and wisdom.

Such is the life of the universal heaven, for the\n Lord\u2019s Kingdom is a kingdom of uses. The angels\n receive happiness from the Lord according to the\n essence and quality of the use which they perform. So\n it is with every pleasure, for the more distinguished its\n use, so much the greater its delight. Thus for instance:\n Conjugal Love, which is the seminary of human society,\n and from which is formed the Lord\u2019s Kingdom in the\n Heavens, is the most important of all uses. All pleas-\n ures are according to the excellence of their uses, which\n indeed are so numerous that it is scarcely possible to\n divide them into their several genera and species,\n although all of them regard the Lord and His Kingdom.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n We are here taught that Conjugal Love, or the state\n of true marriage, is the foundation of the life of the\n highest use, because its end is the perfecting of the\n heavens by angels who to become such must first be\n born upon some earth in the great universe. From\n this we may plainly see that the state of wife and mother\n is the noblest condition of human life attainable by\n woman, and when society shall be regenerated by the\n living truths of the new age, the aim of all education\n will be to fit her for this highest prerogative of her\n being.

Just here I\n would like to present to your notice some conclusions\n drawn from many passages which you have no doubt\n read in your studies of late, so that I need only recall\n them to your minds.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1st. The very essence of the masculine mind is the\n love of acquiring wisdom. The essence of the feminine\n mind is the love of wisdom when acquired. (C. L. 32,\n 88, 90.)\n</p>\n<p>\n 2d. The male sees, concludes and acts from intellect,\n or more properly from reason, the female from affection,\n which gives her perception. The feminine mind receives\n the internal form and brings it forth into effect \u2014 out\n into the external, clothing and decorating it. (C. L. 115,\n 122 .)\n</p>\n<p>\n 3d. The duties of the sexes are different, owing to\n the different essence of their mental conformation, but they\n are conjunctive. (C. L. 100.)\n</p>\n<p>\n 4th. The duties of men are those in which the\n understanding and judgment predominate and relate to\n public uses performed away from the home. Women\u2019s\n duties tend to the forming, developing, making practical\n in all ways, by the activity of her perceptive affections of\n use, the rational wisdom of the man, a work he cannot do.\n (C. L., 9. 174, 175, 176.) Women are more wise in some\n things than men. They sometimes discourse wisely and\n with eloquence. (C. L. 168, 208, 293, 330.)\n</p>\n<p>\n An intelligent study of the Writings will teach us that\n in every use to be performed there must be found the con-\n junction of two essential principles. May not these be\n represented by the two sexes, \u2014 one part to be more fitly\n performed by the man, and the other suited to the genius\n of the women- and will not the use be more perfectly\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0425/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 276, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 462}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0425/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 552, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 925}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0425/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1105, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1850}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0425/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3700}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wj:er:us:al:em:in:wo:00:me:rc:newjerusaleminwo00merc:newjerusaleminwo00merc_0425/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wj/er/us/al/em/in/wo/00/me/rc/newjerusaleminwo00merc/newjerusaleminwo00merc_0425.jp2", "height": 3700, "width": 2210, "levels": 6, "size": 469228}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"425\">\n<p>\n WOMAN IN THE CHURCH\n</p>\n<p>\n 401\n</p>\n<p>\n accomplished when men and women work together side\n by side in the fear of the Lord and for His sake ?

It has\n been recognized for several decades, chiefly by the char-\n acter of its surface agitations and counter- currents. It\n marks the confluence of the old with the new in the\n stream of the Ages. The real movement has been on a\n much more interior plane of life. Wherever this interior\n movement has been felt, it has, as a rule, been sacredly\n guarded and held in abeyance for a riper time. As Mary\n \u201ckept all things and pondered them in her heart,\u201d so the\n woman of the Church, feeling the tremendous pressure\n of a descending life within her, has waited for Him who\n \u201copeneth and no man shutteth\u201d to set before her an open\n door.\n</p>\n<p>\n The question in the air is, \u201cWhat shall we do, or be,\n or claim in the New- Church Societies? Shall we teach,\n preach, legislate?\u201d These things are propounded for\n women, but not by her. With me the question is a far\n deeper one, and concerns her life as a whole, rather than\n as a half. Her question is, \u201cAre we, the women of the\n New Church, ready for the coming of the Lord? We\n form half the channel for the descent of a New and\n Celestial Church. If by disuse we have become atro-\n phied, or by misuse we have become selfish, and worldly,\n what shall we do to make ready for the Lord?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n As the Lord looks upon the Church, does he see a\n form of truth alone, or does he see her as a bride adorned\n for her husband ? \u201cThe marriage of the Lamb is come;\u201d\n has the wife made herself ready ?
