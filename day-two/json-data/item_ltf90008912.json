Therefore ye\n are buried with him by baptism into death, that like as\n Christ w as raised up from the dead by the glory of\n the Father, even so we also should walk in newness\n of life.\u201d In this portion of the word we have a re\u00ac\n presentation of a burial by baptism: \u00ab buried with\n Christ by baptism \u201d How clear, how emphatic. We\n have also a representation of a resurrection. \u00abThat\n like us Christ (in like manner) as Christ was raised\n from the dead;\u201d 6 so we (being raised from that sem\u00ac\n blance of death and a burial) should walk in newness\n of life.\u201d First planted in the likeness of his death;\n then raised in the likeness of his resurrection, and\n walk as living subjects of that resurrection, clear,\n unequivocal, and explicit as this passage of holy\n writ is; yet if need be, and if it be possible, Col. , ' i, 12.\n is more explicit, particularly as to baptism, being a\n striking semblance of a resurrection, whether it be\n Christ\u2019s resurrection, or the believing subject of bap\u00ac\n tism, it is the same. Thus it reads: \u201c Buried with him\n by baptism , wherein also ye are risen with him.\u201d Now\n observe this last clause in particular. Believers are\n first said to be buried with Christ by baptism, and\n then it is affirmed thus: \u201c Wherein (or in which bap\u00ac\n tism) ye are risen with him through the faith of the\n operation of God.\u201d That is to say, in the exercise\n of that faith, which was produced in their hearts by\n the special and operative influence of the Holy\n Ghost, they were enabled to understand the true\n nature of that baptism with which they were bap\u00ac\n tized, as aptly representing (among other things) a\n burial and resurrection.

So the sext\n reads: \u201cJohn was baptizing at Enon, near to Salem,\n because there was much water there!\u201d John iii. Here\n let it be observed, we have no need of either Greek\n or geographical criticisms, to make us believe that\n there was not much water at Enon, although the\n words of the Holy Spirit, which are rendered into\n plain English, and cannot well he misunderstood, in\u00ac\n form us that there was, and on that account was se\u00ac\n lected by the venerable Baptist, as a convenient place\n for the administration of the ordinance.\n</p>\n<p>\n When we so uniformly find repenting- \u2014believing\u2014\n receiving the word\u2014rejoicing in God\u2014and such like\n expressions accompanying, nay go before baptism,\n we are constrained to believe that such subjects only\n as did so believe, repent, See. were baptized, especial\u00ac\n ly as we find no one passage in which Christian bap\u00ac\n tism is introduced or enforced that children are once\n named as the subjects thereof, or in which parents\n are commanded or instructed to have their children\n baptized. The obvious truth of these remarks per\u00ac\n plexes the Psedobaptists, and drives them as a last\n shift to hunt for children in the house of the Philip\u00ac\n pian jailor 9 of Lydia , and of Cornelias , but they have\n not yet been so successful as to find any. As to Cor\u00ac\n nelius, who was a Roman < fficer, the probability is,\n that he had none about him but soldiers; but be that\n as it may, it is very evident that those, who were bap\u00ac\n tized had received the Holy Ghost. And Peter proves\n the propriety of their being baptized on that, ground,\n and on that only.
