No one contributor is\n in any way responsible for the views of any other. Each writer selected his\n own subject and treated it according to his own convictions and concep\u00ac\n tions of truth. The biographical sketches were prepared, in most cases,*\n by friends of the authors. Some of them were written by the editor. They\n are necessarily brief. The writer of the first sermon in the book preferred\n not to be represented by a biographical sketch. Of his appearance his\n portrait will speak.

Burgdorfs boyhood was spent on a farm in his\n native township until he was eighteen years of age, attending\n school less than the average time of boys of his period. His\n mind did not catch the inspiration of knowledge until the age of\n twenty, when God\u2019s love of light and truth flashed upon his soul,\n and the command rested upon him to go into the vineyard of the\n Master and work. This led him to study, and with study came\n God\u2019s sweet intelligence, and with the intelligence the desire to\n give forth to the world God\u2019s great and exceeding love. He\n took up his first public work at Union Spring, in his native\n county, where he was ordained for the ministry, Rev. Joseph\n Badger preaching the ordination sermon.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is worthy of note that he is preaching to-day with much ac\u00ac\n ceptance, where he first began his public career.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Burgdorf was greatly blessed in his selection of a wife\u2014\n Miss Alice Jewell, of Arcadia, Wayne county, N.

Mr. Burgdorf has spent his life, as a minister,\n at Union Spring, Newark, and Naples, to all of which places he\n has been recalled the second time. At Newark he labored some\n fifteen years with eminent success, building up the church into a\n noble Christian structure, notwithstanding it was full of dissen\u00ac\n sions when he began to preside over them. Mr. Burgdorf,\n although not strong, has never lost a day nor sermon from ill\n health, making duty the controlling motive of his life.

I know the ingenious\n attempts which have been made to set aside the histories of this\n event, as contained in the first chapters of Matthew and Luke,\n because they represent ' the manner of his birth as miraculous.\n But if the first parts of Matthew and Luke are to be rejected\n because they recite the miraculous manner of Christ\u2019s coming\n into the world, why not reject the last chapters of all the evan\u00ac\n gelists because they recite the equally miraculous ihanner of his\n death, resurrection, and ascension ?

We are told that God\n hath set Christ \u2018\u2018forth to be a propitiation through faith in his\n blood ;\u201d \u201cthat he is the propitiation for our sins, and not for ours\n only, but also for the sins of the whole world/\u2019 And Paul says,\n \u201cWe jov in God through our Lord Jesus Christ, by whom we\n have now received the atonement.\u201d (The only place where the\n word atonement occurs in the common English translation of the\n New Testament.) But it is not affirmed here, or any where else,\n that Christ made a propitiation or atonement for anybody. He\n was the propitiation, and by him we received the atonement.\n The atonement is the reconciliation. Paul says, \u201cBy whom we\n have now received the atonement,\u201d showing that the atonement\n is received when the reconciliation is effected. This atonement,\n \u2022or reconciliation, can not-be made for us without our consent and\n \u2022co-operation. \u201cWe then, as embassadors for Christ, as though\n God did beseech you by us, we pray you in Christ\u2019s stead be ye\n reconciled to God.\u201d It is Christ then, and not a theory; it is\n Christ, and not another; it is Christ, and not what he has done\n \u2022or can do for us; it is what he is to us. We illustrate the point\n \u2022of faith in a divine personality thus : It is a popular dogma, and\n essentially orthodox, that the only hope of man, of the sinner,\n is in the righteousness of Christ\u2014its imputation; that we must\n be clothed with\u2019 his righteousness; and a free and flippant use of\n these terms is unquestioned evidence of soundness in theology\n and evangelicism in religion.

Lyon; \u201ccome on, patriots.\u201d At that\n moment a bullet struck Lyon, and he fell mortally wounded.\n But the battle was not lost. The death-defying enthusiasm of\n those soldiers met the enemy in awful contest; and their peals of\n victory above the wail of their enemy slain rent the air. Jesus\n of Nazareth had a few followers; but of all who listened to his\n words and felt the pressure of his healing hands, few dared meet\n the bitterness of his opposers, and take upon themselves his\n name while he was in the flesh. But in the awful conflict, when\n Gethsemane\u2019s agony was over, Calvary trembled in the wail of\n the dying Christ\u2019s despair\u2014\u201cMy God, my God, why hast thou\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0099/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0099/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0099/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0099/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0099/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0099.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 469101}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"99\">\n<p>\n ELLEN G.

All\n nations have had this light, yet have adopted some system of\n Teligion assumed to be divine, and the founders of such systems\n have been regarded as supernatural, or as mediators between the\n people and the great Creator and source of all power.\n</p>\n<p>\n Neither has the light of nature satisfied the instinct of man\n as to his thirst for more knowledge.

Here let me state that with a\n belief in a divine Being, separate from matter, there is nothing\n unreasonable in a belief in revelation, but from the nature of the\n subject much in its favor. It would be out of place here to\n argue the existence of such a Being. We therefore take it for\n granted that the almost universal belief of the human family is\n true\u2014that there is a God, an intelligent Supreme Maker and\n Ruler of the universe. That this Being not only made and\n organized all things by inexorable laws, and that all things were\n made with certain designs and adaptations, as light for the eye,\n sound for the ear, etc.; so following the analogy one may\n reasonably conclude that all great longings of his creatures\n shall be met by suitable gratification.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0108/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0108/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0108/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0108/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0108/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0108.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 513737}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"108\">\n<p>\n 88 CHRIST AN A UTHORITY IN RELIGION\n</p>\n<p>\n As stated, we have no knowledge of any people, at any period\n in history, whose worship\u2014and all have some kind of worship\u2014\n is based on the light of nature alone.

I\n refer to the modifying power of Christianity upon surrounding\n circumstances. There is a law of our nature that one great and\n controlling passion so occupies the mind that for the time it be\u00ac\n comes oblivious to all other desires. Such is the miser in the\n pursuit of wealth, that he becomes indifferent to heat, cold,\n hunger, and toil. Give him his ducats, anS he asks no more.\n Such, also, is the case with votaries of pleasure, fame, love, and\n hatred. While these are temporary in their duration and unsat\u00ac\n isfactory in their nature, Christianity, as an absorbing principle,\n is lasting, elevating, and fully satisfying to the highest and no\u00ac\n blest aspirations of man. On this principle we can understand\n the meaning of the Savior when he said, \u201c I have bread to eat\n that you know not of;\u201d and of Paul in the expression, \u201c I have\n learned in whatsoever state I am therewith to be content.\u201d It\n does not destroy the force of this argument that many believers\n in Christ live and die without reaching this state. It is enough\n for our purpose to know that some have reached it, that the\n tendency of the gospel is to that end, and that all are more or\n less assisted in this controlling of adverse circumstances.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the worldly-minded, poverty, obscurity, failures in pet\n schemes, unpopularity, persecutions, the sickness and death of\n friends, and the same to themselves, are almost tmbearable; but\n to the Christian believer, filled with love to his Maker, trusting\n and relying on his promise that all things work together for his\n good, he not only can bear these tribulations, but, like the apos\u00ac\n tle, he may be able to glory in them.\n</p>\n<p>\n In closing, let me say that, whatever the great Father has in\n -store for his children in the future, we are sure that the religion\n of Christ has brought them the greatest light ever given to the\n world. It teaches us clearly that we have nothing to fear but\n sin as the destroyer of our genuine happiness; that obedience to\n the law of God, as given in nature and revelation, brings to us\n our highest good; that earthly circumstances, in themselves, are\n of little consequence, as the poor and despised may be happy\n with God, while the rich and popular must be wretched without\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0121/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0121/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0121/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0121/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0121/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0121.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 188036}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"121\">\n<p>\n EVAN WILLIAMS HUMPHREYS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 101\n</p>\n<p>\n \" him.

So, too, the influence of the doc\u00ac\n trine of immortality upon the conduct of men is an argument in\n its behalf; for truly one can not in heart believe in an immortal\n destination without being somewhat lifted by it into higher ideas\n of life. To feel and believe that one is only a creature of a day\n \u2014a mere worm of the dust\u2014is a tremendous drawback to all\n aspiration. High aims, noble achievements, heroic daring, pa\u00ac\n tient suffering, protracted efforts for a blameless life, are hardly\n possible under the sad sense of all coming soon to nothingness.\n An orator of Rome could say, \u201c Deprive me not of this hope of\n immortality, since it makes me both a better and happier man.\u2019 '\n And this was before the world was \u201c visited by the Daystar from,\n on high.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0129/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0129/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0129/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0129/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0129/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0129.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 457832}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"129\">\n<p>\n MOSES KIDDER.\n</p>\n<p>\n 107\n</p>\n<p>\n ' There is, we must confess, a far-reaching power in the hearty\n belief of immortality and its accompanying thought of account\u00ac\n ability. Sometimes arguments have been drawn from nature\u2014\n or called such\u2014which are nothing more than illustrations of the\n possible future life. ' The caterpillar, which is metamorphosed\n and becomes a butterfly, did not die. If life had become ex\u00ac\n tinct, by any means, in its transition state, the butterfly had not\n been. As an illustration it is pertinent, and indeed beautiful,\n but weighs nothing as an argument. ' There are many other\n thoughts which are suggestive of a future and immortal life, but\n when all are fully and fairly presented and pondered we still ask,\n \u201cWhere is the proof?\u201d There will still remain a painful un\u00ac\n certainty.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Hope, no doubt, was born in many a human soul before\n Jesus opened his lips upon the momentous question, and many\n died in the belief of some kind of an existence beyond the dark\n vale. At best Nature\u2019s voice is feeble, and all human reasoning\n will not banish the ghost of doubt that arises when Death holds\n his victim in his relentless grasp, and speaking to the senses\n seems to say, \u201cAll is gone.\u201d Faith is a higher element of\n power in the human soul than reason, for it does smile at times\n at seeming impossibilities, and lays hold of unseen things, ard\n itself is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things\n out of sight. But to the thinking mind even faith requires some\n facts to stand upon; some promise from him who is able to\n make his word sure, even though it should be in seeming conflict\n with all the known operations of nature. With facts and prom\u00ac\n ises which no skeptical criticism can invalidate, we may build\n our hopes in \u2018 \u2018 full assurance.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The question quite naturally arises, on reading the text,\n whether ancient believers were in darkness like the world around\n them in regard to their immortality\u2014if they had any other light\n than that which nature furnished. One who walked with God\n must have had a vision more distinct and sure than one who did\n not. Enoch, before his translation, received this testimony, that\n he pleased God. One could not long walk in loving fellowship\n with God and not feel the birth of an immortal hope in his own\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0130/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0130/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0130/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0130/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0130/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0130.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 515747}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"130\">\n<p>\n 108\n</p>\n<p>\n LIFE AND IMMORTALITY.\n</p>\n<p>\n soul. Though we do not find any formal statement of the\n doctrine in the Old Testament, we do find some gracious inti\u00ac\n mations of it there. The translation of the seventh from Adam\n was a fair intimation that a life with God was possible. This\n opening of the gates of the unseen world for one of their num\u00ac\n ber to pass through was not forgotten by the fathers of our race.\n Elijah went up to heaven in a chariot of fire. Heaven, there\u00ac\n fore, must have seemed a reality to men who believed that even\n two from earth had gone there and were yet alive. The holy\n men of old, such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Moses, departed\n this life with great cheerfulness. They died as though they\n knew God was their God, and that he was not the God of the\n dead, but of the living. The psalmist said, \u201cMy heart is glad,\n and my glory rejoiceth: my flesh also shall rest in hope. For\n thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine\n holy one to see corruption. Thou wilt show me the path of\n life: in thy presence is fullness of joy; at thy right hand\n are pleasures for evermore.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Such triumphant songs it seems to me could never come forth\n from hearts that looked for nothing beyond this life. Many\n such sweet words of trust and of hope are found in the Old\n Testament Scriptures, running through them like a thread of\n gold. The Christian, with his immortal hope, uses them as the\n best vehicle of his own longings and heavenly anticipations.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. We learn more of the faith of the saints of old from what\n is said of them by New Testament writers, than what they have\n said of themselves. To this I now wish to call attention.\n Abraham saw the day of Christ and rejoiced. The writer of\n the epistle to the Hebrews, giving an epitomized history of the\n ancient faith, says of the fathers who believed in God, \u201cThese\n all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having\n seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced\n them, and confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on\n the earth.

There are\n statements which seem to me to imply as much as far as continued\n existence may be regarded as immortal existence. One reason,\n perhaps, why the gospel does not recognize the soul\u2019s immortality\n is that the gospel promises a body, too, of an incorruptible nature.\n It is not merely a future existence of the intelligent part of man,.\n but really an embodied being. Paul did not speak of a disem\u00ac\n bodied life to come. \u201cNot,\u201d says he, \u201cthat we would be\n unclothed, but clothed upon with our house which is from heaven,\n if so be that being clothed we shall not be found naked.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In his great argument to the church of Corinth he intimates\n that if they deny the doctrine of an incorruptible spiritual body\n they may as well deny the whole thought of future life, and so\n eat and drink, for to-morrow we die. Those who denied the res\u00ac\n urrection of the dead clothed with a spiritual body could not\n claim to retain their Christian faith by affirming that they still\n held to the immortality of the soul. That was not the distinct\n Christian doctrine of immortality-. Moses and Elias were as\n visible to the eyes of Peter, James, and John on the Mount of\n %T ransfiguration as was the transfigured body of Jesus when they\n there saw him in a glorified state. And again the apostle writes,\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018 \u2018 Who shall change our vile body, that it may be fashioned like\n unto his glorious body?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Paul not only describes the body of the future life as spiritual,\n but as incorruptible, glorious, and powerful\u2014as really, therefore,\n a bodily existence as the present, though not so grossly material.\n I think it sufficiently clear that the life of the world to come, as\n taught by Christ g.nd his apostles, was not something borrowed\n from the ancient philosophy, but was peculiarly and distinctly a\n part of the gospel itself, and was as truly brought to light through\n the gospel as was any other truth therein revealed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8 . Nor have we yet measured or comprehended the fullness-\n of the immortality which the gospel has brought to light. It is\n not only an endless embodied existence, but it is also an exist\u00ac\n ence in holiness.

There is none good but one\n that is God.\u201d I put these two side by side, not to show an\n identity of meaning, but that we may more easily see how the\n same God, who only is good and yet bestows his goodness upon\n others, may, in the same manner, bestow upon others his immor\u00ac\n tality likewise. The true life and immortality which the gospel\n brings to light is, therefore, the gift of God through the gospel.\n</p>\n<p>\n Again : Immortality is something to be sought for by \u201cpatient\n continuance in well doing,\u201d in connection with \u201cglory and\n honor.\u201d If immortality is only unending existence, then it\n must be denied to those who do not seek for it in the ways of\n well doing; and, consequently, the unrighteous will cease to be.\n But if immortality implies something more than mere existence,\n if it includes goodness, godlikeness, and the elements of heaven,\n then we need not necessarily look for the utter extermination of\n those who forget God. To be immortal is to be incorruptible in\n soul and body, and no less so in character and life.

to sink down in despair, and just then a herald\n should be seen coiming with a proclamation frotn the sheik, say\u00ac\n ing, A grand feast is prepared, and waiting for such lost, perish\u00ac\n ing wanderers! Under such circumstances we could appreciate\n -a feast, and look upon such provision not with indifference, but\n decide at once that it would be death to refuse and life to accept\n the offered benefits.\n</p>\n<p>\n Man\u2019s greatest danger lies in his insensibility to discern the\n real wants of the soul. This fact is beautifully set forth by our\n Savior, in the parable of the rich man, Luke 12: 16-22. This\n rich man soliloquized thus, \u201cWhat shall I do, because I have\n no room where to bestow my fruits? And he said, This will I\n do: I will pull down my barns, and build greater; and there\n will I bestow all my fruits and my goods. And I will say to my\n soul, Soul, thou hast much goods laid up for many years; take\n thine ease, eat, drink, and be merry. \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This man\u2019s folly and consequent danger did not consist in\n being in possession of good, fertile soil, nor in his skill in prop\u00ac\n erly cultivating his farm in a manner to make it productive, nor\n yet in building barn-room sufficient to store his goods. This was\n all right in his proceedings\u2014and it is also right for every man\n to labor to lay up a sufficiency of worldly goods\u2014but this man\n exhibited extreme folly and ignorance of the real wants of the\n soul. The soul is susceptible of pain and pleasure, and is exer\u00ac\n cised with sensations of hunger and thirst, as also of feasting, as is\n the body. Hence it was said, \u201cThey wandered in the wilder\u00ac\n ness; hungry and thirsty, their souls fainted within them.\u201d\n -(Psalms 107: 4, 5.) \u201cHearken diligently unto me (God), and\n eat ye that which is good, and let your soul delight itself in\n fatness. Incline your ear, and come unto me (to God): hear,\n and your soul shall live/\u2019 (Isaiah 55 : 2, 3.) The soul has no\n appetite for temporal food. It wants a food suited to its nature.\n The bird seeks its native air. The fish is restless, and dies\n without its native element. The body of man requires earthly\n food. But the soul is a spirit, an immaterial principle, and must\n have spiritual food.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0146/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0146/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0146/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0146/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0146/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0146.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 508000}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"146\">\n<p>\n 122\n</p>\n<p>\n THE GOSPEL FEAST.\n</p>\n<p>\n This gospel feast is represented a feast of fat things, not a leany\n morsel, or a dry pittance, but rich, delicious, fat things, full of\n marrow, of wines well refined and well adapted to the wants of\n the soul, and perfectly congenial to its nature. To enjoy this\n feast is simply to be a partaker and practitioner of the Christian\n religion, which may be summed up in one word, namely, love\u2014\n love to God, and love to man. \u201c Having the love of God shed\n abroad in our hearts by the Holy Ghost given unto us.\u201d And\n it may properly be said we are \u201cpartakers of the divine nature.\n Being permeated with the love and spirit of the Master it be\u00ac\n comes a delight to do his will and keep his commandments.\n Old things are passed away, and all things are become new.\u201d\n When he receives Jesus and his law, with all the train of graces\n which belong to Christianity, the opposing elements, such as\n enmity, hatred, malice, envy, etc., all disappear at the approach\n of the sinner\u2019s friend. This gives a taste of heavenly joy, peace,\n comfort, and consolation, to which he was hitherto a stranger.\n He now holds intercourse with heaven, communion with the\n Savior, and approaches God as his kind, loving Father, and asks-\n and receives mercy and grace as he needs.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is also a feast to his soul. To attend to the ordinances of\n the church all religious duties become a pleasure. All true\n Christian workers are feasted when they meet their class in the\n Sunday-school, in the prayer-meeting, and when they listen to\n the word of life preached, and when they feed the hungry, clothe\n the naked, visit the sick, speak a word of comfort to the afflicted,\n a word of warning to the wayward, and especially when they\n bring wandering prodigals home to their Father\u2019s house, to feast\n with them,, where there is bread enough and to spare.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is a feast of love, peace, and joy even in suffering\u2014if\n called to do so\u2014for the sake of Christ and humanity. It is said\n that Moses chose rather to suffer affliction with the people of\n God than to enjoy the pleasure of sin, esteeming the reproach\n of Christ greater riches than the treasures of Egypt.

Piety, on the other hand, is often graced\n with the name of wisdom. Prosperity is, in itself, a real\n -blessing. Let us examine how it comes to pass that the pros\u00ac\n perity of fools destroys them.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the poor*behold wealth properly used, they bless the\n just and the generous, from whose munificence they receive\n employment and reward. On the other hand, when they see\n others dissipating the fortunes which their forefathers had hon\u00ac\n orably earned, oppressing their dependants in order that they\n may roll in sin, then the hearts of the poor swell within them;\n with murmurings they eye their own huts and ragged children,\n and become prepared for strikes, tumults, and every evil work,\n which all good citizens know is wrong.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Lord gave Saul great booty upon the conquest of Amalek,\n but Saul was ignorant of the use to which God designed that\n prosperous event. His folly and covetousness blasted his crown\n and took the scepter from his family. \u201cBecause thou hast\n rejected the word of the Lord,\u201d said Samuel to Saul, \u201che hath\n also rejected thee from being king.\u201d When worldly prosperity\n \u2022comes do not throw off the yoke of the Lord Jesus Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n The animals which the Philistines selected to carry the ark of\n the Lord remind us of doubtful souls who are not accustomed\n to bear the yoke of Christ.

If we would realize that the yoke of Jesus\n Christ is easy, we must bear it daily. The arms of Saul were\n heavy to David, simply because he was not accustomed to wear\u00ac\n ing them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Prosperity of some kind too often causes a divided heart. A\n house divided against itself can not prosper. You abstain, per\u00ac\n haps, from injuring your enemy in the church, but it is without\n loving him as your brother. You give a few dollars to send the\n gospel to the heathen, but you half begrudge the money. \u201cYe\n can not serve God and mammon.\u201d Isaac\u2019s wife suffered the\n most cruel anguish just before the birth of Jacob artd Esau. The\n two children struggled within her. Rebecca prayed that God\n would either grant her deliverance or death. A voice from\n heaven gave her to understand that the two children were two\n nations. So it is with divided hearts in the world to day. They\n still carry two loves which are irreconcilable, Jacob and Esau, the\n love of Jesus Christ and the love of worldly prosperity. If the\n love of the Master alone possessed our hearts, all would be quiet.\n Sinful passions keep you in trouble. You can not speak kindly\n of those who eclipse you. Your jealous thoughts and criminal\n attachments keep your hearts divided. Paul felt within him a\n law in opposition to the law of God.

Now, I do not say that religion\n has no experience to which the soul may refer with assurance,\n nor that experience has nothing to do with it. I am not calling\n this in question. It is only this that I controvert, namely, that\n it is a special experience, and nothing more; a something you\n carry around with you, as you do your conscience, and that you\n can tell the precise date when, and the circumstances under\n which, you came in possession of it, and can give a history of\n your feelings before and at the time you received it.\n</p>\n<p>\n But the question may be asked\u2014and legitimately, too\u2014What\n is the meaning of the phrase \u201cExperiencing religion?\u201d The\n word experience is from a Greek word which means \u201cto try, to\n test,\u201d to ascertain the quality and worth of anything by trial.\n When one tries this or that piece of mechanism to learn its\n merits he is experimenting, and the knowledge he gains is by\n experience. He has learned its value or its worthlessness. m\n Now, take experience, as thus defined, and apply it to religion,\n and it follows that he who has a religious experience has learned\n the value of religion not by mere feeling or emotion, nor by the\n testimony of another, nor by hearsay, but by actual, personal\n test; that is, by receiving the teachings of Christ \u201cand applying\n them in the government of life.\u201d Just so far as he has tested\n religion and acquainted himself with its intrinsic value by apply\u00ac\n ing, in every-day life, the lofty principles taught by the Messiah,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0186/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0186/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0186/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0186/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0186/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0186.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 506121}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"186\">\n<p>\n 158 RELIGION NO T AN EMO TION, B UT A LIFE .\n</p>\n<p>\n just so far he has religious-experience, and no farther.

Still he is said to have\n experienced religion, got religion. \u201cBut what has such a one\n actually experienced?\u201d What has he gained? Very much,\n indeed. He has gained a view of his wretched and lost condi\u00ac\n tion while transgressing the laws of ' Jehovah; he has learned the\n great wants of his soul, and, like the prodigal son, he has \u201ccome\n to himself;\u201d he has experienced the power of Christian truth\n upon his heart so forcibly that he has resolved to lead a new\n life by forsaking all unrighteousness, and by walking in the\n truth. And in this step he has gained an inward joy, having an\n assurance of the pardon of sins and an \u201cacceptance in the\n beloved.\u201d This change being real, it is the greatest, the most\n glorious that can take place in this life. He has now just com\u00ac\n menced religious experience. He has barely entered upon the\n journey in which he is to learn, by trial, the real worth of\n religion. Instead of its being said, \u201cHe has got religion,\u201d it\n may be truthfully said, \u201c He has secured the beginning of re\u00ac\n ligion. He has just started in the heavenly race, which he is\n expected to run entirely through with patience.\u201d The straight\n and narrow path, the highway of holiness, is still all before him.\n He has made the wisest choice possible, adopted the highest\n principles of life, and enthroned within his heart the noblest\n purposes. .But these do not make up the sum of religion.

A man may be as orthodox in all his\n views on every article of theology as John Knox, of Scotland,\n was claimed to be, and yet be a comparative stranger to \u201cpure\n ' religion.\u201d You may have your faith cut, and carved, and\n hewed, till it fits every angle, and curve, and line of the\n soundest type of orthodoxy; you may be weighed in its most\n delicately adjusted scales, and measured by its most elaborately\n graduated rules, and then labeled all over, \u201cSound in the faith/*\n and yet be sadly wanting in the unmixed religion of the text.\n Now, this is not saying that faith has nothing to do with it, nor\n that a sound belief is a matter of supreme indifference\u2014that you\n may believe anything or nothing, just as you may elect. I would\n not be understood as supporting this idea at all. Faith is essen\u00ac\n tial to religion\u2014a genuine faith, a pure and holy faith, a sound\n faith. Indeed there can be no pure and undefiled religion with\u00ac\n out it. Faith in Jehovah as the all-father, and in Christ as our\n teacher and redeemer, and in the word of inspiration as the rule\n of life, lies at the foundation of all excellence in religion. But\n this faith is not religion any more than the foundation is the\n building, or the root of the plant is the stock, the blossoms, and\n the fruit. Would any one say, Since the building is not the\n foundation there is no necessity for it; or, since the blossoms\n and the fruit are not the root, it is not essential to them? Cer\u00ac\n tainly not. No more would I say, since faith is not religion, it\n is, therefore, not necessary to it. And I may remark again, in\n closing this first part of the subject, that religion is not a special\n experience, does not consist of pleasurable emotions and desires,\n is not austerity of life, nor the observance of certain forms and\n usages, and is not made up of faith in any special creed. While\n it has its pleasurable emotions, feelings, and desires, its experi\u00ac\n ence, its calm sobriety, its order, and its pure, genuine faith, it\n is not either one of them, and we should be careful not to\n \u2022confound it with them.\n</p>\n<p>\n I will now proceed to answer the question, What is religion?\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0188/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0188/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0188/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0188/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0188/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0188.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 475130}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"188\">\n<p>\n 160 RELIGION NOT AN EMOTION, BUT A LIFE.\n</p>\n<p>\n by this plain and direct answer, \u201cIt is a life.\u201d If this is a\n correct definition, then a man is religious in the proportion that\n he lives religion; and he has religion in the ratio that he does it.\n It is, therefore, something to be lived, to be done, as well as\n possessed and enjoyed.

To such, religion is nothing during the week. It\n enters not with them into the common duties of life. It is one\n thing, and these ordinary affairs are other and quite different\n things, and the former has no part nor lot with the latter.

Hence it\n is said of him who breaks off his sins by righteousness and turns to\n the Lord, that he is \u201cborn again.\u201d And the divine law, in speak\u00ac\n ing of such a one, says, \u201cBeing born again, not of corruptible\n seed, but of incorruptible, by the word of God which liveth and\n abideth forever.\u201d No language could be employed that would\n more fully express the magnitude of the change that takes place\n when one enters upon this new life than the phrase \u201cbeing born\n again.\u201d And yet, while it expresses the greatness of this change,\n it also indicates that so far as this new journey which he has just\n commenced is concerned he knows very little, indeed. It is\n with him as it is with the young child. As it has just started on\n life\u2019s way, so has he barely entered upon his religious course.\n As the child is weak, ignorant, and inexperienced in all that\n pertains to its present state, so is he in those things which belong\n to that life into which this new birth introduces him. True, he\n is conscious of desires, hopes, and aspirations that take hold on\n heaven; but these, however pleasurable they may be, do not\n make up a religious life\u2014do not constitute religion. They are\n the beginning of this, as the babe is the beginning of the man.\n These desires, hopes, aspirations, and feelings must ripen into\n principles which will control the heart within and the life without\n before he can be truly called a religious man. At this new birth\n he has just commenced the difficult work of subduing the pas\u00ac\n sions, tastes, habits, plans, and principles of his past life, and of\n bringing them all under the control of the higher and nobler\n principles and purposes of his new life. But at this period he is\n only a \u201c babe\u201d and must feed upon the \u201csincere milk of the\n word that he may grow thereby.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 2.

This resulted in a renewal of his covenant with God and\n in settling his religious convictions. In June following he was\n buried in baptism by his father, and united with the Christian\n Church of West Bloomfield. In September, 1849, while under\n deep impressions that he must preach the gospel, he entered the\n Meadville (Pennsylvania) Theological School, where he pursued\n the regular course and graduated July 1, 1852.

First we will glance at the age in which the primitive\n church grew and prospered. This covered the first three cen\u00ac\n turies of the Christian era, and ended with the establishment of\n the Christian religion, not only in the palace at Rome, but as the\n predominant religion of the empire. This was an age of perse\u00ac\n cution, an age when it cost something to be a Christian. But\n the persistent opposition to which the avowed disciples of Jesus\n were then exposed had a tendency to make them pure, sincere,\n and zealous defenders of the gospel. Such they were. In the\n spirit of their divine Master these early martyrs met their fate,\n and, by his example, were animated to endure their sufferings\n and death with heroic fortitude. \u201c Lord, lay not this sin to their\n charge! \u201d were the dying words of the first of their number.\n How strikingly was this prayer of Stephen like the prayer which\n Jesus uttered on the cross! And those other words, \u201cLord\n Jesus, receive my spirit,\u201d also bring before us the Savior ' s last\n utterance while we behold the image of Christ reflected in the\n person of his chosen disciple.\n</p>\n<p>\n The period of the primitive church was marked by great suf\u00ac\n fering. Nevertheless it is justly regarded as the church\u2019s\n \u201cgolden age.\u201d \u201cWith the memory of the apostles and their\n companions still recent, with greater unanimity of doctrine than\n afterwards existed, in the early glow of its enthusiasm for the\n</p>\n<p>\n 11\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0204/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0204/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0204/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0204/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0204/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0204.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 538818}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"204\">\n<p>\n 174 CHRIST ' S LIFE A MEANS OF SAL VA TION.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" blessed gift that God had bestowed on man, the church beheld,\n during that age, its cause advance, not only despite the malice\n > of its enemies, but through that very malice.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The times were favorable for true religious growth. Living\n principles formed the basis of action. From the days of Herod\n to the reign of Constantine, not a disciple of Jesus lived but\n knew that he might be called to seal his faith with his blood;\n and few were there, through all that long sad age, but could\n recall the memory of some brave, heroic martyrdom, which, if\n not witnessed by themselves, was so reported to them by eye\u00ac\n witnesses as to add depth to their convictions and strength to\n their religious principles.\n</p>\n<p>\n Towering above all was the example of the blessed Son of\n Ood who had so recently lived and wrought his wonderful\n works upon the earth. This stood out before them in living\n light, and was universally known. The world was not then, as\n now, full of books. Only a few existed, and of the few the\n writings of the evangelists held the chief place, and were most\n widely known. As yet no spiritual tyranny had usurped power\n \u2022over men\u2019s minds and forbidden the reading of the Scriptures.\n -Systems of divinity had not obscured tl^e plain facts in the life of\n Christ with their unmeaning mysticism. Dogmas had not taken\n the place of practical piety. And so the character and teachings\n of the Holy One were better understood, and his Spirit more\n largely prevailed among his disciples in that age, perhaps, than\n since. Had that early purity, that single-hearted devotion to\n truth and to God, continued unabated from that day to this, who\n shall say that practically the whole world had not long since\n owned Christ as king; and that not in the name only, but in the\n spirit and power of his gospel ?\n</p>\n<p>\n II. We are brought now to the second period in the church\u2019s\n history\u2014to an age of outward prosperity and splendor.

Constantine first declared himself the\n friend of Christianity; and of those who succeeded him to the\n throne scarcely one sought to re-establish the ancient paganism.\n Christianity became the popular religion. The teachers of the\n faith were not, as they once were, driven to take refuge in deserts\n and mountain-caves, but were welcomed into king\u2019s houses, and\n appeared as counsellors in royal courts. Alas! that they were\n unable to endure such honors; that peace and plenty should so\n soon have manifested their power to lead away from the true and\n heavenly path. And yet has not worldly prosperity an effect\n much the same to-day ? Hardly was the church at rest without\n when it was broken and rent by factions within. Men forgot\n the test of fellowship which Jesus gave when he declared that\n whosoever should \u201cdo the will of the Father was his brother,\n and sister, and mother.\u201d And that other test, in the words of\n Paul, was sadly overlooked, \u201c If any man have not the Spirit of\n Christ he is none of his.\u201d The mind was diverted from the\n study of Christ\u2019s character to the study of doctrines respecting\n his person. The Savior\u2019s spirit was forgotten in the very attempt\n to bestow dignity and honor upon his name. Two hundred\n years were thus numbered with ' the past. And if, through these\n centuries, controversy and persecution largely prevailed, yet this\n period was brightened by the labors of many noble and divinely-\n consecrated minds, and no doubt the rich fruits of holiness were\n produced in multitudes of hearts and lives.\n</p>\n<p>\n III. Would that there were nothing worse to present. But a\n darker day dawns, and we must note it as we pass. We have\n now reached the period when the wild hordes of the North\n overran the Christian world and destroyed the old laws and\n language.

In 1838 his\n parents removed to Vergennes, Kent county, Michigan. At the\n age of fourteen he professed religion, and united with the Chris\u00ac\n tian Church at Vergennes. In 1853, when but nineteen years\n old, he was received as a licentiate member of the Grand River\n Valley Christian Conference. Being of studious mind, and\n thirsting for knowledge, his father, though poor and unable to\n afford him material aid, in the fall of 1853 gave him his time,\n which enabled him to attend a select school for a fall term of\n two months, take charge of a common school during the winter\n at thirteen dollars per month, and to work by the month upon a\n farm during the summer. By the middle of September, 1854,\n having accumulated one hundred dollars, he started for Antioch\n College, where he spent two years, paying his way the last term\n of the first year by sweeping the college building, and during the\n last year by serving as a night-watch. Having completed the\n preparatory course at Antioch, he returned to Vergennes and\n taught school during the following winter. February 1, 1857, he\n was ordained to the ministry. The next summer was spent in\n traveling and preaching.\n</p>\n<p>\n He settled at Maple Rapids in the fall of 1857, and.divided\n his time between teaching and preaching.

The one is denominated\n the dispensation of grace, the other the dispensation of law. In\n treating our topic it will be fitting to get a correct understanding\n of the meaning of the two words\u2014law and grace\u2014as found in\n the New Testament. It should be observed that the discussions\n that have characterized religious thought along down the centuries\n since the days of Paul have almost entirely changed the meaning\n of many words used in the Pauline epistles. In this age of the\n world great pains should be taken to get a correct understanding\n of terms used by the inspired writers of the apostolic age.\n</p>\n<p>\n The term law, in theology, is susceptible of various construc\u00ac\n tions. It sometimes includes the whole of revelation, and again\n refers to the books of Moses alone. Sometimes it alludes solely\n to the Jewish code of rites and ceremonies; it is then termed\n ceremonial law. This law is supposed to have been entirely set\n aside by the Christian dispensation. It is regarded as \u201ca\n shadow of good things to come, and not the very image of the\n things.\u201d Again we find this term law applying to the ten\n commandments, written upon the tables of stone, and it is there\n termed moral law. Among other definitions attached to this\n word may be named that which makes it a rule of action or\n conduct. These definitions are special to the province of re\u00ac\n ligion. There are many other significations that are not perti\u00ac\n nent to our theme.

It certainly can not refer to the ceremonial law,\n else Paul would not say, \u201cThe law is holy, and the command\u00ac\n ment holy, just, and good.\u201d He would never say this of a\n dispensation he deemed obsolete. In fact, he declares, in the\n same connection, \u201cthe law is spiritual;\u201d and again, \u201cI consent\n unto the law that it is good.\u201d The study of Paul\u2019s argument\n leads us to the conclusion that the law contrasted is a simple rule\n of action as compared with the spiritual elements of character,\n and that the term is used much as James uses the term works in\n contrast with faith. He does not ignore works but enforces the\n necessity of an accompanying faith. James argues the impor\u00ac\n tance of works as an accompaniment of faith, while Paul presents\n the importance of faith, or grace, as an essential auxiliary to\n \u201cgood works.\u201d What Paul brings into contrast in the text is\n the mere action or performance with intrinsic character or\n excellence, which is denominated grace, or a condition of grace.\n Law, as a mere rule of conduct, is brought into comparison with\n spiritual life in the soul, which is a state of divine grace or\n excellence. With this suggestion as to the use of the term grace\n we are now prepared to study its meaning as found in the word\n of God. The word is often found in the New Testament, and is\n a word entering largely into all theological discussions. Like\n law, it has a variety of meanings. One definition is that of\n favor, and in this sense often expresses the mercy of God, as\n distinguished from his justice. A second, and more common\n signification, is inner excellence, and as such refers to the\n disposition of mind by which we yield obedience to the divine\n law, and by which we are brought into harmony with the spirit\n of Christ, and feel the \u201cHoly Spirit witnessing with our spirits\n that we are the children of God.\u201d This, doubtless, is the sense\n in which it is most commonly used in the apostolic writings.\n The saving grace of the Apostle Paul is not a mere logical\n distinction, but a spiritual state of the heart by which it cleaves\n to that which is good. It is not a salvation resulting from the\n mere mercy or favor of God, but is one based upon those\n spiritual qualities and disposition of mind commending man to\n the divine favor.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0219/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0219/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0219/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0219/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0219/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0219.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 466276}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"219\">\n<p>\n E.

His denunciation of priest and pharisee was because\n of an outward compliance with law in their lives while there\n was no reverence for law in their hearts. Christ never de\u00ac\n nounced law as such, nor did he set up faith or grace as a rival\n principle. In the sermon on the mount he accepts the require\u00ac\n ments of the moral law, but goes further and demands an\n obedience of the heart. The law says, \u201c Do not kill,\u201d but the\n great Teacher enforces that disposition which will not indulge\n anger in the heart. The lust that dwells in the heart is itself sin,\n even without the formal act. To prove the position taken let\n us spend a little time in examining a few passages of scripture.\n</p>\n<p>\n In Zechariah 12: 10, we read, \u201cI will pour upon the house\n of David, and upon the inhabitants of Jerusalem, the spirit of\n grace and of supplications.\u2019\u2019 This language of the prophet refers\n to the Christian dispensation, and evidently does not refer to the\n idea of favor, but rather those qualities of mind and heart begot\u00ac\n ten of Christ in the soul, and which express a conformity to the\n spirit of the Redeemer.

It is an\n awakening of our spiritual nature into life and spiritual growth.\n It is a love for God in the soul that leads us to despise evil and\n cleave to what is good. It is a hungering and thirsting for\n righteousness which has the promise of being supplied. No\n formal compliance with the teachings of Christ, no ceremonial,\n however august, can insure the divine benediction; for such is\n only of the outward man\u2014only law. It is only when the law of\n God is written in the heart, so that we love God with all our\n might, mind, and strength, and our neighbor as ourselves, that\n we are under grace. It is in exactly this sense that \u201c love is the\n fulfilling of the law,\u201d and \u201che who loves is born of God.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In our civil relations he who honors the law of the state in\n his heart and yields implicit obedience to such law because it is\n right and because he loves the right, is the noblest citizen. The\n person who obeys the law because he fears the penalty merely,\n and not because of inner allegiance, is under the dominion of\n law. The penalty of the law is of little account to the man who\n loves righteousness. He is not lashed into obedience, but he is\n drawn by the inspiration of Christ\u2019s heavenly life. With this\n definition of grace we at once understand the meaning of the\n phrase \u201cmeans of grace.\u201d These means, though ordained of\n God, are of no avail only so far as they conduce to our growth\n in grace. Prayer is a means of grace, and by it we are to\n drink in more of the divine excellence. But he who prays with\n the idea that the prayer alone* will commend him to God has no\n true conception of spiritual life. It is only when the prayer has\n in view a higher and better life that it is a saving power, not in\n itself, but in that higher life to which prayer is instrumental.\n Devotion is a grace that all Christians should possess; and where\n there is no devotion\u2014however much of prayer in outward act\u2014\n there is nothing to commend to God. Prayer is a powerful in\u00ac\n strumentality ordained of God to impart to us that spirit of de\u00ac\n votion that is always acceptable to God.

Finney\n and through the religious influence of the college at Oberlin he\n was led to make a public confession of faith in Christ. On the 1st\n of July, 1855, he united with the Glady Creek Christian Church,\n Champaign county, Ohio, and was baptized by Rev. Hiram\n ' Simonton, at West Liberty, on the first Sunday in August of the\n same year.\n</p>\n<p>\n During the winters of 1854-5 and 1855-6 he taught district\n schools near his father\u2019s home, and two years later he taught a\n four-months\u2019 school in Warren county, Iowa.\n</p>\n<p>\n Brother Moore entered the English classes of Antioch College\n at the spring term of 1854. On account of ill health and want\n of means he was compelled to leave the school two or three\n times. He spent, altogether, nearly five years at Antioch.\n From the time, and even before, he united with the church\n he felt it his duty to preach; but for four years he shrunk\n from so great and responsible a work. His first sermon\n was preached at Glady Creek, Ohio, June 13, 1858. The\n following autumn he united with the Miami Conference, at\n Enon, Ohio, and the next year\u2014August 31, 1859\u2014was ordained\n during the annual session of the conference in the college chapel\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0226/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0226/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0226/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0226/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0226/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0226.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 495284}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"226\">\n<p>\n 194\n</p>\n<p>\n D.

IV. MOORE.\n</p>\n<p>\n 199\n</p>\n<p>\n does speak his words \u2014 coming from the heart, and backed by the\n power and energy of the Holy Spirit\u2014glow, and quiver, and\n take effect, for they are alive and of God. \u201cFor the word of\n God is quick and powerful, and sharper than any two-edged\n sword, piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit,\n and of the joints and marrow, and is* a discerner of the thoughts\n and intents of the heart.\u201d So David found it to be. The\n successful preacher is the Lord\u2019s servant, speaking the Lord\u2019s\n message.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Nathan exhibited a great deal of tact; he used very shrewd\n stratagem in approaching the king. We have a law against\n common citizens carrying concealed weapons, but the servant of\n the Lord is justifiable in secreting the sword of reproof, with\n which he is to strike sin and arrest the sinner, until the favorable\n time to strike the fatal blow. We all know what strategy\n is in military affairs. It is a well-known fact that the greatest\n victories ever gained by the most successful generals, were\n won by strategy. They came when and in a way they were not\n expected, sometimes falling back to draw the foe out of his\n entrenchments, sometimes making a feint attack on one side to\n deceive the enemy, while he comes down with his main force,\n like an avalanche, on the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n Well, now, this tact should be used by the army of the Lord\n as well as by the military chieftain. We have a signal instance\n of this in the case of Ehud and King Eglon. King Eglon was\n an enemy of the Lord\u2019s people, an oppressor of Israel, and\n imposed on them a most outrageous tax.

It is remarkable that David should have fallen into such a\n sin. The Lord had highly exalted him, established him king\n over Israel. David had inquired of the Lord what he should\n do. God had been with him an,d blessed him in a miraculous\n manner on various occasions. He had entered into a solemn\n covenant with God. He was naturally of a devotional spirit,\n and had exhibited such humility, reverence, and devotion that he\n was declared to be a man, in his general character,* \u201cafter God ' s\n own heart.\u201d The Lord had sent a solemn revelation to David\n through this very same Nathan, declaring his purpose to favor\n the king and his descendants. David had often rehearsed the\n mercies of God, and in many remarkable ways had shown a\n pious and devotional spirit. He was the tender man whose heart\n smote him because he cut off Saul\u2019s skirt. He was a servant of\n the Lord, king of the people, the sweet singer of Israel. We are\n startled with wonder at the fall of such a man.\n</p>\n<p>\n But there is nothings perfect under the sun. The tempter of\n \u2022our race assails the best of men, .and always attacks them at the\n weak points. You remember that when the wicked Jeroboam\n became inspired with the most malignant hatred toward the\n king of Judah, and gave himself and his kingly office to the\n promotion of idolatry in its most hideous forms, the Lord sent\n \u201ca prophet from Judah\u201d to warn him of his impiety and predict\n his doom.

Lot, who was grieved with\n the sins of Sodom, afterward committed a worse sin himself.\n Who would have thought that Noah, who built the ark because\n he believed in God, faithfully warned the people, gave an\n example to all the world how they should save themselves\u2014who\n would have thought that when the flood was past he would have\n given the first example of sin to his own sons?\n</p>\n<p>\n There was Solomon, the man who was chosen of the Lord,\n who built the temple and prayed in it, who wrote such wise and\n holy proverbs, who was termed by God as the wisest man in\n the world\u2014who would have thought that he, in his old days,\n would have taken more concubines unto himself than any heathen\n in the world, and gone out after the goddess of the Zidonians, and\n after the abomination of the Ammonites? Yet it is too true that\n he who was the beauty of Israel, a blessing to his generation,\n beloved of his God, fell; and the Scripture is faithful in relating the\n sad and surprising story of Solomon\u2019s defection and degeneracy.\n So David ' s sin, as wonderful and astounding as it is, is not an\n isolated case.

He does\n not call it an imprudence, or man-slaughter, but calls it by its\n true name, \u201cbloodguiltiness.\u201d He is evidently oppressed with\n a sense of the heinousness of his sin. He prays like one who is\n consciously guilty. The blood of Uriah was not only on his\n skirts, but on his conscience, and his heart lay low in the dust.\n This is the only way to find pardon. His pardon was declared\n on this penitent confession, but with a reserve of judgment. He\n never afterward enjoyed what he had done before. He came\n back weary, humbled, broken-hearted, and was restored, but he\n never again sung so jubilant as in former days. His harp and\n his heart were out of tune. Broken bones may be set and\n healed, but they are often subject to shooting pains. So the\n memory of forgiven sins. Job said in his old age, \u201cThou\n makest me to possess the iniquities of my youth.\u201d Though he\n was forgiven, though he was a man of God, yet the memory\n of his youthful sins troubled him. Oh, friends, sins may be par\u00ac\n doned, yet we can not fully get rid of all their effects in this life.\n</p>\n<p>\n III.

The relation\u00ac\n ship existing between the Father and the Son is a perfect one.\n There is no discord between them. Though they are two dis\u00ac\n tinct, separate entities, personalities\u2014if it be proper to use such\n a term of divine beings\u2014yet they are one in spirit, purpose, and\n will. No word Christ ever uttered indicated any unwillingness-\n on his part to do the Father ' s will, but he expresses his willing\u00ac\n ness to obey the Father in strongest terms.

While God so loved the world that he gave his Son to\n save those believing on him, I believe the Son\u2019s love for man\n was so great that he was willing to come to earth and cheerfully\n suffer and die that he might bring men to God.

S. NEW HOUSE.\n</p>\n<p>\n 233\n</p>\n<p>\n The essential idea of a state of bondage is restraint from doing\n right, from living out one\u2019s real and truest nature. Men are not\n slaves because they can not live like birds in the air or the fishes\n in the sea; they were made neither to be angels nor dragons\n while they are men. But they are veritable slaves when their\n natures are restrained, when they can not do what they ought to\n do, and what they were made to do by the Creator.\n</p>\n<p>\n Civil bondage is that restraint placed upon human beings\n which robs them of their inalienable rights as members of the\n commonwealth and society. Freedom is the displacement of\n this restraint. Mental and spiritual bondage differ from this\n only in that the masters are error and sin instead of a fellow\u00ac\n being. These stand over men as with an iron goad, and impel\n them to a service at once in violation of their real natures and\n their highest good. To all such fettered souls Jesus proclaims\n the hope, nay, the blessed assurance of emancipation, full and\n absolute, by the mighty arm of truth, conditional only upon per\u00ac\n severing discipleship. \u201cIf ye continue in my word/\u2019 then shall\n ye be made \u201cfree.\u201d \u201cIf the Son, therefore, shall make you\n free, ye shall be free indeed.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This language must be understood as setting forth, in a vivid\n light, the contrast between a Christian life in its incipiency on\n the one hand, and in its fullness, its ideal estate on the other.\n These Jews were unquestionably accepted of Jesus as true and\n faithful believers, though they were low down in the scale of\n discipleship, and still in the bondage of error. He teaches them\n the sad fact of their bondage to error, and at the same time\n raises their minds to the sublime estate of ideal citizenship in\n his kingdom. \u201cIf ye continue\u201d then freedom will be your\n inheritance. They were accepted for their simple faith in Jesus,\n not for their freedom from all error\u2014for their purity of heart,\n and not for their purity of intellect.

In the epistles, no less than in the gospels, the\n value of this element is set forth in a clear light. It is declared\n to be \u201cthe substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things\n not seen.\u201d \u201cWithout faith it is impossible to please God,\u201d\n \u201c for whatsoever is not of faith is sin.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In the writings of St. Paul, the apostolic theologian, all the\n controversies which had arisen between the Jewish and gentile\n converts over \u201ccircumcision,\u201d \u201cmeats,\u201d and \u201cdays,\u201d are\n resolved into a sublime harmony by the discovery of this com\u00ac\n mon element of simple faith toward God. By him circumcision\n and uncircumcision are regarded as alike valueless and good,\n according to the faith of the soul; true circumcision being \u201cthat\n of the heart, in the Spirit, and not in the letter;\u201d its value con\u00ac\n sisting in a true purpose of heart to do the will of God, and\n which purpose of heart might as likely lead to the non observance\n of rite as to its observance.

Truth has\n nothing to fear, whether of science or religion, from the untruth\n of the world. Sooner or later it must and will outshine all error,\n as the greater brilliancy of the sun obscures the stars by day; so\n shines the truth as it is in Jesus, as he lived it and taught it, and\n as he exerts it in the salvation of men.

All such efforts must prove not only fruitless of any\n permanent good, but injurious in the extreme to the cause of\n Christ and his truth. And may it not be that the ministry in the\n past has employed far too much such human instrumentalities\n that it has not been crowned with more brilliant success in\n planting the banner of Jesus in heathen lands and raising men\n everywhere to the blessed estate of freemen in Christ Jesus?\n May it not have aimed too much to present to the world a creed,\n a correct system of theology, rather than the necessity of faith in\n the incarnate \u201cWord\u201d and the saving truths of the plain gospel\n of God\u2019s love ?

The same conflict appears in human\n life. Only a few of the strongest reach a ripe old age. More\n than one half die in childhood.

We are\n born of God, but a well-developed Christian character is not the\n result of an hour\u2019s blissful experience; nor does the study and\n ardent devotion to some pet formula or creed produce a change\n of heart.

Peter speaks of \u201cexceed\u00ac\n ing great and precious promises, that by these ye might be par-\n takers of the divine nature, having escaped the corruption that\n is in the world through lust. And beside this \u201d\u2014now begins the\n achievements\u2014\u201cgiving all diligence add to your faith virtue,\n and to virtue knowledge, and to knowledge temperance, and to-\n temperance patience, and to patience godliness, and to godliness,\n brotherly kindness, and to brotherly kindness charity.\u201d (II.\n Peter i : 4-7.)\n</p>\n<p>\n We are not alone in this warfare, but Jesus has wisely hidden;\n from us the place where grace begins; hence we are admonished ta\n \u201cgive all diligence to make our calling and election sure.\u201d '\n There are no joys so sweet as those found in the excellency of the-\n divine life.\n</p>\n<p>\n Self-control, culture, purity, and the ability to enjoy and serve\n God make men eternally rich and happy. That man will best\n realize the idea of Christian perfection who keeps a spotless-\n character alongside of a deep and joyous religious experience.\n Faith is a wonderful principle. It is \u201cthe substance of things,\n hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\u201d \u201cThis is the vic-\n - tory that overcometh the world, even your faith.\u201d These defini\u00ac\n tions present faith as the inspiration and great force of the\n Christian life. It is by this inspiration that \u201c we look not upora\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0297/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0297/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0297/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0297/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0297/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0297.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 338018}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"297\">\n<p>\n W.

When\n I hear persons tell of their love for Christ, and have not obeyed\n the commands of the divine law, I, according to the Scriptures,\n have a right to doubt it. \u201c By this we know that we love the\n children of God, w ' hen we love God, and keep his command\u00ac\n ments. For this is the love of God, that we keep his command\u00ac\n ments; and his commandments are not grievous. \u201d (I. John 5:\n</p>\n<p>\n 2, 3.) Because to love is to obey. For this reason Jesus says,\n *\u2018 If ye love me, keep my commandments.\u2019\u2019 And keep is equiv\u00ac\n alent to obey.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, while a promise of marriage does make a great change\n in the conduct of said parties, who could fellowship them as\n husband and w r ife on such a declaration ? What character have\n they established as such? Then why should we fellowship the\n Christian character of a believer before it is established ? How\n many do we fellowship prematurely at our protracted meetings\n who do not even confess Jesus, much less obey the ordinances\n of baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper?\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, we do think that if a brother and sister are in earnest\n they can not help but obey the following requirements of our\n blessed Lord. And how the church and its pastor can pass it\n by without asking believers to obey it is more than we can con\u00ac\n ceive, that is if they are converted and love Christ: \u201cGo ye,\n therefore, and teach all nations, baptizing them in the name of\n the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost: teaching\n them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you;\n .and, lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world.\n Amen.\u201d (Matt. 27: 19, 20.)\n</p>\n<p>\n What authority have I to recognize as husband and wife par\u00ac\n ties who have not obeyed the requirements of the civil law ?\n The simple declaration that \u201cwe love each other\u201d will not do to\n \u2022establish such a character this side of legal requirements.

It opens wide every\n \u2022church-door and leaps over sectarian walls. It visits the homes\n of the poor and meets all on a common level. No institution\n on earth extends the hand of charity in so many directions and\n different ways as the church of Jesus Christ. Yet there are very\n many things done by members of the church that are not very\n charitable. This is often the result of ignorance and religious\n superstition, but not a fault of charity, for it never faileth.\n Christians often, in their zeal and self-righteousness, do many\n foolish and hurtful things and call them charity\u2014things done for\n applause and for a pretense. \u201c And though I bestow all my\n . goods to feed the poor, and though I give my body to be burned,\n and have not charity, it profiteth me nothing.\u201d (I. Cor. 13 : 3.)\n True charity is the fruit that grows on the tree of love, and no\n institution has attained to teach and practice this charity like\n unto the church of Christ. Christians do good for evil, pray for\n their enemies, are benevolent to the poor, are no respecter of\n persons when governed by the law of doing good. And while\n many institutions are doing great good, none outside of Christ\n and his church can raise up in its midst a banner and on it find\n inscribed, in letters eternal, the following: \u201cTherefore, if thine\n enemy hunger, feed him; if he thirst, give him drink; for in so\n doing thou shalt heap coals of fire on his head. Be not over\u00ac\n come of evil, but overcome evil with good.\u201d In what institution\n will you find a charity like this ? And while it may not always\n be lived up to and carried out by all of the brotherhood of\n Christ, yet nevertheless it .is one of the beautiful principles of\n the Christian church, the good Samaritan of the world, the\n brightest star in the Christian\u2019s crown.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0322/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0322/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0322/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0322/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0322/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0322.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 487466}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"322\">\n<p>\n 280\n</p>\n<p>\n THE MISSION OF THE CHURCH.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Let sects, and names, and parties fall,\n</p>\n<p>\n And Jesus\u2019 love be all in all.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n V.

It would further introduce a very undesira\u00ac\n ble uncertainty into human affairs by making the relation of\n cause to effect evitable and inconstant. It would, moreover, de\u00ac\n stroy the sanctity and authority of law and lead men to despise\n what, by its causing punishment to follow with absolute certain\u00ac\n ty, they now respect.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Jews lived under a theocracy.

Yet we are not to conclude there\u00ac\n from that he daily administered their affairs and constantly inter\u00ac\n posed to keep them from sin and its suffering. What he did do\n was to give them his law, which, if they would keep, it should\n go well with them ; but if they refused to obey, it should fare ill\n with them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another view of providence always supposes the miraculous.\n Accordingly nothing is worthy to be called providential except it\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0336/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0336/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0336/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0336/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0336/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0336.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 506905}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"336\">\n<p>\n 292 PRESENCE AND PRO VIDENLE OF\\ GOD.\n</p>\n<p>\n be a result contrary to the one usual in the course of- nature or\n one which has no adequate cause in nature, that is, a miracle.\n Miracles and providences are different processes and have differ\u00ac\n ent ends in view.

The physical landmarks\n of Jerusalem, the towering precipices, the beetling crags, or the\n serried battlements encircling the city are no more evident than\n the moral landmarks that environ the band of Christians.

Divorced from\n their organic relations, reduced to inorganic elements, they\n would betray little concord.\n</p>\n<p>\n You may imagine a curious experiment in chemistry. First\n find the exact quantities and proportions of the various salts,\n acids, and alkalies which enter the frame of an adult man.\n Obtain them and place them in a retort of sufficient size. Then\n finally pour on the mass the five and one-half pails of water in\n which each full-grown man is dissolved. The experiment would\n be doubly an experiment, for no chemist has tried or reported\n such a proceeding. But any man familiar with the properties\n of these conflicting substances can fancy a disturbance like the\n birth-throes of chaos, though on a smaller scale. The extreme\n diversities of their reactions would cause instant and vigorous\n conflict. But in the human body there is no such conflict.\n While the heart beats, while the soul sitting behind it governs,\n all these various elements unite in one common life. The man\n is one. You do not bid \u201cGood-morning,\u201d or, \u201cA prosperous\n voyage,\u201d to s r many pounds of calcic phosphate and the rest of\n ut to Mr. X. Y. Z. who owns the calcic phosphate.

The sermon is the\n appeal of a missionary who stands between the living and the\n \u2022dead, and offers immortality to man. The king sat in judgment\n surrounded by his court. The missionary stood in chains,\n guarded by the officers. In that age all kings and all officers\n were opposed to Christ. All is changed now, and the proudest\n monarchs bow to the crucified One. But in this case the king\n represents an Unbelieving world, and the missionary the incom\u00ac\n ing Christianity. Therefore this sermon is the believer\u2019s answer\n to the unbelief of all. The king, though born a Hebrew, was by\n education a pagan. The missionary was a Christian, one of the\n earliest and ablest converts to a celestial religion, in the converts\n to which self is dead, but Christ lives in him a heavenly life. In\n the true Christian life Christ\u2019s life is reproduced day by day.\n The great mass of professors are not possessors, but like the\n king, counted believers only from their believing parents, while\n in practice pagans. The king said, \u201cThou art permitted to\n speak for thyself.\u201d Then the missionary said, \u201cI think myself\n happy, because I shall answer for myself this day before thee\n touching all the things whereof I am accused of the Jews. I\n verily thought with myself that I ought to do many things con\u00ac\n trary to the name of Jesus of Nazareth. Which thing I also did\n in Jerusalem; and many of the saints did I shut up in prison,\n having received authority from the chief priests; and when they\n were put to death I gave my voice against them. And I pun\u00ac\n ished them oft in every synagogue, and compelled them to\n blaspheme; and being exceedingly mad against them I perse\u00ac\n cuted them even unto strange cities.

Who desires such a paradise, a reign\n of passion, sensuality, and sin, the atheist\u2019s heaven? The king,\n had seen enough of this in pagan Rome, and shuddered at the\n thought. Yes, something must be true. Atheism might answer\n if nothing existed; but we exist, and existence must be accounted\n for. Whence comes man? What is his origin? What his.\n destiny? Science can not answer. \u201cThe worldly wisdom,\n knew not God.\u201d Religion must answer. It is the mother of\n science. It builds colleges and universities, it promotes philos\u00ac\n ophy, it appeals to reason. All things always existed or grew\n out of some things which always existed, or there is an intelligent\n Creator. If you answer that all things always existed, you are\n bound to account for the absence of earlier history. If some\n always existed you are bound to account for the absence of\n earlier development. Why this tardy growth? Eternity is a\n very long time, and the journey seems just begun. If all sprung\n from nothing, when and how ? And what gave it the start, and\n why so late ? It is as impossible for nothing to create a mopad\n as a man. Ex nihilo nihil fit. Out of nothing nothing comes.\n Protoplasms, primordial germs, or fiery vapors require a Creator\n as well as the sea bound earth or fiery sun.

He says he is not quite certain that his boy\u00ac\n hood was remarkable for anything in particular. He was born\n in a log-cabin and shared the privations incident to living in the\n woods. Being the eldest of his father\u2019s family he was made\n familiar with all the industries of pioneer life. Opportunities for\n .attending school in that county were very limited at that time.\n</p>\n<p>\n He was converted, as he now believes, at the age of fourteen,\n but being diffident and fearing that he would reproach the church\n by backsliding he did not make any public profession until he\n was near twenty. The result was he backslid. To this day he\n believes it to have been his duty to join the church at fourteen.\n</p>\n<p>\n At his father\u2019s request he went to a trade at the age of eight\u00ac\n een, but told his father that he did not expect to follow it. The\n reason was that in his own mind there was a strong and abiding\n conviction that he would preach the gospel. Soon after making\n ^a profession he began taking an active part in the meetings of\n the church, but declined invitatidns to preach for the reason that\n it was his conviction that a minister should be more fully edu\u00ac\n cated than he then was. His father did all he could to help him\n fit for college. The struggle, however, was a hard one. The\n spirit of the times was against young men being educated for the\n pulpit.\n</p>\n<p>\n On July 1, 1831, the church now known as Ujiion Mills, New\n York, gave him a certificate to \u201cimprove his gifts,\u201d and the\n New York Eastern Conference gave him license to preach on\n June 1, 1834. In June, 1835, g ave himself wholly to the\n ministry. He preached his first sermon at Mason, New Hamp\u00ac\n shire, where Rev. John Phillips was then preaching.

God is su\u00ac\n preme and man is sub-royal\u2014like Pharaoh and Joseph\u2014and all\n under man, and man under God over them. The trust and\n honor are exceeding great, and as responsible as high. If man\n be faithful no deadly poison, the bite of no viper, can harm him.\n He is only a little lower than the angels, with vast trusts com\u00ac\n mitted to him. While faithful he may fall back on the arm of\n Omnipotence and, listening to wisdom divine, he may feel sure\n that he is backed by all the artillery of heaven. On the other\n hand, if he violate his covenant the crown falls from his head '\n and the death-wave rolls over him deep and strong. In violating\n his covenant he dares supreme authority. His first sin strikes as*\n high as heaven and as broad as his under-royalty.

The Bible makes the flesh of\n Jesus to the divine as the vail was to the face of Moses. There\n is more love in the divine than in human nature, or God ceases to\n be supreme in the best and highest attribute of the soul. Jesus\n says the divinity in him doeth the works. When will the relig\u00ac\n ious world cease to believe that Mary, as the mother of God, is\n more loving than God himself? Both ideas unintentionally un\u00ac\n deify Jehovah. But the divinity in Jesus\u2019 loving, giving, wait\u00ac\n ing, is love above our highest conception.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The conditions of reconciliation\u2014atonement\u2014to God\n were fully revealed in the teachings, life, death, and resurrection\n of Jesus; and when man accepts the fact that Jesus is God\u2019s.\n Son, the way, the truth, and the life, he is atoned\u2014reconciled\u2014\n to God. And any system that attempts to establish the actual\n atonement before man accepts contradicts Paul. (II. Cor. 5 :\n 17-20.)\n</p>\n<p>\n This redemption by reconciliation is from the power of the\n grave, from vain conversation, from the devil, from all iniquity.\n God makes no commercial treaty with these. Every man by\n this may know whether he is of the elect any day. If he ac\u00ac\n cepts God\u2019s terms he is reconciled, is atoned, to God, is elected,\n is justified from all things from which he could not be by the\n law of Moses, and is made every whit whole. Whosoever, con\u00ac\n fessed the Son hath the Father also; whoso willfully rejecteth\n the Son rejecteth the Father also. If he cordially receive the\n Son, God does not impute sin to him.

If it happen to be tent-duty, well;\n if it be to storm the heights of Satan\u2019s strongholds, be up and at\n it. Be anxious to be doing duty rather than running here and\n there. Work first. If, while storming a stronghold, you see\n the Lord\u2019s ensign waving gloriously in place of the black flag,\n you may shout the warrior\u2019s shout and sing hallelujah, as did the\n saints when Babylon fell.

Heaven\u2019s, an apple of discord will disappear and the\n warmth and the beauty of the gospel will reach hearts now cold\n and distant.

its\n character and work. All may admit the fact; but the effect is\n various on the different characters interested. It is often asked,\n What is death ? The severing of a slender thread that binds\n mortals to earth. Philosophy tells us that it is a step into the\n dark\u2014the untried future. Ambition looks upon it as the sudden\n termination of all its cherished hopes and pursuits. The gay\n and thoughtless estimate it as the dreaded event which changes\n merriment into melancholy and eclipses forever the brightest\n prospects of buoyant youth. But to the invalid, or the pilgrim\n of threescore and ten years, the rest and quietness of death\u2019s\n peaceful slumbers are regarded as a fit and desirable termination\n of the fitful turmoils of life, and through a well-founded hope he\n exclaims, \u201cI would not live always!\u2019* and enters joyfully that\n tranquil mansion where \u201cthe wicked cease from troubling and\n the weary are at rest.\u201d But death is more fully described by\n what it does than by what it is, and can be traced more by its\n works than by its nature.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. There is but a step between us and death in mingling with\n the works and beholding the mementoes of the departed\u2014the\n implements which they used, the tenements which they built,\n the books which they wrote, the opinions which they advocated.\n Through all these they are speaking to us, admonishing, teach\u00ac\n ing, and encouraging to wise designs and virtuous deeds.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. In the affections of the heart. These do not die when\n the loved and the cherished depart. Those dear to us iij life we\n can not cease to love, though they have passed through the vail\n of mortality. The places of their rest we consecrate ; and often\n not until death has set its seal upon them are the principal excel\u00ac\n lences of their character developed. Memory and affection in\u00ac\n vest the departed form with beauties unknown to the earthly\n life.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

We readily admit the truth of this charge, and\n yet respectfully submit that the fact, affirmed by the words as\n they stand, is most clearly implied in the general context. The\n unity of the church is that for which Christ prayed, while our\n text but affirms the possibility of that for which he prayed.\n Would he, with his wealth of wisdom and his illimitable pre\u00ac\n science, pray for that which was impossible as a consummation?\n We may not safely charge Jesus with such folly, but the rather\n prefer the charge against that class of men who, in the madness\n of their unsanctified ambition, are seeking to thwart the wish\n and defeat the purpose of the divine Master. Nor should the\n reader lose sight of the fact that Jesus here prays for organic\n union, and affirms the possibility of such a form of union. He\n would no more pray for what was and for what could not but be\n than for what could not be. The folly would be as evident in\n the one as in the other case. Mere spiritual union has ever ob\u00ac\n tained, and can not but exist. As you can no more conceive of\n a Christian separated from Christ than you can of a fruitful\n branch separated from the vine, so one can not philosophically\n conceive of one Christian spiritually separated from another\n Christian. The branches all belong to the vine, and by the vine\n are connected with each other. Thus the spiritual union be\u00ac\n tween Christ and his followers, and between each and all of his\n followers is simply an inevitable thing. For this form of union\n Christ did not pray, but for organic union, such as exists be\u00ac\n tween the members of a single, local church.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0420/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0420/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0420/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0420/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0420/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0420.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 486429}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"420\">\n<p>\n 366\n</p>\n<p>\n THE LA W OF UNITY:\n</p>\n<p>\n THE PRIMITIVE LAW.\n</p>\n<p>\n A casual observation of the remote past, clearly presents the-\n law of unity as the supreme law, the universal principle inters\n woven with and controlling all things. Until the flood prevailed,,\n or for one thousand six hundred and fifty years, and indeed\n thereafter for one hundred and twenty years, until the Tower of\n Babel reared its defiant head heavenward, \u201cthe whole earth was-\n of one language and of one speech.\u201d Shinar\u2014\u201cthe country of\n the two rivers,\u201d and the ancient name of Chaldea and Babylonia,\n was then the narrow cradle of the human race. With an Asian\n home, Airica was as yet unseen and Europe untrodden, while\n the Americas and the ocean isles, those smaller continents of\n the earth, were undreamed of by the people. With a single\n speech, a central, common home, and a single type of features-\n and complexion, one only scepter swayed the people politically,\n and one only religion controlled the people morally.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE LAW CHANGED.\n</p>\n<p>\n But this law of concentration and assimilation was destined, in\n the providence of God, to be suspended for a time.

Go to, let us go down, and there confound their lan\u00ac\n guage, that they may not understand one another\u2019s speech.

If for these divisions\n we had to look into the face of a single Methodism, or a single\n Presbyterianism, it would not be so bad; but there are eleven\n kinds of Methodism and nine kinds of Presbyterianism.

But when men turn from the Bible to an uninspired\n creed, they are bound as with a rope of sand only. Has not\n Methodism illustrated this? Have not Presbyterianism and\n Lutheranism ? It is not the creed that unites divided hearts, but\n Christ. The Christians afford ample illustration of this. No\n schism has ever appeared in their body. No secession has ever\n shattered their ranks. Individuals have gone forth from them,\n and even many of their ministers, to the regret of the body, have\n stepped down and out.

However, this incongruous rela\u00ac\n tionship proves the possibility of church unity.\n</p>\n<p>\n UNIFYING FORCES.\n</p>\n<p>\n These are many, and but few can be considered. As a chief\n of these we might dwell upon the wish of the pew, the almost\n universal desire of the laity for organic church unity; but more\n to our purpose, in point of argument, is\n</p>\n<p>\n THE VOICE OF THE PULPIT.\n</p>\n<p>\n This voice is very full and emphatic, and we regret that the\n space allotted us is so nearly consumed, that we may not present\n the formidable array at hand. Luther, that grand old veteran,\n who thought of nothing but the reformation of the Catholic\n Church, who hardly dreamed of separation from it until he was\n forced by repeated anathemas out of it, found his feet planted\n firmly upon that Rock whereon is built the Christian Church.\n Hear his voice, and then notice how widely from him and his\n expressed wish his followers have gone.

This principle\n was first in its history, and is first in its philosophy, and is funda\u00ac\n mental to, and underlies, the other two great principles, namely,\n Bible our only creed and Christian our only name. All is the\n effect and result of the adoption of the great practical and\n fundamental principle \u2014 no test of church-fellowship except\n Christian character. What, then, it may be asked, is Christian\n character? We answer, Christian character means Christian\n disposition\u2014affections, heart, and life. But how shall we know\n the hearts and affections of others ? There is no way but by in\u00ac\n ferences drawn from their professions and their lives.\n</p>\n<p>\n Various answers are given to the question, What is the way of\n salvation? But however different the various points of view\n may be, all true answers are harmonious in their essence when\n we properly understand their depths and their interior relations.\n Even in the Scriptures themselves very different answers are\n given, according to the different experiences and different stand\u00ac\n points of the various writers. And between none of them, per\u00ac\n haps, are the differences greater than between St. Paul and St.\n James. And we will on this occasion offer a few suggestions\n toward reconciling those two apparently different views. And\n the explanations offered will come nearer to being truly catholic,\n namely, truly a compromise and reconciliation of the views and\n ideas of the generality of Christians of all ages, \u201corthodox\u201d and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0444/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0444/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0444/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0444/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0444/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0444.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 471271}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"444\">\n<p>\n 388 HARMONY OF ST.

Different objects and different audiences of different parts of\n the Bible.\n</p>\n<p>\n James was writing to rich, Antinomian, worldly, hard-hearted\n Jews, \u201cprofessing\u201d Christianity, yet who were making a bad use\n of Paul\u2019s doctrines of free grace and salvation by faith, and who\n were not under his jurisdiction perhaps. But Paul was attack\u00ac\n ing the strongest citadel of formalism and Judaism; that citadel\n which he had found as strong in his own honest but unconverted\n heart; a citadel strong in the hearts of nearly all men who are\n earnestly striving to serve God naturally; namely, salvation by\n honest merit and sincere righteousness\u2014an error which was ac\u00ac\n tually doing much towards entirely checking the progress of the\n church by its ol$l forms and natural spirit among an antiquated\n people.\n</p>\n<p>\n The various books of the Bible were written for two different\n ends, always and both at once; namely, use at the time they\n were written, and use in the future. These books were not\n written giving prominence only to\u2018 ' the time then present, as that\n proportion would be too small; but as it were one half to the\n then present moment, and one half to the future. The advan\u00ac\n tage of that method is, that it 1 is truly historical, and therefore is\n always so much the more convincing, as well as really so much\n the more certain to be understood rightly.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have here only that appearance of contrariety of opposing\n forces, whose real co-existence, under wisdom, produces all life\n and all action, even as the centripetal and centrifugal forces,\n the two kinds of electricity, and many other pairs in nature.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

So\u2014in verse\n fourteen\u2014if a man say he have faith when yet that faith does\n not influence his actual life, then his faith is of the sort that\n will not save him. The apostle is saying these things merely for\n a comparison. Now, continuing the same idea in verse seven\u00ac\n teen: \u201cEven so\u201d that sort of faith which does not produce\n works is \u201cdead.\u201d Now when we speak of the capacities of a\n man, his ability to build steamships, fathom oceans, delve into\n nature, measure stars, etc., we are speaking of a living man, not\n a \u201cdead\u201d one. A dead thing is not only too weak, not only\n weaker than a living thing, but is in several respects a generically\n different sort of thing, not only weaker than the other, but differ\u00ac\n ing from it in some radical respects of constitution; though in\n what exactly the difference consists between a living and a dead\n thing science has not yet definitely found out or expressed.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is a sort of dead good-wishing which we may have for\n others; as, for instance, at a theater, before we know the de\u00ac\n nouement of the plot we may have a sort of good wishing for\n some of the unfortunate \u201cdramatis personce ,\u201d but it amounts to\n nothing. \u201cEven so\u201d at a theater we may lend a sort of tem\u00ac\n porary faith or belief to the transactions presented; or, in read\u00ac\n ing a work of fiction we may, jyea, must give a sort of belief, for\n the time being, to the things told, for they would fail to affect us\n \u25a0if we distinctly bore in mind all the while that the matters before\n us were fictions. But the good-wishing and the faith, in such\n cases, are a different sort of thing from that of real faith which,\n manifesting itself in real life, produces voluntary, beneficent ac\u00ac\n tion, and which both manifests and cultivates good, moral char\u00ac\n acter.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then, in verse eighteen, if one man shows his sort of faith,\n that is merely sentimental and without consequent works, the\n other man would show his sort of faith by his works, to be not\n the merely sentimental or dead sort.

Now, just as good\n intentions are something inward, as related to outward bodily\n actions, just so faith may be considered as something inward, as\n related to other inward intentions and feelings\u2014faith being really\n an ertiotion or state of mind within other emotions or states.\n</p>\n<p>\n And just as intellectual theoretical faith underlies all those\n things, so there is a something that is still more inward underly\u00ac\n ing that faith.

The meaning is that faith is the\n means but good works are the great end.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this life, then, faith is largejy the means to salvation, and\n other good works are the enjoyment and activity of the salvation\n itself.

Nevertheless we may safely say the amount of\n this worth is almost as nothing compared to the amount of the\n gratuity.

But grace is not always par\u00ac\n allel with nature.

Yet after all the real\n truth might be that the truly suitable candidates could be those\n who were most difficult to save, or those whose peculiar natural\n gifts or peculiar receptivity of divine powers might make their\n salvation more honorable or glorious to God or even more useful\n in his kingdom. Everybody employs and pays best those who\n can do the most and the best work for them. But so far as God\n saves those who are most difficult to save he must sometimes\n save those who are among the wickedest; but whether their\n wickedness arises from their own free will chiefly or from tempta\u00ac\n tions and unfortunate circumstances we can not say.\n</p>\n<p>\n At any rate, however, there is reasonable room to believe that\n while men can not attain immortal happiness on the ground of\n absolute worth, being sinners, and their services at best, even if\n they were perfect, being entirely inadequate to so great a reward,\n yet relative individual personal worth before God shall not go\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0452/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0452/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0452/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0452/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0452/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0452.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 477397}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"452\">\n<p>\n 396 HARMONY OF SF JAMES AND ST.

So does James.\n And Paul ' s text for Romans is taken from Habakkuk 2: 4,\n \u201cBehold, his soul that is lifted up is not upright in him, but the\n just shall live by faith.\u201d But Paul, in making the quotation\n (Romans 1 : 17) from Habakkuk, omits the words about the\n \u201csoul that is lifted up,\u201d probably because then as now, when\n pride is spoken of people are more apt to think about petty vani\u00ac\n ties and ostentations of life, of dress, or social position, than\n about that deeper pride of soul which interiorly turns itself away\n from God, with even some feeling of contempt, as if we were\n not dependent on him for every good thing, or with some feeling\n of aversion that we are thus dependent. But Paul doubtless had\n these other words of Habakkuk in his mind, in his text, and\n throughout his epistle to the Romans.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is a part of true humility of soul to feel constantly our de\n pendence on God, even in the little changes of common life.\n James understands this, \u201cGo to, now, ye that say, To-day or\n to-morrow we will go into such a city,\u201d etc. \u201c For that ye ought\n to say, If the Lord will, we shall live, and do this,\u201d etc. (James\n 4:13-16.)\n</p>\n<p>\n The Old Testament\u2014except in Psalms, as was said above\u2014\n speaks little of faith but much of humility. The Psalms, how\u00ac\n ever, speak very much of faith, but in them, instead of having\n the ambiguous and unsatisfactory translation\u2014faith - we have the\n correct rendering, trust\u2014trust in God. True humility of soul\n before God is one of those things alluded to awhile ago, in pass\u00ac\n ing, as being something still more inward even than real spiritual\n faith, being that interior disposition of soul which tends to prompt\n one to trust in God, as and when the intellectual ideas of God\n are presented to the mind through the word or through nature\n and the church.\n</p>\n<p>\n James being a kind of spokesman or chairman of the church\n of the Jews in Jerusalem, his mode of thought is somewhat legal\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0454/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0454/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0454/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0454/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0454/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0454.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 495383}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"454\">\n<p>\n 398 HARMONY OF ST.

This, I\n think, is one of the reasons why we often find so much goodness\n in persons who have not much apparent faith in the Scriptures or\n in the churches. And, indeed, the very same principle is illus\u00ac\n trated in a yet more inwardly curious thing, that among intellect\u00ac\n ual and theoretical believers in the Bible\u2014yea, also, and among\n professing Christians, namely, that the best men, so far as we can\n see, are by no means always those who have the clearest or\n truest views of revelation, nor even those who have the clearest\n views or most joyful hopes of their own personal interest in the\n blessings and promises there taught. Oftentimes the best Chris\u00ac\n tians really are those who pass almost half their time nearly de\u00ac\n spondent of ever living righteously before God, or even of being\n saved at last.

J. B. WESTON.\n</p>\n<p>\n John Burns Weston was born in Madison, Somerset county,.\n Maine, July 6, 1821. He is the oldest surviving son of Stephen;\n and Rebecca Weston. His grandparents were among the earliest\n members of the Christian denomination in that part of Maine.\n His parents were members of the same denomination, his grand\u00ac\n father and father both being deacons. In his fourteenth year he\n was converted, was baptized by Elder Joseph Merrill, and united\n with the Christian Church. His early life was spent in hard\n work on a farm, where he formed his habits of industry. His\n opportunities for schooling were extremely small; but he learned\n \u2018very easily, and by faithful use of such opportunities as he had,\n and by improving his leisure moments at home, he made unusual\n progress in study, standing high in ordinary branches, and study\u00ac\n ing algebra, geometry, trigonometry, surveying, and navigation\n by himself, with his father\u2019s aid. At seventeen he commenced\n teaching school. From eighteen to twenty-two he went to the\n academy when he could be spared from the farm\u2014about four\n terms in all. In this time he prepared for college in Latin and\n Greek, and made proficiency in French and other branches be\u00ac\n sides. His means would not then allow him to go to a college.\n He had attended a Sunday-school from the first organized in the\n town, and from sixteen years of age he was teacher of a class.\n From the time of his conversion, and especially from seventeen\n years of age, he was interested in all religious work\u2014during* re\u00ac\n vivals and at all other times. He had an early impression that\n it was his duty to engage in the ministry, though his timidity led\n him to shrink from it. This conviction became so strong that in\n 1843, before he was twenty-two, he united with the Maine Cen\u00ac\n tral Conference and was approved as a licentiate. In August of\n that year he accepted a call to a small church in West Newbury,\n Massachusetts. He was ordained in 1844, and continued at.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0457/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0457/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0457/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0457/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0457/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0457.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 402405}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"457\">\n<p>\n 401 *\n</p>\n<p>\n /..

They never have seen, and so they can not\n conceive of, church oneness without them; just as in the out\u00ac\n break of our civil war European nations looked for our downfall.\n They had never seen the success of a nation without a crowned\n head, and they could not conceive it possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n But let us understand the question. It is very different from\n the question whether truth is important or whether it is of any\n consequence what one believes. Truth is important; and within\n the scope of any man\u2019s search it should be sought for as hidden\n treasure. The truth which bears upon true and Christ-like liv\u00ac\n ing, which relates to the good of the bodies, and minds, and\n souls of men, is of essential importance. It should be earnestly\n sought and firmly held. Indifference is without excuse. It is\n of consequence what a man believes. Truth is better than error,\n even in the most trivial matter. In many things one\u2019s belief\n determines his life. Error sometimes leads to moral and social\n ruin. Erroneous theories are often a palsy upon spiritual power,\n a fatal hindrance to individual or associated success. These\n things are conceded; but they do not touch the point at issue.\n To understand our question we need to consider what is meant\n by \u201ca creed-statement\u201d and what is meant by \u201c church suc\u00ac\n cess.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n One\u2019s creed is his belief. A creed-statement is a statement of\n belief. The term is generally applied to religious belief. Every\n one has some belief on religion and religious topics. It is well\n to have some decided belief - a belief which can be stated in terms\n well defined. So far a creed is justifiable. Not to have one in\u00ac\n dicates an inexcusable thoughtlessness on most important themes.\n Religion is a matter of faith and has to do with .things the most\n vital of all which pertain to human interest. It takes hold of\n the most sacred duties and relations which pertain to this life\n and the life to come. It challenges thought, feeling, and action.\n No earnest mind can fail to be moved by it.

If they were of any essential service in pro\u00ac\n moting the success of Christianity, certainly this was the period\n for its display. But the fact of history is, that from this time the\n work of making converts to Christ and cultivating godliness,\n love, and benevolent deeds for human welfare grew weak; the\n activities of the church were devoted to disputing on creeds and\n making converts to sects, the spirit of Christ was sacrificed to a\n spirit of rivalry, hatred, and persecution, and the lamp of spirit\u00ac\n ual life burned low in the church, and came near to extinction.\n Creed-statements had been abundantly present, and if our ob\u00ac\n jectors\u2019 position is true, church success should, in logical se\u00ac\n quence, have been equally present. Was it so? Rather the\n reverse was true. Their importance to church success had a\n large trial, but it is safe to say that they acted against it rather\n than for it.\n</p>\n<p>\n True, on the division of the empire, and the grand schism\n between the eastern and western churches the hierarchy in the\n western church, impersonated in the pope, held a wide and pow\u00ac\n erful sway. But who will call ' this period of mediaeval darkness,\n of ignorance, corruption, warfares, murders, and all forms of\n vice and degradation, a period of church success in any true\n -sense ?\n</p>\n<p>\n The period of the Reformation was another instance of what\n we deem church success.

The New Testament and apostolic view of\n Christianity and church work was resumed and a new and suc\u00ac\n cessful impulse was given to the efficiency, not of the Roman\n Church, but of the church of Christ. All Europe felt the thrill\n of the new life; and simple Christianity, instead of priestly rule,\n became a power again among men. What was the element of\n this new success? A new creed-statement or multiplied creed-\n statements? Not at all. The essential point in the Reformation\n of Luther was the holding up of the Bible as the standard in op\u00ac\n position to church authority. To the Bible would Luther bring \u00ab\n all the practices and usages of the church, and wherein they did\n not conform to the divine standard he denounced them. The\n broadest distinction between Protestantism and Catholicism was\n that the one was biblical, the other traditionary; the one main\u00ac\n tained that the Bible should be in the hands of the people, and\n that the right of private judgment should be sacred, the other\n that the authority of the church was paramount, and that the-\n right of interpreting the Bible and making the creeds was vested\n in it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Luther went forth with the open Bible, without any creed-\n statement; and with that as their text-book and guide and the\n embodiment of their faith did he and his co-laborers do their\n grand work for the world. Afterwards some of his followers\n thought it necessary to have a statement of their belief set forth,,\n and Luther, sorely against his judgment, consented to the Augs\u00ac\n burg Council. Then the Augsburg Confession was agreed to\n and proclaimed. The result was that a small portion of those\n whom the new movement had aroused agglutinated around the\n confession and formed the sect of Lutherans. But how shorn\n were they of power as compared with the great ground-swell of\n the whole Reformation, which embraced in it only the spirit of\n Christ and the gospel, with \u201c the Bible only \u201d as the \u201c standard.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The grandest work of the Reformation, then, was done with\u00ac\n out creed-statements and with the Bible alone as the standard.\n</p>\n<p>\n It does not matter how wide from our views of truth some of the\n interpretations of the reformers were.

So a habit of thought has\n been engendered which has rendered it almost impossible in\n many minds to separate, even in idea, the prosperity of the\n cause of Christ from the success of the denomination, or to con\u00ac\n ceive of church success without a creed-statement as a concom\u00ac\n itant.\n</p>\n<p>\n But let us see if there can pot be found among the circum\u00ac\n stances attendant upon the grand successes of the gospel some\n which are uniformly present, and which ought to be taken .as the\n true causes. Take the case of the apostles. What do we find\n among them ?\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. We find them to have been devout believers in the Lord\n * Jesus Christ as a savior from sin. By this faith they had been\n</p>\n<p>\n led to forsake their own sins, and in their hearts and lives they\n had been converted to him. The spirit of Jesus dwelt in them\n and actuated them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. They believed the teaching of Jesus and the doctrine of\n the New Testament, of which, under God, they were the authors.\n This embraces the statement of faith which we have given above\n as our own. Inspired by love to man as well as love to God;\n believing that men of all nations were sinners and that Jesus had\n died for them all, the righteous for the unrighteous, to bring\n them to God; that in him was everlasting life and out of him\n there was no salvation\u2014they went forth with a large-souled con\u00ac\n secration and an undaunted zeal to win Christ and win souls to\n Christ. And the Spirit of God went with them. They did not\n count their lives too dear to be sacrificed in their work; and,\n feeling themselves debtor to Jew and to Greek, they went every\u00ac\n where on their mission of love and salvation.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. They had a firm faith in the resurrection and a future\n state. Christ had brought life and immortality to light to them\n through the gospel, and they accepted it. Life to them was a\n reality whose issues were comprehended by eternity alone. Sin\n to them was a fearful destroyer, working ruin to a soul whose\n destiny was eternal. Possessed by such convictions they were\n wonderfully in earnest in preaching the gospel of salvation and\n proclaiming Jesus as man\u2019s only hope and all-sufficient Savior.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0476/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0476/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0476/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1187, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1906}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0476/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2374, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3813}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:go:sp:el:se:rm:on:sb:yc:00:co:an:gospelsermonsbyc00coan:gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0476/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/go/sp/el/se/rm/on/sb/yc/00/co/an/gospelsermonsbyc00coan/gospelsermonsbyc00coan_0476.jp2", "height": 3813, "width": 2374, "levels": 6, "size": 523955}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"476\">\n<p>\n 418 IS A CREED-STATEMENT NECESSARY ?\n</p>\n<p>\n 4 .
