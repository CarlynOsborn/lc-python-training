No little artistic\n ability was manifested in some of the efforts essayed. The\n entertainments consisted chiefly of readings, vocal and instru-\n mental music, burlesque acting, lectures, etc. Several original\n poems, written on board the ship, were delivered. One of these,\n by the Rev. C. H. Beale, of Centre Moriches, L. I., was particu-\n larly pleasing, being extremely bright.\n</p>\n<p>\n Among the many ways in which the hours of the day were\n spent by the gentlemen was in playing \u201c shuffle board,\u201d a game\n very extensively practised by sailors, and requiring considerable\n dexterity to succeed well at it. A steady eye and a strong wrist\n are necessary to play it well. I will not attempt a detailed de-\n scription of it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of course a great deal of writing was done by members of\n the party. The majority of persons who go to Europe com-\n mence to keep a journal as soon as they step on the deck of the\n steamer that is to carry them over. I believe it is estimated\n that three-fourths of all who attempt to make a record of their\n doings and seeings while traveling in this country, signally fail\n to do so. Some drop off very quickly, others linger for a few\n weeks, but the few only succeed in the undertaking which is so\n fruitful of satisfaction and enjoyment when completed, but the\n production of which is attended with much hard labor. On\n board the \u201c Devonia\u201d there was the usual quota of journal-keep-\n ers. Quite a number have fallen by the wayside already, others\n show unmistakable signs of weariness in their well-doing, and\n the rest sharpen their pencils, when asked if they intend to keep\n up their writing during the entire trip, with an air which seems\n to say, \u201c Keep it up?

It was at Greenock that I obtained my first im-\n pression of English railroad trains. I had frequently read\n of them, but was not prepared to behold such comical-looking,\n dirty \u201ccoops.\u201d The cars are much smaller and lighter than those\n used in America, and are divided into compartments, each one\n of which accommodates six persons, who sit facing each other,\n three on a side. I was agreeably disappointed, when the train\n commenced to move, at the freedom from jar which was notice-\n able. I must say I never rode so comfortably for an hour in a\n train at home as I did during this my first trip in an English car.\n Subsequently I have learned that all the cars here are not such\n ill-looking, dirty things, as was the one I first sat in. Some of\n them are very elegantly painted and luxuriously upholstered.\n There are three classes of conveyances on every road; and the\n third class being for the poor people, a very small price is\n charged for riding in them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Glasgow is about an hour\u2019s travel from Greenock. We did\n not stop in this city, so famous for its shipping, but, changing\n cars, pushed on to Edinburgh by the way of the lakes. The ride\n through the Trossachs by carriage was delightful. We rode in\n high vehicles that resemble jaunting-cars in style, but are con-\n siderably larger; and the spirited horses attached to them\n wl dried us along through a region charmingly picturesque and\n replete with romance.\n</p>\n<p>\n Arriving at Loch Katrine we embarked on the .steamer \u201c Rob\n Roy,\u201d and for an hour enjoyed a sail on its waters. Leaving\n the steamer at Stronachlachar, we went by coach to Inversnaid,\n where we dined at one of those fine mountain hotels where\n everything that is served is so delicious. Subsequently we en-\n joyed a twenty-mile sail on that famous and lovely Scottish\n sheet of water of whose beauty poets have so often sung, \u2014 Loch\n Lomond. Its praise has not been sounded too highly. It merits\n all that has ever been said of it, and volumes would be required\n to contain this. Situated in a valley, surrounded on all sides\n by high hills and mountains, dotted with islands, its shores\n studded with beautiful residences, it is indeed an ideal spot,\n delightfully romantic.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u25ba\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:sw:ri:tt:en:du:00:cl:ar:letterswrittendu00clar:letterswrittendu00clar_0016/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 299, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 475}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:sw:ri:tt:en:du:00:cl:ar:letterswrittendu00clar:letterswrittendu00clar_0016/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 599, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 951}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:sw:ri:tt:en:du:00:cl:ar:letterswrittendu00clar:letterswrittendu00clar_0016/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1198, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1902}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:sw:ri:tt:en:du:00:cl:ar:letterswrittendu00clar:letterswrittendu00clar_0016/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2396, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3804}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:sw:ri:tt:en:du:00:cl:ar:letterswrittendu00clar:letterswrittendu00clar_0016/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/le/tt/er/sw/ri/tt/en/du/00/cl/ar/letterswrittendu00clar/letterswrittendu00clar_0016.jp2", "height": 3804, "width": 2396, "levels": 6, "size": 514274}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"16\">\n<p>\n \u25c4\n</p>\n<p>\n *\n</p>\n<p>\n 10 LETTERS.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is needless to say that the sail on Loch Lomond was fruitful\n of exquisite pleasure. We left the steamer at Balloch Pier, and\n seated ourselves in the train for Edinburgh? which we reached\n about half -past six o\u2019clock. I will not speak of the ride by rail\n from Greenock to Edinburgh, of the surprises that constantly\n unfolded themselves, but will only say that the objects passed,\n the towns gone through, abounded in interest, and we gazed\n upon the rapidly changing scenes with unalloyed pleasure. Two\n nights and a day were given us in the famous city of Edin-\n burgh, the capital of Scotland, which is situated on a cluster of\n eminences a mile and a half south of the Frith of Forth \u2014 an\n arm of the sea which is here about six miles in breadth. The\n country around Edinburgh is a happy blending of hill and plain.\n</p>\n<p>\n The fields are very fertile, well cultivated, and ornamented with\n gardens and villas. Twelve hundred years ago, Edwin, a king\n of Northumbria, built a fort on the rocky height on which the\n castle of Edinburgh now stands, and hence, as is alleged, arose\n the name of Edwinsburgh, or Edinburgh. The population of\n Edinburgh, with its suburbs, is estimated at two hundred and\n sixty thousand. It abounds in places of interest, the principal\n of which our party visited, in the charge of old and experienced\n guides. A bird\u2019s-eye view of Edinburgh, to any one who has\n even a smattering of geology, suggests at once the primeval\n means by which it has become so picturesque. The first place\n a stranger usually goes to is the castle, which is replete with\n interest and romance. The castle is an immense stone structure,\n situated upon a rock three hundred and eiglity-three feet above\n the level of the sea, and its battlements towering above the city\n may be seen in some directions for fifty miles. The rock is\n very precipitous on all sides but the east, and before the inven-\n tion of artillery it must have been impregnable. In the south-\n east corner of the castle, is an old palace built by Queen Mary\n in 1565. On approaching the castle from the only accessible\n side, the Half-Moon Battery first strikes the eye. Salutes are\n fired from this battery on royal holidays and occasions of na-\n tional rejoicing; and daily, at one o\u2019clock, the time gun is fired\n from the same platform, by a wire stretching over the city from\n</p>\n<p>\n \u25ba \u00ab \u2014 \u25ba \u25c4\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:sw:ri:tt:en:du:00:cl:ar:letterswrittendu00clar:letterswrittendu00clar_0017/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 306, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:sw:ri:tt:en:du:00:cl:ar:letterswrittendu00clar:letterswrittendu00clar_0017/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 612, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:sw:ri:tt:en:du:00:cl:ar:letterswrittendu00clar:letterswrittendu00clar_0017/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1224, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1907}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:sw:ri:tt:en:du:00:cl:ar:letterswrittendu00clar:letterswrittendu00clar_0017/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2449, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3814}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:sw:ri:tt:en:du:00:cl:ar:letterswrittendu00clar:letterswrittendu00clar_0017/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/le/tt/er/sw/ri/tt/en/du/00/cl/ar/letterswrittendu00clar/letterswrittendu00clar_0017.jp2", "height": 3814, "width": 2449, "levels": 6, "size": 469189}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"17\">\n<p>\n *\n</p>\n<p>\n LETTERS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 11\n</p>\n<p>\n the Royal Observatory on Calton Hill.

The jewels\n were securely inclosed in a kind of cage of upright iron bars,\n and guarded by an officer.

The pious queen of Malcolm Canmore prob-\n ably built the chapel, and certainly worshiped in it during her\n residence in the castle till her death in 1093. Beside the chapel\n is \u201c Mons Meg,\u201d an enormous gun, supposed to have been built\n under the direction of James IV., who in 1498 employed it at\n the siege of Nordham Castle. It was rent in 1680 when firing\n a salute, since which time it has been useless. The balls which\n were fired in it were large stones of about two and one-fourth\n feet diameter. Some of these are now piled alongside of\n Meg. The castle is now occupied by soldiers, a large portion\n of it being used for barracks.

Until the Reformation it was a collegiate\n church, dedicated to St. Giles, the patron saint of the town. It\n was provided with thirty-six altars, and had nearly one hundred\n clergymen and other attendants. At the Reformation all this\n was swept away, and for a while its ministrations were con-\n ducted by John Knox, the eminent Scotch reformer. The\n church is a massive structure, and now three separate services\n are held in it at the same time on Sundays. In the tower is a\n chime of bells which are played daily at one o\u2019clock.\n</p>\n<p>\n Near St. Giles\u2019 is John Knox\u2019s house. It is shown for a small\n fee, and is well worth seeing. The house is in a good state\n of preservation. Over the door is the inscription, \u201c Lufe God\n abuf all, and ye nychtbour as yiself .\u201d The window from which\n Knox addressed the multitude was looked out of by us with\n peculiar interest. The great reformer died here in the sixty-\n seventh year of his age, November 24, 1572. I forgot to say that\n it was in St. Giles\u2019 Church, on the memorable day in 1637 when\n the obnoxious liturgy of Laud was to be introduced into Scot-\n land by authority, that Jennie Geddes threw her stool at the\n head of the dean. The famous stool is preserved in the Anti-\n quarian Museum. It was well, for ' the dean that the stool\n missed its mark, as it is very heavy.\n</p>\n<p>\n In an old churchyard which we visited, lie the remains of\n Robert Ferguson, Adam Smith, and Dugald Stewart.

It was projected in 1816, and the idea was to\n reproduce an exact model of the Parthenon at Athens. The\n project was received with such enthusiasm that \u00a36,000, about\n -$30,000, was subscribed at the first public meeting held for its\n promotion. Various circumstances occurred to chill the patri-\n otic ardor, and the monument has never been finished, and\n probably no addition will ever be made to it. The foundation\n stone was laid in 1822, and the entire amount subscribed was\n spent in the erection of three colossal steps and twelve columns.\n Various proposals have been made for the completion of the de-\n sign, but they have not come to any practical issue. Many per-\n sons are of the opinion- that, as a matter of taste, the monument\n is more picturesque as it stands.

Many of the niches in the monument are\n occupied by statues of the most familiar characters in Scott\u2019s\n novels and poems, and a Scott museum is in process of forma-\n tion in an apartment immediately above the great central arch.\n The monument fronts the house in which David Hume, the\n historian, died. The monument is viewed by all strangers as a\n model of art.

The monks first\n settled here were a community of the Cistercian order. They\n were given to agricultural and pastoral pursuits, and their\n primitive mode of life was simple and frugal. In course of\n time their manners degenerated, so that, as the old ballad\n says : \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c The monks of Melrose made fat kail\n On Fridays, when they fasted,\n</p>\n<p>\n And wanted neither beef nor ale\n As long\u2019s their neighbors\u2019 lasted.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The monastery was founded in 1136, and was ten years in\n building.

Its greatest length is about four hundred feet, and\n two of its towers rise to the height of two hundred and twenty-\n five feet. After entering the abbey, turn whichever way you\n will, you are constantly reminded that England\u2019s choicest dust\n rests here, for innumerable memorials are to be seen on every\n hand, marking the spot where remains are buried. Portions of\n the abbey are set apart into what are called chapels, in which\n tombs have been erected. The oldest of the chapels is that of\n St. Edward the Confessor. It contains, besides the monument\n to its founder, those of many other monarchs. The most ele-\n gant tomb-chapel is that of Henry VII. It is most exquisitely\n carved on every side. Here is the tomb of Edward III., who\n died in 1377. Upon it rests his effigy, with the shield and\n sword which he carried in France, \u2014 a big, two-handled affair,\n seven feet long, and weighing eighteen pounds. In one chapel\n is a beautiful tomb erected to Mary Queen of Scots, and near it\n is another erected by King dames I. to Queen Elizabeth, bear-\n ing the recumbent effigy of that sovereign, supported by four\n lions. Queen Mary (\u201cBloody Mary\u201d), who burned about\n seventy persons a year at the stake during four years of her\n reign, rests here in the same vault.

Every\n part of it is replete with thrilling story. It has witnessed some\n of the blackest and foulest deeds that ever were chronicled. Its\n foundation dates back to Caesar\u2019s time, and the scenes which\n have occurred within its walls invest it with more historic in-\n terest than any other European palace or prison. Shakespeare\n has made this Tower to play a prominent and a bloody part in\n his dramas, and as we walk about in it we can almost fancy we\n see some of the characters he has so vividly drawn, and hear the\n cries of some of the victims who have died here. The Tower\n covers no less than thirteen acres, and inside the inclosure there\n are fourteen towers; namely, the Bell Tower, White, Bloody,\n Beauchamp, Flint, Devereux, Brick, Record, Bowyer, Jewel,\n Constable, Broad, Arrow, and Salt.\n</p>\n<p>\n The guides to the Tower are attired in the costume of the\n yeomen of the guard of Henry the Eighth\u2019s time, and they are\n principally old soldiers who receive the position as a reward for\n bravery or faithful service. The admission to the. Tower is six-\n pence, and an additional sixpence is charged to see the crown\n jewels. One of the first interesting features is the armory,\n where thousands and thousands of weapons \u2014 pistols, swords,\n cutlasses, and bayonets \u2014 are kept, enough to equip a large\n army. Beauchamp Tower has much to attract, for here we\n began to visit the prisons of many an unhappy and unfortunate\n captive. The walls bear many inscriptions, which those who\n were confined there made. In one room is the word \u201cJane\u201d\n cut, which is said to refer to Lady Jane Grey. The autograph\n of Philip Howard, Earl of Arundel, who was beheaded in 1572\n for aspiring to the hand of Mary Queen of Scots, is to be seen\n over a fireplace.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the White Tower is a small room, where Sir Walter Ra-\n leigh wrote his \u201cHistory of the World.\u201d Near by is the block\n and the executioner\u2019s ax, which, in Elizabeth\u2019s reign, severed\n Essex\u2019s head from his body.

The inside of the rooms I found to be\n rather small, and in each sat half a dozen women busily engaged\n in the manufacture of different kinds of lace.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lace-making looks very simple, but it is a most laborious oc-\n cupation, and requires the constant attention of those, who are\n engaged in it. The thread of which the lace is constructed is\n wound on a score of long and slender spools, and it is by the lift-\n ing and moving of these spools that the different patterns are\n wrought.

It is a small place, very prettily situated, but not in\n itself particularly interesting. If it had not been for the poem\n I have referred to, it would never have been widely known.\n Large quantities of wine are made here, and the neighborhood\n abounds in lovely scenery.

Few towns are\n more charmingly situated or possess a more picturesque appear-\n ance. Five times the town has been bombarded, twice reduced\n to ashes, and three times its inhabitants were given over to the\n rapine and plunder of soldiery. Having suffered so much from\n the ravages of war, Heidelberg is now comparatively a modern\n town. The attraction which has the most fascination for the\n tourist is the old castle, a most imposing and magnificent ruin,\n with lofty turrets, great, round towers, terraces, archways, and\n court-yards. It is called the most splendid ruin in all Europe.\n It is a wonderful mingling of fortress and palace. Its foundation\n dates back to the thirteenth century, and fortunes were spent in\n its construction. No modern structure I have ever seen com-\n pares for a moment with this castle in solidity and architectural\n grandeur. As you look upon it in all its vastness, you can hardly\n believe that human agency created it. Here are walls twenty-\n five feet thick, and the rest of the castle is built on the same\n gigantic plan. I cannot, of course, describe in the limits of a\n letter the vast extent and splendor of this castle. One might\n stay here for days and make new discoveries almost hourly.\n The castle is covered with figures of the most beautiful design,\n chiseled out of the solid stone.\n</p>\n<p>\n The eye is bewildered with the profusion of the works of art,\n which are the result of six centuries of labor. The castle is\n situated upon a high hill, only accessible from two points. The\n view from many spots about the grounds is very extensive and\n pleasing. Before leaving the castle I must speak of the wine-\n cellar. Here may be seen barrels as large as cottage houses, in\n which the lordly occupants of the castle kept their wine. One\n of these hogsheads when filled holds two hundred and thirty-six\n thousand bottles. On the top of it, which is reached by a flight\n of stairs, is laid a platform, upon which many a quadrille has\n been danced.\n</p>\n<p>\n The University of Heidelberg is justly and widely celebrated\n as a school of law and medicine, and from its walls many illus-\n trious scholars have gone forth.

All disputes of a serious nature are set-\n tled by a duel, and a student who refuses to fight is ever after\n looked upon with contempt. Indeed, so thoroughly has this idea\n of dueling been engrafted into the German mind, that I doubt if\n one of the eight ' hundred students in the institution would de-\n cline a challenge to meet an opponent.

In consequence of the large tide of tourists\n which sweeps in upon Lucerne each summer, a number of mag-\n nificent hotels have been erected, one of which, the Schweizerhof,\n is regarded as the finest hotel on the continent.

And the subject well merits all that has\n been said in its favor; for it is indeed a charming lake, most\n romantically located at the foot of mountains which tower\n thousands of feet into the air. The lake, besides being called\n Lucerne, is known as the Lake of the Four Cantons. It is con-\n sidered the most beautiful body of water in all Switzerland, and\n the grandeur and beauty of the scenery on every side are height-\n ened by the historical associations connected with the country\n bordering on its waters ; for these cantons are the birthplace of\n Switzerland\u2019s freedom, and the scenes of the struggles of Wil-\n liam Tell and his brave associates.\n</p>\n<p>\n A few miles\u2019 ride on the lake brings you to Tell\u2019s chapel, situ-\n ated upon a rock on the shore, and marking the place where\n Tell sprang out of Gessler\u2019s boat, as is told in the stories of the\n Swiss hero.

From this town a splendid\n view of the Jungfrau, one of the best known of the mountains\n of Switzerland, is obtainable.

Berne is a city of\n bears. That animal is the heraldic emblem of the city, and that\n fact is evident before a person has been there a single hour.\n They may be seen on the city gates in granite, carved out of\n wood by the hundreds in shop-windows, and alive and hungry\n for sweetmeats in the city bear-pits. Berne is a good place to\n buy wood-carvings, cuckoo-clocks, and music-boxes. The town\n has a tower of very old origin, on which is a curious automatic\n clock, a peculiar feature of which is at every hour a troop of\n bears appear in front and march round a wooden platform; a\n cock also crows, and a comical figure strikes a bell with a ham-\n mer. Fortunately we were there on a market-day, when the\n streets were thronged with people, affording us a fine opportu-\n nity for studying the manners, customs, and acts of the Swiss\n peasantry. The streets were lined with booths and stalls, and\n the whole scene looked like a large country-fair. Berne boasts\n of a cathedral two hundred and thirteen feet high, in which is a\n splendid organ, which all who go to the town should be sure to\n hear.\n</p>\n<p>\n Freiburg is a curious town, outwardly and inwardly. Goto\n the upper part of the town, and everybody and everything is\n German ; but in the lower part, everybody and everything is\n French.

One of the soldiers, knowing that his towns-people\n would be anxious to know how the battle went, started for the\n town as soon as the struggle was over, running at the top of his\n speed. On the way he met with an accident, falling down a\n steep embankment, by reason of a twig, which he grasped for\n support, coming out by the roots. He kept on, however, in\n spite of his wounds, and, still clutching the fatal twig, finally\n reached the market-place with only strength enough to shout :\n \u201c Victory ! Victory ! \u201d and fell dead in the midst of his friends.\n The twig was planted, and now the fine old lime-tree stands as\n a beautiful memento of the love and courage of that gallant\n young soldier, and the victory of Morat. This happened in 1481.\n</p>\n<p>\n The cathedral is a Gothic building, dating from 1285, and is\n two hundred and eighty feet in height. The visitor will be\n struck with the remarkable bas-relief over the entrance, \u201c The\n | Last Judgment,\u201d \u2014 an angel weighing mankind in batches, devils\n carting off the condemned, etc., etc. The organ here is one of\n the finest in the world. There are two performances on it daily,\n and a pleasant hour may be spent here listening to its strange and\n marvelous music. Some wonderful wind and storm effects are\n introduced by the organist. The organ has seventy-seven stops,\n and seven thousand eight hundred pipes, some of which are\n thirty-five feet high.\n</p>\n<p>\n The suspension bridge thrown across the river Same is the\n longest in Europe, and is a wonderfully artistic piece of work-\n manship. It has a span of nine hundred and sixty-four feet,\n and its cost was about one hundred and twenty-five thousand\n dollars. It is light and elegant, and yet amazingly strong.\n Across the Gotteron ravine is another bridge seven hundred and\n forty-six feet long, and three hundred and five feet above the\n water. It is fastened into the solid rock, and looks, from its\n slight and delicate make, like a mere chain thrown from one side\n of the gorge to the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n From Freiburg we sped on to Geneva, crossing Lake Leman,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:sw:ri:tt:en:du:00:cl:ar:letterswrittendu00clar:letterswrittendu00clar_0059/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 306, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 476}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:sw:ri:tt:en:du:00:cl:ar:letterswrittendu00clar:letterswrittendu00clar_0059/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 612, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:sw:ri:tt:en:du:00:cl:ar:letterswrittendu00clar:letterswrittendu00clar_0059/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1224, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1907}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:sw:ri:tt:en:du:00:cl:ar:letterswrittendu00clar:letterswrittendu00clar_0059/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2449, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3814}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:sw:ri:tt:en:du:00:cl:ar:letterswrittendu00clar:letterswrittendu00clar_0059/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/le/tt/er/sw/ri/tt/en/du/00/cl/ar/letterswrittendu00clar/letterswrittendu00clar_0059.jp2", "height": 3814, "width": 2449, "levels": 6, "size": 470085}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"59\">\n<p>\n LETTERS .\n</p>\n<p>\n 53\n</p>\n<p>\n the largest sheet of water in Switzerland, and with which every-\n body who has read Byron is familiar.
