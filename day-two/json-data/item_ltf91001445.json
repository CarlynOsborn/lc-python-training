Artistic rules and taste\n are therefore invaluable in their direction, and the stage-man-\n ager should have an eye for color, graceful grouping, and general\n effect. Light and shadow, bright and sombre coloring, must\n be contrasted and combined to make the pictures perfect.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c The first requisite is a frame, which must fit exactly into\n the front of the stage, whether this is a raised platform, or\n merely a parlor. Four pieces of wood, an inch thick, and about\n one foot in width, are neatly joined at the corners, and over the\n entire open space is fastened a coarse black lace, through which\n all the pictures are to be seen. The wooden frame must now\n be covered with glazed cambric, bright yellow in color, which\n is drawn tightly over the wood and fastened securely, being\n neatly drawn over the edges. At regular Intervals fasten large,\n full rosettes of the cambric. It is a great improvement, though\n not necessary, to mix black with the rosettes, and carry a nar-\n row strip of black all round the inner and outer edges of the\n frame.

Queen Elizabeth dressed in\n trained silk dress with high ruff, stands n. pointing to Marie\n Stuart, who holds up her left hand as if deprecating the wrath\n of her cruel cousin. Marie Stuart wears black dress trimmed\n with white wax beads, a square head-dress of black. Pictures\n of these costumes may be found in any history of England.\n</p>\n<p>\n Scene II \u2014 Signing the Death- Warrant. Queen Elizabeth\n sits at the right of a table, which stands in centre of stage, sur-\n rounded by her ladies of honor, who are dressed in similar cos-\n tume to her own. A large man stands behind the table, as if\n urging her to sign the warrant, which she seems unwilling to\n do.\n</p>\n<p>\n Scene III \u2014 Scene of the Execution. The queen kneels beside\n the block, which occupies the centre of the stage. She is en-\n gaged in prayer, and hol ds a small cross. She is attended by\n two gentlemen and three ladies in mourning. A priest at left\n corner of the stage lifts up his hand as if exhorting her. The\n executioner, dressed in red, stands by the block, leaning on a\n long axe. The block is covered with black cloth.\n</p>\n<p>\n Scene IV \u2014 The Execution. In the next scene, the queen has\n laid her head upon the block, and the executioner stands with\n uplifted axe. One of the ladies kneels at the right, and another\n has fallen into the arms of the third as if she had fainted.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0043/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 235, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 391}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0043/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 470, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 782}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0043/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 941, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1564}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0043/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1882, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3129}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0043/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/di/ck/sp/ar/lo/re/xh/ib/00/un/se/dicksparlorexhib00unse/dicksparlorexhib00unse_0043.jp2", "height": 3129, "width": 1882, "levels": 6, "size": 430795}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"43\">\n<p>\n THE TABLEAUX .\n</p>\n<p>\n 87\n</p>\n<p>\n The Lily Maid of Astolat.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this scene, a beautiful blonde lies in the boat with her\n feet toward the bow her hair bangs over the pillow, which is\n richly trimmed with gold paper.

More than\n four hundred years after her death the anniversary of her march\n to the delivery of Orleans was celebrated with much pomp and\n ceremony annually. A procession of citizens visited the scenes\n of the various battles around the city, led by a youth in the\n military dress of the fifteenth century, bearing a white banner;\n and at another portion of the ceremony he was loaded with\n chains to denote the captivity of Joan of Arc.

In the days I refer\n to there was plenty of room for the settlers to spread them-\n selves in, and no doubt they wandered considerably. John\n Smith did. He wandered so much that he fell into the hands\n of a tribe of Indians, who, notwithstanding he politely handed\n them his card, with his name beautifully engraved upon it, col-\n lared him and led him off captive.

The honest farmer boys, beholding for\n the first time so much loveliness, were completely fascinated,\n and they little thought the object of their affections was capable\n of treating both alike with the marks of her preference. One\n summer evening the elder brother determined to offer his heart\n and hand to the fair lady, and was hastening to meet her by\n appointment at a secluded spot by the river-bank. Hearing\n voices he crept up slowly through the thicket of grape-vines,\n and taking off his hat gazed earnestly through the thick\n branches. What was his surprise to see his brother in the most\n earnest conversation with his beloved, who seemed listening\n with delight to his impassioned language. Filled with rage\n and despair he hurried away, seeking only to tear himself from\n the presence of his love, and the sight of his brother\u2019s happi-\n ness. The next morning found him at Boston, where he\n enlisted in the regiment which was on the point of returning\n home to England His hat having been found on the river-\n bank, he was long mourned as dead by his brother, who finally\n married the young lady. On the morning of the 19th of April,\n 1775, the younger brother left his young wife, and assembled\n with the minute men, of which company he was a member. At\n nine o\u2019clock he was stationed on Buttrick\u2019s Hill, and marched\n boldly to the defence of the Old North Bridge, where Capt.\n Davis, the first martyr, fell.

When all\n have been instructed and have practised thoroughly, an attempt\n is made to rehearse the parts all together ; several rehearsals\n will be needed, and at least one full-dress rehearsal, with all\n the 11 properties,\u201d & c., in perfect order, with the incidental\n music and all other accessories carefully attended to.\n</p>\n<p>\n Performers will find, in studying their gestures, an immense\n assistance by practising before a full length mirror, enabling\n them to 11 see themselves as others see them,\u201d and correct many\n an error of which they would otherwise be unconscious.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is considerable difficulty in selecting pantomimes that\n come within the powers of young people, the great majority\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0094/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 241, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 389}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0094/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 483, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 779}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0094/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 967, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1559}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0094/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1935, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3118}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0094/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/di/ck/sp/ar/lo/re/xh/ib/00/un/se/dicksparlorexhib00unse/dicksparlorexhib00unse_0094.jp2", "height": 3118, "width": 1935, "levels": 6, "size": 387094}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"94\">\n<p>\n 88\n</p>\n<p>\n PAELOB PANTOMIMES.\n</p>\n<p>\n being designed for practised professionals, and requiring access-\n ories of scenery and stage arrangements not likely to be within\n the reach of youthful amateurs.\n</p>\n<p>\n The pantomimes inserted here are entirely practical, and can\n be made completely successful, with moderate amateur talent,\n and such u properties \u201d and contrivances as will cause no seri-\n ous embarrassment in their preparation.\n</p>\n<p>\n The action for each performer is given in dialogue style, and\n lays down the directions for the actors in fulfilling their parts ;\n but the manager must be particular to provide u business 77 for\n actors not actually in action, so that all who are in the scene\n are busy.

Then take the club in the left hand, and shake\n the right fist, clenched in a determined manner ; seize the club\n with the right hand firmly, strike a fourth blow, hold up four\n fingers, and nod repeatedly to Albert with a smile of satisfaction.\n When this action is finished, a gentle tap with the foot against\n the barrel will give Jack the u cue \u201d to expose the dummy-\n head, etc. The rest of the play is very easy, and, if well acted,\n will be fully as effective as a more elaborate performance.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0119/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 243, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 388}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0119/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 486, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 777}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0119/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 973, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1554}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0119/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1946, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3108}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0119/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/di/ck/sp/ar/lo/re/xh/ib/00/un/se/dicksparlorexhib00unse/dicksparlorexhib00unse_0119.jp2", "height": 3108, "width": 1946, "levels": 6, "size": 411833}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"119\">\n<p>\n the art exhibition..\n</p>\n<p>\n 113\n</p>\n<p>\n THE ART EXHIBITION.\n</p>\n<p>\n This amusing style of entertainment is of quite modem date.\n It involves a considerable amount of preparation and arrange-\n ment; but, if well got up, it fully repays the time and trouble\n expended in its elaboration.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Art Exhibition, as its name implies, consists of a regu-\n larly printed list of paintings, in imitation of the catalogue of\n an Art Gallery, or Collection of pictures or sculptures, each ar-\n ticle referred to in the catalogue being duly numbered to cor-\n respond with the description in the printed list.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some of these descriptions are embellished with an appro-\n priate poetical quotation, and usually bear the name (imagi-\n nary, of course) of the artist.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Collection does not consist, as might be supposed, of ar-\n tistic paintings, & c., but of articles or objects which wittily and\n ludicrously fulfill the conditions laid down for them in the cat-\n alogue, and display a large amount of ingenuity and inventive\n humor.

Each head\n must be fashioned out of a piece of soft wood, with a sharp pen-\n knife, and then painted with oil- color.\u00ae. Punch\u2019s nose and chin\n may be formed of separate pieces of wood, and then fastened\n on to the face with a little glue. Our artist has drawn a frill- ^\n length figure of Punch, and the faces of the other characters in\n the drama \u2014 namely: 1. Judy; 2. Policeman; 3. Foreigner; 4.\n Ghost; 5. Doctor; 6. Clown; 7.

The success of this really amusing ex-\n hibition depends on carefully avoiding that error, and doing\n thoroughly and intelligently whatever is undertaken. It needs\n very little effort to produce grotesque and laughable effects\n upon the Shadow- Curtain, but to carry out a successful per-\n formance entire, requires more than ordinary care and much\n 1 practice.\n</p>\n<p>\n The first thing to provide is a curtain of white muslin, not too\n thick, but of substance enough to allow no rays of light to pass\n between the threads. The seams must be made with a very\n narrow margin, with close and tightly-drawn stitches, and the\n number of the seams reduced as much as possible by using the\n widest muslin that can be obtained. The size of the curtain\n will depend on the place of exhibition ; in a parlor, the^space\n between the folding or sliding-doors affords a good place for it.\n A surface of six or eight feet wide, and eight or ten high, forms\n a curtain which will answer for small performers ; but for full-\n grown persons it should be larger ; and, where available, an\n area of twelve feet square will not be any too large.\n</p>\n<p>\n The size of the curtain having been fixed upon, and the seams\n sewn, provide a frame a little larger each way than the opening\n to be covered. Secure the curtain to the frame with tacks,\n stretching it sufficiently to take out all folds and creases, and\n fasten the frame firmly against the casing of the door ; this ar-\n rangement makes a neater appearance than making the frame\n to fit inside the door-casing. Just before the commencement ot\n the performance the curtain may be wet evenly with a sponge\n and clean water ; this renders the shadows much sharper and\n more distinct, and cannot well be dispensed with if the material\n of the curtain be thick.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0149/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 240, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 385}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0149/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 481, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 771}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0149/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 962, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1543}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0149/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1925, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3086}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0149/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/di/ck/sp/ar/lo/re/xh/ib/00/un/se/dicksparlorexhib00unse/dicksparlorexhib00unse_0149.jp2", "height": 3086, "width": 1925, "levels": 6, "size": 460816}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"149\">\n<p>\n SHADOW PANTOMIMES.\n</p>\n<p>\n 143\n</p>\n<p>\n The selection and management of the light are matters of the\n highest importance. Whatever kind of light be used, it is nec-\n essary to have a bright and steady flame ; a large, dull, or flick-\n ering light being utterly useless. Where gas is burned in the\n room a flat-flame burner may be fitted to a stand placed on the\n floor, and arranged so that the gas-flame is not more than two\n or three inches from the ground ; in fact, the lower the better.\n The stand can be connected with the nearest gas-fixture in the\n room by means of a flexible tube. In parlors where there is no\n gas the best substitute is a low, flat, tin kerosene-lamp, similar\n to those used in the street-cars ; a glass lamp would involve too\n much risk of breakage and consequent danger of fire.\n</p>\n<p>\n The position of the light is the next point which claims our\n attention. About six feet behind the centre of the curtain\n place a stool or box, whose height is sufficient to clear the top\n of the lamp. This is intended to protect the lamp and affords\n a convenient footing for stepping over the light ; it should,\n therefore, stand firmly, or else be secured to the floor. Just in\n front of this step the lamp is to be placed ; and, for convenient\n reference hereafter, we will call this the u first position.\u201d The\n edge of the flame should be presented toward the curtain, as a\n flat flame, especially if it be a wide one, will make the outline\n of the shadows on the curtain less distinctly defined.\n</p>\n<p>\n Three or four feet behind the footstool, and in a line with the\n centre of the curtain, place another box about two and a half\n feet high, to serve as a stand for the light when needed.

In such cases the light in the\n second position throws shadows more natural, and less dis-\n torted in their proportions, than when used in the first position.\n</p>\n<p>\n The lamp must be managed by a person who gives his undi-\n vided attention to the performance ; he should understand thor-\n oughly what is going to be played, and thus be able to give all\n the necessary stage-directions to the players, who should follow\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0150/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 241, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 389}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0150/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 483, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 779}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0150/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 967, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1559}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0150/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1935, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3118}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0150/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/di/ck/sp/ar/lo/re/xh/ib/00/un/se/dicksparlorexhib00unse/dicksparlorexhib00unse_0150.jp2", "height": 3118, "width": 1935, "levels": 6, "size": 480065}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"150\">\n<p>\n 144\n</p>\n<p>\n SHADOW PANTOMIMES.\n</p>\n<p>\n his orders implicitly. No performance can be successful with-\n out a competent stage-manager, and, least of all, a shadow-pan-\n tomime. In transferring the lamp from one position to the\n other, it must be done very gradually, or the effect on the shad-\n ows caused by its change of place will be too apparent, and\n this must never be attempted without previous practice ; in fact,\n no part of a performance can be made entirely successful in its\n effects without very careful and frequent rehearsal. Colored\n light may be thrown on the curtain by holding a strip of colored\n glass close before the light. Glass of a light color only must\n be used, and perfectly clean ; dark colors deaden the light too\n much. During a performance the shadow-light must be the\n only one allowed to be burning ; all others, both behind the\n curtain and among the audience, must be entirely extinguished.\n</p>\n<p>\n Where it is not convenient to arrange a drop-curtain, the\n light must be masked before the performance commences and\n at its close. A small box, or even a large book, placed close in\n front of the light, will answer, provided it be large enough to\n shade the entire curtain.\n</p>\n<p>\n The means employed, and the effects produced, in a shadow-\n pantomime, are so entirely different from those of a stage-per-\n formance, that a few general directions are indispensable :\n</p>\n<p>\n First, as to the position of the body. The side of the head\n must always be presented to the curtain, as the profile is the\n only shadow that is effective ; even when the rest of a perform-\n er\u2019s body is fronting the curtain, the head should bo turned to\n one side or the other, so as to show its^ profile. He must never\n attempt to look at his shadow ; this throws the face at once out\n of profile ; during rehearsal only is this allowed.\n</p>\n<p>\n When a performer is standing side to the curtain, especially\n with the light in the first position, he must be very careful how\n he manages the shoulder furthest from the curtain ; unless ho\n keeps both his shoulders exactly in a line with the light his\n shadow will be an astonishing one.

When\n both arms are brought forward into shadow they must be held\n near together, and in such position relatively that the shadow\n of the one is not eclipsed by that of the other. If the arms are\n held wide apart the shadow of the one nearest the light will be\n greatly the larger. The same may be said of any articles or\n objects held in the hands ; in order to bring them into shadow\n the hand must always be above or below the object held.\n</p>\n<p>\n Next, as to action. All movements must be well tested by\n rehearsal, as their effects on the shadow -curtain are often\n widely different from what we might be led to expect. If a\n performer wish, for instance, to scratch his head, it must be\n done with the arm well curved to the front ; in any other posi-\n tion the whole of the arm and most of the hand will be obscured\n by the shadow of the body and head. All motions must be\n made parallel with the curtain, or their effect is indistinct or\n entirely lost. Turning round must be done quickly and neatly,\n with an exact and complete reverse of profile. In passing one\n another (a thing which should be seldom done) performers\n should accomplish the movement close together, and rapidly, so\n as to prevent their shadows from getting mixed. When step-\n ping over the light, either toward or from the curtain, it must\n be done sideways, presenting the profile to the light, and with\n a long stride, so as to step down close to the curtain, if going\n on, or clear over the lamp, if going off. Any halting midway\n between the curtain and the light will leave only the lower half\n of the body in shadow, and of colossal proportions; entrance or\n exit over the light should not be too often repeated, but con-\n fined to a performer\u2019s first appearance or final exit, or some\n other occasion when it may be done with good effect.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0152/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 241, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 389}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0152/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 483, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 779}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0152/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 967, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1559}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0152/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1935, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3118}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0152/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/di/ck/sp/ar/lo/re/xh/ib/00/un/se/dicksparlorexhib00unse/dicksparlorexhib00unse_0152.jp2", "height": 3118, "width": 1935, "levels": 6, "size": 551028}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"152\">\n<p>\n 146\n</p>\n<p>\n SHADOW PANTOMIMES.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are very few persons, comparatively speaking, who\n are gifted with a talent for pantomime.

In a shadow the expression of the eye is lost ;\n the working or play of the features is imperceptible ; the only\n really movable portion of the face is the lower jaw, affording the\n means of opening or closing the mouth. If ever you should\n meet with a lucky individual who can really (not metaphorically)\n turn up his nose, engage him for your shadow-pantomime on the\n spot, as one possessing a talent not to be despised.\n</p>\n<p>\n As the facilities for emotional expression are so limited, it\n follows that a shadow-pantomime must depend entirely for suc-\n cess on a rapid succession of thrilling and ludicrous situations,\n all so exaggerated as to be unmistakable in their meaning.\n</p>\n<p>\n Whenever any short dialogue or interchange of ideas occurs,\n between two performers, there is no other way to make it plain\n to the audience than to put your few remarks into words, re-\n peat them silently in your own mind, and accompany them with\n thoroughly appropriate but greatly exaggerated action. This\n is really the secret of all successful pantomimists. Two parties,\n when in apparent conversation, should be careful to speak one\n at a time, as it were ; that is, not to act both at once, but each\n wait for the other to finish what he is about, and then reply to\n it. Hence, the part each performer has to assume must be as\n thoroughly studied beforehand as though it were a stage-comedy;\n and the manager be always ready to prompt (in a low whisper)\n when the actor is at fault ; this, of course, requires perfect order\n and quiet behind the curtain. Nothing should be done in a\n hurry, but, on the contrary, with the greatest deliberation ; un-\n less every action is distinctly and completely performed the\n whole thing degenerates into a confused jumble, utterly unin-\n telligible to the audience.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0153/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 240, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 385}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0153/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 481, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 771}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0153/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 962, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1543}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0153/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1925, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3086}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:ck:sp:ar:lo:re:xh:ib:00:un:se:dicksparlorexhib00unse:dicksparlorexhib00unse_0153/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/di/ck/sp/ar/lo/re/xh/ib/00/un/se/dicksparlorexhib00unse/dicksparlorexhib00unse_0153.jp2", "height": 3086, "width": 1925, "levels": 6, "size": 477888}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"153\">\n<p>\n SHADOW PANTOMIMES.\n</p>\n<p>\n 147\n</p>\n<p>\n All \u201c Properties,\u201d or articles to be used in a performance,\n should be laid down on the floor or on a table, in exactly the\n order in which they will be required, within easy reach of the\n manager, and under his sole control.
