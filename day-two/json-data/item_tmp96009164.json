ON CIVIL AFFAIRS.\n</p>\n<p>\n It will be remembered by the student of\n history that about the middle of the eighteenth\n century a fierce conflict of arms arose between\n Great Britain and France for the mastery of\n American territory. The Canadian settle\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n ments were peopled mostly by French colo\u00ac\n nists, and were under French dominion. The\n colonies lying further South, along tile Atlan\u00ac\n tic coast, were settled chiefly by emigrants\n from Great Britain, with their descendants,\n and were under British rule. In the conflict\n known in the colonies as \u201c the Old French\n War,\u201d Great Britain, aided by her American\n Colonies, was the victor. France lost forev\u00ac\n er all her possessions on this continent. In\n that contest, the American Presbyterian\n Church boldly avowed its sympathy with, and\n allegiance to the British government. In\n proof, we cite the following Pastoral Letter\n to the Churches under the care of the Synod.\n (The Synod was at that time the chief judi\u00ac\n catory of the Church.)\n</p>\n<p>\n Title 2.\u2014 documents on civil affairs.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00a7 45.

The Synod under a sense of\n the present distressed and calamitous state of\n the country, do agree that they will recom\u00ac\n mend to all their congregations to unite in ob\u00ac\n serving the last Thursday of October instant,\n as a day of public humiliation, fasting and\n prayer.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Synod propose further to recommend to\n their congregations to spend part of the last\n Thursday of every month in extraordinary\n prayer, while the present mournful state of\n our public affairs continues.\n</p>\n<p>\n And they do further most ' earnestly recom\u00ac\n mend it to all their members, present and ab\u00ac\n sent, to exert themselves in an extraordinary\n manner, in their several spheres of influence,\n for a general and thorough reformation of\n those crying abominations which seem most\n evidently to have kindled the anger of Heaven\n against this land.\n</p>\n<p>\n And that they would, in their public perfor\u00ac\n mances, frequently explain, and warmly press\n on their hearers the necessity of such a refor\u00ac\n mation in this day.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Synod taking into serious considera\u00ac\n tion the dangerous situation of the public at\n this juncture, by means of a potent, prevailing,\n and cruel enemy; the divided state of these\n colonies; the abounding of profanity, luxu\u00ac\n ry, infidelity, error, and ignorance; the evi\u00ac\n dent suspension of spiritual influences from\n the Church, which is followed with an evident\n insensibility under the judgments as well as\n ordinances of God ; together with other awful\n aspects of Divine Providence; cannot but view\n them as plain demonstrations of his displea\u00ac\n sure.

For not only in the word of\n God should we attend to his divine will, but\n also mark his hand in that providence by\n which he directs the course of human affairs\n with invariable wisdom and paternal good\u00ac\n ness.\n</p>\n<p>\n The faithless French, and their savage\n allies, were lately the rod of divine displea\u00ac\n sure for our many provocations. Under the\n calamities of war, and the wasting ravages of\n Indian cruelty, we were repeatedly brought to\n approach the throne of grace, with solemn\n fasting and prayer; and thereby openly pro\u00ac\n fessed our resolution to forsake the ways of\n sin and turn unto the Lord.

As the firm belief, and habitual recol\u00ac\n lection of the power and presence of the living\n God, ought at all times to posses the minds of\n real Christians, so in seasons of public calam\u00ac\n ity, when the Lord is known by the judgment\n which he executeth, it would be an ignorance\n or indifference highly criminal not to look up to\n him with reverence, to implore his mercy by\n humble and fervent prayer, and, if possible,\n to prevent his vengeance by unfeigned repen\u00ac\n tance.\n</p>\n<p>\n We therefore, brethren, beseech you in the\n most earnest manner, to look beyond the im\u00ac\n mediate authors either of your sufferings or\n fears, and to acknowlege the holiness and jus\u00ac\n tice of the Almighty in the present visitation.\n He is righteous in all his ways, and holy in\n all his works. Affliction springeth, not out of\n the dust. He doth not afflict willingly, nor\n grieve the children of men ; and therefore, it\n becomes every person, family, city, and pro\u00ac\n vince, to humble themselves before his throne,\n to confess their sins, by which they have pro\u00ac\n voked his indignation, and entreat him to pour\n out upon all ranks a spirit of repentance and\n of prayer. Fly also for forgiveness to the\n atoning blood of the great Redeemer the\n blood that speaketh better things than that\n of Abel. Remember and confess not only\n your sins in general, but those prevalent\n national offences, which may be justly con\u00ac\n sidered as the procuring causes of public judg\u00ac\n ments; particularly profaneuess and contempt\n of God, his name, Sabbaths, and sanctuary ;\n pride, luxury, uncleanness, and neglect\n of family religion and government, with the\n deplorable ignorance and security which cer\u00ac\n tainly ought to be imputed to this as their\n principal cause. All these are, among us,\n highly aggravated by the inestimable pi ' ivile-\n ges which we have hitherto enjoyed without\n interruption since the first settlement of this\n country. If, in the present day of distress,\n we expect that God will hear our supplications,\n and intei ' pose for our protection or deliverance\n let us remember, what he himself requires of\n us is, that our prayers should be attended with\n a sincere purpose, and thorough endeavour af\u00ac\n ter personal and family reformation. \u201cIf\n thou prepare thine heart, and stretch out thine\n hand towards him, if iniquity be in thine hand\n put it far away, and let not wickedness dwell\n in thy tabernacles.\u201d\u2014Job xi. 13, 14.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Synod cannot help thinking that this\n is a proper time for pressing all of every rank,\n seriously to consider the things that belong to\n their eternal peace. Hostilities, long feared,\n have now taken place; the sword has been\n drawn in one province, and the whole continent\n with hardly any exception, seem determined\n to defend their rights by force of arms. If, at\n the same time, the British ministry shall con\u00ac\n tinue to enforce their claims by violence, a\n lasting and bloody contest must be expected.\n Surely, then it becomes those who have taken\n up arms, and profess a willingness to hazard\n their lives in cause of liberty, to be prepared\n</p>\n<p>\n for death, which to many must be certain, and\n to every one is a possible or probable event.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have long seen with concern, the circum\u00ac\n stances which occasioned, and the gradual in\u00ac\n crease of, this unhappy difference. As Minis\u00ac\n ters of the gospel of peace, we have ardently\n wished that it could, and often hoped that it\n would, have been more early accommodated.\n It is well known to you, (otherwise it would be\n imprudent indeed thus publicly to profess,)\n that we have notbeen instrumental in inflaming\n the minds of the people, or urging them to acts\n of violence and disorder. Perha; s no instance\n can be given on so interesting a subject, in\n which political sentiments have been so long\n and so fully kept from the pulpit, and even\n malice itself has not charged ' us with laboring\n from the press: but things are now come to\n such a state, that we do not wish to conceal\n our opinions as men and citizens, so the rela\u00ac\n tion we stand in to you seemed to make the\n present improvement of it to your spiritual\n benefit, an indispensable duty.\n</p>\n<p>\n Suffer us then to lay hold of your present\n temper of mind, and to exhort, especially, the\n young and vigorous, by assuring them that\n there is no soldier so undaunted as the pious\n man, no array so formidable as those who are\n superior to the fear of death. There is noth\u00ac\n ing more awful to think of, than that those\n whose trade is war, should be despisers of the\n name of the Lord of hosts, and that they should\n expose themselves to the imminent danger of\n being immediately sent from cursing and cru\u00ac\n elty on the earth, to the blaspheming rage and\n despairing horror of the infernal pit. Let,\n therefore, every one, who from generosity of\n spirit, or benevolence of heart, offers himself\n as a champion in his country\u2019s cause, be per\u00ac\n suaded to reverence the name, and walk in the\n tear of the Prince of the kings of the earth,\n and then he may, with the most unshaken firm\u00ac\n ness, expect the issue either in victory or\n death.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let it not be forgotten, that though for the\n wise ends of his providence it may please God,\n for a season, to suffer his people to lie under\n unmerited oppression, yet in general, we may\n expect, that those who fear and gerve him in\n sincerity and truth, will be favored with his\n countenance and strength. It is the character\n and the privilege of the children of Ged, that\n they call upon him in the day of trouble, and\n he, who keepeth covenant and truth for ever,\n has said, that his ears are always open to their\n cry. VVe need not mention to you in how many\n instances the event in battles, and success in\n war, have turned upon circumstances which\n were inconsiderable in themselves, as well as\n out of the power of human prudence to foresee\n or direct, because we suppose you firmly be\u00ac\n lieve that after all the counsels of men, and\n the most probable and promising means, the\n Lord will do that which seemeth him good;\n nor hath his promise ever failed of its full ac\u00ac\n complishment ; the Lord is with you while ye\n be with him, and if ye seek him he will be\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0007/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 325, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0007/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 650, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0007/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0007/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2602, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0007/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ge/ne/ra/la/ss/em/bl/yi/00/al/le/generalassemblyi00alle/generalassemblyi00alle_0007.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2602, "levels": 6, "size": 735680}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"7\">\n<p>\n 7\n</p>\n<p>\n found of you; but if ye forsake him he will\n forsake you. 2 Ckron xv. 2.\n</p>\n<p>\n After this exhortation, which we thought\n ourselves called upon to give you at this time,\n on your great interest, the one thing needful,\n we shall take the liberty to offer a few advices\n to the societies under our charge, as to their\n public and general conduct; and,\n</p>\n<p>\n First. In carrying on this important strug\u00ac\n gle, let every opportunity be taken to express\n your attachment and respect to our sovereign,\n King George, and to the revolution principles\n by which his august family was seated on the\n British throne. We recommend, indeed, not\n only allegiance to him from duty and princi\u00ac\n ple, as the first magistrate of the empire, but\n esteem and reverence for the person of the\n prince, who has merited well of his subjects on\n many accounts, and who has probably been mis\u00ac\n led into the late and present measures by those\n about him; neither have we any doubt that\n they themselves have been in a great degree\n deceived by false information from interested\n persons residing in America. It gives us the\n greatest pleasure to say, from our own certain\n knowledge of all belonging to our communion,\n and from the best means of information of the\n far greatest part of all denominations in the\n country, that Use present opposition to the\n measures of administration does notin the least\n arise from disaffection to the king, or a desire\n of separation from the parent state. We are\n happy of being able with truth to affirm, that\n no part of America would either have approved\n or permitted such insults as have been offered\n to the sovereign in Great Britain. We exhort\n you, therefore, to continue in the same disposi\u00ac\n tion, and not to suffer oppression, or injury\n itself, easily to provoke you to anything which\n may seem to betray contrary sentiments: let\n it ever appear, that you only desire the pre\u00ac\n servation and security of those rights which\n belong to you as freemen and Britons, and that\n reconciliation upon these terms is your most\n ardent desire.\n</p>\n<p>\n Secondly. Be careful to maintain the union\n which at present subsists through all the colo\u00ac\n nies ; nothing can be more manifest than that\n the success of every measure depends on its\n being inviolably preserved, and, therefore, we\n hope that you will leave nothing undone which\n can promote that end. In particular, as the\n Continental Congress, now sitting at Philadel\u00ac\n phia, consists of delegates chosen in the most\n free and unbiassed manner, by the body of the\n people, let them not only be treated with res\u00ac\n pect, and encouraged in their difficult service\n \u2014not only let your prayers be offered up to\n God for his direction in their proceediugs\u2014\n but adhere firmly to their resolutions ; and let\n it be seen that they are able to bring out the\n whole strength of this vast country to carry\n them into execution. We would also advise\n for the same purpose, that a spirit of candor,\n charity, and mutual esteem, be preserved and\n promoted towards those of different religious\n denominations. Persons of probity and prin\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n ciple of every profession, should be united to\u00ac\n gether as servants of the same Master, and the\n experience of our happy concord hitherto in a\n state of liberty should engage all to unite in\n a support of the common interest; for there is\n no example in history, in which civil liberty\n was destroyed, and the rights of conscience\n preserved entire.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thirdly. We do earnestly exhort and be\u00ac\n seech the societies under our care to be strict\n and vigilant in their private government, and\n to watch over the morals of their several mem\u00ac\n bers. It is with the utmost pleasure we re\u00ac\n mind you, that the last Continental Congress\n determined to discourage luxury in living,\n public diversions, and gaming of all kinds,\n which have so fatal an influence on the morals\n of the people. If it is undeniable that universal\n profligacy makes a nation ripe for Divine judg\u00ac\n ments, and is the natural means of bringing\n them to ruin, reformation of manners is of the\n utmost necessity in our present distress. At\n the same time, as it has been observed by emi\u00ac\n nent writers,that the censorial power,which had\n for its object the manners of the public in the\n nDcient free States, was absolutely necessary\n to their continuance, we cannot help being of\n opinion that the only thing whieh we have\n now to supply the plaee of this is the religious\n discipline of the several sects with respect to\n their own members ; so that the denomination\n or profession which shall take the most effectual\n care of the instruction of its members, and\n maintain its discipline in the fullest vigor,\n will do the most essential service to the whole\n body. For the very same reason the greatest\n service which magistrates, or persons iu au\u00ac\n thority can do, with respect to the religion or\n morals of the people, is to defend and secure\n the rights of conscience in the most equal and\n impartial manner.\n</p>\n<p>\n Fourthly. We cannot but recommend, and\n urge in the warmest manner, a regard to order\n and the public peace; and sis in many places\n during the confusions that prevail, legal pro\u00ac\n ceedings have become difficult, it is hoped that\n all persons will conscientiously pay their just\n debts, and to the utmost of their power serve\n one another, so that the evils inseparable from\n a civil war may not be augmented by wanton\u00ac\n ness and irregularity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Fifthly. We think it of importance at this\n time, to recommehd to all of every rank, but\n especially to those who may be called to action\n a spirit of humanity and mercy. Every battle\n of the warrior is with confused uoise, and gar\u00ac\n ments rolled in blood. It is impossible to ap\u00ac\n peal to the sword without being exposed to\n many scenes of crulty and slaughter; but it is\n often observed that civil wars are carried on\n with a rancor and spirit of revenge much\n greater than those between independent States.\n The injuries received, or supposed, in civil\n wars, wound more deeply than those of foreign\n enemies; it is therefore the more necessary to\n guard against this abuse, and recommend that\n meekness and gentleness of spirit, which is the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0008/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 325, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0008/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 650, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0008/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0008/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2602, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0008/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ge/ne/ra/la/ss/em/bl/yi/00/al/le/generalassemblyi00alle/generalassemblyi00alle_0008.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2602, "levels": 6, "size": 802749}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"8\">\n<p>\n 8\n</p>\n<p>\n /\n</p>\n<p>\n noblest attendant on true valor.

The following points are\n clearly brought out in it-\n</p>\n<p>\n 1.

This has been\n severely censured \u2014 rather denounced. It\n will be a sufficient answer to this charge to\n insert the action of the Old Synod appointing\n a day of prayer for Congress.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00a7 47.

But as\n the Continental Congress are now sitting, who\n may probably appoint a fast for the same pur\u00ac\n pose the Synod, from respect to that august\n body, and for the greater harmony with all\n other denominations, and for the greater pub\u00ac\n lic order, if the Congress shall appoint a day\n not above four weeks distant from the said\n last Thursday of June, order that the Congre\u00ac\n gations belonging to this Synod do keep the\n day appointed by the Congress, in obedience\n to this resolution ; and if they appoint a day\n more distant, the Synod order both to be ob\u00ac\n served by all our communion.

Your militai ' y\n achievemements insured safety and glory to\n America, in the late arduous conflict for free\u00ac\n dom; while your disinterested conduct, and\n uniformly just discernment of the public in\u00ac\n terest, gained you the entire confidence of the\n people: An 1 in the present interesting period\n of public affairs, the influence of your personal\n character moderates the divisions of political\n parties and promises a permanent establish\u00ac\n ment of the civil government.\n</p>\n<p>\n From a retirement more glorious than\n thrones and sceptres, you have been called to\n your present elevated station, by the voice of\n a great and a free people; and with an una\u00ac\n nimity of suffrage that has few, if any exam\u00ac\n ples, in history. A man more ambitious of\n fame, or less devoted to his country, would\n have refused an office in which his honors\n coaid not be augmented, and where they might\n possibly be subject to a reverse. We are hap\u00ac\n py that God has inclined your heart to give\n yourself once more to the public. And we de\u00ac\n rive a favorable presage of the event, from\n the zeal of all classes of the people, and their\n confidence in your virtues ; as well as from the\n knowledge and dignity with which the federal\n councils are filled. But we derive a presage,\n eveu more flattering, from the piety of your\n</p>\n<p>\n character. Public virtue is the most certain\n means of public felicity ; and religion is the\n surest basis of virtue. We therefore esteem\n it a peculiar happiness to behold in our chief\n magistrate, a steady, uniform avowed friend of\n the Christian religion; who has commenced\n his administration in rational and exalted sen\u00ac\n timents of piety; and who, in his private con\u00ac\n duct, adorns the doctrines of the gospel of\n Christ; and on the most public and solemn oc\u00ac\n casions, devoutly acknowledges the govern\u00ac\n ment of Divine Providence.\n</p>\n<p>\n The example of distinguished characters will\n ever possess a powerful and extensive influence\n on the public mind; and when we see in such a\n conspicuous station, the amiable example of\n piety to God, of benevolence to men, and of a\n pure and virtuous patriotism, we naturally\n hope that it will diffuse its influence; and that\n eventually, the most happy consequence* will\n result from it. To the force of imitation, we\n will endeavor to add the wholesome instruc\u00ac\n tions of religion. We can consider ourselves\n as doing an acceptable service to God, in our\n profession, when we contribute to render men\n sober, honest and industrious citizens, and the\n obedient subjects of a lawful government.. In\n these pious labors, we hope to imitate the most\n worthy of our brethren of other Christian\n denominations, and to be imitated by them:\n assured that if we can, by mutual and\n generous emulation, promote truth and virtue,\n we shall render a great and important service\n to the republic; shall receive encouragement\n from every wise and good citizen ; and, above\n all, meet the approbation of our Divine Mas\u00ac\n ter.\n</p>\n<p>\n We pray Almighty God, to have you always\n in his holy keeping.

The committee to whom was re\u00ac\n committed the report on the reference from the\n Presbyteries of Madison and Lancaster, repor\u00ac\n ted, and their report was adopted, and is as\n follows, viz :\n</p>\n<p>\n That said Presbyteries invite the attention\n of the General Assembly to certain slanderous\n reports, extensively circulated against the\n Presbyterian and other denominations, involv\u00ac\n ing the charge of an attempt on the part of\n these denominations to unite Church and state,\n and thus subvert the civil institutions of our\n country; and intimate their desire that this\n Assembly would take order on the subject, and\n by some public act disabuse themselves and\n their constituents of such unfounded and in\u00ac\n jurious imputations. In the opinion of your\n committee, no public act is necessary on the\n part of this Assembly to refute a charge wholly\n unsupported by testimony and facts; nor any\n exposition of their principles in relation to\n civil magistracy, and the claims of the Church,\n demanded, other than that contained in our\n acknowledged ecclesiastical standards, and\n published to the world. For the better infor\u00ac\n mation, however, of any who may be in dan\u00ac\n ger of imposition from unfounded statements,\n the Assembly would refer to the following ' ex-\n hibition of their primcples as contained in the\n accredited Constitution of the Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c1. God the supreme Lord and King of all\n the world, hath ordained civil magistrates to\n be, under him, over the people, for his own\n glory and the public good and to this end hath\n armed them with the power of the sword, for\n the defence and encouragement of them that\n are good, and for t the punishment of evil\n doers.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c2. It is lawful for Christians to accept and\n execute the office of magistrate, when called\n thereunto ; in the managing whereof, as they\n ought especially to maintain piety, justice and\n peace according to the wholesome laws of each\n commonwealth, so for that end, they may law\u00ac\n fully now, under the New Testament, wage war\n upon just and necessary occasions.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c3. Civil magistrates may not assume to\n themselves the administration of the word and\n sacraments; or the power of the keys of the\n kingdom of heaven ; or in the least interfere in\n matters of faith. Yet, as nursing fathers, it is\n the duty of civil magistrates to proftet the\n Church of our common Lord, without giving\n the preference to any denomination of Chris\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n tians above the rest, in such a manner that all\n ecclesiastical persons shall enjoy the full, free,\n and unquestioned liberty of discharging every\n part of their sacred functions without violence\n or danger. And as Jesns Christ hath appoin\u00ac\n ted a regular government and discipline in his\n Church, no law of any commonwealth should\n interfere with, let, or hinder, the due exercise\n thereof, among the voluntary members of any\n denomination of Christians, according to their\n own profession and belief. It is the duty of\n civil magistrates to protect the person and\n good name of all their people, in such an effec\u00ac\n tual ' manner as that no person be suffered,\n either upon pretence of religion or infidelity,\n to offer any indignity, violence, abuse, or in\u00ac\n jury, to any other person whatsoever; and to\n take order that all religious and ecclesiastical\n assemblies be held without molestation or dis\u00ac\n turbance.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c4. It is the duty of the people to pray for\n magistrates, to honor their persons, to pay\n them tribute and other dues, to obey their law\u00ac\n ful commands, and to be subject to their au\u00ac\n thority, for conscience sake. Infidelity or dif\u00ac\n ference in religion, doth not make void the\n magistrate\u2019s just and legal authority, nor free\n the people from their due obedience to him ;\n from which ecclesiastical persons are not ex\u00ac\n empted ; much less hath the Pope any power\n or jurisdiction over them in their dominions,\n or over any of their people; and least of all\n to deprive them of their dominions or lives, if\n he shall judge them to be heretics, or upon\n any other pretense whatsoever.\u201d\u2014Confession\n of Faith, Ch. xxiii.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cSynods and councils are to handle or con\u00ac\n clude nothing, but that which is ecclesiastical;\n and are not to intermeddle with civil affairs\n which concern the commonwealth, unless by\n way of humble petition, in cases extraordina\u00ac\n ry ; or by way of advice for satisfaction of con\u00ac\n science, if they be thereunto required by the\n civil magistrate.\u201d\u2014 lbtd.

Peace is amongst the very highest tem\u00ac\n poral blessing of the Church as well as of all\n mankind ; and public order is one of the first\n necessities of the spiritual as well as the civil\n commonwealth. Peace has been wickedly su\u00ac\n perseded by war, in its worst |form, through\u00ac\n out. the whole land ; and public order has been\n wickedly superseded by rebellion, anarchy,and\n violence, in the whole Southern portion of the\n Union.\n</p>\n<p>\n All this has been brought to pass in a disloyal\n and traitorous attempt to overthrow the Na\u00ac\n tional Government by military force, and to\n divide the nation, contrary to the wishes of\n the immense majority of the people of the na\u00ac\n tion, and without satisfactory evidence that\n the majority of the people in whom the local\n sovereignty resided,even in the States which re\u00ac\n volted, ever authorized any such proceeding,\n or ever approved the fraud and violence by\n which this horrible treason has achieved what\u00ac\n ever success it has had.

The Church of Christ has no authority\n from him to make rebellion, or to counsel trea\u00ac\n son, or to favor anarchy in any case whatever.\n On the contrary, every follower of Christ has\n the personal liberty bestowed on him by Christ,\n to submit, for the sake of Christ, according to\n his own conscientious sense of duty, to what\u00ac\n ever government., however bad, under which\n his lot may be cast. But, while patient suffer\u00ac\n ing for Christ\u2019s sake can never be sinful, trea\u00ac\n son, rebellion, and anarchy may be sinful\u2014\n most generally, perhaps, are sinful; and, pro\u00ac\n bably, are always and necessarily sinful in\n all free countries, where the power to change\n the government by voting, in the place of force\n which exists as a common right, constitution\u00ac\n ally secured to the people, who are sovereign.\n If, in any case, treason, rebellion, and anarchy\n can possibly be sinful, they are so in the case\n now desolating large portions of this nation,\n and laying waste great numbers of Christian\n congregations, and fatally obstructing every\n good word and work in those regions. To the\n Christian people scattered throughout those\n unfortunate regions, and who have been left\n of God to have any hand in bringing on these\n terrible calamities, we earnestly address words\n of exhortation and rebuke, as unto brethren\n who have sinned exceedingly, and whom God\n calls to repentance, by fearful judgments. To\n those in like circumstances who are not charge\u00ac\n able with the sins which have brought such ca\u00ac\n lamities upon the land,but which have chosen in\n the exerci-e of their Christian liberty, to stand\n in their lot and suffer, we address words of\n affectionate sympathy, praying God to bring\n them off conquerors. To those in like circum\u00ac\n stances, who have taken their lives in their\n hands, and risked all for their country and for\n conscience\u2019 sake, we say, we love such with\n all our heart, and bless God such witnesses\n were found in the time of thick darkness. We\n fear, and we record it with great grief, that\n the Church of God, and the Christian people,\n to a great extent, and throughout all the re\u00ac\n volted States, have done many things that\n ought not to have been done, and have left un\u00ac\n done much that ought to have been done, in\n this time of trial, rebuke, and blasphemy; but\n concerning the wide schism which is reported\n to have occurred in manySouthern Synods,this\n Assembly will take no action at this time. It\n declares, however, its fixed purpose, under all\n possible circumstances, to labor for the exten\u00ac\n sion and the permanent maintenance of the\n Church under its care, in every part of the\n United States. Schism, so far as it may exist,\n we hope to see healed. If that cannot be, it\n will be disregarded.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. We record our gratitude to God for the pre\u00ac\n vailing unity of sentiment and general inter\u00ac\n nal peace, which have characterized the Church\n in the States that have not revolted embracing\n a great majority of the ministers, congregations\n</p>\n<p>\n .and people under our care. It may still be call*\n ed, with emphasis, a loyal, orthodox and pious\n Church; and all its acts and works indicate\n its right to a title so noble. Let it strive for\n divine grace to maintain that good report. In\n some respects,the interest of the Church of God\n are very differentjfrom those of all civil institu\u00ac\n tions. Whatever may befall this, or any other\n nation, the Church of Christ must abide on\n earth triumphant even over the gates of hell.\n It is, therefore, of supreme importance that the\n Church should guard itself from internal alie\u00ac\n nations and divisions, founded upon questions\n and interests that are external as to her, and\n which ought not by their necessary workings\n to cause her fate to depend on the fate of things\n less important and less enduring than herself.\n Disturbers of the Church ought not to be allow\u00ac\n ed : especially disturbers of the Church in\n States that never revolted, or that have been\n cleared of armed rebels : disturbers who, un\u00ac\n der many false pretexts, may promote discon\u00ac\n tent, disloyalty, and general alienation, tend\u00ac\n ing to the unsettling of ministers, to local\n schisms, and to manifold trouble Let a spirit\n of quietness, of mutual forbearance, and of rea-\n d} 7 obedience to authority, both civil and eccle\u00ac\n siastical, illustrate the loyal ' y, the orthordoxy,\n and the piety of the Church. It is more es*-\n pecially to ministers of the gospel, and amongst\n them, particularly to any whose first impres\u00ac\n sions had been, on any account, favorable to\n the terrible military revolution which has\n been attempted, and which God\u2019s providence\n lias hitherto so singularly rebuked; that these\n decisive considerations ought to be addressed.\n And in the name and by the authority of the\n Lord Jesus we earnestly exhort all who love\n God or fear his wrath, to turn a deaf ear to all\n counsels and suggestions that tend towards a\n reaction favorable to disloyalty, schism, or dis\u00ac\n turbance either in the Church or in the coun\u00ac\n try. There is hardly anything more inexcus\u00ac\n able connected with the frightful conspiracy\n against which we testify, than the conduct of\n those office-bearers and members of the Church\n who, although citizens of loyal Slates, and sub\u00ac\n ject to the control of loyal Presbyteries and\n Synods, have been faithless to all authority\n human and divine, to which they owed subjec\u00ac\n tion. Nor should any to whom this Deliver\u00ac\n ance may come fail to bear in mind that it is\n not onlv their outward conduct concerning\n which they ought to take heed; but it is\n also, and especially their heart, their temper,\n and their motives, in the sight of God, and to\u00ac\n wards the tree and beneficent civil government\n which he has blessed us withal, and toward\n the spiritual commonwealth to which they are\n subject in the Lord. In all these respects, we\n must all give account to God in the great day.\n And it is in view of our own dread responsibil\u00ac\n ity to the Judge of quick aud dead that we\n now make this Deliverance.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0013/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 325, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0013/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 650, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0013/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0013/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2602, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0013/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ge/ne/ra/la/ss/em/bl/yi/00/al/le/generalassemblyi00alle/generalassemblyi00alle_0013.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2602, "levels": 6, "size": 779247}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"13\">\n<p>\n 13\n</p>\n<p>\n ACT OF 1863.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Lotvrie ' s Paper.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Committee to whom was referred the\n resolution which proposed to raise the flag of\n the United States upon the building in which\n the Assembly is now convened, and to report\n in respect to the \u201cState of tlje Country,\u201d res\u00ac\n pectfully present the following report:\n</p>\n<p>\n Your Ccmmittee believe that the design of\n the mover of the original resolution, and of\n the large majority, who are apparently ready\n to vote for its adoption, is simply to call forth\n from the Assembly a significant token of our\n sympathy with this Government, in its earnest\n efforts to suppress a rebellion that now for\n over two years has wickedly stood in armed re\u00ac\n sistance to lawful and beneficent authority.\n But as there are many among us who are un\u00ac\n doubtedly patriotic ; who are willing to ex\u00ac\n press any righteous principle to which this\n Assembly should give utterance, touching the\n subjection and attachment of an American citi\u00ac\n zen to the uuionandits inst itutions who love the\n the flag ot our country, and rejoice iu its succes\u00ac\n ses by sea aud by land; and who yet do not es\u00ac\n teem this particular act a testimonial of loyalty\n entirely becoming to a church court,\u2014and as\n many of these brethren, by the pressing of this\n vote, would be placed in a false position, as if\n they did not love the Union, of which that flag\n is thebeloved symbol, your Committee deem\n themselves authorized,by the subsequent direc\u00ac\n tion of the Assembly, to propose a different ac\u00ac\n tion to be adopted by this venerable court.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is well known, on the one hand, that the\n General Assembly has ever been reluctaut to\n repeat its testimonies upon important matters\n of public interest; but, having given utterance\n to carefully considered words, is content to\n abide calmly by its recorded deliverances.\n Nothing that this Assembly can say can more\n fully express the wickedness of the rebellion\n that has cost so much blood aud treasure ; can\n declare in plainer terms the guilt before God\n and man, of those who have inaugurated, or\n maintained, or countenanced, for so little\n cause, this fratricidal strife; or can more im\u00ac\n pressively urge the solemn duty of the Gov\u00ac\n ernment to the lawful exercise ot its authority,\n and of the people, each in his several place,\n to uphold the civil authorities, to the end that\n law and order may again reign throughout\n this entire nation\u2014than these things have al\u00ac\n ready been done by previous Assemblies. Nor\n need this body declare its solemn rebukes to\u00ac\n wards those ministers and members of the\n church of Christ, who have aided in bringing\n on and sustaining these immense calamities ;\n or tender our kind sympathies to those who\n are overtaken by troubles they could not avoid,\n and who mourn and weep in secret places, not\n unseen by the Father\u2019s eye; or reprove all\n wilful disturbers of the public peace; or exhort\n those that are subject to our care, to the care\u00ac\n ful discharge of every duty tending to uphold\n the free and beneficent government under\n</p>\n<p>\n which we are, and this specially for conscience\n sake, and as in the sight of God\u2014more than,\n in regard to all these things, the General As\u00ac\n sembly has made its solemn deliverances,\n since these troubles began.\n</p>\n<p>\n But, on the other hand, it may be well for\n this General Assembly to reaffirm, as it now\n solemnly does, the great principles to which\n utterance has already been given. We do this\n the more readity, because our beloved church\n may thus be understood to take her deliberate\n and well-chosen stand, free from all imputa\u00ac\n tions of haste or excitement; because we re\u00ac\n cognize an entire harmony between the du\u00ac\n ties of the citizen, (especially in a land where\n the people frame their own laws, and choose\n their own rulers,) and the duties of the Chris\u00ac\n tian to the great Head of the Church; because\n indeed, least of all persons, should Christian\n citizens even seem to stand back from their\n duty, when bad men press forward for mis\u00ac\n chief; and because a true love for our country,\n in her times of peril, shoul forbid us to with\u00ac\n hold an expression of our attachment, for the\n insufficient reason that we are not accustomed\n to repeat our utterances.\n</p>\n<p>\n And because there are those among us who\n have scruples touching,the propriety of any de\u00ac\n liverance of a church-court respecting civil\n matters, this Assembly would add, that all\n strifes of party politics should indeed be ban\u00ac\n ished from our ecclesiastical assemblies, and\n from our pulpitg; that Christian people should\n earnestly guard aginst promoting partizan di\u00ac\n visions ; and that the difficulty of accurately de\u00ac\n ciding,in some cases, whatare generaland what\n party principles, should make use areful in our\n judgments; but that our duty is none the less\n imperative to uphold the constituted authorities\n because minor delicate questions may possibly\n be involved. Rather, the sphere of the church\n is wider and more searching, touching matters\n of great public interest, than the sphere of the\n civil magistrate, in this important respect \u2014that\n the civil authorities can take cognizance only\n of overt acts ; while the law of which the\n church of God is the interpreter, searches the\n heart, makes every man subject to the civil\n authority, for conscience\u2019 sake, and declares\n that man truly guilty, who allows himself to\n be alienated, in sympathy and feeling, from\n any lawful duty, or who does not conscien-\n tioua\u2019y prefer the welfare, and especially the\n preservation of the government, to any party\n or partisan ends. Officers may not always\n command a citizen\u2019s confidence; measures may\n by him be deemed unwise; earnest, lawful\n efforts may be made for changes he may think\n desirable ; but no causes now exist to vindicate\n the disloyalty of American citizens towards\n the United States government.\n</p>\n<p>\n The General Assembly would not withhold\n from the government of the United States, that\n expression of cordial sympathy which a loyal\n people should offer.

Some of the very first notes of war, as you\n qre aware, issued from the pulpits of the Old\n</p>\n<p>\n School Presbyterian Church. Dr. Thornwell\n and Palmer were universally recognized as\n the leaders of the body, and their voice upon\n all questions was most potential. On the 21st\n of Nov. 1860, in Columbia, S.C., Dr. Thornwell,\n from the pulpit, discussed the theory of the Gov\u00ac\n ernment, and the relations between the States\n and Federal Government, and advocated the\n political doctrine of States Rights. Dr. Pal\u00ac\n mer, from his pulpit, in New Orleans, took for\n his theme that it was the Providential trust of\n the South \u201cto conserve and perpetuate the insti\u00ac\n tution of slavery as now existing,\u201d \u201cwith the\n right unchanged by man to go and root itself\n wherever Providence and nature may carry\n it;\u201d and urges the fulfilment of this trust \u201cin\n the face of the utmost possible peril.\u201d \u201cShould\n the madness of the hour appeal to the arbitra\u00ac\n tion of the sword we will not shrink even from\n the baptism of. fire.\u201d He then review ' s the\n condition of political parties, and urges Seces\u00ac\n sion as an immediate and imperative duty. I\n allude to these celebrated sermons because they\n were such potential agencies in precipitating\n the political catastrophe which followed. They\n werfc widely circulated as campaign documents\n the religious papers of the South, almost with\u00ac\n out exception, echoed their call, and the several\n Presbyteries, one after another, stood prepared\n to renounce all allegiance to the United States\n and transfer to the Confederate States.\n</p>\n<p>\n On December 3d, 1860, months before the\n war commenced, the Synod of South Carolina\n declared, \u201cThat Synod has no hesitation, there\u00ac\n fore, in expressing the belief that the people of\n South Carolina are now called upon to imitate\n their Revolutionary forefathers and stand up\n for their rights.

It assumed in all its proceed\u00ac\n ings that the political bonds which had joined\n them to the United States were sundered, and\n fhat the Confederate States were an indepen\u00ac\n dent government. Their action throughout\n implicitly\u2014their letter to all the Churches\n throughout the world explicitly\u2014recognized\n the Confederate States as an actual and right\u00ac\n ful government, thus deciding as a Church the\n the political question then in dispute and un\u00ac\n settled between them and the United States,\n the decision of which had been committed by\n both parties to the final arbitrament of the\n sword. In the Narrative adopted by that As\u00ac\n sembly they say, \u201cIn the first place we notice\n the relation of our congregations to the great\n struggle in which we are engaged. All the\n Presbyterial Narratives without exception men\u00ac\n tion the fact, that their congregations have\n evinced the most cordial sympathy with the\n people of the Confederate States, in their ef\u00ac\n forts to maintain their cherished rights and\n institutions against the despotic power which\n is attempting to crush them. Deeply convinc\u00ac\n ed that this struggle is not alone for civil\n rights and property and home, but also for\n religion, for the Church, for the Gospel, for\n existence itself, the- Churches in our connec\u00ac\n tion have freely contributed to its prosecution\n of their substance, their prayers, and above\n all, of their members and the beloved youth\n of their congregations. The Assembly desire\n to record with its solemn approval this fact of\n the unanimity of our people in supporting a\n contest to which Religion, as well as Patrio\u00ac\n tism, now summons the citizens of this coun\u00ac\n try, and to implore for them the blessing of\n God in the coursejthey are now pursuing.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It is a singular instance of the influence of\n times of great excitement in swerving men\n from the most cherished principles of their\n lives, and one which ought to teach us char\u00ac\n ity for each other, that our Southern brethren\n who had so long and loudly declared that sla\u00ac\n very was a political question, with which the\n Church might not intermeddle, should pro\u00ac\n claim to the world, as they did in 1864, that\n \u201cit is the peculiar mission of the Southern\n Church to conserve the institution of slavery.\u201d\n And we submit that ou* affirmation is made\n good\u2014all Evangelical Churches in the coun\u00ac\n try, both North and South, during the recent\n troubles, took precisely the same ground as our\n General Assembly.\n</p>\n<p>\n We next quote from Dr. E- P. Humphrey*s\n address before the Presbytery of Louisville,\n delivered in the Chestnut Street Church, Lou\u00ac\n isville, July 12, 1866.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Great Issues Stated.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is proper to state at the outset that Dr.\n ffm. L. Breckinridge and myself were mem\u00ac\n bers of the last General Assembly of our\n Church. The Presbytery of Louisville, now\n in session here, has desired that both of us\n shall appear before it at this time, in explana\u00ac\n tion of the present position of our ecclesias\u00ac\n tical affairs. I regret to say that my distin\u00ac\n guished friend, Dr. Breckinridge is detained\n at home by sickness, and cannot therefore ap*-\n pear with me on this occasion. I have been\n greatly strengthened in my personal convict\u00ac\n ions upon this whole subject by the fact that\n mine are his convictions also; and I need not\n tell the people of this city how much rever\u00ac\n ence is due to that singularly pure and upright\n man\u2014that faithful servant of the Church. All\n this increases my regret that we are deprived\n at this time of his presence and the wisdom of\n his counsels. Unhappily, in this discussion\n our own brethren are our opposers \u2014 many\n of whom we have trusted and loved, whom\n we still love, and will love to the end. This\n fact ought to restrain ns from the use of\n language unbecoming the Christian minister\n in a discussion with his brethren. I desire to\n bear this in mind. It will be my endeavor, in\n what I have to say, to make, not a controversial\n speech, but a plain and simple explanation. I\n offer you not a dispute, or even an argument,\n but a statement of the case.\n</p>\n<p>\n NATURE OF THE QUESTION.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let me here say that this discussion turns\n not upon the doctrines of grace, or the way of\n salvation, or on the ordinances of worship, or\n ou the frame of Church government; but sim\u00ac\n ply upon certain acts of the Assembly touch\u00ac\n ing the late civil war.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is not on the one hand a political, nor on\n the other a strictly doctrinal question; but it is\n eccesiastical, a question of Church law and\n polity. And the remarkable fact is that the\n strifes which now agitate our Church root\n themselves in two issues, both of which are\n dead. The late rebellion is one\u2014that has\n ceased; slavery is another\u2014that too is extir\u00ac\n pated forever. It is a humiliating reflection\n that Christians, and even Christian ministers\n should be found fighting over the grave in\n which those old things that have passed away\n are about to be hidden.

The radical princi\u00ac\n ples are these:\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. The Church and the State are, both of\n them, ordinances of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The province of each is separate and\n distinct. The Church exists for the salvation\n of sinners\u2014the State for the temporal welfare\n of its citizens. The Church ought not to be\n predominant over the State, which is pure pa\u00ac\n pacy ; nor subordinate to the State, which is\n Erastianism; nor simply tolerated bv the State,\n which is semi-Erastianism ; but wholly inde\u00ac\n pendent of the State, which is the American\n theory.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Subjects which are purely secular in their\n nature belong exclusively to the State. Ques\u00ac\n tions of the tariff, of banks, income taxes,\n suffrage, the army and navy, and the like, fall\n undei the sole jurisdiction of the State, and\n any attempt on the part of the Church to de\u00ac\n termine them ought to be resisted. So, also,\n subjects which are purely spiritual belong ex\u00ac\n clusively to the .Church. Questions of reveal\u00ac\n ed religion, such as the doctrine of the Trini\u00ac\n ty and the Atonement, the mode of worship,\n the sacraments, and the way of Church gov\u00ac\n ernment, and the like, fall under the jurisdic\u00ac\n tion of the Church; and any attempt of the\n State to meddle with them ought to be rebuked.\n But there are subjects which may be called\n mixed , being in some of their aspects secular\n and in other aspects religious. Here the rule\n is obvious. In mixed cases all those aspects\n which are secular beloug to the State, and\n must be determined by the civil tribunal; all\n those aspects which are spiritual belong to the\n Church, and must be turned over to the eccle\u00ac\n siastical courts.\n</p>\n<p>\n APPLICATION OF THIS DOCTRINE.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now apply these principles to the position\n of our Church towards the late rebellion.\n That was a mixed case. In all its secular as\u00ac\n pects, the rebellion belonged to the Govern\u00ac\n ment. The difficult and much disputed consti\u00ac\n tutional questions, the powers and duties per\u00ac\n taining to Congress and to the courts of justice\n and to the Executive, the organization and con\u00ac\n trol cf the army and navy, the mode of deal\u00ac\n ing with slavery and the writ of habeas corp\u00ac\n us and martial law, as war questions all these\n belonged to the State, and it would have been\n an impertinence in the Church to meddle with\n them. But the rebellion presented aspects\n purely moral and religious. Obedience to the\n powers that be and that are ordaiued of God\n submission to lawful and constitutional author\u00ac\n ity, the duty of the civil magistrate to enforce\n the laws,the duty of Christians not to obstruct or\n hinder, but to aid and assist the magistrate in\n this high office\u2014these were the moral and reli\u00ac\n gious aspects of the civil war, and as such they\n belonged to the Church. So long as no moral\n questions were involved in the contest, the\n Church had nothing whatever to do with it;\n but the moment that questions of right and\n</p>\n<p>\n wrong, of obedience to God, of immutable and\n eternal morality, emerged from the crash of\n arms, then instantly the Church was called on\n to speak out. I would not give offense to any,\n but I must tell you the truth. Our Church\n considered the rebellion wrong in point of\n morals, a sin against God, and for that reason\n it took jurisdiction of the case in that aspect\n of it Not that all who went into the rebellion\n were guilty of immorality and known sin. I\n do not say that. The question of personal sin\u00ac\n fulness depends upon a variety of circumstan\u00ac\n ces\u2014upon knowledge of God\u2019s Word, upon the\n point of view from which the facts are exam\u00ac\n ined, and upon the inward intent and motive.\n I am not now speaking of men. I judge no\n man. But I am considering the thing itself in\n its own inherent nature; and I repeat that our\n Church held the rebellion to be morally wrong,\n and on that ground the General Assembly con\u00ac\n demned it year by year. For proof of the fact\n that the Assembly followed this clear and dis\u00ac\n criminating doctrine of its proper functions, I\n refer you to a paper adopted by the St. Louis\n Assembly. Here is an extract: \u201cIn regard to\n our deliverances on these subjects (slavery and\n the rebellion), the Assembly here contents it\u00ac\n self as sufficient with declaring that it has but\n exercised the constitutional right and duty of\n the Assembly, which has been constantly ex\u00ac\n ercised from the time of our fathers; who made\n the Constitution of our Church to utter its senti\u00ac\n ments, warnings and exhortations on all poin ts\n and questions which, while we are properly\n restrained from invading the jurisdiction of\n civil tribunals, do nevertheless belong to that\n class of questions which we may handle, viz:\n those moral and religious questions, although\n they may embrace points in which politics,\n whether in their larger or lesser sense, are\n involved; because while relating to civil and\n political affairs, they are also questions of re\u00ac\n ligious duty, and cannot be thrown out of the\n religious jurisdiction.\u201d This is the Assembly\u2019s\n own exposition of the subject.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE HISTORICAL ARGUMENT.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nor, let me further explain, is the doctrine or\n the practice under it a novelty in our Church.\n About the middle of the last century, the French\n entered into a conspiracy with the savages of\n this Western country, the bloody and brutal\n purpose of which was to exterminate the white\n settlement of the West. The struggle that fol\u00ac\n lowed is known as the Old French War. Brad-\n dock s defeat, and the cruelties inflicted by the\n savages who were taken as prisoners, occurred\n in 1755. Our highest Church judicatories at\n that time were the Synod of New York and the\n Synod of Philadelphia. These two Synods\u2014\n the first in 1755 and the second in 1757\u2014took\n into consideration \u201cthe dangerous condition of\n the country,\u201d \u201cthe melancholy condition of the\n British (or American) colonies and their al\u00ac\n lies.\u201d denounced, in so many words, the \u201ccruel,\n potent and prevailing enemy,\u201d and \u201cthe shock\u00ac\n ing depredations and barbarities of the heathen\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0022/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 325, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0022/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 650, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0022/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0022/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2602, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0022/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ge/ne/ra/la/ss/em/bl/yi/00/al/le/generalassemblyi00alle/generalassemblyi00alle_0022.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2602, "levels": 6, "size": 873814}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"22\">\n<p>\n 22\n</p>\n<p>\n on our borders, influenced and attended by the\n perfidious, restless enemies of our civil and re\u00ac\n ligious liberties.

And in the distribution of the\n honors which posterity will award to our\n Church, in this immortal story, a large share\n will fall to the Presbyterians in Virginia and\n the Carolinas and Georgia. When I remember\n that this Church had, from time immemorial,\n taught her sons to reverence our institutions\n as ordained of God, I do not wonder that they\n sought her blessing when they rushed to arms\n in the late civil war. I think a Church with\n such a historical crown upon her august and\n venerable brow may be pardoned if she lifted\n up her majestic form and shook out to the light\n her unsullied aud radiant jewels and then\n gave her blessing to these gallant boys.

See\n minutes of 1864, p, 297.\n</p>\n<p>\n The above analysis we believe covers the\n whole ground, and fairly develops every contes\u00ac\n ted principle involved in the successive deliv\u00ac\n erances of the Assembly on Slavery and the\n State of the Country. And we here distinctly\n repeat the ground we take: That there is not\n a principle involved in all these acts , which is not\n likewise involved in the ancient testimonies and\n deliverances of the Presbyterian Church! First,\n as to the principle that the Church has author\u00ac\n ity to teach men the duty of allegiance to a\n particular government. In 1766, the General\n Synod\u2014which twenty-two years afterwards\n became the General Assembly\u2014addressed a\n \u201c Pastoral Letter\u201d to the churches and people\n under its care, on the occasion of the \u201crepeal\n of the Stamp Act.\u201d Let the historic period be\n carefully noted. The storms of revolution were\n gathering. Great Britain had entered upon\n that, course of unjust legislation which ended\n in the independence of the American colonies\n Men already began to talk freely of renounc\u00ac\n ing their allegiance to the mother country.\n The Stamp Act, so justly odious to Americans,\n had through the influence of a few noble men\n in the British Parliament, been lately repealed.\n Whereupon this \u201cPastoral Letter,\u201d whLh clo\u00ac\n ses in the following language : \u201cWhile we thus\n call upon you to fear God, you will not forget\n to honor your King, and pay a due submission\n to his august parliament. * * *\n</p>\n<p>\n We most earnestly recommend it to you to\n encourage and strengthen the hands of the\n government, to demonstrate on every proper\n occasion your undissembled love for your mo\u00ac\n ther country, and your attachment to her true\n interest, so inseparably connected with your\n own. That thus you may become wise and\n good as well as free and happy, and that while\n you enjoy liberty, civil and religious, you may\n not be the servants of sin and Satan, is the\n fervent prayer of those who watch for your\n souls as men who must give an account.\u201d El-\n lihu Spencer, Moderator.\u201d Now note; this\n Pastoral Letter\u2014this \u201cancient testimony\u201d of\n</p>\n<p>\n the Church\u2014delivered just one hundred years\n ago\u2014enjoins upon its people the duty of alle\u00ac\n giance to the British Throne and Parliament.\n And that too not in the \u201cpiping times of peace,\u201d\n but when the storms of war were brooding !\n This is precisely similar to what was done by\n the General Assembly of the same Church in\n 1861\u2014nearly a century later.\n</p>\n<p>\n The principle involved is the same in both\n cases, to wit: the authority of the Church to\n teach men the duty of obedience to a particular\n civil government. And for this act the \u201cDec\u00ac\n laration and Testimony\u201d charges the Assembly\n with going to the very verge of apostasy !\n</p>\n<p>\n Who has departed from the \u201cold land\u00ac\n marks ?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It will be observed that this Pastoral Letter\n was prepared several years before the Declara\u00ac\n tion of Independence. Afterwards, when Bri\u00ac\n tish aggression had forced the colonies to ab\u00ac\n solve their allegiance to the British Crown, the\n Presbyterian Church cordially supported the\n cause of their country. Of this, their records\n gave unequivocal evidence.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our Confession of Faith.\n</p>\n<p>\n The public mind has become quite familiar\n of late with the fourth section, thirty-first\n chapter, of our Confession of Faith, which\n reads as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cSynods and Councils are to handle or con\u00ac\n clude nothing, but that which is ecclesiastical;\n and are not to intermeddle with civil affairs\n which concern the commonwealth, unless by\n way of humble petition in cases extraordina\u00ac\n ry; or by way of advice for satisfaction of\n conscience, if they be thereunto required by\n the civil magistrate.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The use made of this clause in our Stand\u00ac\n ards, by the Declaration and Testimony party,\n is to prove that the General Assembly, and the\n church generally, have violated this part of\n the Constitution ; and to that extent have de\u00ac\n parted from \u201cthe old landmarks.\u201d But there\n are certain portions of the Confession of\n Faith which we observe the brethren of this\n way of thinking never quote, or even allude\n to. And what makes this omission appear\n the more singular, is the fact that there are\n parts of the Confession which do teach, with\n exact particularity, upon the very questions\n in controversy. The matters in dispute\n tftnongst us have reference chiefly to these two\n questions: first, what are the duties of Chris\u00ac\n tians in the matter of citizenship? And\n second, what limits are prescribed to the\n Church, in teaching and enforcing these du\u00ac\n ties? These are precisely the questions about\n which they say the Assembly and the Church\n have erred so egregiously; and they are,\n moreover, precisely the subjects upon which\n our Standards teach very clearly and explicit\u00ac\n ly. Why then are these parts of our Book\n never quoted\u2014never even alluded to, in their\n discussions? Without attempting to answer\n the question, we propose to quote some of the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0025/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 325, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0025/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 650, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0025/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0025/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2602, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0025/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ge/ne/ra/la/ss/em/bl/yi/00/al/le/generalassemblyi00alle/generalassemblyi00alle_0025.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2602, "levels": 6, "size": 723059}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"25\">\n<p>\n 25\n</p>\n<p>\n passages bearing on these important topics.\u2014\n Con. of Faith , ch. xxm, sec. 1 and 2 \u201cOf the\n Civil Magistrate.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n I. \u201cGod, the Supreme Lord and King of all\n the world, hath ordained civil magistrates to\n be under him over the people, for his own\n glory and (he public good, and to this end,\n hath armed them with the power of the sword,\n for the defense and encouragement of them\n that are good, and for the punishment of evil\u00ac\n doers.\n</p>\n<p>\n II. \u201cIt is lawful for Christians to accept and\n execute the office of a magistrate, when called\n thereunto ; in the managing whereof, as they\n ought especially to maintain piety, justice and\n peace, according to the wholesome laws of\n each Commonwealth, so, for that eud, they\n may lawfully, now under the New Testament,\n wage war upon just and necessary occasions.\u201d\n Again, \u201cIt is the duty of civil magistrates to\n protect the person and good name of all their\n people,\u201d & c.\u2014Sec. III. And again, \u201cIt is the\n duty of the people to pray for magistrates, to\n honor their persons, and to pay them tribute\n and other dues, to obey their lawful com\u00ac\n mands, and to be subject to their authority for\n conscience\u2019s sake\u201d.\u2014Sec. IV.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the Larger Catechism we have an expo\u00ac\n sition of the fifth commandment. The an\u00ac\n swer to question 124, defines those embraced\n in it, besides \u201cnatural parents,\u201d to be \u201ces\u00ac\n pecially such as by God\u2019s ordinance are over\n us in place of authority, whether in family,\n church or commonwealth ' \u2019 The answer to ques\u00ac\n tion 127, defines the honor due to these supe\u00ac\n riors, thus, \u201call due reverence in heart, word\n and behavior; prayer and thanksgiving for\n them; imitation of their virtues and graces;\n willing obedience to their lawful commands\n and councils; due submission to their correc\n tions,\u201d & c. Answer to question 128, defines\n the \u201csins\u201d against superiors (civil magistrates\n included) to be, \u201call neglect of the duties re\u00ac\n quired toward them ; envying at, contempt of,\n and rebellion against, their persons andplrces,\n in their lawful commands, counsels, and cor\u00ac\n rections,\u201d & c. The duties of \u201csuperiors\u201d are\n also defined to be, \u201cdiscountenancing, reprov\u00ac\n ing and chastising such as do ill,\u201d & c. And\n their sins, \u201ccareless exposing, or leaving\n them to wrong, temptation and danger/ ' & c.\n</p>\n<p>\n Such is the teaching of our Standards re\u00ac\n specting the duties of the civil magistrate, and\n of good citizenship. Now, we will cheerfully\n surrender the use of our columns to any one\n who will point out exactly wherein our Church\n has gone beyond these plain directions of her\n Constitution, in her late deliverances. Of\n course we always except that part of the act\n of 1861, which was ambiguous, and which\n was modified by the act of 1862. This latter\n act declared it to be the duty of the \u201ccivil\n magistrate\u201d to maintain the authority of the\n government by the sword. For this it has\n been denounced as a \u201cgospel of blood.\u201d But\n our Standards say the Christian magistrate\n may \u201clawfully wage war upon just and neces\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n sary occasions.*\u2019 Moreover, it is his duty to\n \u201cchastise such as do ill;\u201d and he is guilty oi\n sin , if he fails in this duty, and thereby ex\u00ac\n poses the people to wrong and danger. Again\n we ask, wherein has the Church violated her\n Constitution? We go farther, and ask, would\n she not violate her Constitution, in its spirit\n and letter, if she failed to teach men their\n duty in these matters? For this Constitution\n is her system of doctrine\u2014her accepted inter\u00ac\n pretation of the word of God\u2014which she is\n bound by solemn vows to receive and teach\n</p>\n<p>\n In conclusion we make briefly two observa\u00ac\n tions: (1) It is plain from the above extracts\n from our Standards, that the framers of them\n did not understand it to be \u201cintermeddling\n with civil affairs which concern the Common\u00ac\n wealth,\u201d or \u201chandling or concluding things\n not ecclesiastical,\u201d when they taught that the\n civil magistrate might lawfully wage war;\n that it is the duty of Christian citizens to pray\n for him, obey him, and maintain his authori\u00ac\n ty ; and that it is a sin not to perform these\n duties, and to rebel against him. Evidently\n they did not consider these things as belong\u00ac\n ing to the State exclusively, and that they had\n no right to handle them. For we see how\n plainly they did handle them.\n</p>\n<p>\n (2) The Fathers of the Presbyterian Church\n in this country, interpreted these Standards in\n the same way that we have done. They de\u00ac\n cided that the struggle of the American colo\u00ac\n nies for independence was one of those \u201cjust\n and necessary occasions\u201d on which the civil\n magistrate might \u201clawfully wage war;\u201d that\n it was the duty of their people to support the\n Continental Congress, and maintain its au\u00ac\n thority, & c.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Old Scotch Church\u2014the mother of us\n all\u2014carried the application of this doctrine\n to the extent of deposing men from the minis\u00ac\n try for being engaged in rebellion.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is perfectly evident, therefore, that our\n Declaration and Testimony brethren, whether\n right or wrong, have themselves departed\n from the \u201cold landmarks.\u201d They, not we, are\n following after new doctrines.\n</p>\n<p>\n II.

They\n are copied from Baird\u2019s Digest.\n</p>\n<p>\n J. The first formal action on the subject\n was in 1787, and is as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe following was brought in by the Com\u00ac\n mittee of Overtures:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe Creator of the world having made of\n one flesh all the children of men, it becomes\n them, as members of the same family, to con\u00ac\n sult and promote each other\u2019s happiness. It\n is more especially the duty of those who main\u00ac\n tain the rights of humanity, and who acknowl\u00ac\n edge and teach the obligations of Christiani\u00ac\n ty, to use such means as are in their power to\n extend the blessings of equal freedom to eve\u00ac\n ry part of the human race\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cFrom a full conviction of these truths, and\n sensible that the rights of human nature are\n too well understood to admit of debate, Over\u00ac\n ture\u2019d, that the Synod of New York and Phila\u00ac\n delphia recommend, in the warmest terms, to\n every member of their body, and to all the\n Churches and families under their care, to do\n everything in their power consistent with the\n rights of civil society, to promote the abolition\n of slavery, and the instruction of negroes,\n whether bond or free.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Synod, taking into consideration the\n overture concerning slavery, transmitted by\n the Committee of Overtures last Saturday,\n came to the following judgment:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe Synod of New York and Philadelphia\n do highly approve of the general principles in\n favor of universal liberty, that prevail in\n America, and the interest which many of the\n States have taken in promoting the abolition\n of slavery; yet, inasmuch as men introduced\n from a servile state to a participation of all\n the privileges of civil society, without a prop\u00ac\n er education, and without previous habits of\n industry, may be, in many respects, danger\u00ac\n ous to the community, therefore they earnestly\n recommend to all the members belonging to\n their communion, to give those persons who\n are at present held in servitude such good ed\u00ac\n ucation as to prepare them for the better en\u00ac\n joyment of freedom; and they moreover\n recommend that masters, wherever they find\n servants disposed to make a just improvement\n of the privilege, would give them a peculium,\n or grant them sufficient time and sufficient\n means of procuring their own liberty at a\n moderate rate, that thereby they may be\n brought into society with those habits of in\u00ac\n dustry that may render them useful citizens;\n and. finally, they recommend it to all their\n people to use the most prudent measures, con\u00ac\n sistent with the interest and ihe state of so\u00ac\n ciety, in the counties where they live, to pro\u00ac\n cure eventually the final abolition of slavery\n</p>\n<p>\n in America.\u201d\u2014 Minutes , May 28th, 1787, p.\n</p>\n<p>\n 510\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1793 the General Assembly re affirmed\n this deliverance in the following terms: \u201c Or\u00ac\n dered, that the records of the General Synod\n of the year 1787, on the subject of Slavery,\n be published among the extracts to be print\u00ac\n ed of the proceedings of this Assembly.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The next action ha3 reference to the ques\u00ac\n tion of communing with slaveholders; Ought\n those who are guilty of holding slaves to be\n admitted to the communion table? Ought\n Christians to commune with such? It will be\n seen that this question was introduced from\n the Presbytery of Transylvania , Kentucky .\n Let those who charge \u201cradicalism\u201d on the\n present members of the Synod of Kentucky\n bear this fact in mind. The following is the\n action adopted with the letter to Transylvania\n Presbytery:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cA serious and conscientious person, a\n member of a Presbyterian congregation, who\n views the slavery of the negroes as a moral\n evil, highly offensive to God, and injurious to\n the interests of the gospel, lives under the\n ministry of a person, or amongst a society of\n people who concur with him in sentiment on\n the subject upon general principles, yet for\n particular reasons hold slaves, and tolerate\n the practice in others. Over lured, ought the\n former of these per ons, under the impressions\n and circumstances above described, to hold\n Christian communion with the latter?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAfter due deliberation, it was\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c1.

it. exhibits rational, accountable, and im\u00ac\n mortal beings in such circumstances as scarce\u00ac\n ly to leave them the power of moral action.\n It exhibits them as dependent on the will of\n others, whether they shall receive religous in\u00ac\n struction;

whether they\n shall preserve their chastity and purity, or\n regard the dictates of justice and humanity.\n Such are some of the consequences of slavery\n \u2014consequences not imaginary, but which\n connect themselves with its very existence.\n The evils to which the slave is always ex\u00ac\n posed often take place in fact, and in their\n very worst degree and form; and where all of\n them do not take place, as we l ' ejoice to say in\n many instances, through the influence of the\n principles of humanity and religion on the\n mind of masters, they do not\u2014still the slave\n is deprived of his natural right, degraded as a\n human being, and exposed to the danger of\n passing into ihe hands of a master who may\n inflict upon him all the hardships and injuries\n which inhumanity and avarice may suggest.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cFrom this view of the consequences re\u00ac\n sulting from the practice into which Chr ' stian\n people have most inconsistently fallen, of en\u00ac\n slaving a portion of their brethren of man\u00ac\n kind\u2014for \u2018God hath made of one blood all na\u00ac\n tions of men to dwell on the face of the earth,\u2019\n \u2014it is manifestly the duty of all Christians\n who enjoy the light of the present day, when\n the inconsistency of slavery, both with the\n dictates of humanity and religion, has been\n demonstrated, and is generally seen and ac\u00ac\n knowledged, to use their honest, earnest, and\n unwearied endeavors, to correct the errors of\n former times, and as speedily as possible to\n efface this blot on our holy religion, and to\n obtain the complete abolition of slavery\n throughout Christendom, and if possible\n throughout the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n (c) \u201cWe rejoice that the Church to which we\n belong commenced as early as any other in\n this country, the good work of endeavoring to\n put an end to slavery, and that in the same\n work many of its members have ever since\n</p>\n<p>\n been, and now are, among the most active,\n vigorous, and efficient laborers. We do. in\u00ac\n deed, tenderly sympathise with those portions\n of our Church and our country where the\n evil of slavery has been entailed upon them;\n where a great, and the most virtuous part of\n the community abhor slavery, and wish its\n extermination as sincerely as any others\u2014\n but where the number of slaves, their ignor\u00ac\n ance, and their vicious habits generally, ren\u00ac\n der an immediate and universal emancipation\n inconsistent alike with the safety and happi\u00ac\n ness of the master and the slave. With those\n who are thus circumstanced, we repeat that\n we tenderly sympathise. At the same time,\n we earnestly exhort them to continue, and if\n possible, to increase their exertions to effect a\n total abolition of slavery. We exhort them\n to suffer no greater delay to take place in this\n most interesting concern, than a regard to the\n public welfare truly and indispensably de\u00ac\n mands.\n</p>\n<p>\n (d) \u201cAs our country has inflicted a most\n grievous injury upon the unhappy Africans,\n by bringing them into slavery, we cannot in\u00ac\n deed urge that we should add a second injury\n to the first, by emancipating them in such\n manner as they will be likely to destroy them\u00ac\n selves or others. But we do think that our\n country ought to be governed in this\n matter by no other consideration than\n an honest and an impartial regard\n to the happiness of the injured party, un\u00ac\n influenced by the expense or inconvenience\n which such a regard may involve. We, there\u00ac\n fore, warn a ' l who belong to our denomina\u00ac\n tion of Christians, against unduly extending\n this plea of necessity,; against making it a\n cover for the love and practice of slavery, or\n a pretense for not using efforts that are lawful\n and practicable, to extinguish this evil.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAnd we, at the same time, exhort others to\n forbear harsh censures, and uncharitable re\u00ac\n flections on their brethren, who unhappily live\n among slaves whom they cannot immediately\n set free; but who, at the same time, are real\u00ac\n ly using all their influence, and all their en\u00ac\n deavors, to bring them into a state of freedom,\n as soon as a door for it can be safely opened.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHaving thus expressed our views of slave\u00ac\n ry, and of the duty indispensably incumbent\n on all Christians to labor for its complete ex\u00ac\n tinction, we proceed to recommend, and we\n do it with all the earnestness and solemnity\n which this momentous subject demands, a\n particular attention to the following points:\n</p>\n<p>\n (e) \u201cWe recommend to all our people to\n patronize and encourage the Society lately\n formed, for colonizing in Africa, the land of\n their ancestors, the free people of color in our\n country.

Much less can they be attained by\n those indiscriminate denunciations against\n slaveholders, without regard to their charac\u00ac\n ter or circumstances, which have to so great\n an extent characterized the movements of\n modern abolitionists, which so far from re\u00ac\n moving the evils complained of, tend only to\n perpetuate and aggravate them.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe apostles of Christ sought to ameliorate\n the condition of slaves, not by denouncing\n and excommunicating their masters, but by\n teaching both masters and slaves the glorious\n doctrines of the gospel, and enjoining upon\n each the discharge of their relative duties.\n Thus only cau the Church of Christ, as such,\n</p>\n<p>\n now improve the condition of the slaves in\n our country.\n</p>\n<p>\n (A) \u201cAs to the extent of the evils involved\n in slavery, and the best methods of removing\n them, various opinions prevail, and neither\n the Scriptures nor our constitution authorize\n this body to prescribe any particular course\n to be pursued by the churches under our care.\n The Assembly cannot but rejoice, however, to\n learn that the ministers and churches in the\n slaveholding States are awaking to a deeper\n sense of their obligation to extend to the\n slave population generally the means of grace,\n and many slaveholders not professedly re\u00ac\n ligious favor this object. We earnestly exhort\n them to abound more and more in this good\n work. We would exhort every believing mas\u00ac\n ter to remember that his Master is also in\n heaven, and in view of all the circumstances\n in which he is placed, to act in the spirit of\n the golden rule; \u2018Whatsoever ye would that\n men should do to you, do ye even so to them.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018 In view of the above stated principles and\n facts,\n</p>\n<p>\n Resolved , 1.

The tendency\n is evidently to separate the northern from the\n southern portion of the Church; a result\n which every good citizen must deplore, as\n tending to the dissolution of the Union of our\n beloved country, and which every enlightened\n Christian will oppose as bringing about a\n ruinous and unnecessary schism between\n brethren who maintain a common faith.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The yeas and nays being ordered, were re\u00ac\n corded.

The consideration of the report of\n the Synodical Committee. The committee of\n Synod on the subject of slavery laid before\n Presbytery the following plan for the moral\n and religious instruction and future emanci\u00ac\n pation of slaves, (viz. 1.) We would recom\u00ac\n mend that all slaves now under 20 years of\n age, and all those yet to be born in our pos\u00ac\n session, be emancipated as they severally\n REACH THEIR 25th YEAR.\n</p>\n<p>\n (2.) We recommend that deeds of emanci\u00ac\n pation be now drawn up and recorded in our\n respective county courts, specifying the slaves\n whom we are about to emancipate and the\n age at which each is to become free. This\n measure is highly necessary, as it will furnish\n to our own minds, to the world, and to our\n slaves, satisfactory proof of our sincerity in\n this work; and it will also secure the liberty\n of the slave against all contingencies.\n</p>\n<p>\n (3.) We recommend that our slaves, be in\u00ac\n structed in the common elementary branches\n of education.\n</p>\n<p>\n (4.) We recommend that strenuous and\n persevering efforts be made, to induce them\n to attend regularly upon the ordinary services\n of religion, both domestic and public.\n</p>\n<p>\n (5.) We recommend that great pains be\n taken to teach them the holy scriptures, and\n that to effect this, the instrumentality of Sab\u00ac\n bath Schools when ever they can be enjoyed,\n be united with thafe^f domestic instruction.\n</p>\n<p>\n A resolution was then offered that Presby\u00ac\n ters recommend to the churches under their\n care to adopt the plan presented by th^com-\n mittee of Synod.

They believe there may be at the present\n time many slaves belonging tb members of\n the Presbyterian communion, whose situa\u00ac\n tions would be greatly improved by emanci\u00ac\n pation ; and that many others, especially of\n the children and youth might be prepared for\n freedom by the use of efforts on the part of their\n masters. But it is difficult to provide by gen\u00ac\n eral rules for such individual cases, and this\n Synod think it best to leave them to the oper\u00ac\n ation of the Christian law of love on the con\u00ac\n sciences of men.\n</p>\n<p>\n For the purpose of promoting harmony and\n concert of action on this important subject.\n The Synod do\n</p>\n<p>\n Resolve , That a committee of ten be ap\u00ac\n pointed, to consist of an equal number of\n ministers and elders, John Brown, chair\u00ac\n man, John Green, Thomas Porter Smith,\n Charles N.

You\n will see that the memorial submitted to your\n consideration states slavery as a moral evil,\n very heinous, and consequently sufficient to\n exclude such as will continue in the practice\n of it from the privileges of the Church. This,\n sir; is not the opinion of these congregations\n only, but also of a large majority of this Pres\u00ac\n bytery, and, we have reason to believe, of the\n sister Presbyteries in this country, as well as\n of the greater part of Christians in our com\u00ac\n munion. However, as we are instructed by\n the sacred oracles that all things should be\n done decently and in order, we have thought\n it not prudent that we should decide in a mat\u00ac\n ter of such moment, but that the higher judi\u00ac\n catories of the Church should direct us. We,\n therefore, submit it to your wisdom and seri\u00ac\n ous deliberation, and we earnestly request you\n to communicate to us your sentiments as short\u00ac\n ly after the rising of Synod as you may find\n convenient, as we think the state of the\n Churches here really requires it.\n</p>\n<p>\n We are, dear sir, your brethren in the\u2018gos\u00ac\n pel, James Crawford,\n</p>\n<p>\n Robert Marshall,\n Barton W.

I have tried to make it\n complete. The third volume of the records,\n covering the period from May 28, 1814, to\n April 10, 1821, has been lost for many years;\n but we can draw a fair inference as to the\n state of opinion during that time. The his\u00ac\n tory divides itself into sections, according to\n the views taken, and prevailing or^coutend-\n ing. Section 1 was that given in my last let\u00ac\n ter, covering some ten years, from April 16th,\n 1799, to October 10th, 1809, in which the in\u00ac\n clination in Presbytery evidently was not to\n tolerate the institution of slavery at all.

VVe feel the responsibility\n and difficulty of the duty to which the church\n has called us, yet the character of those\n whom we address, strongly encourages us to\n hope that labor will not be in vain. You pro\u00ac\n fess to be governed by the principles and pre\u00ac\n cepts of a holy religion. You recognize the\n fact that you have yourselves \u201cbeen made\n free \" by the blood of the Son of God, and you\n believe that you have been imbued with a por\u00ac\n tion of the same spirit which was in \u201cHim,\n who though he was rich, ' yet for our sakes be\u00ac\n came poor.\u201d When we point out to such per\u00ac\n sons their duty, and call upon them to fulfill\n it our appeal cannot be altogether fruitless.\n But we have a still stronger ground for our\n encouragement in our firm conviction, that, the\n cause which we advocate is the cause of God,\n and that his assistance will make it finally\n prevail. May He \u201cwho hears the cry of the\n poor and needy,\u201d and who has commanded to\n let the \u201coppressed go free,\u201d give to each one\n of us wisdom to know our duty, and strength\n to do it.\n</p>\n<p>\n We earnestly entreat you, brethren, to re\u00ac\n ceive our communication in the same spirit of\n kindness in which it is made, and permit\n neither prejudice nor interest to close your\n minds against the reception of the truth, or\n steel your hearts against the convictions of\n conscience. Very soon it will be a matter of\n no moment whether we have had large or small\n possessions on the earth, but it will be of\n infinite importance whether or not we have\n</p>\n<p>\n conscientiously sought out the will of God arid\n done it.\n</p>\n<p>\n We all admit that the system of slavery,\n which exists among us, is not right. Why,\n then, do we assist in perpetuating it? Why\n do we make no serious effort to terminate it?\n Is it not because our perception ' -of its ' sinful\u00ac\n ness is very feeble and indistinct ' , .while our\n perception of the difficulties.pf instructing\n and emancipating our slaved^s Strong and ,\n clear? As long as we believe thart slavery, as\n it exists among us, is a light evil in the sight\n of God, so long will we feel inclined to pro\u00ac\n nounce every plan that can be devised for its \u2022\n termination inexpedient or impracticable.\n Before, then, we unfold our plan, we wish to\n examine the system, and try it by the princi\u00ac\n ples which religion teaches. If it shall not\n be thus proved to be an abomination in the\n sight of a just and holy God, we shall not so\u00ac\n licit your concurrence in any plan for its ab\u00ac\n olition. But if, when fairly examined, it shall\n be seen to be a thing which God abhors, we\n may surely expect that no trifling amount of\n trouble or loss will deter you from lending\n your efforts to its extermination.\n</p>\n<p>\n Slavery is not the same all the world over.\n And to ascertain its character, in any particu\u00ac\n lar state or country, we must examine the con\u00ac\n stituents and effects of the kind of slavery\n which there exists. The system as it exists\n among us, and is constituted by our laws, con\u00ac\n sists of three distinct parts\u2014a deprivation of the\n right of property , a deprivation oj personal lib\u00ac\n erty ,, and a deprivation of personal security. In\n all its parts, it is manifestly a violation of the\n laws of God as revealed by the light of na\u00ac\n ture, as well as the light of revelation.\n</p>\n<p>\n l. A part hf our system of slavery consists in\n depriving human beings of the right to acquire\n and hold property. Does it need any proof to\n show that God has given to all human beings a\n right to the proceeds of their own labor? The\n heathen acknowledge it\u2014every one feels it.\n The Bible is full of denunciations against\n those who withhold from others the fruits of\n their exertions. \u201cWo unto him that buildeth\n his house by unrighteousness, and his cham\u00ac\n bers hjy wrong; that useth his neighbor\u2019s ser\u00ac\n vice without wages, and giyeth him not for\n his work.\u201d* Does ' an act which, is wrong,\n when done once and toward one individual,\n become right because it is practiced daily and\n hourty, and toward thousands ? Does the Just\n and Ho\u2019y One frown the less upon injustice,\n because it is systematically practiced, and is\n sanctioned by the laws of the land ? If the\n chicanery of the law should enable us to es\u00ac\n cape the payment of our debts, or if a human\n legislature should discharge us from our obli\u00ac\n gations to our creditors, could we, without\n deep guilt, withhold from our neighbors that\n which is their due ? No ; we all recognize the\n principle that the laws of the |God of nature\n can never be replaced by any legislature under\n</p>\n<p>\n *Jer. 22: 13. See also James 5; 4. Lev. 19:13.

The deprivation of personal liberity forms\n another part of our system of slavery. Not only\n has the slave nc right to his wife and chil\u00ac\n dren, but he has no right even to himself. His\n very body, his muscles, his bones, his flesh, are\n all the property of another. The movements\n of his limbs are regulated by the will of a\n master. He may be sold, like a beast of the\n field\u2014he may be transported in chains like a\n felon. Was the blood of our revolution shed\n to establish a false principle, when it was\n poured out in defense of the assertion that \u201call\n men are created equalthat \u201cthey are en\u00ac\n dowed by their Creator with certain inaliena\u00ac\n ble rights; that among these are life, liberty,\n and the pursuit of happiness? If it be a vi\u00ac\n olation of the rights of nature to deprive men\n of their political freedom , the injustice is sure\u00ac\n ly much more flagrant, when we rob them of\n personal liberty. The condition of a subject is\n enviable compared with the condition of the\n slave. We are shocked at the despotism exer\u00ac\n cised over the Poles. But theirs is a political\n yoke, and is light compared with the personal\n yoke that bows down the two millions of our\n colored countrymen. Does European injustice\n lose its foul character when practiced, with ag\u00ac\n gravations, in America ?\n</p>\n<p>\n Still farther, the deprivation of personal\n liberty is so complete, that it destroys the\n rights of conscience. Our sj^stem, as estab\u00ac\n lished by law, arms the master with power to\n prevent his slave from worshiping God, ac\u00ac\n cording to the dictates of his own conscience.\n The owner of human beings among us, may\n legally restrain them from assembling to hear\n the instructions of divine truth, or even from\n ever uniting their hearts and voices in social\n prayer and praise to Him who created them.\n God alone is Lord over the conscience. Yet\n our system, defrauding alike our Creator and\n our slaves, confers upon men this prerogative\n of Deity. Argument is unnecessary to show\n the guilt and madness of such a system. And\n do we not participate in its criminality *if we\n uphold it ?\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The deprivation of personal security is the\n remaining constituent of our system of slavery.\n The time was, in our own as well as in other\n countries, when even the life of the slave was\n absolutely in the hands of the master. It is\n not so now among us. The life of a bondman\n cannot be taken with impunity. But the law\n extends its protection no farther. Cruelty\n may be carried to any extent, provided life be\n spared. Mangling, imprisonment, starvation,\n every species of torture, may be inflicted upon\n him, and he has no redress. But, not content\n with thus laying the body of the slave de\u00ac\n fenseless at the foot of the master, our system\n proceeds still farther, and strips him in a great\n</p>\n<p>\n measure of all protection against the inhu\u00ac\n manity of any othr White man, who may\n choose to maltreat him. The laws prohibit the\n evidence of a slave against a white man from\n being received in a court of justice. So that\n wantonness and cruelty may be exercised, by\n any man, with impunity, upon these unfortu\u00ac\n nate people, provided none witness it but\n those of their own color. In describing such\n a condition, we may well adopt the language\n of sacred writ: \u201cJudgment is turned away\n backward, and justice standeth afar off, and\n truth is fallen in the street, and equity can\u00ac\n not enter. And the Lord saw it, and it dis\u00ac\n pleased Him that there was no judgment.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Such is the essential character of our slave\u00ac\n ry. Without any crime on the part of its un\u00ac\n fortunate subjects, they are deprived for life,\n and their posterity after them, of the right to\n property, of the right to liberty, and of the\n right to personal security. These odious fea\u00ac\n tures are not the excrescences upon the sys\u00ac\n tem, they are the system itself \u2014they are its es\u00ac\n sential constituent parts. And can any man\n believe that such a thing as this is not sinful\n \u2014that it is not hated by God\u2014and ought not\n to be abhorred and abolished by man ?\n</p>\n<p>\n But there are certain effects , springing nat\u00ac\n urally and necessarily out of such a system,\n which must also be considered, in forming a\n proper estimate of its character.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. Its most striking elfect is to deprave and\n degrade its subjects , by removing from them the\n strongest natural checks to human corruption. As\n there are certaiu laws impressed upon the ele\u00ac\n ments, by which God works to preserve the\n beauty and order of the material creation;\n so there are certain principles of human na\u00ac\n ture, by which He works to save the moral\n world from ruin. These principles operate on\n every man in his natural condition of free\u00ac\n dom\u2014restraining his vicious propensities, and\n regulating his deportment.

He sinks far down\n toward a level with the beast of the field, and\n can be moved to action only by such appeals\n as influence the lunatic and the brute. This\n is the condition to which slavery reduces the\n great mass of those who wear its brutalizing\n yoke. Its effects upon their souls are far\n worse than its effects upon their bodies. Char\u00ac\n acter, property, destination, power and family\n respectability, are all withdrawn from the\n reach of the slave. No object is presented to\n excite aud cultivate those higher feelings,\n whose exercise would repress his passions and\n regulate his appetites. Thus, slavery deranges\n and ruins the moral machinery of man, it\n cuts the sinews of the soul, it extracts from\n human nature the salt that purifies and pre\u00ac\n serves it, and leaves a corrupting mass of ap\u00ac\n petite and passion.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. It dooms thousands of human beings to hope\u00ac\n less ignorance. The acquisition of knowledge\n requires exertion; and the man who has to\n continue through life in bondage, has no\n strong motive of interest to induce such exer\u00ac\n tion; for knowledge is not valuable to him, as\n to one who eats the fruits of his own labors.\n The acquisition of knowledge requires also fa\u00ac\n cilities of books, teachers and time, which can\n be only adequately furnished by masters ; and\n those who desire to perpetuate slavery will\n never furnish these facilities. If slaves are\n educated it must involve some outlay on the\n part of the master. And what reliance for such a\n sacrifice can be placed on the generosity and\n virtue of one who looks on them as his prop\u00ac\n erty, and who has been trained to consider\n every dollar expended on them as lost, unless\n it contributes to increase their capacity for\n yielding him valuable service? He will have\n them taught to work, and will ordinarily feed\n and clothe them so as to enable them to per\u00ac\n form their work to advantage, But more\n thau this, it is inconsistent with our knowl\u00ac\n edge of human nature to expect that he will\n do for them. The present state of instruction\n among this race answers exactly to what we\n might thus naturally anticipate. Throughout\n our whole land, so far as we can learn, there\n is but one school in which, during the week,\n slaves con be taught. The light of three or\n four Sabbath schools is seen, glimmering\n through the darkness that covers the black\n population of a whole State. Here and there\n a family is found, where humanity and reli\u00ac\n gion impel the master, mistress or children to\n the laborious task of private instruction.\n Great honor is due to those engaged in this\n philanthropic and self-denying course, and\n their reward shall be received in the day,\n when even a cup of cold water, given from\n Christian motives, shall secure a recompense.\n But, after all, what is the utmost amount of\n instruction given to slaves? Those who enjoy\n the most of it, are fed witli but the crumbs of\n knowledge which fall from their master ' s ta\u00ac\n ble\u2014they are clothed with the mere shreds\n and tatters of learning.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nor is it to be expected that this state of\n things will become better, unless it is deter\u00ac\n mined that slavery shall cease. The impression\n is almost universal that intellectual elevation\n unfits men for servitude, and renders it im\u00ac\n possible to retain them in this condition. This\n impression is upquestionably correct. The\n weakness and ignorance of their victims is the\n onl,y safe foundation on which injustice and\n oppression can rest. And the effort to keep in\n bondage men to whom knowledge has imparted\n power, would be like the insane attempt of the\n Persian tyrant, to chain the waves of the sea,\n and whip its boisterous waters into submis\u00ac\n sion. We may as soon expect to fetter the\n winds, seal up the clouds, or extinguish the\n fires of the volcano, as to prevent enlightened\n minds from recovering their natural condition\n of freedom. Bence, in some of our States,\n laws have been enacted, prohibiting, under\n severe penalties, the instruction of the blacks;\n and even where such laws do not exist, there\n are formidable numbers who oppose, with\n deep hostility, every effort to enlighten the\n mind of the negro. These men are determined\n that slavery shall be perpetuated, and they\n know that their universal \u2022 education must bo\n followed by their universal emancipation.\n They are then acting wisely, according to the\n wisdom of this world, when they deny educa\u00ac\n tion to slaves\u2014they are adopting a measure\n necessary to secure their determined purpose.\n It is, however, such policy as the robber ex\u00ac\n hibits, who silences in death the voices that\n might accuse him, and buries in the grave the\n witnesses of his crimes. He is determined to\n pursue his occupation, and his safety in it re\u00ac\n quires that he should not indulge in the weak\u00ac\n ness of keeping conscience. How horrible\n must be that system, which, in the opinion of\n even its strongest advocates, demands, as the\n necessary condition of^its existence, that\n knowledge should be shut out from the minds\n of those who live under it\u2014that they should\n be reduced as nearly as possible to the level\n of brutes or living machines\u2014that the powers\n of their souls should be crushed. Let each\n one of us ask, Can such a system be aided,\n or even tolerated, withoutdeep criminality?\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. It deprives its subjects , in a great measure ,\n of the privileges of the gospel. Tou| may be\n startled at this statement, and feel disposed to\n exclaim, \u201cOur slaves are always permitted,\n and even eneouraged, to attend upon the ordi\u00ac\n nances of worship.\u201d But a candid and close\n examination will show the correctness of our\n charge. The privileges of the gospel, as en\u00ac\n joyed by the white population of this land,\n consist in free access to the Scriptures , of a\n regular gospel ministry , and domestic means of\n grace. Neither of these are, to any extent\n worth naming, enjoyed by slaves, as a mo\u00ac\n ment\u2019s consideration will satisfactorily show.\n The law, as it is here, does not prevent free\n access to the Scriptures , but ignorance, the\n natural result of their condition, does.

It has been\n proposed by some zealous and devoted friends\n of the colored race, to supply the diffcienoy of\n gospel ministrations among them. We need\n not here speculate on the probable results of\n such a scheme, if carried into effect, in a com\u00ac\n munity where there is no intention to emanci\u00ac\n pate; for before theVe is found among us be\u00ac\n nevolence enough to adopt and execute it, on\n a scale large enough to effect any highly val\u00ac\n uable purpose, the community will be already\n ripe for measures of emancipation. Such a\n spirit of kindness toward this unfortunate\n race as this scheme proposes, can never co\u00ac\n exist with a determination to keep them in\n hopeless bondage. Farther, there are no\n houses of worship exclusively devoted, to the\n colored population. Tiie galleries of our own\n churches, which are set apart to their use,\n would not hold the tenth part of their num\u00ac\n bers\u2014and even those few -eats are, in gener\u00ac\n al,. thinly occupied. So that, as a body, it is\n evident, that our slaves do not enjoy the pub\u00ac\n lic ordinances ot religion. Domestic means of\n grace are still more rare among them. Here\n and tiiere a family is found, whose servants\n are taught to bow with their masters around\n the fireside altar. But their peculiarly ad\u00ac\n verse circumstances, combined with the natu\u00ac\n ral alienation of their hearts from God, render\n abortive the slight efforts of most masters to\n induce their attendance on the domestic ser\u00ac\n vices of religiou. And if we visit the cot\u00ac\n tages of those slaves who live apart from their\n masters, where do we find them reading their\n Bibles and kneeling together before a throne\n of mercy? Family ordinances of religion\n are almost unknown among the blacks. We\n do not wish to exaggerate the description of\n this deplorable religious condition of our col\u00ac\n ored population. We know that instances of\n true piety are frequently found among them \u2014\n but these instances, we all know, to be awfully\n disproportionate to their numbers, and to the\n extent of those means of grace which exist\n around them. When the missionaries of the\n cross enter a heathen land, their hope of fully\n Christianizing it rests upon the fact, that they\n oan array and bring to bear upon the minds\n</p>\n<p>\n cf those children of ignorance and sin, all\n those varied means which God has appointed\n for the reformation of man. But while the\n system of slavery continues among us, these\n means can never be efficiently and fully em\u00ac\n ployed for the conversion of tlxe degraded sons\n of Africa. Yet \u201cGod hath made them of one\n blood\u201d with ourselves; hath provided for them\n the same redemption; hath in his providence\n cast souls upon our care, and hath clearly in\u00ac\n timated to us the doom of him who \u201cseeth his\n brother have need, and shutteth up his bowels\n of compassion from him.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. This system licenses and produces great\n cruelty. The law places the whip in the hands\n of the master, and its use, provided he avoid\n destroying life, is limited only by his own\n pleasure. Considering the absolute power\n with which our people are armed, it must be\n ackno wledged that the treatment of their de\u00ac\n pendents is, in general, singularly humane.\n Mauy circumstances operate here to mitigate\n the rigors of perpetual servitude: aud it ia\n probably the fact that no body of slaves have\n been ever better fed, better clothed, and less\n abused, than the slaves of Kentucky. Still\n they have no security for their comfort but the\n humanity and generosity of men who have\n been trained to regard them not as brethren,\n but as mere property. Humanity and gener\u00ac\n osity are, at best poor guarantees for the pro\u00ac\n tection of those who cannot assert their rights,\n and over whom the law throws no protection.\n Our owncondition we would feel to be wretched\n indeed, if no law secured us from the insults\n and maltreatment even of our equals. But su\u00ac\n periority naturally begets contempt; and con\u00ac\n tempt generates maltreatment, for checking\n which we can rely not on virtue, but only on\n law. There are, in our land, hundreds of\n thousands clothed with arbitrary powers over\n those whom they are educated io regard as\n their property, as the instruments of their\n will, as creatures beneath their sympathy, de\u00ac\n void of all the feelings which dignify human\u00ac\n ity, aud but one remove above cattle. Is it\n not certain that many of these hundreds of\n thousands will inflict outrages on their de\u00ac\n spised dependants? There are now in our\n whole land two millions of human beings\n exposed, defenseless, to every insult and\n every injury short of maimingor death, which\n their fellow-men may choose to inflict. They\n suffer all that can be inflicted by wanton ca\u00ac\n price, by grasping avarice, by brutal lust, by\n malignant spite, and by insane anger. Their\n happiness is the sport of every whim, and the\n prey of every passion, that may, occasionally\n or habitually, infest the master\u2019s bosom. If\n we could calculate the amount of woe endured\n by ill-treated slaves, it would overwhelm every\n compassionate heart; it would move even the\n obdurate to sympathy. There is also a vast\n sum of suffering inflicted upou the slave by\n humane masters, as a punishment for that idle\u00ac\n ness and misconduct which slavery naturally\n produces.

There is not a village or road\n that doe 3 not behold the sad procession of\n manacled outcasts, whose chains and mourn\u00ac\n ful countenances tell that they are exiled by\n force from all that their hearts held dear.\n Our church, years ago, raised its voice of\n solemn warning against this flagrant viola\u00ac\n tion of every principle of mercy, justice and\n humanity. We blush to announce to you and\n to the world, that this warning has often been\n disregarded, even by those who hold to our\n communion. Cases have often occurred in our\n own denomination, where professors of the re\u00ac\n ligion of mercy have torn the mother from\n her children, and sent her into a merciless and\n</p>\n<p>\n returnless exile. Yet acts of discipline have\n rarely followed such conduct. Far be it from\n us to ascribe to our people generally a partici\u00ac\n pation in these deeds, or a sympathy with\n them\u2014they abhor and loathe them. But\n while the system, of which these cruelty are\n the legitimate offspring, is tolerated among us,\n it is exceedingly difficult to inflict punishment\n upon their perpetrators. If we commence dis\u00ac\n cipline for any acts which the\u2019laws of slavery\n sanction, where shall we stop? What princi\u00ac\n ple is there which will justify us in cutting\n off a twig or a branch of this poison tree, that\n will not, if fairly carried out, force us to pro\u00ac\n ceed, and hew down its trunk, and dig up its\n roots? These cruelties are only the loathsome\n ulcers, which show corruption in the blood and\n rottenness in the bones of this system.

But they are his\n property by the same tenure by which we hold\n our slaves; and has he not a right, he may ex\u00ac\n claim, to do as he pleases with his own? Nay,\n the security and peace of his dominions re\u00ac\n quire this cruelty. He is not willing to re\u00ac\n linquish the property w hick he inherited; and he\n may tell us, and tell us truly, that it cannot\n be retained in safety without the adoption of\n these horrid measures. Can we condemn his\n conduct, and yet justify our system of slave\u00ac\n ry ? Or can we condemn both, and yet be\n guiltless, if we use no efficient exertions to\n terminate these cruelties among us ? ,\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. It produces general licentiousness among the\n slaves. Marriage, as a civil ordinance , they can\u00ac\n not enjoy. Our laws do not recognize this re\u00ac\n lation a3 existing among them ; and, of course,\n do not enforce by any sanction the observance\n of its duties. Indeed, until slavery \u201cwaxeth\n old and tendeth to decay,\u201d there cannot be\n any legal recognition of the marriage rite, or\n the enforcement of the consequent duties. For\n all regulations on this subject would limit the\n master\u2019s absolute right of property in his\n slaves.

Their present\n quasi marriages are just such contracts, and\n are continually thus voided. They are, in this\n way, brought up to consider the matrimonial\n engagement as a thing not binding, and they\n act accordingly. Many of them are united\n without, even the sham and forceless ceremony\n which is sometimes used. They, to use their\n phraseology, \u201ctake up with\u201d each other, and\n live together as long as it suits their mutual\n convenience or inclination. This wretched\n system inevitably produces revolting licenti\u00ac\n ousness. This feature in the slave character\n is so striking, as to induce in many minds the\n idea that the negro is naturally repugnant to\n the restraints of matrimony. From the am\u00ac\n ple and repeated testimonies, however, of such\n travelers as Park and Lauder, who visited this\n race in the.r native land, we learn that their\n character is, in this respect, in Africa, the re\u00ac\n verse of what it is here\u2014that they regard the\n marriage rite with remarkable sacredness,\n and scrupulously fulfill its duties. Our fa\u00ac\n miliarity with this consequence of s\u2019avery\n prevents us from regarding it with the horror\n which it would, under other circumstances, in\u00ac\n spire. The sacredness of the marriage rite is\n the bulwark of moralty\u2014the cornerstone of\n domestic happiness. It is the foundation on\n which alone the whole fabric of an organized\n and virtuous community can be built. On it\n must rest all those family relations, which\n bind together and cement society. Without it,\n we might herd together like brutes, but we\n could no longer live together as human beings.\n There would be no families, no strong ties of\n kindred, no domestic endearments, softening\n the manners and curbing the passions. Sel\u00ac\n fish, sensual and unrestrained, man would ex\u00ac\n ercise his reason only to minister to the more\n groveling propensities of his nature. Any\n set of meu will approximate to this condition,\n just in proportion to their approximation to\n the practical abolition of matrimonial re\u00ac\n straints. And certainly never, in any civil\u00ac\n ized country, has respect for these restraints\n been more nearly obliterated than it has been\n among our blacks. Thus the working of our\n system of slavery diffuses a moral pestilence\n among its subjects, tending to wither and\n blight everything that is naturally beautiful\n and good iu the character of man. Can this\n system be tolerated without sin?\n</p>\n<p>\n 0. This system demoralizes Ike whites as well\n as the blacks. Masters are in a great degree,\n irresponsible for the exercise of their power;\n and they generally feel that their object iu\n possessing and exercising their dominion is\n their own utility, and not the good of those\n over whom they rule. Now, power can never\n be held or exercised without moral injury to\n its possessor , unless its exercise be subject to\n responsibility, or unless it be held mainly for\n the good of its subjects , not of its possessor. The\n lives of absolute monarchs furnish us with our\n most d s p ' -ting p\u2018c\u2018uros of hu oa > de\u00abriv ity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Few, even of those who have been previously\n trained to self-control and virtue, have been\n able to withstand the corruptin i nfluence of\n unrestrained power. And the effect is, in some\n measure, the same where despotic authority is\n possessed and exercised in a smaller sphere.\n No man acquainted with the frailty of the hu\u00ac\n man heart, would desire uncontrolled domin\u00ac\n ion over his fellow-men. We are sufficiently\n prone by nature to tyranny, and a disregard\n of the rights and interests of others, without\n having these feelings developed, cultivated,\n and matured by a sense of irresponsibility,\n and by the habit of regarding ourselves as\n born to command, and others as born to obey.\n Where a consciousness of responsibility, equal\u00ac\n ity, and dependence, does not check their\n growth, hard-heart.edness, selfishness, and ar\u00ac\n rogance, are, in most men, fearfully exhibited.\n And these odious traits of character must be\n peculiarly marked in those who have, from\n childhood, been trained in the school of des\u00ac\n potism The hand of one of our greatest\n statesmen has strikingly portrayed the demor\u00ac\n alizing effects of this system on the minds and\n manners of the ruling class. \u201cThere must,\n doubtless,\u201d says Mr. Jefferson, \u201cbe an unhap\u00ac\n py influence on the manners of our people,\n produced by the existence of slavery among\n us. The whole commerce between master and\n slave is a perpetual exercise of the most bois\u00ac\n terous passions, the most unrelenting despot\u00ac\n ism on the oue part, and degrading submission\n on the other. Our children see this, aad\n learn to imitate it; for man is an imitative\n animal. This quality is the germ of all edu\u00ac\n cation in him. From his cradle to his grave,\n he is learning to do what he sees others do.\n If a parent could find no motive either in his\n philanthropy or self-love, for restraining the\n intemperauce of passion toward his slave, it\n should always be a sufficient one that a child\n is present. But generally it is not sufficient.\n The parent storms, the child looks on, catches\n the lineaments of wrath, puts on the same airs,\n in the circle of smaller slaves, gives a loose rein\n to the worst passions, and thus nursed, educa\u00ac\n ted and daily exercised in tyranny, can not\n but be stamped by it with odious peculiarities.\n The man must be a prodigy, who can retain\n his manners and morals undepraved by such\n circumstances.\u201d* Such, according to the tes\u00ac\n timony of one who had marked its operation\n with a philosopher\u2019s eye, is the character\n which slavery forms\u2014a character perfectly\n the reverse of that which the gospel requires.\n</p>\n<p>\n We forbear to picture before you the conse\u00ac\n quences of that indolence and aversion to all\n manual occupations, which are necessarily en\u00ac\n gendered in youth, surrounded by a servile\n class who are engaged in these pursuits.\n These consequences you have all seen, and\n felt and deplored.

And when He cometh to execute ven\u00ac\n geance, \u201cwho may abide the day of his com\u00ac\n ing?\u201d Who can stand up before his indigna\u00ac\n tion?

We see the truth of what the\n prophet declares, that \u201cthe Lord is slow to\n anger\u201d\u2014but we are assured that it is equally\n true, that He is \u201cgreat in power, and will not\n at all acquit the wicked: the Lord hath His\n way in the whirlwind and in the storm, and\n the clouds are the dust of his feet.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Brethren, we profess to be Christians\u2014we\n reverence the holy revelation which God has\n given\u2014we look to its precepts for guidance,\n and to its denunciations for warnings. We\n know that the principles of the divine deal\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n ings are the same in every age, and that what\n God said to those of old, when we are in simi\u00ac\n lar circumstances, He sailh unto us. Listen,\n then, to one of the many intimations He lias\n given us cf the way in which he will punish\n it. \u201cThe people of the land have used op\u00ac\n pression, and exercised robbery, aud have\n vexed the poor and needy; yea, they have op\u00ac\n pressed the stranger wrongfully, and I sought\n for a man among them, that should stand in\n the gap before me for the land, that 1 should\n not destroy it; but I found none. Therefore I\n have poured out mine indignation upon them;\n</p>\n<p>\n I have consumed them with the fire of my\n wrath; their own way have I recompensed\n upon their heads, saith the Lord.\u201d ' * Can we\n despise the instructions of the Almighty?\n Shall we shut our eyes and close our cars\n against the admonitions of the Great Judge of\n the earth? Shall we not arise and \u201cstand in\n the gap before Him for the land, that He may\n not destroy it?\u201d Though our \u201cnest may be\n built on high,\u201d and \u201cour defense be the muni\u00ac\n tions of rocks,\u201d we cannot escape, if God rise\n up against us\u2014He can blast our prosperity\u2014\n He can drown us in blood\u2014He can blot out\n our existence and our name from under\n heaven.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let us remember, too, that not only as a\n people, but as individuals, God will deal with\n us. The day is soon coming when every man\u2019s\n works which he wrought shall be tried as by\n fire\u2014and we must then \u201ceat of the fruits of\n our own ways.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n We have exhibited fairly, but briefly, the\n nature and effects of slavery. For the truth\n of our facts, we refer to your own observa\u00ac\n tions; for the correctness of our reasoning, we\n appeal to your* judgments and consciences.\n What, then, must we conclude? Is slavery a\n system which Christians should sanction or\n even tolerate, if their efforts can avail to\n abolish it? The reply is often made, \u201cGod\u2019s\n word sanctions slavery, and it cannot therefore\n be sinful. It cannot be our duty to relinquish\n our power over our slaves, or the Bible would\n have enjoined it upon us to do so.\u201d We will\n not attempt to elaborate argument against this\n plea for slavery\u2014it needs no such answer.\n A few observations will sflice to show its utter\n fallacy.\n</p>\n<p>\n We are told that the apostles gave to Chris\u00ac\n tian masters and Christian servants directions\n for the regulation of their mutual conduct.\n True; and these directions will be valuable\n while the world lasts\u2014for so long, we doubt\n not, will the relation of master and servant\n exist. But how do such directions license\n holding of slaves? The terms which the\n apostles use in giving these precepts, are the\n same terms which they would have used had\n there been no slaves upon the earth.

If this assertion were true, and if\n the Bible only virtually denounced it, would be\n a sin. No man can righteously contiuue a\n practice which God disapproves of, no matter\n in what form the disapproval is expressed.\n But the assertion is not true. The New Tes\u00ac\n tament DOES CONDEMN, SLAVEDOLDING, AS PRAC\u00ac\n TICED AMONG US, IN THE MOST EXPLICIT TERMS\n FURNISHED BY THE LANGUAGE IN WHICH THE\n</p>\n<p>\n inspired penman wrote. If a physician, af\u00ac\n ter a minute examination, should tell a patient,\n that his every limb and organ was diseased\u2014\n if he should enumerate the various parts of\n his bodily system, the arms, the legs, the head,\n the stomach, the bowels, & c. and shou d say of\n each one of these parts distinctly that it was\n unsound; could the man depart, and say, \u2018 ' Af\u00ac\n ter ad i am not diseased, for the physician has\n not said, in express terms , that my body is un\u00ac\n sound?\u2019 Has he not received a more clear\n and express declarat ion of his entirely diseas\u00ac\n ed condition, than if lie had been told in mere\u00ac\n ly general terms, that his body was unsound?\n Thus has God condemned slavery. He has\n specified the parts which compose it, and de\u00ac\n nounced them, ono by one, in the most ample\n and unequivocal form. In the English langu\u00ac\n age we have the term servant , which we apply\n indiscriminately both to those held in volunta\u00ac\n ry subjection to another, and to those whose\n subjection is involuntary. We have also the\n term slave , which is applicable exclusively to\n those held in involuntary subjection. The\n Greek language had a word corresponding ex\u00ac\n actly, insignification, with our word servant.;\n but it had none that answered precisely to our\n term slave.* How then was an apostle, wri\u00ac\n ting in Greek, to condemn our slavery ? Could\n it be done in the way in which some seem to\n think it must be done before they will be con\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n vinced of its sinfulness ? How can we expect to\n find in Scripture the words \u201cslavery is sinful,\u201d\n when the language in which it is written con\u00ac\n tained no term which expressed the meaning\n of our word slavery ? Would the advocates of\n slavery wish us to show that the apostles de\u00ac\n clare it to be unchristian to hold servants\n (douloi)? This would hav^e been denouncing,\n as criminal, practices far different from slave\u00ac\n holding. But inspiration taught the holy pen\u00ac\n men the only correct and efficacious method of\n conveying their condemnation of this unchris\u00ac\n tian system. They pronounce of each one of\n those several things which constitute slavery,\n that it is sinful\u2014thus clearly and forever de\u00ac\n nouncing the system, wherever it might ap\u00ac\n pear, and whatever name it. might assume. If\n a writer should take up each part of our fed\u00ac\n eral constitution separately and condemn it\n article by article, who would have the folly to\n assert that, after all, he had not expressly con\u00ac\n demned the constitution? Who would say\n that this thorough and entire disupproval of\n every part of the instrument of confederation\n rau-t pass for nothing, and is no proof of the\n writer\u2019s hostility to it, because he has never\n said exactly in so many words, \u201cI disapprove\n of the constitution of the United States? We\n see that he could condemn it most explicitly\n and thoroughly without even mentioning it by\n name.\n</p>\n<p>\n Further, human language is so fluctuating\n that words often, in the lapse of time, change\n their meaning. The word tyrant expresses\n now a very different idea from that which it\n once conveyed. So the term constitution of\n the United States, at some future period, from\n the alterations introduced into our govern\u00ac\n ment, may indicate something far different\n from that which it now indicates. It is true\n wisdom, then, when we wish to perpetuate our\n condemnation of a system or institution, to\n express our sentiments of the various things\n that constitute the system or institution, and\n not of the mere name by which it is now known.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus our sentiments will be guarded from\n the misconceptions that may arise in the fluc\u00ac\n tuation of language. So that even if there\n were words in Greek, specifically set apart to\n designate the idea of slavery, inspiration would\n probably still have guided the apostles to their\n present form of expression in its condemna\u00ac\n tion. Had they used such language as this,\n \u201cslavery is sinful,\u201d some modern apologist for\n the system might have alleged that our slave\u00ac\n ry was not such as existed among the Greeks\n \u2014that slavery here was a different thing from\n that which the apostles denounced.

We\n are commanded to give our servants \u201cthat\n which is just and equal,\u201d and no sophistry can\n persuade us that we fulfil this toward those\n whom we deprive of the reward of their labor.\n We know that the idea of a bondman receiv\u00ac\n ing a just and equal remuneration for his la\u00ac\n bor, never enters the minds of slaveholders.\n The precepts against fraud, oppression, pride\n and cruelty, all cut directly through the heart\n of the slave system. Look back at the consti\u00ac\n tuents and the effects of slavery, and ask your\u00ac\n selves, \u201cIs not every one of these things di\u00ac\n rectly at variance with the plainest commands\n of the gospel?\u201d The maintenance of this\n system breaks not one law of the Lord, or two\n laws\u2014it violates the whole code\u2014it leaves\n scarcely one precept unbroken. And will any\n one, then, contend that slavery is not repro\u00ac\n bated by God, and that he may participate in\n the system, and assist in its perpetuation,\n without deep criminality? Forbid it, con\u00ac\n science\u2014forbid it, common sense ! Gaming,\n horse-racing, gladiatorial shows in which\n men were hired to butcher each other, the\n selling of children by their parents, which\n was often practised in ancient days\u2014all these\n things are condemned by the Scriptures, not\n by name, but (as slavery is condemned) by\n denouncing those crimes of which these acts\n are modifications and illustrations.\n</p>\n<p>\n These views of the sinfulness of slavery\n place it beyond all doubt, that it is the duty\n of every individual connected with the system\n to aid, vigorously and efficiently, in its aboli\u00ac\n tion, and thus free himself from all participa\u00ac\n tion in its criminality. How is this to be done?\n Certainly not by merely treating our slaves\n kindly, and thus mitigating the evils of their\n condition. You may say you have already,\n in the case of your own slaves, abolished the\n worst evils of the system, and that in every\n way you promote their comfort and welfare.\n Still, duty absolutely requires at least one\n more step\u2014a guarantee that their future hap\u00ac\n piness, and that of their children, shall not be\n at the mercy of another\u2019s caprice. And this\n can be effected only by a legal provision for\n their release from bondage. It is probable\n that the Romans were in a better condition\n under Titus, than they would have been had\n they governed themselves. But the gentleness\n of his sway only aggravated the horrors of\n their situation, under his dark and bloody\n successors. Granting all that any man may\n urge in favor of his own kindness to his de\u00ac\n pendents, still he is, contrary to the laws of\n nature and of God, retaining them in a condi\u00ac\n tion, which is tolerable only under the most\n rare and favorable circumstances\u2014which in\u00ac\n evitably works woe and ruin, unless prevent\u00ac\n ed by the singular virtue and generosity of\n</p>\n<p>\n an extraordinary master. Would we be will\u00ac\n ing that we and our children should be thus\n held? And remember that the fundamental\n principle of Christian morality is, that \u201cwhat\n thiugs soever ye would that others should do\n unto you, do ye even so to them.\u201d Are we\n complying with our Saviour\u2019s injunction,\n when we thus leave our fellow-beings exposed\n to all the future miseries, which avarice, ca\u00ac\n price and cruelty may inflict? Yet we pro\u00ac\n fess subjection to Christ\u2019s laws\u2014\u201cHe that\n knoweth my will and doeth it,\u201d says the divine\n Redeemer, \u201che it is that loveth me.\u201d The very\n best condition of a slave for life, is like the\n condition of those unfortunate men that we\n sometimes read of, who have been unjustly\n condemned to die\u2014but mercy or policy arrest\u00ac\n ing the execution of the sentence, they have,\n for a time, been permitted to go at large, yet\n liable at every moment to be remanded to\n prison and to death. This is the situation of\n a slave, at his best estate\u2014and who will say\n that either justice or mercy permits us to re\u00ac\n tain him in such a situation ?\n</p>\n<p>\n It is often urged that our slaves are better\n off than our free negroes. If mankind had\n considered this plea for continuing to hold\n slaves a valid one, the whole world would have\n been still in slavery\u2014for all nations have\n been at one time or other in some kind of\n slavery\u2014and all despots urged this plea\n against their emancipation. Besides, no man.\n ought to urge this as his reason for retaining\n his bondmen, unless he feels conscious that it\n is his real motive. And we willingly appeal\n to every man\u2019s conscience to say, whether his\n own imagined interest is not his real motive\n for refusing to adopt any efficient measures\n for changing the condition of his servants.\n That our negroes, if emancipated, will be\n worse off, is, we feel, but the specious pretext\n for lulling our own pangs of conscience, and\n answering the argument of the philanthro\u00ac\n pist. None of us believe that God has so cre\u00ac\n ated a whole race, that it is better for them to\n remain in perpetual bondage. One mode of\n emancipation may be preferable to another-i-\n but any mode is preferable to the perpetuation,\n through generations to come, of a degrading\n bondage. History, with a hundred tongues,\n testifies that, as a general rule, to emancipate\n is to elevate. And it is vain for any man to\n argue against such a general law of nature by\n adducing the occasional departures, which\n have fallen under his own personal observa\u00ac\n tion. We plant ourselves down on the broad\n and acknowledged principle, that God created\n all men capable of freedom\u2014if, then, they\n have become unfit for this condition, it is by\n our fault they have become so; and our exer\u00ac\n tions, if we are willing to do our duty, can\n easily restore to them that fitness oi which we\n have deprived them.\n</p>\n<p>\n As the conclusion of all that has been ad\u00ac\n vanced, we assert it to be the unquestionable\n duty of every Christian, to use vigorous and\n immediate measures for the destruction of the.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0050/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0050/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0050/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0050/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0050/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ge/ne/ra/la/ss/em/bl/yi/00/al/le/generalassemblyi00alle/generalassemblyi00alle_0050.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 917592}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"50\">\n<p>\n 50\n</p>\n<p>\n whole system, and for the removal of all its\n unhappy effects.

Our position is unnatural,\n and we can neither retain it nor recede from\n it, without suffering and inflicting evils, and\n the man who will not emancipate, until he can\n see a plan which will secure the happiness of\n himself and his slaves, without effort and\n without inconvenience, will have to wait until\n the trumpet of the archangel shall summon\n the slave and his master before the dread tri\u00ac\n bunal of their common Lord.

The most\n simple is that of abolition, or immediate and\n complete emancipation. Many considerations,\n however, induce in us the belief, that this is\n not the best plan which might be presented to\n you for general adoption. It is, doubtless,\n preferable to perpetuating the bondage of\n your slaves. So, too, in the political world, a\n revolution, with all its consequences, is prefer\u00ac\n able to a perpetuation of tyranny; yet cer\u00ac\n tainly a safe and rapid political reformation\n is, in all practical cases, the dictate of both\n humanity and policy. There are, we doubt\n not, many cases in which the condition and\n character of particular slaves, render their\n immediate emancipation the master\u2019s duty.\n But those who conceive that immediate eman\u00ac\n cipation is, in all cases, a duty, do not reflect\n upon the circumstances in which we are\n placed. They argue as if we had a system of\n laws, devised in reference to the peculiar\n character and condition of emancipated\n blacks, and adapted both to exercise over\n them a salutary and necessary restraint, and\n also to secure their intellectual and moral im\u00ac\n provement. If the political community in\n which we live would enact such laws, then the\n case which they imagine might be realized,\n and our duty might be different from what it\n now is. At present, an emancipated black\n among us is placed in peculiarly unpropitious\n circumstances. His situation is surrounded\n by difficulties and temptations, and no pro\u00ac\n vision is made to secure him against them, or\n to promote either his own intellectual and\n moral culture, or that of his offspring. We\n cannot, then, place our slave undergthe re\u00ac\n straint and protection of peculiar laws, which\n would, as far as might be practicable, guaran\u00ac\n tee his safety and advancement. We have no\n legal system which might be a kind of Mosaic\n dispensation to our slaves, preparing them for\n the clearer light and higher privileges of a\n more glorious economy, where they would be\n</p>\n<p>\n admitted to that full liberty, wherewith God,\n in his providence, has made us free. We, as\n individuals, are shut up to the alternative of\n giving our slaves unrestrained self-control, or\n retaining, for a time, our legal authority over\n them. The fact that our power is greater than\n should have ever been entrusted to masters, is\n no sufficient reason for a conscientious man\u2019s\n immediate relinquishment of his only title to\n exercise that portion of authority, which he is\n fully persuaded, is necessary to be continued,\n for a time, for the good of those over whom it\n extends.\n</p>\n<p>\n The plan, then, which we propose, is, for the\n master to retain, during a limited period, and\n with a regard to the real welfare of the slave,\n that authority which he before held in perpe\u00ac\n tuity, and solely for his own interest. Let the\n full future liberty of the slave be secured\n against all contingences, by a recorded deed\n of emancipation, to take effect at a specified\n time. In the meanwhile, let the servant be\n treated with kindness\u2014let all those things\n which degrade him be removed\u2014let him en\u00ac\n joy means of instruction\u2014let his moral and\n religious improvement besought\u2014let his pros\u00ac\n pects be presented before him, to stimulate\n him to acquire those habits of foresight, econ\u00ac\n omy, industry, activity, skill and integrity,\n which will fit him for using well the liberty\n he is soon to enjoy. That master is, in our\n opinion, doing most for the destruction of this\n system, who thus sets in operation a machine\u00ac\n ry which, in a given and limited period, will\n not only unbind the body of the slave, but will\n link by link, and in the only way in which it\n can be effected, twist off the fetters that now\n cramp his soul. If the master retains his au\u00ac\n thority over his servants only for a time, that\n he may enjoy ampler opportunities of em\u00ac\n ploying means for their amendment and ele\u00ac\n vation\u2014if he regard them as a trust commit\u00ac\n ted to him by his Master and theirs for their\n mutual benefit, and no longer as property of\n which he has the uncontrolled disposal, for\n his own selfish ends\u2014if he acts and feels\n thus, he is not only free from guilt, but he is\n \u201cbringing forth fruits meets for repentance\u201d\n \u2014he is doing a work of righteousness and hu\u00ac\n manity. If it be pretended that such a man\n is sinning, it must be on one or the other of\n these grounds\u2014either he is doiDg harm to his\n own servant by his course, or he is injuring\n others by countenancing the oppressive and\n cruel system of slavery. But neither of these\n allegations would be correct. Will any sober\n man, acquainted with the ordinary character\n of slaves, assert that it would be doing them\n an injury to deny them, for a time, the exer\u00ac\n cise of unlimited self-control? Will he as\u00ac\n sert, that the authority of a conscientious and\n kind benefactor extending over them, for a\n time, to assist them in the attainment of cor\u00ac\n rect sentiments, useful knowledge, and virtu\u00ac\n ous habits\u2014restraining them from vice, shield\u00ac\n ing them from temptation and moulding them\n to rectitude \u2014will he assert that such authori-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0051/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 321, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0051/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 642, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0051/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1285, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0051/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2570, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0051/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ge/ne/ra/la/ss/em/bl/yi/00/al/le/generalassemblyi00alle/generalassemblyi00alle_0051.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2570, "levels": 6, "size": 723026}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"51\">\n<p>\n 51\n</p>\n<p>\n ty is doing harm ?

They are, therefore, kept under au\u00ac\n thority for three years longer\u2014and not only\n no harm, but even a kindness is done to them.\n The almost unanimous voice of mankind pro\u00ac\n nounces that this is right.

Let him do\n as he does, and slavery at once ceases. He\n has, by his deed of emancipation, recorded his\n detestation of theii system, and shown that\n he will sacrifice his gains to his abhorrence of\n it. But it is asked, what difference is there in\n principle, between his holding them for some\n years and their holding them for life? The\n difference in principle is the same that exists\n between guardianship aud slavery, or between\n ordinary apprenticeship and slavery. If it\n were sinful to do anything which may be mis\u00ac\n interpreted into an encouragement of slavery,\n it would then be wrong to use the products of\n slave labor, to associate with slave proprie\u00ac\n tors, and to do a thousand other acts which\n may be said to be a countenancing of this un\u00ac\n just system.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is also a matter worthy of the serious\n consideration of a benevolent mind, whether\n by a hasty emancipation, he may not be rivet\u00ac\n ing more firmly the chains of other slaves.\n The strongest and most frequent argument in\n the mouth of the advocate of slavery is, the\n worthlessness of the free blacks. This argu\u00ac\n ment is, it is true, sophistical\u2014but its force is\n accumulated by every case of emancipation,\n when the subsequent conduct of the black is\n at war with his own interest, and the welfare\n of the community. If, then, we do not use a\n reasonable prudence, and secure, as far as\n may be possible, the future good conduct of\n</p>\n<p>\n those whom we make free, we may be found\n among the number of those whose well-meant\n but misguided zeal retards the work they aim\n to advance.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have thus sketched a general outline of\n the plan which we propose for your adoption;\n and have endeavored to show that the princi\u00ac\n ples on which it is based, are the principles of\n truth and righteousness. We have no hesita\u00ac\n tion in saying that this plan, in its general\n featui-es, should be adopted and acted on by\n all. In carrying it out into its minute de\u00ac\n tails, many cases of doubt and difficulty will\n arise, both as to the precise period for emanci\u00ac\n pating particular slaves, and as to the means\n to be used for their adequate preparation.\n But every one who cherishes Christian ben\u00ac\n evolence, and strives to keep an honest con\u00ac\n science, will be able, by applying the princi\u00ac\n ples laid down, to ascertain the specific course\n which is duty, in his own individual case.\n These cases of difficulty can, however, occur\n only in respect to the slaves who are already\n advanced in years, and whose habits are fixed;\n in relation to the young, our course is plain\n and unembarrassed. In view, then, of these\n circumstances, we leave many things to pri\u00ac\n vate judgment, and confine ourselves to a few\n specifications as exhibiting what is the clear\n and unquestionable duty of all.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1.

We recommend that deeds of emancipa\u00ac\n tion be now drawn up, and recorded in our re\u00ac\n spective county courts, specifying the jslaves\n we are about to emancipate, and the age at\n which each is to become free.\n</p>\n<p>\n This measure is highly necessary, as it will\n furnish to our own minds, to the world, and to\n our slaves, satisfactory proof of our sincerity\n in this work; aud it will also secure the lib\u00ac\n erty of the slave against all contingencies.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. We recommend that our slaves be in\u00ac\n structed in the common elementary branches\n of education.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4.

Sabbath schools for\n the blacks ought to be ganiorzed in nearly all\n our congregations.\n</p>\n<p>\n All these and many more such measures\n have been successfully adopted in some places\n and by some individuals.- There are many\n others who might pursue them with equal suc\u00ac\n cess.\n</p>\n<p>\n Brethren, there are three courses before\n you, one of which you must choose: either to\n emancipate immediately and without prepara\u00ac\n tion, or to pursue some such plan of gradual\n emancipation as we propose, or to continue to\n lend your example and influence to perpetuate\n slavery. It is improbable that you will adopt\n the first course\u2014if, then, you refuse to con\u00ac\n cur in the plan of gradual emancipation, and\n act upon it, however you may lull conscience,\n you are lending your aid to perpetuate a de\u00ac\n moralizing and cruel system, which it would\n be an insult to God to imagine that he does\n not abhor\u2014a system which exhibits power\n without resposibility, toil without recompense,\n life without liberty, law without justice, wrongs\n without redress, infamy without crime, pun\u00ac\n ishment without guilt, and families without\n marriage\u2014a system which will not only make\n victims of the present unhappy generation,\n inflicting upon them the degradation, the con\u00ac\n tempt, the lassitude, and the anguish of hope\u00ac\n less oppression, but which even aims at trans\u00ac\n mitting this heritage of injury and woe to\n their children, and their children\u2019s children,\n down to their latest posterity. Can any\n Christian contemplate, without trembling, his\n own agency in the perpetuation of such a sys\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n tem? And what will be the end of these\n scenes of misery and vice? Shall we wait\n until worldly politicians and legislators may\n rise up and bid them cease? We will wait in\n vain. Already have we heard the sentiment\n proclaimed from high places, and by the voice\n of authority, that a race of slaves is necessary\n to the existence of freedom. Is it from those\n who utter such sentiments, that we expect de\u00ac\n liverance to come? No. Reformation must\n commence, where we are divinely taught that\n \u201cjudgment must begin, at tha house of Ood\n This work must v e done; and Christians must\n begin it, and begin it soon, or wrath will come\n upon us. The groans of millions do not rise\n forever unheard, before the throne of the Al\u00ac\n mighty. The hour of doom must soon arrive\n \u2014the storm must soon gather\u2014the bolt of de\u00ac\n struction must soon be hurled\u2014and the guilty\n must soon be dashed in pieces. The voice of\n past history, and the voice of inspiration, both\n warn us that the catastrophe must come, un\u00ac\n less averted by repentance. And let us re\u00ac\n member that we are each of us individually\n responsible. We are individually assisting to\n pile up this mountain of guilt. And even if\n temporal judgments do not fall upon our day,\n we are not on that account the more safe from\n punishment. If we \u201cknow our Lord\u2019s will,\n and do it not, we shall be beaten with many\n stripes.\u201d The sophistry and false reasoning\n by which we may delude our own souls, will\n not blind the eyes \u201cwhich are as a flame of\n fire.\u201d A few years, at most, will place us\n where we would gladly give all the slaves of\n a universe, to buy off the punishment that op\u00ac\n pression brings down upon the soul. It may\n be difficult to stand in the judgment without\n having done it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Brethren, we have done. The hour is com\u00ac\n ing in which the slave and his master must\n stand together before the tribunal of God\u2014a\n God who judges righteously.

Are you prepared to say, \u201cAs\n I have done unto these, so let it be done unto\n me\u2014as I have shown mercy, so let me receive\n mercy at the hands of my judge?\u201d Antici\u00ac\n pate, we beseech you, the feelings and decision\n of that great day which is fast hastening on;\n try yourselves now, as God will then try you.\n \u201cWhat doth the Lord require of thee, but to\n do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly\n with your God?\u201d Are you \u201cdoing justly,\u201d\n while you retain your fellow-men in hopeless\n bondage? Are you \u201cloving mercy,\u201d while you\n are supporting a system that degrades and\n brutalizes beings whom God created in His\n own image ?

While, in this deplorable\n schism, this Synod sees a sad proof of the\n want of wisdom in that action of the Assem\u00ac\n bly, which has been a chief pretext of it, it\n decidedly condemns the schism itself, as be\u00ac\n ing without sufficient justification, and in its\n results, portentious of incalculable evil. And\n as concerning the posture of the Synod, it\n seems timely to declare, that it adheres with\n unbroken purpose to the Presbyterian Church\n in the United States of America; and hereby\n enjoins upon all its members, and upon all\n under its control and care, to avoid all divis\u00ac\n ive and schismatical courses, to cultivate the\n peace of the Church, and to practice great mu\u00ac\n tual forbearance.\n</p>\n<p>\n been almost or quite as much misunderstood\n and misrepresented as those of the Assembly,\n and as they are made to play a conspicuous\n part in all the controversy now going on, we\n propose to present them here entire. First\n in order is the\n</p>\n<p>\n Paper adopted by Synod at Harrodsburg, in\n</p>\n<p>\n in 1861, on the Minutes of the Assembly , and\n</p>\n<p>\n which is as follows :\n</p>\n<p>\n The committee* on the Minutes of the As\u00ac\n sembly presented their report, which was re\u00ac\n ceived, amended, approved, and is as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n The Committee on the Minutes of the As\u00ac\n sembly of 1861, upon the best consideration\n they have been able to give to the contents of\n those Minutes, and of the unhappy condition\n of the Church, at the present mo ment\u2014and\n of the perils which threaten the cause of\n Christ, in the bounds of this Synod, submit\n the following minute to the consideration of\n Synod.\n</p>\n<p>\n (1.) The action of the Assembly concerning a\n day of general prayer.\n</p>\n<p>\n This Synod deeply regrets that part of the\n action of the last Assembly, touching the or\u00ac\n der for a day of general prayer, which was\n liable to be construed, and was construed, into\n a requisition on all the members and office\u00ac\n bearers of the Church, living in the numer\u00ac\n ous States which had seceded from the United\n States and were in a State of war with them,\n as bound by Christian duty, and by the au\u00ac\n thority of the Church, to disregard the hostile\n governments which had been established over\n them, and, in defiance of the actual authority\n of those governments, to pray for their over\u00ac\n throw. In the judgment of a large minority\n of the Assembly, and of multitudes in the\n Church, the subject-matter of the action of the\n Assembly, in the premises, being purely polit\u00ac\n ical, was incompetent to a spiritual court.\n</p>\n<p>\n Undoubtedly It was incompetent to the As\u00ac\n sembly, as a spiritual court, to require or to\n advise acts of disobedience to actual govern\u00ac\n ments, by those under the power of those gov\u00ac\n ernments\u2014in the manner and under the cir\u00ac\n cumstances which existed; and still further, it\n was neither wise nor discreet, for the Assem\u00ac\n bly of the whole Church to disregard, in its\n action, the difficulties and dangers, which\n rendered it impossible for large portions of\n the Church to obey its order, without be\u00ac\n ing liable to the highest penalties. The\n action of the Assembly being exhaust\u00ac\n ed by the occurrence of the day of prayer part of a single act , viz: that of 1861.

The causes of Domestic Missions and Ben\u00ac\n eficiary Education in the bounds of this Synod.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the actual state of affairs, and until the\n present evil times are overpast, the Synod,\n without affecting its permanent relations to\n the Boards, advises the Presbyteries under its\n care, to take charge of the cause of Domestic\n Missions and the cause of Education, as re\u00ac\n lated to the cases of beneficiary candidates for\n the ministry, in their bounds respectively.\n Let funds be collected and disbursed through\n the action of the Presbyteries respectively, for\n the greatest benefit, according to their judg\u00ac\n ment, of the Missionary and Education causes,\n within the bounds of this Synod. And the\n Synod exhorts the Presbyteries to increased\n liberality to both of these great and suffering\n causes; so that, in these sad times, the gospel\n may be more and more widely preached among\n the destitute in our bounds; and so that in\u00ac\n creased liberality may be extended to the sup\u00ac\n port of indigent youth seeking the ministry\n amongst us\n</p>\n<p>\n *The committee were, R.

In reply to this, I\n say, first, that I have never said that the\n \u201cacts\u201d of the Assembly were repugnant to\n God\u2019s word\u2014but one act only out of five\u2014\n that of 1861.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Assembly\u2019s act of 1861, is embodied\n mainly in two resolutions. The first appoints\n a day of prayer, to be observed throughout\n the bounds of the Church; \u201cto seek God\u2019s\n guidance and blessing upon our rulers, and\n their counsels, as well as on the Congress of\n the United States about to assemble; and to\n implore Him in the name of Jesus Christ, to\n restore to us the blessings of an honorable\n peace.\u201d The second acknowledges \u201cour obli\u00ac\n gations to promote and perpetuate, as far as\n in us lies, the integrity of these United States,\n and to uphold the Federal Government.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In regard to the action of the Synod of\n Kentucky. The first thing to be noted is that\n it has reference exclusively to that part of the\n Assembly\u2019s deliverance appointing a day of\n general prayer. A glance at the Synod ' s min\u00ac\n utes, as quoted above, will show this. The\n point of its condemation lies against the As\u00ac\n sembly ' s advising \u201cdisobedience to actual gov\u00ac\n ernments, by those under the power of those\n governments\u201d And it is this action of the\n Assembly which \u201cthe Synod judges to be re\u00ac\n pugnant to the word of God.\u201d Upon this we\n have two remarks to make : First, it is more\n than doubtful, we think, whether the Assem\u00ac\n bly intended its action to be so interpreted as\n to require of any under its care, \u201cdisobedi\u00ac\n ence to actual governments\u201d over them. Sec\u00ac\n ondly, the very next Assembly\u2019s action on the\n state of the country, formally and expressly\n disavowed any such authority. This is its lan\u00ac\n guage: \u201cOn the contrary, every follower of\n Christ has the personal liberty bestowed on\n him by Christ, to submit, for the sake of\n Christ, according to his own cons ientious\n sense of duty, to whatever government , however\n bad, under which his lot may be cast.\u201d [See\n minutes of 1862, p. 625.] It is very gener\u00ac\n ally known that the papers quoted above\u2014\n that of the Synod of Kentucky, and the As\u00ac\n sembly of 1862\u2014were drawn by the same\n hand. It wai natural to expect, therefore,\n that what was condemned by the Synod of\n Kentucky, in October, 1861, should be disa\u00ac\n vowed by the Assembly in May, 1862. What\n we think will appear from \u25a0this comparison of\n these important papers, amounts to this : that\n every point of the Assembly\u2019s act of \u201961, in\u00ac\n volving fundamental principles, condemned\n by the protest of Dr. Hodge and others, and\n by the Synod oD Kentucky, has been solemnly\n denied by that Assembly as belonging legiti\u00ac\n mately to its action, or solemnly disavowed by\n the succeeding Assembly, as expressing the\n</p>\n<p>\n settled and deliberate judgment of the Church.\n And further, that the grand principle, touch\u00ac\n ing the authority of the Church to teach men their\n duty to the civil powers, was assented to, by Dr.\n Hodge, by the Synod of Kentucky through its\n entire delegation in the Assembly of \u201961. and\n by the whole Southern Church so far as repre\u00ac\n sented in that body.\n</p>\n<p>\n The next meeting of Synod was held at\n Paris, in May, 1863. The Committee on\n the Minutes of the Assembly consisted of the\n following persons:\n</p>\n<p>\n R. J. Breckinridge, J. T. Lapsley, J. D.\n Matthews, J. S. Hays, N. Rue.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Committee on the Minutes of the As\u00ac\n sembly presented their report, which was\n unanimously adopted. It is as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n The Committee of Synod on the Minutes of\n the General Assembly, of 1863, submit, as\n their report, the following minute, as proper\n to be adopted by Synod.\n</p>\n<p>\n If this Synod had been constituted, accord\u00ac\n ing to its adjournment in 1861, early in Octo\u00ac\n ber, 1862\u2014which was prevented by the occu\u00ac\n pation of the State of Kentucky by a hostile\n army\u2014there were, no doubt, amongst the im\u00ac\n portant matters contained in the minutes of\n the General Assembly of 1862, several, which\n it would have been proper for this Synod, per\u00ac\n haps its duty, to have made subject of special\n action. The greater part of these topics, in\n their present posture, and in that of this\n Synod to them, and considering, that the Gen\u00ac\n eral Assembly of 1863 will convene within\n the present month, does not appear to demand\n any particular action of this Synod, in that\n aspect of them, at this time.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is, however, one deliverence of the\n Assembly of 1862, namely, that on the state of\n the Church and the country , with regard to\n which the Synod cannot, with propriety, re\u00ac\n main wholly silent. The posture of this gen\u00ac\n eral matter, and of the Church in the bounds\n of this Synod, is this: its congregations, its\n Presbyteries, and this Synod, are, more or\n less, divided in sentiment.

By these deliverances, this Synod\n was willing and is still willing to abide, and\n any further or different utterance on that sub\u00ac\n ject by the last General Assembly, was, in the\n judgment of this Synod, unnecessary, unwise\n and untimely\u2014 unnecessary , because the former\n deliverances were sufficiently expressive of the\n views of the Church, and had been acquiesced\n in with great unanimity for many years ; un\u00ac\n wise, because the whole country was excited\n upon the subject of slavery, and the means\n adopted by the President of the United States\n for its destruction, in regard to which there\n was great division of sentiment in the public\n mind, and the Assembly could not take any\n action on the subject without at least seeming\n to cast its influence, with one or the other of\n the political parties, which divided the coun\u00ac\n try. Moreover, the Minute of the Assembly\n was peculiarly liable to this imputation, be\u00ac\n cause in the latter part of this some of its ex\u00ac\n pressions may be misunderstood, and others\n may be taken in the sense of a political, if not\n a partisan statement. The action of the As\u00ac\n sembly was untimely , because times of high\n political excitement are not proper occasions\n for the ecclesiastical courts to express opinions\n upon the topics which constitute the party is\u00ac\n sues of the day. The mission of the Church of\n Christ is spiritual, and any interference with\n matters purely political is a departure from\n her duty, and without the pale of her authori\u00ac\n ty, as conferred upon her by her Divene Head.\n</p>\n<p>\n Whilst expressing these views, the Synod\n deems it timely again to declare that it ad\u00ac\n heres with unbroken purpose to the Presbyte\u00ac\n rian Church of the United States of America,\n and hereby enjoins on all its members and up\u00ac\n on all under its control and care to avoid all\n divisive and schismatical courses, to cultivate\n the peace of the Church, and to practice great\n mutual forbearance.\n</p>\n<p>\n The vote was taken by yeas and nays, and\n resulted as follows : Yeas, 49 ; nays, 38.\n</p>\n<p>\n Yeas.\u2014H.

It is as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n After sermon, the Synod was called to order\n and constituted with prayer by Rev. Mr. Breck,\n Moderator of the former Synod. The Stated\n Clerk of Synod, the Rev. S. S. McRoberts, then\n proceeded to call the roll, beginning with the\n Presbytery of Louisville, using for the pur\u00ac\n pose, according to the standing order of Synod,\n the list of members furnished him by the Rev.\n R. Valentine, Stated Clerk of the Presbytery.\n As he was about to call the churches of that\n Presbytery, Mr. Beck interrupted the proceed\u00ac\n ings and directed Mr. McRoberts to call the\n names of \u201call the constituent elements\u201d of the\n Synod, meaning thereby, in addition to those\n already enrolled, the ministers whom the Gen\u00ac\n eral Assembly had forbidden to sit in any\n church court higher than a session, together\n with the ministers who had openly renounced\n the jurisdiction of the Assembly, until some\n future Assembly shall set aside as null and\n void certain acts of certain Assemblies; and\n the ministers who, after their Presbyteries\n had been dissolved by acts of disobedience\n to an order of the last Assembly, had proceed\u00ac\n ed to business in defiance of the authority of\n the Assembly. Mr. McRoberts refused to\n obey the requirement of Mr. Breck, for the\n reason that it was in direct palpable violation\n of the order of the Assembly. Mr. Breck then\n declared that he would himself call complete\n the roll of Synod, thus usurping the office of\n Stated Clerk; as this office is defined in the\n invariable customs, and written rules of the\n Church. Mr. Breck added that he should rule\n as out of order, any and every motion that\n might be made, until he should complete the\n roll. Col. Geo. T. Wood, Ruling Elder, rose to\n protest against the course of Mr. Breck, as\n wholly repugnant to any parliamentary law ;\n and Dr. R. J. Breckinridge, to protest on be\u00ac\n half of himself, and those who intended to ad\u00ac\n here to the General Assembly, against this\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0058/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0058/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0058/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0058/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0058/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ge/ne/ra/la/ss/em/bl/yi/00/al/le/generalassemblyi00alle/generalassemblyi00alle_0058.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 835378}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"58\">\n<p>\n 58\n</p>\n<p>\n usurpation, and unlawful conduct on the part\n of Mr. Breck, and both of these brethren were\n called to order by Mr. Breck, and were cried\n down by a loud clamor in the house; and were\n not allowed to take an appeal to the Synod,\n from tha ruling of the Moderator.

Seasons for Special Prayer.\u2014 The at\u00ac\n tention of the m\u2019nisters and churches under\n our care, is earnestly called to the appoint\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n ment by the Assembly of two seasons for\n special prayer, viz: The last Thursday in Feb\u00ac\n ruary, in behalf of Colleges and other insti\u00ac\n tutions of learning, and for the conversion of\n the rising generation, especially the children\n of the church; and the second week in Janu\u00ac\n ary, including the first and second Sabbaths,\n as a week of prayer for the outpouring of the\n spirit of God upon all flesh. In connection\n with the first of these, the Assembly desig\u00ac\n nates the first Sabbath of March as a period\n for solemnly addressing parents and children\n upon their respective duties. In connection\n with the second, remembrance is made of the\n mercy God has displayed toward his Church\n in times past, in answering prayer. The Sy\u00ac\n nod urges upon all under its jurisdiction the\n devout observance of these special services.\n God has graciously vouchsafed heretofore a\n listening ear to the cry of his people; let\n them not withhold prayer now. Let them\n prove the Lord again, if he will not open the\n windows of heaven and pour out renewed\n blessings upon them. In this sad day of de\u00ac\n fection and opposition our own institutions of\n learning demand, and that in an eminent de\u00ac\n gree, the prayers and fostering care of the\n faithful.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The Boards of the Church.\u2014 The opera\u00ac\n tions of the Boards claimed, of course, a large\n share of the time and attention of the last as\n of previous Assemblies. These are the organ\u00ac\n ized instrumentalities whereby the Church is\n endeavoring to accomplish, in its manifold as\u00ac\n pects, the great work committed to it of its\n Divine Head. Every follower of the Savior of\n our order should feel a profound interest in\n their conduct; should become acquainted with\n their works, their wants, their failures and\n their successes; and should ever cherish a\n lively sense of the obligations resting upon\n him to support them by his prayers, and by\n liberal contributions according to the measure\n of this world\u2019s goods committed to his stew\u00ac\n ardship. Hence it becomes the imperative\n duty of the rulers in God\u2019s house to examine\n carefully the proceedings of the Assembly\n touching these important interests, and the\n reports of the Boards themselves; to instruct\n the people of God of their duty herein, to\n awakeu their interest, to elicit their sympa\u00ac\n thy and co-operation, and to give them the\n opportunity of contributing statedly to the\n advadcement of the Redeemer\u2019s kingdom.\n This Synod most affectionately and earnest\u00ac\n ly solicits its own members, and the people\n under its care, to consider the recommenda\u00ac\n tions and injunctions of the Assembly relating\n to the varied work entrusted to the Boards,\n and solemnly enjoins upon them the faithful\n discharge of their obligations to the Church\n and to her glorified Redeemer.\n</p>\n<p>\n All the more incumbent is the duty to sus\u00ac\n tain the Boards at the present time, because of\n the persistent efforts of late to alienate them\n from the hearts of the Presbyterians of Ken\u00ac\n tucky. And these efforts, it is painful to add,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0059/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 321, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0059/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 642, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0059/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1285, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0059/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2570, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0059/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ge/ne/ra/la/ss/em/bl/yi/00/al/le/generalassemblyi00alle/generalassemblyi00alle_0059.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2570, "levels": 6, "size": 742622}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"59\">\n<p>\n 59\n</p>\n<p>\n have been attended with no inconsiderable de\u00ac\n gree of success.

These things ought not so\n to be. The Boards deserve the confidence and\n support of the churches. Unwise and unsta\u00ac\n ble men, mistaken, misled, infatuated, have\n brought about the condition of things we now\n deplore.

At the meeting\n of Synod in 1861, at Ilarrodsburg, the follow\u00ac\n ing action was taken : \u201cIn the actual state of\n affairs, and until the present evil times are\n overpast, the Synod, without affecting its per\u00ac\n manent relations to the Boards, advises the\n Presbyteries under its care to take charge of\n the cause of Domestic Missions and the cause\n of Education, as related to the cases of bene\u00ac\n ficiary candidates for the ministry, in their\n bounds respectively.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In regard to this action it is to be observed\n (1.) That it is simply advisory in its nature;\n (2.) That it was a tempory measure, \u201cuntil the\n present evil times are overpast, (3.) That it\n was. not to affect our \u201cpermanent relations to\n the Boards.\u201d It is unquestionably certain\n that the great and only object aimed at was\n to secure harmony throughout our bounds\n while the \u201cevil times\u201d continued. It was\n staled, moreover, on the floor of Synod, at the\n time, by one authorized to speak for them, that\n such action had had beforehand the approba\u00ac\n tion of the Secretaries of these two Boaids.\n In the minute, too, of which this action is a\n part, the Synod declares \u201cthat it adhers with\n unbroken purpose to the Presbyterian Church\n in the United States of America, and enjoins\n upon all its members, and upon all under its\n control and care, to avoid all divisible and\n schismatical courses, to cultivate the peace of\n the church, and to practice great mutual for\u00ac\n bearance.\u201d How signally this considerate\n measure failed to preserve peace and harmony\n amoug us, the progress of events has but too\n fully demonstrated. And not only so; it has\n been made the occasion of casting foul obliquy\n upon the Synod, by the most wanton miscon\u00ac\n struction of its terms and its purpose. In a\n document issued last August, in the form of\n an address to the Presbyterian people of Ken\u00ac\n tucky, and which acquired importance only\n from its being signed by fifty-four persons, at\n that time ministers and ruling elders in the\n Presbyterian Church\u2014in the document, re\u00ac\n ferring to the minute passed at Harrodsburg,\n the signers of it say: \u201cThe Synod so far sus\u00ac\n pended its relations to those Boards of the\n General Assembly, whose work it deemed ca\u00ac\n pable of being done by itself, as to take that\n</p>\n<p>\n work, within its bounds, into its own hands;\n which, it is believed, was in preparation for\n the contingency of the Synod feeling con\u00ac\n strained to take an independent position.\u201d It\n is perfectly manifest that this is a perversion\n of the Synod ' s action, and a most unwarrant\u00ac\n able representation of ils purpose; much\n harsher teims, indeed, could be justly used in\n characterizing such a statement. The Synod\n had no thought of makiDg preparation to take\n an independent position; no intention of en\u00ac\n tering a wedge which should eventually sun\u00ac\n der its relations to the General Assembly. All\n this may have been in the minds of some, in\n whose hearts the fell spirit of schism has al\u00ac\n ready been doing its evil work; but such was\n not the mind of the Synod. The darling pro\u00ac\n ject of inducing the Synod to take an inde\u00ac\n pendant position, was steadily and stealthily\n pursued from the day of that meeting at Har\u00ac\n rodsburg, and finally culminated in the fla\u00ac\n grant schism at Henderson. The address to\n the Presbyterian people of Kentucky was it\u00ac\n self the product of an organized manifestation\n of the spirit that had fomented in secret for\n several years. To subserve the bad end in\n view, the action at Harrodsburg was con\u00ac\n stantly misrepresented. Furthermore, the\n new ecclesiastical body recently constituted\n at Henderson, claiming the names, rights and\n authority of the Synod of Kentucky, has not\n only assailed, in a published address, the\n members of this court and the Presbyteries\n under its care, charging them with \u201creckess\n violence aod wrong,\u201d but has reiterated the\n unfounded assertion that \u201cfive years since the\n Synod, by unanimous resolution, suspended\n its former relations to the Board of Domestic\n Missions.\u201d Yet it did no such thing, and even\n the advice then given was not followed by all\n the Presbyteries. The same convention of ec\u00ac\n clesiastics, absurdly claiming still to be a part\n of the Presbyterian Church in the United\n States of America, has organized a Committee\n of Domestic Missions and commended it to the\n support of those rightfully under our juris\u00ac\n diction, thus endeavoring to supplant one of\n the most important Boards of the Church.\n Now, in view of these facts, this Synod deems\n it timely to declare that the action taken at\n Harrodsburg. touching the charge by Presby\u00ac\n teries of the causes of Domestic Missions and\n Education, has expired in virtue of the limi\u00ac\n tation in the terms thereof. The advice, there\u00ac\n fore, is withdrawn; and the inferior judicato\u00ac\n ries and churches under our care are hereby\n advised to prosecute hereafter these interests\n of the Church in connection with the agencies\n appointed by the General Assembly.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3.

Organic Union of the Old and New\n Schools.\u2014 The question of the reunion of the\n two bodies into which the Presbyterian Church\n was formerly divided in 1838, has been much\n discussed of late in the newspapers and peri\u00ac\n odicals, and in many of the judicatories of\n the church. It was brought before the last\n Assembly by overtures from six different\n Presbyteries, all urging the Assembly to take\n measures to secure at an early day the organic\n union of two denominations. Our Assembly\n appointed a committee of fifteen to confer with\n a similar committee appointed by the other\n Assembly, \u201cin regard to the desirableness a-nd\n practicability of reunion, and if, after con\u00ac\n ference and inquiry, such reunion shall seem\n to be desirable and practicable, to suggest\n suitable measures for its accomplishment and\n report to the next General Assembly. 1 ' ' This\n Synod fully recognizes the scriptural doctrine\n of the oneness of the body of Christ and freely\n acknowledges the obligation imposed upon all\n the members of that body to seek after an out\u00ac\n ward realization of unity corresponding to\n the internal, so far and as sptedily as the\n providence of God shall open up the way.\n But to bring into organic union bodies not\n heartily one in doctrine, order and polity\n would be fraught with evil. Apart, but side\n by side, they may labor peaceably and effect\u00ac\n ively in building up the kingdom of their\n common Master; forced together, alienation,\n bitterness, strife and ultimately separation\n again would be the unavoidable and unseemly\n consequences. Two cannot walk together ex\u00ac\n cept they be agreed. The division of the\n Presbyterian Church which it is now sought\n to heal originated in differences of opinion\n touching the very fundamentals of our doc\u00ac\n trine and polity. The real and avowed causes\n of the separation were vital; they reached to\n the very foundations of the Church\u2019s distinc\u00ac\n tive being. The issues made and arbitrated\n were of supreme moment to the peace, purity,\n power and testimony of the Church. If, then,\n the causes of separation still exist, \u201cthe union\n of the two bodies,\u201d as has been well said,\n \u201cwould involve on our part, an utter derilec\n tion of pr\u2019nciple. It would be an acknowledg\u00ac\n ment that we had been either false or mis\u00ac\n guided in all that was done in effecting the\n deliverance of the Church; or it would evince\n that we ourselves had apostatized from the\n faith of our fathers and were willing to sac\u00ac\n rifice our faith for unworthy ends. It would\n also be a grievous breach of trust, and would\n forfeit morally, if not. legally, our titles to the\n endowments of all our institutions.\u201d If on\n the other hand, the original causes of separa\u00ac\n tion have ceased to exist, there may be no\n \u25bcalid objection to the reunion of the two\n bodies; no obstacle that patience and wisdom\n may not surmount. But is there evidence\n that the indispensable prerequisites to a happy\n union do really exist? that these bodies are\n</p>\n<p>\n now of one mind on the essential questions\n that formerly necessitated a division ? There\n is no such evidence before the Church. It hag\n been called for, but it has not been produced.\n We are constrained to believe that no such evi\u00ac\n dence exists. There is, however, much evi\u00ac\n dence going to show that the causes which led\n to the disruption nearly thirty years ago, do\n still exist. Such being the facts, this Synod\n does not see that the way is prepared for or\u00ac\n ganic reunion, and regards with grave appre\u00ac\n hension the posture in which this business\n now st > nds. The zeal with which the measure\n is pursued, is not in our judgment, according\n to knowledge. It is hasty, untimely, not re\u00ac\n gardful enough of souud doctrine and scrip\u00ac\n tural order; and if unchecked, will lead to\n incalculable mischief. Should this measure\n be precipitated, instead of subserving the\n cause of Christian union, it will most assured\u00ac\n ly promote dissension.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5 Dealing with the Signers of the Dec\u00ac\n laration and Testimony. \u2014In the fall of 1865\n this Synod condemned a most violent and\n abusive attack upon our branch of the Church\n of God, commonly knowu as the Declaration\n and Testimony. The Assembly of 1866 con\u00ac\n demned that notorious paper \u201cas a slander\n against the Church, schismatical in its charac\u00ac\n ter and aims, and in its adoption by any of\n our church courts as an act of rebellion\n against the authority of the General Assem\u00ac\n bly.\n</p>\n<p>\n These severe terms of censure met the\n hearty approval of this body. They are dis\u00ac\n criminating and just. The Assembly also in\u00ac\n stituted judicial process against the signers of\n the said Declaration and Testimony; and in a\n manner now so well known that it is needless\n to recite it here. In the measures adopted,\n this Synod recognizes an earnest desire on the\n part of the Assembly to vindicate the charac\u00ac\n ter and authority of the Church, and to pro\u00ac\n mote her peace and purity in the exercise of\n the constitutional \u201cpower of reproving, warn\u00ac\n ing, or bearing testimony against error in doc\u00ac\n trine or immortality in practice,\u201d and \u201cof\n suppressing schismatical contentions and dis\u00ac\n putations;\u201d and a like desire to do its duty in\n the premises, in the spirit of forbearance to\u00ac\n ward the offending, so far as truth and prin\u00ac\n ciple would permit.

During the years\n 1861-1866 the General Assembly took certain\n actions as to the duties of our General Govern\u00ac\n ment, in a time of civil rebellion, and relative\n to the duties of our people to the same in that\n emergency; also relative to the emancipation\n of the slaves in the United States; also rela\u00ac\n tive to the conduct of those Christians who had\n aided the rebellion. And while these acts\n strictly aceord with those of the General As\u00ac\n semblies of the United States and Scotland, of\n former days, in like cases; and also accord\n strictly with the religious convictions of the\n great body of our Presbyterian family, and\n what their consciences required of them as\n religious duty, at the time; certain persons of\n this Synod organized opposition to these acts,\n and have persisted in this opposition until a\n schism has been made in the body of this\n Synod. Our General Assembly in 1861 urged\n upon the United States Government the solemn\n duty of exercising its lawful authority in put\u00ac\n ting down the rebellion, and maintaining law\n and order throughout the nation, and urged\n our people to sustain our Government herein.\n In 1862 the General Assembly judged the at\u00ac\n tempt to overthrow our government and divide\n the nation, contrary to the wishes of the im\u00ac\n mense majority of our people, \u201ctraitorous,\u201d\n contrary to the dictates of natural religion and\n morality, and plainly condemned by the reveal\u00ac\n ed will of God; and bore its testimony against\n the conduct of those Christians who had aided\n and countenanced this evil work. The General\n Assembly in 1864 recited the former deliver\u00ac\n ances of our Church upon slavery and the duty\n of emancipation, and deemed it timely to take\n such further action as to it seemed proper, to\n meet the present aspects of human bondage in\n our country; showing that it had in 1787 high\u00ac\n ly approved of measures then on foot, looking\n to the abolition of slavery, and recommended\n to our people efforts to procure the final aboli\u00ac\n tion of slavery in America; and had in 1795\n \u201c assured all the churches under its care that\n it viewed with the deepest concern any vestiges\n of slavery which may exist in our country;\u201d\n and that in 1815 \u201cexpressed its regret that the\n slavery of the Africans and their descendants\n still continues in many places, and even among\n those within the Church, and urged our people\n to religiously educate and prepare their slaves\n for the enjoyment of liberty when God in his\n providence may open a door for their emanci\u00ac\n pation;\u201d and have declared in 1818, \u201cthe\n voluntary enslaving of one portion of the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0062/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0062/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0062/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0062/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0062/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ge/ne/ra/la/ss/em/bl/yi/00/al/le/generalassemblyi00alle/generalassemblyi00alle_0062.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 895719}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"62\">\n<p>\n 62\n</p>\n<p>\n human race by another, a gross violation of the members of any church within the bounds\n the most precious and sacred rights of human of the schism, who are loyal to the government\n nature\u2014inconsistent with the Law of God and of the United States, and whose views are in\n</p>\n<p>\n totally irreconcilable with the spirit and prin\u00ac\n ciples of the gospel of Christ; and that it is\n manifestly the duty of all Christians to use\n their honest and unwearied endeavours to\n correct the errors of former times as speedily\n as possible and elface this blot from our holy\n religion and to obtain the complete abolition\n of slavery throughout Christendom and that no\n greater delay ought to take place than the\n public welfare demands.\u201d Recognizing the\n fact that the Church has from the beginning\n been waiting on God to open a door for the\n abolition of slavery and urging those under\n her care to use diligence in getting themselves\n and their slaves ready for that day. The Gen\u00ac\n eral Assembly of 1864 declared it to be its\n solemn conviction that this day had come: \u201cIt\n is our judgment that the recent events of our\n history and the present condition of our Church\n and country furnished manifest tokens that\n the time has at length come, in the provi\u00ac\n dence of God, when it is his will that every\n vestige of human slavery among us should be\n effaced, and that every Christian man should\n address himself with industry and earnestness\n to his appropriate part in the performance of\n this great duty: that the excuses for its post\u00ac\n ponement no longer exist: that under the in\u00ac\n fluence of the most incomprehensible infatu\u00ac\n ation of wickedness, those who were most\n deeply interested in the perpetuation of slave\u00ac\n ry have taken away every motive for its\n further toleration and rendered its continuance\n incompatible with the preservation of our own\n liberty.\u201d And noting the facts that in the\n Struggle of the nation for existence against\n powerful and wicked treason, the highest ex\u00ac\n ecutive authorities had proclaimed the abolition\n of slavery within the rebel States, and decreed\n its execution by military force, and that after\u00ac\n wards slavery had been prohibited in all parts\n of the United States by amendment of the\n Constitution, aud that the voice of the nation\n was declaring that civil Government should not\n be re-organized in the rebel States upon any oth\u00ac\n er basis than of emancipation. The General As\u00ac\n sembly judged the difficulties which once seem\u00ac\n ed insurmountable on this subject had been re\u00ac\n moved by Divine Providence, and expressed\n their gratitude to Almighty God for having over\u00ac\n ruled the wickedness of the rebellion so as to\n work out the deliverance of our country from\n the evils and guilt of slavery. And in 1865, it\n being in the knowledge of the General Assem\u00ac\n bly, that during the existence of the rebellion\n which had recently disturbed the peace and\n threatened the life of the nation, a large num\u00ac\n ber of Presbyteries and Synods in the Southern\n States had organized an Assembly in order to\n render their aid to the attempt to establish, by\n rebellion, a separate nation and conserve aud\n perpetuate slavery our Assembly \u201cdeclared\n their acts herein unwarranted, schismatical,\n unconstitutional and recognized as the Church,\n</p>\n<p>\n harmony with the Confession of Faith, and\n with the several Testimonies of the Presbyte\u00ac\n rian Church on thesubjectof Domestic Slavery,\n and directed Presbyteries to treat with kind\u00ac\n ness, ministers and churches who are disloyal,\n or not in sympathy with the former deliver\u00ac\n ances of the General Assembly on the subject\n of slavery, and to receive them when they\n properly acknowledge and renounce their\n errors.\u201d Against these acts certain persons of\n our own number prepared, signed and publish\u00ac\n ed a Declaration and Testimony; saying of\n them, \u201cOur Church has been departing farther\n and farther from both the spirit and plain\n letter of her commission to preach the gospel\n and her charter, as a kingdom not of this\n world. \u2019 That \u201cby the decisions of the Supreme\n Judicatory of the Church in 1864, the consum\u00ac\n mation seems to have been reached, and the\n seal finally set upon all previous and uncon\u00ac\n stitutional and unscriptural acts of the body;\n that these acts are a subversion of the law of\n Christ\u2019s Kingdom and surrendering of the\n crown rights of Zion ' s King, on account of\n which the name and honour of our Lord are\n everywhere blasphemed;\u201d and charging an\n \u201cassumption, on the part of the Courts of the\n Church, of the right to decide questions of\n State policy, characterizing these deliverances\n of the late Assemblies as a sanction given by\n the Church to the perversion of the teachings of\n Christ and his apostles upon the subject of the\n duty of Christians as citizens : declaring that\n the Assemblies \u00a9f 1864 and 1865 have laid\n down a new doctrine upon the subject of slave\u00ac\n ry, unknown to the apostolic and primitive\n Church\u2014a doctrine which has its origin in\n infidelity and fanaticism: representing certain\n language of the Assemblies of 1864 and 1865\n as an unjust and scandalous contradiction of\n their own recorded testimony and of well\n known facts: asserting that the Assemblies of\n 1861 and 1864 countenanced the doctrine, that\n before church courts take action upon import\u00ac\n ant subjects, they ought to inquire what the\n Cabinet at Washington may wish them to do,\n or what effect such action may have upon\n Government Stocks abroad.\u201d Of the Assem\u00ac\n bly\u2019s reference to the lessons of Providence,\n this Declaration and Testimony says: \u201cA more\n total abandonment of God\u2019s written word for\n the uncertain light of dark and mysterious, yet\n undeveloped providences, and these to be ex\u00ac\n pounded by men, it may be, having their un\u00ac\n derstandings darkened, and for not obeying the\n truth, perchance, given up to believe a lie, can\n scarcely be conceived of.

This paper, with the\n act of the Presbytery of Louisville in adopting\n it, being brought to the notice of this Synod\n at its regular meeting, October. 1865, was\n caused to be read in the hearing of the Synod;\n and being considered, the Synod \u201cexpressed its\n disapprobation of the terms of it, and of its\n spirit, and intent, indicated upon its face, as\n looking to further agitation of the Church, if\n not its division, at a time when great mutual\n forbearance was called for among brethren.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It cannot be too often, nor too distinctly called\n to mind that this Synod has, by large majori\u00ac\n ties, publicly disapproved the avowed princi\u00ac\n ples and acts of those amoogst us who have\n been seeking to organize opposition to the\n General Assembly, as often as these have come\n directly under its consideration; and at the\n same time, has \u201casserted that we will adhere\n with unbroken purpose to the Presbyterian\n Church in the United States of America, and\n will oppose every effort to interrupt our eccle\u00ac\n siastical relations with the General Assembly,\n or to produce schism or division on the ground\n of said acts and deliverances.\u201d And this Sy -\n nod is confirmed in its past judgment herein\n by the fact that that judgment has been sus\u00ac\n tained by the wisdom of our whole Church.\n All leading minds, of differents shades of\n opinion touching the matters in question,\n agree as to the nature, character and tenden\u00ac\n cy of the Declaration and Testimony. The\n committee of the last General Assembly ap\u00ac\n pointed to examine it, reported in these words:\n \u201cIt is not simply an expression of disagree\u00ac\n ment with the vast majority of the Church on\n the subject of Loyalty and Slavery, nor a public\n protest against what might be regarded as se\u00ac\n riously erroneous, or unconstitutional in the\n teachings and decisions of the Assembly. It\n is not even a refusal to sustain the General\n Assembly and a renunciation of all obligation\n to support the organization by which the\n Church seeks to maintain and extend the gos\u00ac\n pel among men; nor is it an act of rebellion\n simply, against the constituted ^ecclesiastical\n authorities to which, in his ordination vow,\n every ^Presbyterian minister has solemnly\n promised obedience in the Lord. But it is an\n organized conspiracy against the honor, the\n pe ce and the unity of that part of (he body of\n Christ in which they still claim the rights and\n privileges of membership.

We\n fully sympathize with the disapprobation of\n the spirit, principles and proposed mode of ac\u00ac\n tion set forth in that document, which has\n been so generally expressed. It is founded,\n from first to last, upon an erroneous theory of\n the office and prerogatives of the Church. A\n theory which was advanced for a purpose, and\n was never acted upon any branch of the Church\n from the beginning. If its doctrines were to\n prevail, a seal would be set on the lips of the\n Church, and she would be forbidden to testify\n against many sins, and to enjoin many duties\n which lie properly within her sphere. The\n signers of the Declaration and Testimony, not\n satisfied with protesting against the acts in\n question, extended most unreasonably their\n denunciations and criminations, and put them\u00ac\n selves in the position of schismatics, by avow\u00ac\n ing the purpose of separation and adopting\n the incipient measures for the execution of\n that purpose.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The General Assembly of 1866, understand\u00ac\n ing that the Presbytery of Louisville had, by\n adopting this paper, openly defied its authori\u00ac\n ty, and refused to submit to its orders : \u201cRe\u00ac\n solved, that until it should have examined and\n decided upon the conduct of said Presbytery,\n the commissioners thereof should not be enti\u00ac\n tled to seats in that body; and having exam\u00ac\n ined the same by committee, the Assembly\n adopted the order that on hearing the matter\n the commissioners from said Presbytery should\n be heard subject to the rules of order which\n govern the Assembly. These commissioners\n took the strange position that they had alrea\u00ac\n dy been condemned, and that this proposition\n to hear them was an insult and seeming mock\u00ac\n ery, and refused to make any defense. The\n Assembly disposed of the case by condemning\n the Declaration and Testimony as a slander\n against the Church, schismatical in its char\u00ac\n acter, and declaring its adoption by any of\n our church courts an act of rebellion against\n the authority of the Assembly, and refering\n the subject to the next General Assembly.\n Summoning the signers of this paper and the\n members of the Louisville Presbytery who vo\u00ac\n ted to adopt it to appear before the next Gen\u00ac\n eral Assembly to answer for what they have\n done in this matter\u2014resolving that until their\n case shall have been decided, they shall not\n be permitted to sit as members of any church\n court higher than the Session, and that if any\n Presbytery shall disregard this action, and\n shall at any meeting enroll, as entitled to a\n seat or seats in the body, one or more persons\n designated in the preceding resolutions and\n summoned to appear before the next General\n Assembly, then that Presbytery shall be ipso\n facto dissolved ; and Synods, in making up\n their rolls, shall be guided and governed by\n this action of the General Assembly. For the\n express purpose of showing that it had no\n disposition to act hastily, nor harshly, but\n much ddsired to reach such an adjustment as\n</p>\n<p>\n would enable all true Presbyterians to remain\n in union, the General Assembly postponed\n final judgment for twelve months, thus giving\n ample time for reflection, for repentance and\n for defence. But as if fearing that our beloved\n Zion might be favored of her Divine Head\n with wisdom and grace to reach some happy\n conclusion of the case, within this time given\n for consideration, those immediately commit\u00ac\n ted to the Declaration and Testimony and\n summoned to answer for what they have done,\n in order to give their conduct the semblance\n of reason and justification, began afresh the\n work of agitation and strife, giving new in\u00ac\n terpretations to our Standards and teaching\n false theories and views of the fundamental\n principles of Presbyterianism\u2014principles\n which our Church has never received nor\n sanctioned, as to the true Constitution of the\n Church and the powers of her courts\u2014virtu\u00ac\n ally finding the defense of their conduct in\n the upturning of every valuable principle of\n our Presbyterian system.\n</p>\n<p>\n Also, others of our own nnmber, prepared\n and signed a paper and addressed it to \u201cthe\n Presbyterian people of Kentucky,\u201d and by\n means of it sought to organize conspiracy\n against the authority of the General Assem\u00ac\n bly, and in the interest and behalf of those\n who were under process of discipline before\n the General Assembly\u2014making vigorous ef\u00ac\n forts to induce the entire Church in Kentucky\n to commit herself to open resistance to the\n authority of the Assembly, and persisting in\n efforts to turn away the hearts of our people\n from the Church of our fathers\u2014the Church\n of our choice\u2014and the Church of our love\u2014\n and these efforts have culminated in schism in\n the body of this Synod. For, when this Sy\u00ac\n nod met at its last regular meeting in the city\n of Henderson, 7 o\u2019clock P. M., Oct. 10, 1866,\n and was constituted with prayer by the Mod\u00ac\n erator, Rev. R. L.

The\n Moderator then, in the exercise of power, at\n once unconstitutional, arbitrary and tyran\u00ac\n nical, also defiant of the authority of the Gen\u00ac\n eral Assembly, and regardless of the mind\n and judgment of the wisest members of Sy-\n nod. who were seeking to arrest his unlawful\n proceedure, by suggestion, argument and pro\u00ac\n test, did assume to decide in his own right\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0065/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 321, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0065/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 642, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0065/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1285, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0065/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2570, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0065/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ge/ne/ra/la/ss/em/bl/yi/00/al/le/generalassemblyi00alle/generalassemblyi00alle_0065.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2570, "levels": 6, "size": 745636}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"65\">\n<p>\n 65\n</p>\n<p>\n who were the lawful members of the Synod;\n did assume tn decide in his own right, whether\n or not the orders of the last Assembly should\n be obeyed by the Synod\u2014being backed up by\n the unseemly public clamour, made by persons\n designedly present in order to act public\n clamour and violence in support of the Mod\u00ac\n erator\u2019s decision, that the order of the General\n Assembly should not be obeyed.

Many statements in\n them, rather mis statements, deserve severe\n animadverson. To a few of these we now ad\u00ac\n vert; at another time others may receive at\u00ac\n tention.\n</p>\n<p>\n Among the grave charges alleged against\n the last General Assembly, is \u201cthe proposal for\n the removal of the Danville Theological Semi\u00ac\n nary.\u201d This is but. a repetition of what is\n said on the same point in the Address to the\n Presbyterian people of Kentucky, issued last\n summer by the junto which met in secret con\u00ac\n clave in Lexington\u2014only the statement there\n is still more inaccurate. The Lexington man\u00ac\n ifesto says, \u201cwith the proposition to remove\n from us the Theological Seminary.\u201d The sub\u00ac\n stratum of fact upon which this allegation\n rests, is on a par with much more of that ex\u00ac\n tremely candid, pious, and moderate document.\n Now what did the Assembly do? Accepting\n the resignations of the other professors, it re\u00ac\n quested Dr. R. J. Breckinridge to retain his\n professorship, and authorized him \u201cto confer\n with the trustees of the College, and with the\n Synod of Kentucky, as to the conditions upon\n which they will agree to the removal of the\n Seminary from Danville, and report to the\n next General Assembly.\u201d This action gives a\n coloring of truth, nothing more, to what is\n said by the separatists about the removal of\n the Seminary. The mere mooting of the ques\u00ac\n tion, the simple authorization of Dr. Breckin\u00ac\n ridge to confer with the Trustees of the Col\u00ac\n lege, and with the Synod, as to the conditions\n upon which they will agree to a change of lo\u00ac\n cation, is construed into a proposition to re\u00ac\n move the Seminary from us. The impression\n is made that the Assembly designs to wrong\n us, to disregard its covenants with the Col\u00ac\n lege and the Synod; yet all the Assembly di-\n was to appoint Dr. B. to ascertain upon what\n conditions the contracting parties in Ken\u00ac\n tucky would agree to a removal; and if these\n parties should so agree, what blame could at\u00ac\n tach to the Assembly? and what harm, in any\n event, in a simple proposal to remove? An\n impartial mind cannot fail to detect in thi3\n perversion of the Assembly\u2019s action, a trump\u00ac\n ing up of charges\u2014a hunting after something\n wherewith to fire the Southern heart against\n the Northern Assembly. But the proposition is\n not only to remove the Seminary, but to re\u00ac\n move it fromus , says the Lexington manifested\n that is, if from us means anything outside of\n the limits of the Synod of Kentucky.

R. L, Greek was\n chairman. At a subsequent stage of the pro\u00ac\n ceedings, Mr. Breck made a report which was\n adopted, item by item, and then adopted as a\n whole. This report is the most important pa\u00ac\n per passed on by the new and novel organiza\u00ac\n tion, because thereby its present status and\n policy are determined. It is a marvellously\n queer paper, too, as would naturally be in\u00ac\n ferred from the various little factions making\n up the factious whole, cemented together by a\n common hostility to the righteous judgments\n of the highest court of the Lord\u2019s house. It\n required no mean degree of skill in the game\n of fast and loose in drawing this pronuncia-\n mento, as well as the Pastoral Address, to\n adapt it to \u201cevery shade of opinion * in the\n Bynod.\u201d In this respect it does well. It is\n an improvement upon some other specimens\n of wordy legerdemain we wot. In guaging\n the posture of this new and self-constituted\n Synod, the future ecclesiastical historian,\n guided by the steady light of Mr. Breck ' s re\u00ac\n port, will take his stand on that interesting\n locality known as Point-no-point. With such\n a light and such a point of observation, he\n will have no difficulty in determining the\n mi tes and bounds, the plans and purposes of\n the Henderson Synod; but the report is not\n only an important one, a queer one, a remark\u00ac\n ably lucid and clever one; is a very proper\n one as well\u2014no, proper is not the word; it is\n an exceedingly dignified report. Indeed, its\n dignity surpasses even its lucidity and clever\u00ac\n ness. But the great Homer sometimes nods,\n and the 6un has its spots. If we might ven\u00ac\n ture an adverse criticism, we would say this\n Synodal paper is a little too dignified. I re\u00ac\n minds one of what a wit remarked some years\n since of the English Church\u2014 it is like to die of\n dignity. Its stateliness is freezing; it also\n borders close upon the supercilious. A preju\u00ac\n diced person might call it superbly supercili\u00ac\n ous. There is another slight blemish upon this\n deliverance to which we humbly direct the\n attention of the Synodal fathers and brethren.\n A friendly hint may lead to amendment here\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n after. It is a small spot \u2019tis true, yet easily\n discernable without aid of optic glass. Wc\n mean the air of self-complacency which runs\n through the performance. On reading it over\n with becoming care and veneration, the open\u00ac\n ing sentence of Dr. Joseph Addison Alexan\u00ac\n der\u2019s review of Colton on Episcopacy, occurred\n to us with surprising freshness. \u201cColeridge\n tells us of a man who never spoke of himself\n without first taking off his hat.\u201d Regard for\n self, delight in self-exalted notions of the part\n self has to play, the vast influence sell will\n exert in the world\u2014these crop out rather too\n prominently. \u201c This Synod; \" u the Synod ;\u201d \u201cthis\n bodyfi looms up in grand proportions before\n the eye of self. The Spartans birched their\n children, not because they stole, but because\n they were detected in the theft. The brethren\n who met at Henderson ought to have remem\u00ac\n bered the frailty of poor human nature. We\n all think well of ourselves\u2014we do not blame\n them for that. But just because we do think\n well of ourselves\u2014perhaps too highly\u2014we do\n not like to see others distend themselves too\n proudly. It offends our self-esteem. It is un\u00ac\n wise, therefore, to thrust the sense we cherish\n of our own importance before the eyes of men.\n They do not blame us for feeling big, for\n thinking big things are in us, and will come\n out of us, for magnifying in our own hearts\n the high destiny before us; but they have no\n patience with us when we allow ourselves to\n be detected in these little sillinesses; much\n less when we vain-gloriously parade them in\n the face of the sun.\n</p>\n<p>\n The new Synod affects the roll of mediator.\n \u201cIt is the purpose of this body to shape action\n with reference to that desire, [\u00ab re-union under\n the General Assembly of all sound Presbyterians ]\n and to the fact that, in the Providence of God,\n this body stands in a position towards both\n sections of the Church, which specially quali\u00ac\n fies it for the work of mediation between them.\u201d\n No doubt of it; some individuals and some\n bodies think themselves qualified for any\u00ac\n thing. This statement calls not so much for\n animadversion, as it awakens disgust or pro\u00ac\n vokes laughter, according to the state of a\n man\u2019s digestive apparatus.

Did\n a more insane idea ever enter the head of a\n bedlamite? Special mediatorial qualifications\n of a body whose leaders are to-day under ac\u00ac\n tual process for slander, rebellion and schism!\n Well, this is a grotesque, indeed. For, be it\n observed, the object of the mediation is to\n bring about a re-union under the General As\u00ac\n sembly of the Presbyterian Church in the\n United States of America. That they do pos\u00ac\n sess certain qualifications so far as one of the\n disatfeoted parties is concerned, no man can\n deny. W T ho does not know that the \u201cSouthern\n Churches are understood to sympathise fully\n with this Synod,\u201d and that \u201cthis Synod\u201d sym\u00ac\n pathises fully with those Churches ? And who\n does not understand that a straight-forward,\n honest policy required \u201cthis Synod\u201d to cast in\n its lot at once with those Churches, just as Dr.\n Robinson urged in one of the interlocutory\n meetings ? Rut what on earth could have sug\u00ac\n gested to any member of \u201cthis Synod\u201d that\n they were qualified to mediate at all between\n the grand old Church they have maligned, and\n anybody else? Genius and insanity are said\n to be separated by a narrow boundary. The\n inventions of the one, and the fantastic com\u00ac\n binations of the other, puzzle alike a plain\n understanding. We leave it to a greater psy\u00ac\n chologist than we, to determine whether the\n notion of \u201cthis Synod\u2019s\u2019\u2019 mediation be a pro\u00ac\n duct of genius or of insanity. But this work\n of mediation on the part of these gentlemen of\n \u201csuperior moderation,\u201d says the report is to be\n between the two \u201csections of the Church.\u201d\n Sections of what Church ? Our Church is a\n compact body. There are no sections of it,\n unless the quiddity , that undefinable something\n constituted at Henderson, be a section. What\n that body is, and whether in the Church or out\n of the Church, are questions in hot debate.\n We say they are out, they say they are in.\n Perhaps the best solution ad interim , is to con\u00ac\n sider them a section, a fragment not complete\u00ac\n ly severed as yet from the great mass. Do\n they consider the Presbyterian Church in the\n United States , as our old associates of the South\n call their recent organization, a section of our\n Church? That, too, is a compact body, one\n Church, with the appointments of a distinct\n denomination. The report indeed speaks of\n the \u201cSouthern Churches,\u201d as if these were\n small bodies of Christian people lying around\n looso; whereas they have been constituted into\n one body. There are no sections of it\u2014unless\n \u201cthis Synod\u201d.be a section of the said Church;\n for it is of it, though not in it. We find, then,\n two distinct Churches, not two sections of one\n Church. The only thing answering to a section\n seems to be \u201cthis Synod,\u201d and it a section of\n both Churches. It is in the one, as it claims,\n though not of it; it is of the other, yet not in\n it. It must be a section, and an odd section,\n too; but where are the sections between which\n it proposes to mediate? They\u201dare purely im\u00ac\n aginary. Still we are not a little curious to\n</p>\n<p>\n see the work of mediation begin. When it is\n over, whatever it be, the readers of the min\u00ac\n utes of \u201cthis Synod\u201d will take up the old ditty:\n \u201cParturient monies , nascitur ridiculus mus,\u201d It\n will prove as abortive even as it is absurd, as\n the Kentucky mediation at the outset of the\n rebellion. The gulf that now separates the\n two denominations, is too broad and too deep\n to be bridged overby such workmen. More\u00ac\n over, that gulf is, in no small degree, the work\n of their own hands.\n</p>\n<p>\n The terms used in this part of the report, as\n we have seen, are foolish and deceptive; but\n there is an idea , partially concealed, indeed,\n but discoverable on a little scrutiny. That\n idea is this: Play the fast and loose game as\n long as practicable; though in defiant rebel\u00ac\n lion against the Church, hang on; gather up\n as many as possible of the \u201cconservative min\u00ac\n isters and people in the Northern Assembly,\u201d\n and then strike a bee-line for the Southern\n Assembly. That is the kind of mediation we\n are to look for. Dr. Robinson, bold and dash\u00ac\n ing as he is, wished to go at once; but his com\u00ac\n peers over-ruled him. They wished to mediate\n awhile.\n</p>\n<p>\n We close with calling attention to the follow\u00ac\n ing statement in Mr. Breck\u2019s report: \u201cOn the\n other hand, this Synod has held that the\n Southern Churches, being driven into a sepa\u00ac\n ration from us by the unwise and unconstitu\u00ac\n tional acts of our General Assembly, and by\n circumstances beyond their control, are, there\u00ac\n fore, not schismatical.\u201d We were amazed\n when we first read these words, and immedi\u00ac\n ately examined carefully the minutes of the\n Synod of Kentucky for \u201961, \u201903, \u201964, and \u201965.\n (There was no meeting in 1802, but two in\n 1863.) When and where, we ask, did the\n Synod hold that doctrine? w\u00a7 affirm it has\n held directly the opposite, and make the issue\n squarely with Mr. Breck and his Synod. The\n only deliverance the Synod of Kentucky ever\n made upon the matter now in question, was in\n 1861. It is in these words:\n</p>\n<p>\n (2.) \u201c The schism which followed the action of\n the Assembly. This Synod deplores the schism\n which has occurred in those States in which,\n as before said, it was impossible for the Pres\u00ac\n byterian people to keep the day of prayer or\u00ac\n dered by the Assembly. While, in this de\u00ac\n plorable schism, this Synod sees a sad proof\n of the want of wisdom in that action of the\n Assembly, which has been a chief pretext of\n it, it decidedly condemns the schism itself, as\n being without sufficient justification, and in\n its results, portentious of incalculable evil.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Now here is an express deliverance of the\n Synod\u2019s judgment of the conduct of the South\u00ac\n ern Presbyterians. It is clear and emphatic.\n The Synod says it decidedly condemns the schism\n as being without sufficient justification. Mr.\n Breck and his associates affirm that the Synod\n has held that the Southern Cnurches are not\n schismatical. Let him reconcile these proposi\u00ac\n tions who can.

This is, however, a\n matter of small moment: the signers of it are\n the responsible parties. The document itself\n is by no means a formidable one, and is destin\u00ac\n ed, we presume, to make but little impression\n upon the minds of the \u201cPresbyterian people of\n Kentucky,\u201d it is feeble and vapid in style, be\u00ac\n traying upon the part of the writer an utter\n deficiency in those high qualities of composi\u00ac\n tion, without which the best thoughts fall\n powerless upon the ear. There are no \u201cwing\u00ac\n ed words;\u201d no barbed arrows; nothing sharp,\n clear, terse. It is a dull, sluggish, turbid\n stream of words\u2014a muddy brook flowing\n through a flat alluvian, whose current, whether\n North or Sonth, can scarce be discriminated.\n The popular mind is not aroused by an ad\u00ac\n dress of this order. The heart is in sympathy\n with the mountain torrent, clear and sparkling,\n leaping, dashing, rushing to its appointed\n goal. This paper presents a singular lack of\n the art of condensation, the power of present\u00ac\n ing a case in a series of succint, luminous\n statements. In this respect it is in marvelous\n contrast with the one which the Rev. J. E.\n Spilman and Chas. A. Masliall, Esq., lately\n put forth. Whether its views, therefore, be\n correct or incorrect, its counsels wise or fool\u00ac\n ish, we do not think it will exert an appreci\u00ac\n able influence on the questions at issue. The\n brethren who met at Lexington, were not happy\n in their spokesman. An unskillful leader\n damages the best of causes; and when a man\n aspires to the position of a leader, or is put\n forward as such by h s fellows, it should be\n carefully considered by both him and them\n whether he has the requisite endowments.\n The moulding of public sentiment demands the\n hand of a master. The work of a bungler is\n no where more apparent than just here. To\n lead men, to lead them successfully, is a rare\n gift. A mere ambition to lead neither implies\n nor developesthe power. A man may succeed\n well in the quiet walks of the pastoral care;\n he may train the ycung with a clever degree\n of skill, yet prove totally insufficient 10 grapple\n witii strong men in times of high excitement.\n Tc convince the judgment, to sway the.passions,\n</p>\n<p>\n to form the opinions of earnest men at an hour\n when church and country both are rocked to\n their foundations\u2014this is no child\u2019s play, no\n place for any but a strong, a delicate, and a\n dexterous hand. Longspun platitudes of un\u00ac\n supported assumption^ inconsequental reason\u00ac\n ings, and feeble exhortations, do not reach the\n mark. Never in the history of our Church was\n there a more imperious call than now for\n masters of sentences , as well as clear heads and\n stouts hearts. The brethren who met at Lex\u00ac\n ington were not happy in their selection (or\n their acceptance?) of a leader.\n</p>\n<p>\n Considered as an argument , if indeed it can\n be admitted to rise to the dignity of an argu\u00ac\n ment, this paper is one of the loosest and most\n illogical we have met with during the recent\n discussions in the Church. It is made up of\n gratuitous assumptions, unwarranted infer\u00ac\n ences, and the grossest forms of the petitio\n principii. The wonder is that so many respect\u00ac\n able and educated gentlemen could be induced\n to attach their names to it. And the explanation\n of this, we suppose, is to be found in fact that\n they agreed, m > re or less heartily, in the policy\n proposed, and did not stop to observe the raw\n and unkillful drawing of the paper. Consid\u00ac\n ered as an appeal to the Christian conscience,\n it is lamer, if possible, than in its attempts at\n reasoning. If there is little brains in it, there '\n i 3 still less heart. Whoever the writer may be,\n it is evident his strength does not lie in this\n line The truth is, no man can awaken the\n profounder and nobler emotions of the human\n soul who is incapable of them himself. He\n must be more than a pious man; for faith may\n exist as a grain of mustard-seed. He must be\n a man of generous, tender sensibilities\u2014in\n sweetest sympathy with what is purest and\n loveliest in our renewed natures. None other\n can sweep the chords and \u201cwake to ecstacy the\n living lyre.\u201d The futile attempts of others\n expose them to ridicule. Placid self-esteem,\n and cool audacity, may effect much even on\n important occasions, and in assemblies of able\n men. These may induce persons of quite\n ordinary talents to essay great things, and\n with favoring circumstances, may enable them\n to achieve wonders. Men of real merit and\n capacity are generally slow to put themselves\n forward. They have greatness thrust upon\n them. They do not affect conspicuous station,\n they are forced into it. They are fitted for it,\n and without self-seeking fall heir to it. But\n self-esteem and audacity are not associated\n with profound emotion and tender sensibility;\n and these cannot be successfully counterfeited.\n Poeia nascitur, non fit. A man must be endow\u00ac\n ed by nature with a susceptibility of pure and\n deep emotion himself if he would excite it in\n the breasts of others. Stimulated pathos is all\n in vain; and both hateful and ludicrous be\u00ac\n sides. The pretender, too, is sure to be re\u00ac\n marked. Our author is no exception. His cold,\n cautious, calculating nature, is quite apparent\n to a discerning reader. His sighing and la\u00ac\n mentation awaken no response.

There is no difficulty in dis\u00ac\n covering it. Those who attended and watched\n the proceedings of the Synod at Danville, in\n 1864, will at once detect it. Indeed this pa\u00ac\n per reveals clearly what was only cautiously\n insinuated in speeches made on the floor of\n that Synod. The last paragraph tells the\n whole story. \u201cBehold how good and how\n pleasant for brethren to dwell together in\n unity\u201d ! But the unity aimed at is that of the\n Synod of Kentucky , not of the Presbyterian\n Church in the United States of America.\n \u201cSeverance from a venerable Assembly which\n in time past we have regarded with perhaps\n sinful pride,\u201d would be \u201cpainful.\u201d No doubt\n of it; but that may be endured, the writer\n thinks, provided the Synod can be held to\u00ac\n gether. A division of the Synod, and division\n of our churches, would be calamitous; but\n separation from the church of our fathers in\n which we were born, and in which we have\n lived to this present hour, would be still more\n calamitous. The unity of the Synod upon the\n basis oj adherence to the General Assembly , to\n the whole Church ,\u2014this is our motto; for this\n we have labored and do labor still; for this\n we have made sacrifices even to the verge of\n our profoundest convictions of truth and duty.\n Here we stand, and here we intend to stand.\n The Presbyterian Church, not the Synod of Ken\u00ac\n tucky, is the body of Christ to us. If any\n propose to make a schism in that body, let\n them do it; but they must excuse us for de\u00ac\n clining to become partakers of their sin. If\n any are determined to go out of the Church,\n to assume an independent position, either tem\u00ac\n porary or permanent, or to unite with the\n Southern Assembly, the door is open, but we\n cannot follow them. Our doctrine is, preserve\n our Church relations intact all round \u2014in the\n individual church, in the Synod, in the entire\n body. This is true conservatism. If wrong\n has been done, let it be righted; but we deny\n that sufficient cause has arisen, or is likely to\n arise, for sundering any of our existing re\u00ac\n lations. If extreme men are bent on radical\n measures, we shall take no part with them.\n If the integrity of the church is destroyed, the\n responsibility shall not rest on our shoulders.\n If the ploughshare of division is run through\n our congregations, we shall not drive it. Let\n them bear the blame who are striving to tear\n these congregations away from their old moor\u00ac\n ings. We shall stand still, and urge others to\n do likewise. We revere the Synod of Ken\u00ac\n tucky, but we revere the whole church more.\n The fellowship of God\u2019s people in our whole\n</p>\n<p>\n communion is dear to us. We repudiate the\n idea of setting up a little independent con\u00ac\n cern in the State of Kentucky, cut off from\n organic union with the thousands of Israel. We\n are asked to sever ourselves from the great\n Synods North and East of us\u2014Baltimore,\n Philadelphia, New York, New Jersey; from all\n the institutions of the great Church which we\n have hitherto delighted to call ours, and in\n whose bosom we have found salvation; from\n all participation in the goodly heritage laid up\n for us by our fathers. And all for what? To\n stand out in the cold by ourselves! This is\n the fare to which we are invited. \u201cIf our\n present connection with the General Church\n shall fail us, it is our purpose, as we fear God,\n to have it no fault of ours; and we propose to\n seek no other.\u201d Well, that is silly. Propose\n to seek no other! Do you not believe in the\n communion of saints? Do y r ou wish to isolate\n yourselves? Better than this were it for you\n to unite at once with the Southern Assembly.\n Thither you are gravitating; and there, as you\n well know, the hearts of some of you are now\n and have been for years past. Why stop at a\n half-way house? If you cannot co-operate\n with our Assembly, go into that other\u2014unless,\n perchance, you prefer the New School. But\n go somewhere; go where you can be contented,\n happy, and useful ( ; where you will not be eter\u00ac\n nally chafed by the ecclesiastical misdeeds of\n Yankees, Radicals, and Abolitionists, Go\n where you can live in peace and spend your\n strength in building up Zion, instead of being\n obliged to waste your energies in a fruitless\n war. If, after having entered up your protest\n against what you conceive to be wrong, you\n cannct stand quietly in your lot and work\n with the old Church, go elsewhere. It will be\n better for your own souls, better for the cause\n of Christ. Let us have rest. We do not wish\n to part with you, but wc cannot go with you;\n we cannot leave the old homestead; we cannot\n forsake the fellowship of our brethren num\u00ac\n bered by hundreds of thousands all over this\n broad land. You must not ask us to break\n the unity of the Church, to divide the body of\n Christ, even to please you. We cennot do it.\n The platform you ask us to stand on is too nar\u00ac\n row. What! give up the Presbyterian Church\n in the United States of America for a little in\u00ac\n dependent organization in the central region\n of Kentucky\u2014a mere abortion of a church !\n Oh, no, brethren\u2014do not do it yourselves.

On the one hand the unity of the\n whole Church, on the other the efficacy of every\n particular element of it is perfectly secured :\n and all that is lacking is some application of\n this wonderful organization, by which a tri\u00ac\n bunal like that in the congregation, shall ex\u00ac\n ist for the whole of the Church considered as\n one, and tribunals like both of these shall ex\u00ac\n ist between the first and the last, the smallest\n and the greatest, as necessity may demand.\n This 1 will now explain. * * *\n</p>\n<p>\n It is by toe union of many of fhes^ particu\u00ac\n lar congregations, with their tribunals, and\n by the erection ot a tribunal over the united\n body, similar to the one that exists in each of\n them; that the Church preserves its outward\n unity, and extends its government as its own\n area enlarges, and its members increase. It\n is immaterial what the number of these united\n congregations may be, three, a hundred, or\n any convenient number. The model of this\n application of the principles of the government\n already existed from the origin of the Church,\n probably in every large city, certainly in Je-\n lusalem, Antioch and others; where numerous\n unfixed congregations, although worshipping\n statedly apart, belonged fora time to the same\n organized Church under the control of its sin\u00ac\n gle but numerous tribunal. So that the tran\u00ac\n sition to a similar union of the numerous fixed\n and organized congregations, and the erection\n of a tribunal over them all which should be\n exactly like the tribunal of each, indeed, con\u00ac\n stituted by uniting the whole of the particular\n tribunals or a select portion of each one* was\n a perfectly obvious mode by which the united\n congregations might have mutual counsel and\n assistance, might more effectually preserve\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0071/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 321, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0071/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 642, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0071/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1285, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0071/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2570, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0071/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ge/ne/ra/la/ss/em/bl/yi/00/al/le/generalassemblyi00alle/generalassemblyi00alle_0071.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2570, "levels": 6, "size": 728532}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"71\">\n<p>\n 71\n</p>\n<p>\n the doctrine and execute the discipline of the\n Church, might preserve the organic unity of\n the whole as the body of Christ of which all\n are parts, and might augment by union of\n counsel and effort the efficient working of the\n whole in perfecting and extending the King\u00ac\n dom of God. What is asserted is, that this\n part of the Organization of the Church, which\n seems to be so natural, so obvious, and so wise,\n is also Apostolical and divine; that this union\n of congregations is as thoroughly according to\n the will of God, as the union of individuals in\u00ac\n to congregations is; and the control of the\n tribnnal of the united congregations as real\n over all the congregations and all their special\n tribunals, as the rule of each particular tribu\u00ac\n nal is over the congregation in which it is\n erected. * * * -\u00bb *\n</p>\n<p>\n The union of any number of classical Pres\u00ac\n byteries as such, three, fifty, a hundred, crea\u00ac\n tes a Synod covering them all; composed of\n the same office bearers organized in the same\n way, and with the same power and jurisdic\u00ac\n tion over all, that each had over part. By\n taking the members of this third court or Sy\u00ac\n nod immediately from the first one or Church\n session, it may be made a very numerous bo\u00ac\n dy ; or by taking them from the second court,\n or Presbytery strictly so called, and applying\n the principle of representation of the whole\n Presbytery by a small part of its members,\n the Synod may be a very small body. It is\n perfectly suitable therefore, either to be the\n permanent head of a denomination of Chris\u00ac\n tians, or of a national Church; or to be one of\n a series of tribunals, the supreme one of which\n shall be above it. The scriptural warrant for\n this tribunal has been as fully set forth, and\n its nature as fully considered, in the examina\u00ac\n tion I have already made of the Synod consti\u00ac\n tuted at Jerusalem concerning Gentile Circum\u00ac\n cision, as my limits permit. And now, sup\u00ac\n posing the extent of the Church in any way,\n or its interests of any sort, to demand a tribu\u00ac\n nal still higlior than the Synod, the same divine\n organizat ion and principles apply perfectly,and\n with the same result: and a universal council\n of any number of Churches can be constituted\n for a special purpose ; or a General Assembly\n of any separate Church, whither denomination\u00ac\n al or national, can be constituted as a perma\u00ac\n nent tribunal, without departing in the least\n particular from the divine model, or from the\n divine precepts. If the General Assembly is\n to be numerous, that is effected by making the\n Presbyters who compose it the representatives\n of Presbyteries: if it is to be comparatively\n small, that is effected by making the Presby\u00ac\n ters who compose it the representatives of\n Synods. It is the tribunal of the whole\n Chnrch; it is the whole Church in one Assem\u00ac\n bly by its office bearers, exactly as a Church\n session is aparticular Church met by its office\n bearers ; and the jurisdiction and power of the\n supreme tribunal over all, are of the same na\u00ac\n ture and have the same divine warrant as the\n jurisdiction and the power of the tribunals be\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n low it over,the parts which they respectively\n rule. Tke goverment of the Church, therefore\n is a free representatives goverment: it is not\n a tyrauny like popery, ncr an oligarchy like\n Prelacy, nor a pure democracy like Indepen\u00ac\n dency. It is in its conception perfect no matter\n how small: perfect, no matter how widely ex\u00ac\n panded : perfect at every intermediate a point\n between a small company and the whole race\n of man.\u2014[Dr. Breckinridge ' s Theology, vol.\n ii., Chapter 31]\n</p>\n<p>\n The Power of the General Assembly.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Editor: In a preceding article I proved\n by documents which are wholly unanswerable,\n that, historically, the General Assembly did\n not originate with the Presbyteries. I had\n then proposed to myself to consider, in another\n article, the extent and origin of its power.\n Since sending my first article to the Western\n Presbyterian, I have read with greater or less\n attention, Dr. Wilson\u2019s speech, the document\n issued by a convention held at Lexington, and\n the Report\u2014so called\u2014of the Commissioners\n to the last Assembly from the Presbytery of\n Ebenezer. I have also seen the article of Dr.\n Ilodge in the Biblical Repertory for July. A\n perusal of these documents may cause me to\n give to the discussion of the topic under con\u00ac\n sideration, a somewhat different form from that\n first proposed. It is one of the numerous proofs\n that the professions of standing wholly aloof\n from politics, so persistently and ostentatiously\n paraded by the leaders of the schismatic party,\n are utterly unfounded; that in their efforts to\n promote a revolt from the General Assembly,\n they are forced to adopt a Church theory, al\u00ac\n most identical with ihe exploded doctrine of\n \u201cState rights,\u201d broached by those who sought\n to produce a division of the nation. Why, Mr.\n Editor, when we read that the General Assem\u00ac\n bly is a body of limited powers\u2014that the pow\u00ac\n ers which it possesses it derives by delegation\n from the Presbyteries\u2014that these are the sources\n of all Church power, & c , & c. We seem to have\n stepped by mistake into an old nullification\n caucus, only the words \u201cFederal Government, \"\n and \u201cSovereign States \" being displaced by\n other terms. These brethren may think them\u00ac\n selves entirely removed from the sphere of\n politics. But when lookers on see how in\u00ac\n stinctively the secessionists of the State become\n schismatics in the Church; and how inevitably\n they resort to the same theory of Church pow\u00ac\n er, that in its application to politics, was the\n cause of the late rebellion in the nation, they\n can not but smile at the self delusion, or scorn\n the insincerity of such pretences.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is, running through all the arguments\n on the other side, a great deal of loose talk or\n \u201ctwaddle, \" as Mr. Robinson s \u201c Gritic \" calls it,\n about the Assembly\u2019s being \u201ca delegated body. \"\n So, to some extent, in every Church court above\n the Church session, and even in it \u201cruling\n elders are properly the representatives of the\n people.\u201d Porm of Goy. p.

To what\n end. then, the reiteration of the phrase \u201c def\u00ac\n eated body\u201d as applied to the Assembly ? Is\n it to convey, by indirection, to those who have\n no t thought on these subjects, the idea that\n the lower courts are the sources of power in the\n Church; and that the powers of the Assembly\n are delegated to it by the Presbyteries? A\n great deal of what the renouncers of the As\u00ac\n sembly write, looks as if this were the object.\n Dr. Wilson says expressly: \u201c The only Assembly\n th at is essential to a Presbyterian Church is the\n Church Session. This is the fountain from which\n all the other Assemblies derive their power f A\n more complete renunciation of the Presbyteri-\n a n system of Church government, in fay or of\n indedependency; or a more thoroughly false\n and heretical view of the source of the powers\n of Church courts, could scarcely be expressed\n in the same number of words.\n</p>\n<p>\n I. The Assembly does not derive its powers from\n any inferior court. The idea is an absurdity in\n itself. The Lord Jesus Christ, as the only\n King and Head of his Church, is the source of\n all Church power. This power is not entrusted\n to a single Church court to be, by the members\n thereof delegated to other courts; but each\n court alike, from the session to the General\n Assembly, derives its powers for itself, im\u00ac\n mediately, from Christ. Dr. Stuart Robinson,\n in other days, had a glimpse of this funda\u00ac\n mental truth, when he tells us: \u201cThe same\n power is in every tribunal that is in any tribunal,\n whilst the power of the greater part is over the\n smaller part .\u201d (Church of God, p. 92.) A much\n higher authority has expressed the true idea\n in these terms. \u201cThe jurisdiction and power\n of the supreme tribunal over all, are of the\n same nature, and have the same divine warrant as\n the jurisdiction and the power of the tribunals\n below it over the parts which they respective\u00ac\n ly rule.\u201d The powers of the Assembly, then,\n are in no other sense delegated, in no other\n sense derived powers, than those of Presbyte\u00ac\n ries and other Church courts. All of them,\n when met in his name, have, directly from the\n Master himself, all power to rule the part of\n his Church entrusted to their care.\n</p>\n<p>\n II. I ' he Assembly does not derive its powers from\n the Constitution of the Church. Here again is\n much looseness of thought and language in the\n discussions of brethren. I shall not attempt 10\n elaborate this point, after the masterly treat\u00ac\n ment of it by Dr. Hodge; already, 1 think,\n published in the Western Presbyterian. If the\n plain distinction which he makes between a\n constitution as a grant of power, and a Con\u00ac\n stitution as a treaty or agreement as to how\n the several courts shall exercise the powers\n which they derive from Christ, were kept con\u00ac\n stantly in view, it would relieve the discussion\n of these subjects of much confusion. With re\u00ac\n ference to any act of any Church court, the\n question is not, has this court the right to per\u00ac\n form this act, by the express terms of the Con\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n stitution, or a necessary inference from them?\n But does the Constitution forbid the exercise of\n this power ? If not, then it has the right for\n \u201cEvery Church court has within its limits, all\n Church powers .\u201d (Dr. Hodge.)\n</p>\n<p>\n III. The General Assembly has, in certain cases,\n original jurisdiction. This follows necessarily\n from the theory of Church power. If \u201cthe same\n poweris in every tribunal that is in any tribu\u00ac\n nal, while the power of the greater is over the\n power of the smaller part,\u201d as Dr. Stuart Robin\u00ac\n son once held and taught; the power of original\n jurisdiction in the Assembly necessarily results,\n else, there would be a power in the Presbytery\n not possessed by the General Assembly, which\n directly contradicts the doctrine. It may be\n replied, that although this be true, in theory ,\n yet, in fact, such power does not belong to the\n General Assembly, because by the Constitution,\n it is forbidden to exercise it. To the extent\n that such power was claimed and exercised by\n the late Assembly, it is denied that there is any\n such Constitutional prohibition. And just\n here, issue is joined. Now what says the Con\u00ac\n stitution? 1st, there is much in the language\n used, which implies the existence of such pow\u00ac\n er in the Assembly. Let me quote:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c The General Assembly is the highest judi\u00ac\n catory of the Presbyterian Church. It shall\n represent, in one body, all the particular Church\u00ac\n es of this denomination.\u201d (p.425.) Not Synods,\n nor Presbyteries, but Churches , observe. Again,\n \u201cthey\u201d (the Assembly) \u201cshall constitute the\n bond of union, peace, correspondence, and\n mutual confidence among all our Churches.\u201d\n (p. 426\u2014the same phraseology as before.) Not\n to Synods simply, cr Presbyteries \u2014not to the\n whole body, regarded as bound together by\n these lower courts; the Assembly being the\n bond of the courts themselves, but to \u201call the\n Churches \u201d the Assembly is to constitute the\n bond of union.

We must inter\u00ac\n pret the various clauses of the Constitution so\n as to make them consistent with each other,\n and with truths elsewhere taught. Thisplaiu\n principle, these brethren all overlook.\n</p>\n<p>\n Well, what, then is the meaning of the pro\u00ac\n vision that \u201cprocess against a gospel minister\n shall always be entered before the Presbytery\n of which he is a member?\u201d Simply this: 1st.\n A minister must be tried by his peers. A\n Church Session, therefore, shall not assume\n jurisdiction over a minister, lie is amenable\n to his Presbytery. And, 2nd, No distant Pres-\n hyiery can put a minister on trial before them,\n though the offence may have been committed\n within their bounds. His co-Presbyters are\n to be his judges. It is not then the right of\n the Assembly > o exercise jurisdiction in those\n cases distinct from appeals and references, and\n d istinct from review and control which have\n been before referred to, that is here denied ;\n but the right of any court lower than the Pres\u00ac\n bytery, or any distant Presbytery, to assume\n jurisdiction over a minister. That this is the\n true meaning of the clause is evident. 1st.\n From the original form of the provision as it\n stands in \u201cThe form of Process in the judica\n tures of the Church of Scotland, in Stuart of\n Pardovan\u2019s \u201cCollections,\u201d chap. 7. \u201cAll pro\u00ac\n cesses against any minister are to begin be\u00ac\n fore the Presbytery to which he belongeth,\n and not before the kirk session of hit own parish.\u201d\n And 2nd, from the connection in which it stands\n iu our Book itself. It ie said in the same sec\u00ac\n tion, p. 466; \u201cand the same candor, caution,\n</p>\n<p>\n & c., substituting only the Presbytery for the\n Session,\u201d & c. And in the immediate^ suc\u00ac\n ceeding section, rules are laid down to regular e\n \u2018proceedings in case of the \u201cfacts with which\n a minister stands charged, happening without\n the bounds of his own 1\u2018resbyteryf Still, even\n in that case, \u201cprocess is always to be entered\n befo ' -e the Presbytery of which he is a mem\u00ac\n ber.\u201d I am sure that any candid mind, look\u00ac\n ing at this clause in its immediate connection,\n an in its relation to other provisions of cur\n Book, will arrive at the conclusion that there is\n nothing in it, fairly interpreted, which pro\u00ac\n hibits to the Assembly the power of original\n jurisdiction. 3rd. The practice of the Church\n of Scotland, as well as that of our own Church,\n shows that the power of original jurisdiction\n has always belonged to the General Assembly.\n</p>\n<p>\n But I have already trespassed too far, and\n must reserve what belongs to this head for an\u00ac\n other article. t\n</p>\n<p>\n The General Assembly and the Presbyteries .\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Editor: There are two assprtions con\u00ac\n tinually repeated by our brethren who have\n seceded from the General Assembly, which, if\n I read aright, are directly in the teeth of all\n documentary evidence in the case.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1st. That Presbyteries are prior to the Gen\u00ac\n eral Assembly in point of time, and when\n they became numerous, organized the Assem\u00ac\n bly, so that the Assembly is the creature of the\n Presbyteries.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2nd. That the Presbyteries are the sources\n of power, and that the Assembly being a dele\u00ac\n gated body, can exercise no powers except\n such as have been explicitly conferred upon it\n by the Presbyteries or incidental powers, es\u00ac\n sential to the proper exercise of those explicit\u00ac\n ly granted. As to the first point we must not\n be misled by the ambiguity of words. The\n word \u201cPresbytery\u201d is ambiguous. Strictly, it\n means a body of elders. In this, its original\n signification, it is applicable to every Church\n court composed of ruling and teaching elders.\n The Session is a congregational Presbytery ;\n the Synod is a provincial Presbytery; the\n General Assembly is a national Presbytery ; a\n general council, if composed of ministers and\n ruling elders, might, with perfect propriety,\n be called au ecumenical Presbytery. But.\n while the term Presbytery is thus applicable\n to every Church court, in ordinary discourse,\n it is used to describe the court no . t above the\n Session, called the Classis by ;3i Reformed\n Churches of the continent.\n</p>\n<p>\n The term \u201cAssembly,\u201d we may remark, is\n likewise ambiguous, and may in like manner\n be applied to every Church court from the low\u00ac\n est to tlie highest. If proof of this were want\u00ac\n ing, we might refer to 2d Book of Discipline,\n Chap. 7, Sec. 2:\u2014\u201cAssemblies a;e of four\n soriis & c.; and to Form of Government, chap,\n b, sec. 1, where express mention is made of\n \u201cCongregational, Presbyterial, and Synodical\n Assemblies.\u201d Commonly, however, the term\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0074/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0074/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0074/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0074/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0074/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ge/ne/ra/la/ss/em/bl/yi/00/al/le/generalassemblyi00alle/generalassemblyi00alle_0074.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 803335}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"74\">\n<p>\n 74\n</p>\n<p>\n Assembly is applied to the highest Church\n Court.\n</p>\n<p>\n The question raised by our seceding breth\u00ac\n ren is one, not of words, but of fact. It is not\n whether a body called a Presbytery existed in\n our country prior to a body called an Assembly,\n which point no one cares to controvert, be\u00ac\n cause when decided, we are no nearer a con\u00ac\n clusion than before, all the courts, botn high\n and low, being equally Presbyteries and As\u00ac\n semblies. But the question is whether the\n original Presbytery corresponded, in idea and\n functions, to a classical Assembly, or to a na\u00ac\n tional Assembly ; whether that original Pres\u00ac\n bytery was a subordinate court, which, by some\n strange and happy endowment, possessed the\n power of creating bodies superior to itself; or\n whether it was in fact the supreme judicatory\n of our infant Church, which, by powers in\u00ac\n herent in it as such, created a Synod, com\u00ac\n posed of three or more Presbyteries ; the said\n Synod also being in time subdivided, and pro\u00ac\n visions being made for subordinate Synods,\n and the organization of the General Assem\u00ac\n bly.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, on this plain question of fact, we ask\n attention to a few authorities. The first is\n from Baird\u2019s Digest, p. 276. \u201cThe General\n Assembly is not a body created by voluntary\n union of Presbyteries and Synods, as is some\u00ac\n times assumed ; but itself the original body,\n whence they have derived their existence and\n powers. The first General Assembly of the\n Church of Scotland consisted of six ministers\n and thirty-four other persons, spontaneously\n met, and constituting at once the highest ju\u00ac\n dicatory ot the Church, and the only one\n above the Parochial Presbytery. Precisely\n analagous was the origin of our General As\u00ac\n sembly.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This author goes on to state that the first\n leaf of the original minutes being lost, we can\u00ac\n not be sure of the precise date of the organi\u00ac\n zation, or the particular persons who com\u00ac\n posed the first meeting. The date, as lie\n shows, was probably 1704, and he gives, the\n names of the ministers who sornposed the body\n in 1706. Respecting the name and powers of\n this body, 1 again quote: \u201cIt ordinarily as\u00ac\n sumed the title of 1 the Presbytery ,\u2019 never that\n of the \u2018Presbytery of Philadelphia.\u2019 It as\u00ac\n serted to itself, and was rccoguized as pos\u00ac\n sessing, not merely the functions of a particu\u00ac\n lar subordinate Presbytery, * * * but the\n powers of a supreme judicatory. * * * Its ap\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n propriate title is ' \u2022The General Presbytery. '\n</p>\n<p>\n The second authority is that of the minutes\n of this original Presbytery, as found on pp.\n 45-6, of the \u201cRecords of the Presbyterian\n Church.\u201d The date is 1716, Die Veneris, at\n three o clock, afternoon. \u201cIt having pleased\n Divine Providence so to increase our number,\n as that, * * we judge it may be more service\u00ac\n able to the interest of religion to divide our\u00ac\n selves into subordinate meetings or Presbyteries,\n constituting one annually as a Synod, * *\n</p>\n<p>\n therefore, & c , & c \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Synod thus constituted, consisted of\n three Presbyteries, with arrangements for a\n fourth, and is in terms recogLized as the same\n body as the original Presbytery. In 1 ? 41 a\n schism occurred in this Synod, two Synods be\u00ac\n ing formed; but in 1758 these Synods were\n re-united, and formed the supreme judicatory\n of the Church until 1789. I quote from the\n minutes of the Synod of New York and Phil\u00ac\n adelphia, of date, May 19, 1786, Records, p.\n 517. \u201cThe following motion was made and\n seconded, viz: The Synod, considering the\n number and extent of the Churches under\n their care, and the inconvenience of the pres\u00ac\n ent mode of government by one Synod, re\u00ac\n solved, that this Synod will establish out of its\n own body, three or more subordinate Synods, out\n of which shall be composed a General Assembly ,\u201d\n & c., & c. A committee was appointed to pre\u00ac\n pare a plan. On the 29tli of May, 1788, that\n plan was adopted by the following resolution\n \u2014Records, pp. 547-8.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cResolved, unanimously, That this Synod\n be divided, and it is hereby divided into four\n Synods * * * and that this division\n</p>\n<p>\n shall commence on the dissolution of the pres\u00ac\n ent Synod.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cResolved , That the first meeting of the Gen\u00ac\n eral Assembly, to be constituted out of the\n above said four Synods, be held, and it is\n hereby appointed to be held on the third\n Thursday of May, 1789, in the Second Presby\u00ac\n terian Church, in the city of Philadelphia, at\n 11 o\u2019clock A. M.,\u201d & c., & c.\n</p>\n<p>\n So far is it from the truth, therefore, that the\n Assembly was organized by the Presbyteries;\n that is, the highest judicatory by the lowest,\n directly the reverse is true. The supreme ju\u00ac\n dicatory of the Church\u2018did, in 1716, divide it\u00ac\n self into a number of Presbyteries, which,\n when met in annual session, was to b \u2022 styled\n a Synod ; and again, in 1788, the Synod, then\n the highest court, divided itself into four sub\u00ac\n ordinate Synods, and resolved that out of the\n said subordinate Synods, there should be con\u00ac\n stituted the General Assembly. The last au\u00ac\n thority with which I must conclude, and defer\n what I have to say upon the second point, is\n from the u Presbyterial Critic ,\u201d for August,\n 1855. I quote from pp. 849-50: Notwith\u00ac\n standing all the twaddle about the limited,\n delegated, and defined power of the General\n Assembly\u2014the Presbyteries being the source\n of all its powers, & c., & c., these following\n facts are thoroughly fundamental and undeni\u00ac\n able :\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c1st.

Stuart Robinson, in\n 1855 substantially agreed with the writer in\n holding that the talk of the limited, delegated,\n and defined powers of the General Assembly,\n the Presbyteries being the source of all its\n powers, was twaddle \u2014that it is a thoroughly\n fundamental and undeniable fact, that the\n General Assembly is the real depository of all\n the powers vested by God in our Presbyterian\n Churdi\u2014that the Assembly has all the inhe\u00ac\n rent power over the whole body that any part\n has over itself; and that the General Assem\u00ac\n bly is ordained of God, and God\u2019s Bible the\n source whence it derives its powers.

We can hear the\n Church only as we can hear it speaking\n through its divinely appointed representatives.\n \u201cIt [the General Assembly] is the tribunal of\n the whole Church; it is the whole Church met\n in one Assembly of its office-bearers, exactly\n as a Church session is a particular Church met\n by its office-bearers; and the jurisdiction and\n power of the supreme tribunal over all, are of\n the same nature, and have the same divine\n warrant as the jurisdiction and the power of\n the tribunals below it over the parts which\n they respectively rule.\u201d [Breckinridge s The\u00ac\n ology.) This is the doctrine taught in the\n Danville Theological Seminary before it had\n apostatized, forsooth, from the principles it was\n founded to uphold and propagate. Who is the\n real apostate from these principles, let the\n teachings of the Free Christian Commonwealth\n attest. Whatever powers, then, Christ has\n granted to his Church, belong to the General\n Assembly; and there is no restriction upon\n the exercise of these powers further than is\n expressly imposed by the Constitution. These\n powers are derived from Christ, and set forth\n in His word. lie is the fountain of power\u2014\n not the Presbyteries. Whatever the Church\n may lawfully do, the Assembly may do. The\n limitations, whatever they be, put upon the\n exercise of its powers, are of the nature of\n economical arrangements for the orderly and\n convenient administration of government.\n Why not a Synod or the Assembly examine\n and ordain a man? There is no reason in the\n nature of the thing to be done, why these tri\u00ac\n bunals may not do it; but for the sake of con\u00ac\n venience this work is assigned to the Presby\u00ac\n teries. And it would be very difficult to show\n that, even under cur Constitution, the higher\n tribunals may not. exercise this power of ordi\u00ac\n nation, or any other, should they see cause to\n do so. The Federal Government has no power\n not specified in the Constitution; the supreme\n tribunal of the Church has all the power\n Christ has granted to the Church, and that\n Church may not tie its own hands.

Dr. Wilson lias already left the\n Presbytery out in the cold, and finds his beau\n ideal of jure divino Presbyterianism in the\n Church session. One step more and he gets\n to the brotherhood. Dr. Robinson still accords\n to the General Assembly a kind of half-way\n jure divino existence. No, no; the Second Book\n of Disc ptine does not sustain their theory of\n the powers of the Assembly, its sphere and\n functions, and its relations to the lower courts.\n Even the extracts given in the Commonwealth\n of August 30, do not make good the positions\n they have assumed; much less the parts\n omitted D*. R. says this venerable symbol\n of the Scotch Church teaches that the higher\n courts \u201cneither ordain or depose office-bear\u00ac\n ers;\u201d yet section 30 of the chapter from which\n he quotes, lying too in the very midst of sec\u00ac\n tions lie does quote, and which he has strange\u00ac\n ly overlooked, says of the provincial Assem\u00ac\n bly or Synod, totidem verbis. \u201cIt iias powkr\n to depose the office-bearers of that province\n for gude and just causes deserving depriva\u00ac\n tion.\u201d Several of the other points he makes\n in summing up the case, have just the same\n amount of support as the one here noticed.\n Let \u201cevery candid man\u201d read the seventh\n clnpter of the \u201cBook,\u201d and then judge for\n himself. One of Dr. Robinson\u2019s latest crot\u00ac\n chets, and which likewise he endeavors to\n father on the Second Book of Discipline, is\n that the Synod or Geueral Assembly is neces\u00ac\n sary only to the perfection of our system in\n developing the unity of the Church. Is that\n the kind of necessity taught in the Doctor\u2019s\n book on the Church of God, touching any of\n the tribunals of the Church ? Is that the doc\u00ac\n trine taught at Danville? Let the reader\n tun to the work just named, Part 111, sec. 10,\n pp. 02-3, and ponder these words in connec\u00ac\n tion with what immediately precedes: \u201cSo,\n</p>\n<p>\n tribunals, in a coiresponding extent of juris\u00ac\n diction, must of necessity exist in order to the\n discharge of the functions which we have\n seen are an absolute condition of the existence of\n the Church as one visible body.\u201d Let him also\n note the statement about the middle of the\n section: \u201cHence, therefore, the same power is\n in every tribunal that is any tribunal.\u201d It is\n utterly impossible to reconcile these utter\u00ac\n ances with those of the Free Christian Com\u00ac\n monwealth.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHei mihi, qualis erat! quantum mutatus ab\n illo\n</p>\n<p>\n IIec < ore, qui redit exuvias indutus Acliillei,\n Vel Danaurn Phrygios jaculatus puppibus\n ignes!\n</p>\n<p>\n Squalentem barbam, et concretes sanguine\n crines\n</p>\n<p>\n Vulneraque ilia gerens,\u201d etc.\n</p>\n<p>\n If the Doctor has not fallen from grace, he\n has certainly fallen from the simple rigid\n principles of Presbyterianism he once held\n and taught.

This is\n elaborated with great assiduity, and consti\u00ac\n tutes the burden of their argument against\n the constitutionality of the recent act. With\n exceeding propriety they appeal to the pro\u00ac\n ceedings of the New School Assembly of 18*36.\n They find in a deliverance of that body a\n statement of the powers of the Assembly\n which they heartily approve. They might\n also have summoned to their aid \u201ca manifesto\u201d\n issued by the leading New School men of Ken\u00ac\n tucky, in opposition to the measures of 1837\n and \u201938, and oilier documents almost innumer\u00ac\n able from the same quarter.

Our brethren of the opposition to\u00ac\n day stand shoulder to shoulder with Drs. Be-\n man and Peters against the views advocated\n by Drs.

And\n yet Dr. Stuart Robinson and his coadjutors\n would fain make the impression that they are\n the staunch conservators of the ecclesiastical\n principles of 1837. Now, what were the main\n points made by Drs. Beman and Peters, and\n their friends against the resolutions of Dr.\n Plumer? Let them be distinctly noted. (1.)\n \u201cIt was denied that the Assembly possessed\n original jurisdiction such as it is now pro\u00ac\n posed to exercise\u201d\u2014i. e., in the matter of dis\u00ac\n cipline. This is the precise doctrine also of\n the New School deliverance of 1856, which\n Messrs. Spilman and Marshall laud as a paper\n of \u201csingular ability,\u201d and an \u201cexceedingly\n clear and accurate analysis of the whole sub\u00ac\n ject.\u201d Mark the language they quote and\n adopt : \u201cThe disciplinary function of the As\u00ac\n sembly is simply appellate and revisionary.\u201d\n (2.) \u201cThe session is under the review and con\u00ac\n trol of the Presbytery; the Presbytery of the\n Synod, and the Synod of the General Assem\u00ac\n bly ; because they alone have the legal right\n to inspect their records. The General Assem\u00ac\n bly is, therefore, constitutionally restricted to\n action on the Synods. Unless you can show\n by some ecclesiastical multiplication table,\n that the General Assembly is next above a\n Presbytery, or Session, or individual member,\n you have no right to issue a citation to them,\n and it would be an act of usurpation in you\n to do it.\u201d So said the New Sehool leaders in\n 1837; so say Messrs. Spilman and Marshall\n now : \u201cTo permit it [the General Assembly]\n to stretch out its great arm over the Synod to\n the Presbytery, and over both these to the\n Session; to substitute its own process for that\n of the inferior courts; * * * we cannot\n</p>\n<p>\n but regard this as a most alarming stretch ef\n prerogative, which if practically carried out\n to its legitimate results, would convert the\n Assembly into an overshadowing ecclesiasti\u00ac\n cal despotism.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In the eleventh section of their report, the\n Commissioners from Ebenezer Presbytery ex\u00ac\n press unbounded surprise at the interpretation\n put by the defenders of the Assembly on Art.\n V., Chap. XIL of the Form of Government;\n</p>\n<p>\n and in the same section give certain views of\n their own respecting form of process. Con\u00ac\n tending with the New School leaders in 1837\n about the just interpretation of this very\n article of the Constitution, the eminent and\n revered Dr. Baxter, of Virginia, said, \u201cHere\n is a most important power entrusted to the\n General Assembly; but it is said it amounts\n to nothing, because there is no form of pro\u00ac\n cess distinctly marked out. This is a mis\u00ac\n take. In the full power here granted is in\u00ac\n cluded that of originating new and necessary\n forms of process which may be suited to the\n exigency of the case.\u201d On reading these\n woids of the venerable Virginian, one feels\n as if the great dead had risen from the grave\n to rebuke the men of this generation. Surely\n history repeats itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n We leave our readers to judge if this show\u00ac\n ing is not sufficient to prove our case. Right\n or wrong, the opponents of the Assembly of\n 1866 have gone over to the New School. They\n have joined the camp of our old adversaries of\n 1837. A True Presbyterian.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Two Testimonies.\n</p>\n<p>\n The one of 1835 and tl;e one of 1865\u2014A\n Parallel.\n</p>\n<p>\n A tree is judged by its fruits; the magni\u00ac\n tude of a work, by its results. If the Declara\u00ac\n tion and Testimony be Judged by either of\n these rules, it will be found wanting. As to\n its results , we propose to [run a parallel be\u00ac\n tween it and the famous Act and Testimony,\n on tne basis of which the orthodox faith was\n vindicated in the great controversy between\n the Old and new School. The Declaration and\n Testimony was \u201cadopted by the Presbytery\n of Louisville, at Bardstown, Sept. 2nd, A. D,\n 1865.\u201d It was published to the world a few\n weeks afterwards. It called for a convention\n of all who sympathized in its views and pur\u00ac\n poses, to be held at blank on the blank day of\n blank ) sometime during the cureut year: which\n convention \u2014like some western towns\u2014never\n had any existance, except in somebody\u2019s im-\n magination, or at most on paper. It also call\u00ac\n ed on \u201cThose Ministers and Buling Elders who\n concur in this Testimony\u201d to send in their\n names as signers: and on all Presbyteries and\n Synods who adopted it to send up a copy of\n their \u201cadher.ng act.\u201d One whole year has\n since elapsed. The whole matter has been\n pretty thoroughly discussed. But not a single\n Presbytery or Synod has since adopted it. The\n Synod of Kentucky, out of the busom of which,\n it was given to the world, formally condemned\n it in emphatic terms. Even the Synod of Mis\u00ac\n souri, after carefully considering it, declined\n to adopt it; although a decided majority of\n that body, are supposed to sympathize with the\n views and feelings of its signers.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have before us the second (pamphlet)\n edition of this document.

We believe the names\n of perhaps a dozen others have since been ad\u00ac\n ded. Since its first issue, not a single promi\u00ac\n nent minister or elder in the Church has sub\u00ac\n scribed it. On the contrary, most of them,\n even among its apologists, have condemned it.\n Even Dr. Boardman, in the paper offered to the\n Assembly, as a substitute for the Gurley paper,\n felt constrainedgto condemn it as schismatical.\n (If schismatical , of course, to that extent sinful.)\n At the end of the year, there it stands before\n the world with nearly one hundred and fifty\n name out of ten thousand or more ofiice bearers\n to whom it appeals for their approval.\n</p>\n<p>\n The fact that this paper adopts, in part the\n very language of the Act and Testimony of\n 1835; and that its advocates often refer to that\n celebrated paper, justifies us in running a par\u00ac\n allel bet ween them. On the 30th of May, 1834,\n while the General Assembly was in session at\n Philadelphia, the Act and Testimony was gi\u00ac\n ven to the world; signed by thirty-seven min\u00ac\n isters and twenty-seven elders: sixty-four in\n all. At the meeting of the next Assembly\u2014\n one year afterwards\u2014it. had been \u201ceither en\u00ac\n tirely or substantially\u201d adopted by five Synods\n and thirty Presbyteries; and had been signed\n by three hundred and seventy-four ministers\n and one thousand seven hundred and eigh ' y-\n nine elders !\n</p>\n<p>\n In August, I860, a convention of the sign\u00ac\n ers of the Declaration and Testimony and their\n sympathizers met according to a call made in\n May previous, in St. Louis, Mo. There were\n present about seventy Ministers and Elders\u2014\n mostly from Misouri; representing, perhaps,\n three or four Presbyteries, and minorities in\n some dozen or less other Presbyteries :\u2014all\n outside of Kentucky and Misouri, we believe,\n confessedly represented no Presbytery. From\n the published correspondence, the tidings of\n the Churches seems to have brought them lit\u00ac\n tle sympathy and no encouragement. Now\n the contrast.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the 16th of May, 1835, a convention of\n the Act and Testimony men met in Philadel\u00ac\n phia, \u201cThe members represented forty-one\n Presbyteries and thirteen minorities of Pres\u00ac\n byteries !\n</p>\n<p>\n The conclusion is irresistable. The voice of\n God\u2019s people responded largely to the Act and\n Testimony of 1835, in terms of approval. That\n voice has responded, with equal clearness, to\n the Declaration and Testimony of 1865, in\n terms of condemnation. And upon this con\u00ac\n clusion we desire to make an appeal, specially\n to those who do not approve the Declaration\n and Testimony yet propose to take such a\n course as will lead to the same result\u2014the di\u00ac\n vision of the churches in Kentucky and Mis\n souri. The voice of the Church, with an over\u00ac\n whelming unanimity, condemns the Declara\u00ac\n tion and Testimony. You declare your pur\u00ac\n pose, many of ycu, to adhere to the Church.\n Is it not then your duty to avoid such a course as\n will , inevitably , result in the division of the\n Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the New School Trade.\n</p>\n<p>\n The \u201cNew Theory \u201d not so new after all.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have from time to time characterized the\n views put forth by Dr. Robinson and the other\n leaders of the Declaration and Testimony move\u00ac\n ment as a \u201cnew theory\u201d of Presbyterianism.\n In this Ave have perhaps done them injustice.\n For it is not a \u201c new theory\u201d after all, in the\n sense that it was never advanced before. They\n are not responsible for its authorship. On the\n other hand we have perhaps given them over\u00ac\n much credit. For they have not the poor merit\n of having invented, or discovered their system\n of church doctrine, weak and illogical as it is.\n From what follows, it will be seen how closely\n these modern reformers of the church are fol\u00ac\n lowing in the track of those who took the lead\n of the New School party, in the great contro\u00ac\n versy of 1837-8.\n</p>\n<p>\n We propose to state here some of the chief\n grounds of objection made to the acts of the\n Assembly of 1837; and compare them with\n the \u201cStatement of Doctrines and Principles\n adopted by the Conference at St. Louis, in\n August last.\n</p>\n<p>\n The New School party held,\n</p>\n<p>\n (1.) u That the Assembly has no authority to\n judge of the qualifications oj its own members . \" \u2014\n This ground w T as taken, as against the action\n of the Assembly (1837) in excluding from seats\n the commissioners from certain Presbyteries.\n A leading advocate of this party maintained\n that \u201c the commission is the only sufficient\n evidence of the requisite qualifications of the\n delegate\u201d to the Assembly. Dr. Hodge held\n that the Assembly had the right (1) to decide\n whether Presbyteries were qualified to send\n repre > entatives to the body at all; and (2) to\n decide whether ecnmvssioners, coming from\n Presbyteries in good standing, were entitled\n to seats; and in either case to exclude them\n from seats if the necessary qualifications were\n wanting. He says: \u201cA cause must surely be\n desperate t hat requires such a right to be deni\u00ac\n ed to any representative body on earth.\u201d\u2014\n Prin. Rev. for July, 1838, pp 490-91.

The Synods and Assembly are merely\n courts of review\u2014appellate courls. They have\n none of them legislative powers.\u201d After quot\u00ac\n ing, or rather garbling, the Confession of Faith,\n he adds: \u201cI am thus particular on this point,\n because the \u2018usurped claims of making laws\u2019\n was actually set up, and these proceedings (of\n the Assembly of 1837) justified as legislative\n acts.\u201d It will be seen that the venerable As\u00ac\n sembly of \u201937, which all sound Old School men\n so much delight to honor, was charged with\n \u201cusurping authority \u201d also; and on the same\n grounds with the Assembly of 1866! The plat\u00ac\n form of the St. Louis Conference says, Sec. 10,\n The General Assembly has no legislative powers,\n properly so called; and it has no original juris\u00ac\n diction whatever in cases of judicial process, but\n is strictly and solely a court of Appeal. Here\n again the agreement is perfect. Now if we\n turn to the debates in the Assembly of\u201937, we\n find these views.as developed in the arguments,\n of the New School leaders, according well with\n the arguments used by the Declaration men.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the 25th of May, 1837, resolutions were\n introduced by Rev. (now Dr ) Plumer, citing\n certain inferior judicatories to the bar of the\n next Assembly; and excluding them from seats\n in that body \u201cuntil their case shall be decided.\u201d\n The debate on these resolutions extended thro\u2019\n three sessions of the Assembly. On the New\n School side were ranged Jessup, White, Beman,\n Dickinson and Peters. On the part of the Old\n School, were Plumer, Breckinridge and Baxter.\n What a host! It was maintained by Drs.\n Beman, Peters, & c.\n</p>\n<p>\n (1.) That the Assembly had no \u201coriginal\n jurisdiction.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n (2.) That it had no right to pass by the Syn\u00ac\n od to the Presbyteries: \u201cto reach its strong arm\n over the intervening courts,\u201d that all process\n must go by regular gradation, from one court\n to that next above.\n</p>\n<p>\n (8.) That a man going to the Assembly with\n a commission from a Presbytery, could not be\n excluded from a scat in the Assembly.\n</p>\n<p>\n (4.) That the Assembly is not a perpetual\n body.\n</p>\n<p>\n (5.) That the proposed measure was \u201c un\u00ac\n paralleled in the history of legislative or judi\u00ac\n cial proceedings!\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The above statement is taken from the Prin\u00ac\n ceton Review for July, 1837. This was the\n staple of the argument against that great As\u00ac\n sembly. We need not stop to point out how\n perfectly it accords with the ground of opposi\u00ac\n tion to the Assembly of 1866. The attentive\n readers of the Free Christian Commonwealth\n must be as familiar with these arguments as\n with Webster\u2019s spelling-book. But the re\u00ac\n sponse to these objections from the other side\n is very note-worthy. They maintained, from\n our Standards, that the Assembly had the right\n of \u201coriginal jurisdiction;\u201d that it has authority\n to pass by the intervening courts to those be\u00ac\n low; that it had the right to exclude commis\u00ac\n sioners to the Assembly from seats, & c. Such\n were the views of the leaders of the Old School\n</p>\n<p>\n party in 1837. They saved the Church then;\n they will not ruin it now.\n</p>\n<p>\n But what we note specially, is the identity of\n the doctrine of Church order held by the New\n School and Semi-Congregationalists then, with\n the platform put forth by the Declaration men\n and their apologists now. Drs. Beman and\n Peters, Drs. Wilson and Robinson stand shoul\u00ac\n der to shoulder, on the New School platform of\n 1837! Nor do they stand alone. The Lexing\u00ac\n ton Address takes the same ground. It denies\n to the Assembly the right of original juris\u00ac\n diction;\u201d the power to dissolve a Presbytery];\n the right to deal an ith ministers except by ap\u00ac\n peal, & c.\u2014See Address, page 6. So the com\u00ac\n missioners of Ebenezer Presbytery, in their\n report, published in the Western Presbyterian\n of August 16th. These brethren follow the\n New School track even more closely than the\n others. Sections one, two, three, five, eight, and\n nine of their report are but an exact transcript\n of the arguments urged by Drs. Beman, Peters\n and others against the action of the Assembly\n of 1837. Even their declamation is after the\n same pattern. Say the New School worthies:\n \u201cthis measure is unparalleled in the history of\n legislative or judicial proceedings! \u201d Say our\n Ebenezer brethren: \u201cSince the world began was\n it not heard\u201d i hat such a thing was done! Says\n the Lexington Address: \u201cIt is without precedent\n in ecclesiastical or civil legislation !\u201d Says the\n Declaration and Testimony, page 21: \u201cThus the\n General Assembly has itself become the abet\u00ac\n tor of injustice and despotism.\u201d Whatharmony\n betwixt the accusers of the Old School Assem\u00ac\n blies of 183? and 1866! Their doctrine of\n Church order the same; their logic identical;\n even their rhetoric is cast in the same mold.\n Their music is said to be set to the tune of\n Dixie: they certainly have a New School man\n for their chief musician. Yet these brethren\n accuse the Assembly, and those who adhere to\n it, of seeking a reunion with the New School!\n We are no prophet. But we hazard the as\u00ac\n sertion that they themselves\u2014many of them\u2014\n will, within a brief period, be in union with\n the New School\u2014South; whose organ at Rich\u00ac\n mond now applauds their doctrine ot the\n Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n Precedem s.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is some time since the men of the Declar\u00ac\n ation and Testimony have appealed to Scot\u00ac\n tish history for precidents to sustain them in\n their schismatical course. Formerly they\n abounded in phrases culled from the \u201cLeague\n and Covenant,\u201d and in touching stories of\n martyrdom for Christ\u2019s Headship and Crown.\n Why have they ceased to instruct us from the\n annals of the ancient Kirk? We fear that\n they have found out upon closer search that\n the \u201cLights and Shadows of Scottish Life\u201d is\n not an exact copy of the \u201cActs of the Assem\u00ac\n bly,\u201d and that the heroic covenanter, hiding\n among the glens, to escape from Claverhouse\n and his bloody dragoons, does not represent\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0080/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0080/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0080/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0080/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0080/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ge/ne/ra/la/ss/em/bl/yi/00/al/le/generalassemblyi00alle/generalassemblyi00alle_0080.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 794856}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"80\">\n<p>\n 80\n</p>\n<p>\n the exact character of Scotch Presbyterian\u00ac\n ism.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is indeed good reason for silence, un\u00ac\n less they are rash enough to attempt a com\u00ac\n plete falsification of history.

This present action severs no one from\n the church, but leaves the responsibility of\n final separation upon those who fail to give\n heed to the provisions now and herein made\n for their remaining in or return to the church\n of their fathers, whether they be ministers,\n elders, churches or any organizations claiming\n to be Presbyteries and Synods.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The plan now proposed and recommended\n to this General Assembly for adoption recog\u00ac\n nizes, on the one hand, the authority of the\n last General Assembly in citing the signers of\n the aforesaid Declaration and Testimony to\n appear before this present General Assembly ;\n while, on the other hand, it remits their cases\n to the lower courts for final disposition in a\n way which every minister and member of the\n church must regard as regular, and with the\n simple requisition that the said signers com\u00ac\n ply with the terms above specified.\n</p>\n<p>\n This course does not. even require the said\n signers to renounce the principles of church\n order which they affirm they conscientiously\n entertain, nor is it the wish of the General\n Assembly to interfere with their conscientious\n lonvictions; nor, furthermore, does this plan\n come in conflict with some good and wise\n brethren, who have denied, or seriously doubt\u00ac\n ed, while fully adhereing to the church, the\n competency of the last General Assembly to\n issue the summons to the signers of the afore\u00ac\n said Declaration and Test mony, to appear at\n the bar of the present General Assembly to\n answer for what they have done in this mat\u00ac\n ter. This however, is clear to the whole church\n \u2014that the last and present General Assem\u00ac\n blies stand in a very different relation to this\n whole matter. When the last General A-\u00bbem-\n bly issued its citation to these brethren, such\n was notoriously the condition of the lower\n courts, almost universally, in the Synods of\n Kentucky and Missouri, as subsequent events\n have but too well shown that it would have\n been nothing less than vain trifling with sa\u00ac\n cred interests, which were greatly imperiled,\n for that General Assembly to have remanded\n the cases of these brethren to those courts, but\n now the Synods of Kentucky and Missouri,\n with the Presbyteries in their connection as\n he rein recognized, adhere to the Presbyterian\n Church through the General Assembly, and\n there is every reason to believe that the direc\u00ac\n tions herein made will be faithfully executed\n by them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. This General Assembly regards the re\u00ac\n fusal of many of those cited by the last to ap\u00ac\n pear before the present Assembly, as a grave\n violation of their duty, while at the same time\n it respects the conscientious, though, as it\n judges, the mistaken conviction of duty\n which has led them to decline obedience. It\n duly regards the declaration of some of these\n brethren, the t in signing the aforesaid Dec\u00ac\n laration and Testimony, and in their declining\n to obey the aforesaid citation, they intend no\n</p>\n<p>\n disrespect to the General Assembly, but have\n taken this course because they deem the last\n and previous General Assemblies, to have ex\u00ac\n ceeded their constitutional authority. It ought,\n however, to be clear to these brethren, and\n the whole church that when a court of the\n highest grade and jurisdiction has made deci\u00ac\n sion or issued an order, it is the duty of all\n good and law-abiding men to yield it due res\u00ac\n pect and obedience until it is repealed by the\n proper authority. This is a principle on which\n all good government rests in civil as well as\n ecclesiastical affairs, and without its due re\u00ac\n cognition, anarchy would reign in the church\n and state. In the present case according to\n the principles of our system, no lower court or\n body of men is competent to set aside the acts\n of the General Assembly, for it is a court of\n last resort. If men, from conseientious scru\u00ac\n ples or otherwise, can not abide its deliberate,\n well-considered and solemn decisions, instead\n of persisting during a series of years in open\n defiance of its authority they should, as Chris\u00ac\n tian men, and in the exercise of their Christian\n liberty, quietly withdraw from the church.\n From the present condition of things, however,\n this General Assembly is not disposed to take\n any further notice of the offense of the signers\n of the aforesaid Declaration and Testimony, or\n their refusal to obey the aforesaid citation of\n the last Assembly than is provided for in the\n plan herein set forth for the restoration of\n peace and harmony and the return of these\n brethren to their proper relations in the\n church.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. In regard to the two brethren who have\n obeyed the citation aforesaid\u2014the Rev. J. A.\n Quarles, who signed the aforesaid Declaration\n and Testimony, before the last General Assem\u00ac\n bly met, and the Rev. W. C. Handy, who has\n signed it since, and who appears before the\n present General Assembly in obedience to a\n \u2018supposed order of the Synod of Baltimore\u2019\u2014-\n this General Assembly expresses its gratifica\u00ac\n tion at their manifest spirit of obedience, and\n feels called upon to take no further order in\n their respective cases than to enjoin them to\n repair to their respective Presbyteries and\n comply with the requisitions hereinbefore set\n forth, Mr. Quarles to appear before the near\u00ac\n est Presbytery which adheres to the General\n Assembly.\n</p>\n<p>\n Finally, your committee have been anima\u00ac\n ted in the measures proposed in this report,\n simply by a desire to maintain the authority\n and restore peace and harmony to the church,\n and they are fully convinced that the same de\u00ac\n sire pervades the bosom of every member of\n this General Assembly. They only, therefore,\n in addition, recommend the following resolu\u00ac\n tion, as in their judgment conducive to this\n end, viz:\n</p>\n<p>\n Resolved , That upon a motion, to adopt this\n report, if such shall be made, the persons\n claiming seats upon the floor of this General\n Assembly, and those cited to appear here by\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0084/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0084/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0084/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0084/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0084/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ge/ne/ra/la/ss/em/bl/yi/00/al/le/generalassemblyi00alle/generalassemblyi00alle_0084.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 797185}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"84\">\n<p>\n 84\n</p>\n<p>\n (he last General Assembly shall be heard in\n discussion upon any part of this report.\n</p>\n<p>\n All of which is respectfully submitted :\n Signed\n</p>\n<p>\n R L Stanton, Chairman ; Willis Lord, W.

They have expressed\n their regret that the slavery of the Africans\n and of their descendants still continues in so\n many places, and even among those within the\n pale of the Church, and have urged the Pres\u00ac\n byteries under their care to adopt such meas\u00ac\n ures as will secure, at least to the rising gener\u00ac\n ation of slaves, within the bounds of the\n Church, a religious education, that they may\n be prepared for the exercise and enjoyment of\n liberty, when God in his providence may open\n a door for their emancipation.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The action of the General Assembly upon\n the subject of slavery in the year 1818 is une\u00ac\n quivocal, and so well known that it need not\n be recited at length. The following extracts,\n however, we regard as applicable io our pre\u00ac\n sent circumstances, and proper now to be reit\u00ac\n erated :\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe consider the voluntary enslaving of one\n portion of the human race by another as a\n gross violation of the most precious and sacred\n rights of human nature, as utterly inconsis\u00ac\n tent with the law of God, which requires us to\n love eur neighbour as ourselves, and as totally\n irreconcilable with the spirit and principles of\n the gospel of Christ, which enjoins \u2018that all\n things whatsoever ye would that men should\n do to you, do ye even so to them.\u2019 Slavery\n creates a paradox in the moral system.

It is not necessary\n too minutely to inquire how faithful and obe\u00ac\n dient to these lessons and warnings those to\n %hom they were addressed have been. It\n ought to be acknowlekged that we have all\n much to confess and lament as to our short\u00ac\n comings in this respect. Whether a strict and\n careful application of this advice would have\n rescued the country from the evil of its condi\u00ac\n tion, and the dangers which have since threat\u00ac\n ened it, is known to the Omniscient alone.\n Whilst we do not believe that the present judg\u00ac\n ments of our heavenly Father, and Almighty\n and Righteous Governor, have been inflicted\n solely in punishment for our continuance in\n this sin; yet it is our judgment that the recent\n events of our history, and the present condi\u00ac\n tion of our Church an country, furnish mani\u00ac\n fest tokens that the time has at length come , in\n the providence of Cod , when it is Ills will that\n every vestige of human slavery among us should he\n effaced, and that every Christian man should ad\u00ac\n dress himsetf with industry and earnestness to his\n appropriate part in the performance of this great\n duty.\n</p>\n<p>\n Whatever excuses for its postponement may\n heretofore have existed, no longer avail. When\n the country was at peace within itself, and the\n Church was unbroken, many consciences were\n perplexed in the presence of this great evil, for\n the want of an adequate remedy. Slavery was\n so formidably intrenched behind the ramparts\n of personal interests and prejudices, that to\n attack it with a view to its speedy overthrow\n appeared to be attacking the very existence of\n the social order itself, and was characterized\n as the inevitable introduction of an anarchy,\n worse in its cansequences than the evil for\n which it seemed to be the only cure. But the\n folly and weakness of men have been the illus\u00ac\n trations of God\u2019s wisdom and power. Under\n the influence of the most incomprehensible in\u00ac\n fatuation of wickedness, those who were most\n deeply interested in the perpetuation of slave\u00ac\n ry have taken away every motive for its further\n toleration. The spirit of American slavery, not\n content with its defences to be found in the\n laws of the States, the provisions of the Federal\n</p>\n<p>\n Constitution, the prejudices in favor of existing\n institutions, and the fear of change, has taken\n arms against law, organized a bloody rebellion\n against the national authority, made formida\u00ac\n ble war upon the Federal Union, and in order\n to found an empire upon the corner-stone, of\n slavery, threatens not our existence as a peo\u00ac\n ple, but the annihilation of the principles of\n free Christian government; and thus has ren\u00ac\n dered the continuance of negro slavery incom\u00ac\n patible with the preservation of our own liber\u00ac\n ty aud independence.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the struggle of the nation for existence\n against this powerful and wicked treason, the\n highest executive authorities have proclaimed\n the abolition of slavery within most of the re\u00ac\n bel States, and decreed its extinction by mili\u00ac\n tary force. They have enlisted these formerly\n held as slaves to be soldiers in the national\n armies. They have taken measures to orga\u00ac\n nize: the labor of the freedmen, and instituted\n measures for their support and government in\n their new condition. It is the President ' s de\u00ac\n clared policy not to consent to the reorganiza\u00ac\n tion of civil government within the seceded\n States upon any other basis than that of eman\u00ac\n cipation. In the loyal States where slavery\n has not been abolished, measures of emancipa\u00ac\n tion, in different stages of progress, have been\n set on foot, and are near their consummation ;\n and propositions for an amendment to the Fed\u00ac\n eral Constitution, prohibiting slavery in all\n the States and Territories, are now pending in\n the national Congress So that, in our present\n situation, the interests of peace and of social\n order are identified with the success of the\n cause of emancipation. The difficulties\n wnich formerly seemed insurmountable, in the\n providence of God, appear now almost remov\u00ac\n ed. The most formidable remaining obstacle,\n we think, will be found to be the unwilling\u00ac\n ness of the human heart to see and acccept\n the truth against the prejudices of habit and\n of interest; and to act towards those who have\n been heretofore degraded as slaves, with the\n charity of Christian principle in the necessary\n efforts to improve and elevate them.\n</p>\n<p>\n In view, therefore, of its former testimonies\n upon the subject, the General Assembly does\n hereby devoutly express its gratitude to Al\u00ac\n mighty God for having overruled the wicked\u00ac\n ness and calamities of the rebellion, so as to\n work out the deliverance of our country from\n the evil and guilt of slavery ; its earnest desire\n for the extirpation of slaver} ' , as the root of\n bitterness from which has sprung rebellion,\n war, and bloodshed, and the long list of hor\u00ac\n rors that follow in their train: its earnest\n trust, that the thorough removal of this prolific\n source of evil and harm will be speedily fol\u00ac\n lowed by the blessings of our Heavenly Fath\u00ac\n er, the return of peace, union and fraternity,\n and abounding prosperity to the whole land ;\n and recommend to all in our communion to\n labor honestly, earnestly, and unweariedly in\n their respective spheres for this glorious con\u00ac\n summation, to which human justice, Christian\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0086/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 508}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0086/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1016}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0086/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0086/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4065}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ge:ne:ra:la:ss:em:bl:yi:00:al:le:generalassemblyi00alle:generalassemblyi00alle_0086/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ge/ne/ra/la/ss/em/bl/yi/00/al/le/generalassemblyi00alle/generalassemblyi00alle_0086.jp2", "height": 4065, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 572053}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"86\">\n<p>\n 86\n</p>\n<p>\n ' ' love, national peace and prosperity, every\n earthly and every religious interest, combine\n to pledge them.\n</p>\n<p>\n No New doctrine on Slaver//.\n</p>\n<p>\n We append the following, extracts from the\n minutes of the Assembly of 1806, expressly\n avowing that the Assembly lias no doctrine on\n the subject of slavery, differing from that\n which is taught in all its past deliverances.\n We quote on page 86, of the minutes from the\n \u2018 Pastoral Letter,\u201d which was written by Dr.\n Stanton, and adopted by a vote of 142 yeas, 15\n na_y s, 9 uonliquet, excused 2.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt was under these circumstances that the\n Assembly of 1865 tock its action on slavery.\n (The \u2018Pittsburg orders\u2019).

We claim\n that these records show, that in the acts of the\n Assembly for the past seven years, there is\n not one word condemning slavery, or enforc\u00ac\n ing the duty of upholding the civil govern\u00ac\n ment\u2014not one word in any or all these acts\u2014\n that is not fully warranted by the former\n deliverances of the Church on these to\u00ac\n pics.
