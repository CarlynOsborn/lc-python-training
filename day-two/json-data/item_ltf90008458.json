In dwelling on this topic, I speak not\n of Christianity as a religion^ but as a philosophic system \u2014\n not as a spiritual scheme for another life^ but a philoso\u00ac\n phy hearing on this.

In doing this, as already said, I dwell not on it\n as a religion \u2014that were a theme for the pulpit\u2014but as a\n philosophy for common life.

Assuming, then, that the latter is a\n correct, a true system, I fix upon it as its glory and excel\u00ac\n lence, that it is a system not of rules^ but of principles.\n Drawing illustrations alike from religions and philosophies,\n I would endeavor to unfold this thought\u2014^noticing first,\n the fact, and then its advantages, as they rise in their order\n before us.\n</p>\n<p>\n I.

So applicable are these, that they sweep the\n entire range of time and humanity, and yet so comprehen\u00ac\n sive, that they are given, I had almost said, in a word.

Again:\n</p>\n<p>\n How admirably is this system fitted to develope and\n strengthen and perfect the character. It is so, not merely\n by the duties to which it directs, and the motives which it\n arrays, and the truths which it unfolds, and the scenes to\n which it points us, though all these are as far higher and\n sublimer than those of falsQ religions, as the heavens are\n higher than the earth ; but it is so peculiarly by the disci\u00ac\n pline which it gives us in the application of its principles to\n our own conduct, by, if I may so speak, the course of self-\n discipline and self-training for the heavens to which we are\n directed by its perfect teachings. Where the false or the\n temporary system would point us\u2014the former to some\n silly, and the latter to some arbitrary observance; where\n the Mohammedan would prescribe his washings, and the\n Anchorite the counting of his beads, and the Pharisee the\n tithing of his mint and anise and cummin, and the Cynic\n the maceration of the body\u2014the tendency of all of which,\n in the spirit in which they were performed, must of neces\u00ac\n sity be to contract and belittle the mind, Christianity calls\n us to be familiar with great principles, to understand and\n apply them. It calls us to be Christians, and the very pro\u00ac\n cess and progress of a living Christian are ever expanding.\n It throws us upon our own resources and judgment, and by\n the very process of obedience, makes men of us. It has\n been said, that the man who spends his life in making the\n heads of pins, as thousands do in the work-shops of Great\n Britain, has his mind gradually contracted to then* size.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ch:ri:st:ia:ni:ty:ph:il:00:ed:wa:christianityphil00edwa:christianityphil00edwa_0022/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 147, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 263}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ch:ri:st:ia:ni:ty:ph:il:00:ed:wa:christianityphil00edwa:christianityphil00edwa_0022/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 294, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 527}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ch:ri:st:ia:ni:ty:ph:il:00:ed:wa:christianityphil00edwa:christianityphil00edwa_0022/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 589, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1054}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ch:ri:st:ia:ni:ty:ph:il:00:ed:wa:christianityphil00edwa:christianityphil00edwa_0022/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1178, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2109}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ch:ri:st:ia:ni:ty:ph:il:00:ed:wa:christianityphil00edwa:christianityphil00edwa_0022/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2357, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4219}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ch:ri:st:ia:ni:ty:ph:il:00:ed:wa:christianityphil00edwa:christianityphil00edwa_0022/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ch/ri/st/ia/ni/ty/ph/il/00/ed/wa/christianityphil00edwa/christianityphil00edwa_0022.jp2", "height": 4219, "width": 2357, "levels": 6, "size": 524741}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"22\">\n<p>\n 20\n</p>\n<p>\n And so it is with the man of mere rules\u2014that as a man he\n is constantly in a process of contraction\u2014as if mental and\n moral astringents were ever at their work upon him.
