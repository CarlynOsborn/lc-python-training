BRETHREN,\n</p>\n<p>\n OCTOBER 20, 1827.\n</p>\n<p>\n BEING appointed to watch for your spiritual\n interests, we think it our duty at this time to address you in a pastoral\n letter of more than usual length. The churches in our presbytery are\n mostly in a languishing state. While other regions are visited with fre-\n quent revivals, and stirred up to a diligent practice and a vigorous pro-\n motion of the gospel, we have fallen into a general coldness, and have\n experienced a long suspension of divine influences. In some places,\n death, emigration, and apostacy have diminished the number of church\n members more than the means of grace have increased it. In short,\n some of our wisest and most experienced men think they see amongst us\n the symptoms of a long and fatal decline. Still, however, w\u2019e rest on\n one ground of hope and consolation. Our churches, w T e believe, con-\n tain many sincere children of God, who have an interest at the throne of\n grace, and daily supplicate the Father of Mercies for a blessing on our\n public ordinances, and for an effusion of the spirit upon our churches.\n Therefore, w T e trust that we shall not be finally deserted ; though we\n may suffer a severe chastisement for our abuse of past favours and pre-\n sent privileges.\n</p>\n<p>\n Judging from the history of former ages, we apprehend that the two\n most alarming symptoms in a church are : 1 . the omission or negligent\n performance of duty ; and 2. a departure from sound doctrine according\n > to the scriptures.\n</p>\n<p>\n l.The omission or negligentperformance of duty weakens the pious feel-\n ings of the heart ; wounds, and then hardens the conscience ; \u00a9pens the\n door for temptation and delusion; offends God, and grieves his Holy Spi-\n rit ; and, when it becomes general in a church, bring* on a crisis which\n must soon terminate either in a revival of penitence and zeal, or in a fatal\n breaking up of the church.

A departure from sound .doctrine however, appears from history to\n he yet more dangerous. While the pure and sanctifying truths of\n the gospel are retained, there still exists a principle of life, from which a\n decayed piety may be restored to health and vigour. But when the\n truth itself is materially corrupted, and the gospel of the Son of God turn-\n ed into a system of human inventions, religion is poisoned at the fountain-\n head. Few, if any instances are on record of churches having recovered\n after drinking deeply into the spirit of error.\n</p>\n<p>\n Whether our churches are most in danger from lukewarmness, or\n from error, we shall not undertake to say : but we would earnestly ad-\n monish our beloved flocks (o be on their guard, as ' those that watch for\n their lives, against both the evils we have mentioned.\n</p>\n<p>\n We are persuaded, brethren, that our church in her public standards,\n professes the purp Christianity of the Bible. We pretend not that every\n expression in those standards is precisely correct, as if given by inspira-\n tion. W e claim not a popish infallibility for our judgments; nor for those\n of the reformers, of blessed memory, whose system of doctrines we hold\n unchanged. But our belief of these doctrines is confirmed not only by\n our examination of the word of God, but by the experience of their effi-\n cacy for three hundred years, in keeping up a sober and practical piety\n wherever they have been sincerely professed. No opposing system of\n doctrines has for ages maintained so steady and so purifying an influence\n over the human mind. Other systems have lead either to empty formal-\n ism, dark superstition, or w 7 ild fanaticism ; while the system of Luther,\n Zuinglius, and Calvin, as professed by the Presbyterian and other church-\n es, has always overcome the temporary influence of formalism, supersti-\n tion, and fanaticism ; except where, in the reckless pursuit of novelty,\n men have abandoned the system itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n Yet no form of Christianity, perhaps, has had to encounter such obsti-\n nate prejudices, and such violent attacks from all quarters. In our own\n age and country, and within the bounds of this Presbytery, we have\n witnessed what would seem to be a concerted and resolute effort to des-\n troy our church. Means, both open and concealed, both ordinary and ex-\n traordinary, have been put in requisition to render us odious and unpop-\n ular. At least, several things have lately occurred, and arc likely to oc-\n cur again, which seem to manifest a .spirit of implacable hostility \" against\n our doctrines and institutions.\n</p>\n<p>\n J ustice to ourselves, and faithfulness to what we believe to be the cause\n of truth and piety, call upon us at length to break silence; to lay aside\n false delicacy ; and to expostulate frankly with our chief opponents. .You\n too, brethren, we must affectionately warn of these attempts, and endea-\n vour to fortify your minds against them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Most of you, from your knowledge of facts, already understand that wo\n allude to a society whom, as Christians, we would love, but against whom,\n as persevering assailants, we must at length defend ourselves ; we mean\n the Methodists. But we wish you and them to know that we complain\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0005/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 143, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 260}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0005/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 287, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 520}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0005/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 575, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1040}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0005/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1150, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2081}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0005/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4163}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0005/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/pa/st/or/al/le/tt/er/of/00/pr/es/pastoralletterof00pres/pastoralletterof00pres_0005.jp2", "height": 4163, "width": 2301, "levels": 6, "size": 629412}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"5\">\n<p>\n not of any fair arguments which they have used against our doctrines:\n we complain of the line of policy wliich they sc em to have adopted, which\n certainly they have, too often pursued respecting us.\n</p>\n<p>\n Harmony and fellowship cannot subsist between two religious denom-\n inations ' , unless they treat each other with. decent respect, argue their\n differences candidly and temperately, and pursue towards each other an\n open, fair, and friendly line of conduct. \\V6 often hear friendly profes-\n sions from the Methodists ; sometimes wer experience friendly acts, and\n rejoice in them.

The frequent appearance of double dealing in their policy\n towards others ; the proselyting spirit which they often manifest ; their\n exultation when they make a breach into other churches ; their constant\n attempts to form societies in the heart of congregations fully supplied\n with the means of grace; their apparent eagerness to swell and magnify\n their numbers, and the exceedingly easy terms on which they enrol\n members ; the occasional boasts made even in their public assemblies\n that the Methodists will \u201ctake the world these and other things have\n infused a general suspicion of their harbouring ambitious designs. No-\n thing short of a disavowal of such designs, and a correspondent change of\n conduct, can remove the suspicion.

For if God does not eonverfc-\n the sinner, who does convert him? Do the preachers convert him, or does\n he convert himself? We believe that if a person should go to any church\n in this country, proposing to become a member of it, and tell it that he\n had experienced no religion or conversion, but what had been produced\n by himself, or by preachers, or some other men, that ch urch would imme-\n diately inform him that it could not receive him as a member, nor consider\n him as a Christian. And if all Christians are so fully united in the opin-\n ion that God, and God only, can and does convert the sinner, why are there\n any objections to the doctrine of election ? God certainly foreknows and\n foreordains his own acts. He certainly predetermines whom he will con-\n vert; and this is what we mean by the doctrine of election. But perhaps,\n some may attempt to evade the argument by saying that God has revealed\n his word, and offered his sanctifying grace to the world : and that the sinner\n who is willing to accept the offer shall be saved. To this statement we fully\n agree. We believe that wherever the gospel is preached, every sinner\n who is willing to accept the offers of the gospel will be saved. But this\n does not change the ground of the argument: the question still returns\n upon U3, who makes the sinner willing to accept those offers ? That all\n men are not willing to receive the gospel when preached to them, is mat-\n ter of constant and lamentable experience. And has any man, or set of\n men, discovered any way or means, within the reach of human power,,\n by which sinners can be made willing to receive the gospel? if they have,\n they have made the greatest discovery in the world; or rather, they have\n made a discovery infinitely more important, than all other discoveries in\n the world put together. But there has been no such discovery. This\n willingness to receive the gospel, or to apply to God for his sanctifying\n grace, is the beginning of religion ; and nothing but the sovereign grace\n of God does or can give it. Will it then be asked, since God converts\n sinners, why does he not convert all sinners? This is a question which\n it behooves all Christians who acknowledge and pray for the converting\n grace of God to answer as much as us. But we cannot answer it. God\n Almighty has reasons worthy of himself for every thing he does, and for\n every thing he omits to do. But what those reasons are, we often can-\n not know : and particularly, why it is that he converts some, and leaves\n others unconverted, is not for us to determine.\n</p>\n<p>\n Having now, as we think, briefly established the doctrine of election, we\n shall proceed to make some observations on the general doctrine of the\n divine decrees. By the divine decrees we simply mean that plan which\n the infinite wisdom of God had in view when he created the world. We\n trust it will not be said that when God created the world he had no plan\n in view. We believe that no rational being ever undertook any impor-\n tant work without a plan. There was some end to be answered, some\n purpose to be accomplished, or some consequence to be effected by eve-\n ry important work that was ever undertaken by any rational being : and\n of course, to deny that God had a plan in view when he created the world\n would seem not only to deny his possession of infinite wisdom, but\n even of common rationality. We trust, therefore, that no person can\n be found who will deny that God had a plan in view when he created the\n world. Now this plan is the divine decrees; and the only question which\n remains, isywhether God had sufficient wisdom and power to execute his\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0008/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 143, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 260}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0008/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 287, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 520}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0008/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 575, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1040}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0008/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1150, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2081}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0008/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4163}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0008/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/pa/st/or/al/le/tt/er/of/00/pr/es/pastoralletterof00pres/pastoralletterof00pres_0008.jp2", "height": 4163, "width": 2301, "levels": 6, "size": 709812}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"8\">\n<p>\n ptan, or decrees; or whether his plan has been defeated? If the di-\n vine plan has been defeated, when, and by whom, was it done? Was it\n defeated by the first introduction of sin and misery into the world ? But\n upon this supposition every subsequent scene of sin and misery brought\n into the world was another defeat ; and of course the divine plan has been\n the subject of violation and defeat in innumerable instances. Here is\n matter for the most serious consideration. If the plans of God have been\n so repeatedly defeated since the creation of the world, that is, in the\n course of six thofisandyears; how may these defeats be multiplied in the\n infinite course of our future existence ! Is not the supposition dishonora-\n ble to God? Does it not unsettle our confidence in the management of his\n affairs, and destroy all the hopes of the Christian? Does it not, in fact,\n render every thing unsafe, both in Earth and Heaven ? Angels fell from\n Heaven. If the introduction of sin on earth defeated the counsels of the;\n Almighty, the sin of angels was also a defeat. The truth is, once admit\n that the plans of God have been, or can be defeated, and there is no end\n to the consequences resulting from it ; consequences both dishonorable to\n God, and destructive of the hopes of the Christian, and of all the funda-\n mental principles of religion. Wedonotsay that our opponents admit\n tiiese consequences. We believe they do not admit them.

We believe that man is a moral a gent;\n that his will is free; that the offers of the gospel are freely made to him ;\n and that lie possesses every power necessary to make him justly accoun-\n table for his actions. We are, in fact, willirg to carry the free will or\n moral agency of man, as far as. they can be carried, without defeating the\n counsels, or violating the plans of God ; and farther we cannot consent\n to go.\n</p>\n<p>\n K\n</p>\n<p>\n We trust that this exposition will relieve the doctrine before us from\n much of f he misrepresentation under which it has laboured. The divine\n decrees do not suppose that if a man be born to be saved, he shall be\n saved, let hirn do what he will. They do not make a man a machine, or\n destroy his moral agency. The proper question respecting our view of the\n divine decrees is this : whether free will or moral agency be of such a nature\n as necessarily to put it in the power of creatures to defeat the counsels or\n break the plans of the Deity. If such be the nature of free agency, it\n no doubt destroys the divine decrees: but it destroys, at the same time,\n the sovereignty of God, the hopes of the Christian, and all the motives\n and principles of religion : in fact, it renders every thing insecure, both\n on earth and in Heaven. Moral agency will doubtless exist in Heaven ;\n and if it -can break the plans of God, it can break his promises: so that\n the Christian is not only uncertain of reaching Heaven, but should he ar-\n rive at that happy world, must be uncertain of his continuance there.\n For this moral agency may produce as many revolutions in Heaven, con-\n trary to the divine will, as those who deny the divine decrees must sup-\n pose it has produced on earth.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0009/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 143, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 260}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0009/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 287, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 520}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0009/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 575, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1040}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0009/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1150, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2081}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0009/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4163}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0009/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/pa/st/or/al/le/tt/er/of/00/pr/es/pastoralletterof00pres/pastoralletterof00pres_0009.jp2", "height": 4163, "width": 2301, "levels": 6, "size": 694926}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"9\">\n<p>\n 9 \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n It may be difficult, orindeed impossible, for us to understand how the Di-\n vine Being can govern a multitude of moral agents, so as to preserve his own\n wise plans from violation without restricting their moral agency. But\n because we cannot understand how this can be done, shall we pronounce\n it impossible for God to do it; and assert that because the human will is\n free, the plans of God are continually liable to defeat? We shall take one\n illustration out of hundreds which may be found in the sacred volume, to\n show that God can govern moral agents 60 as to accomplish his own wise\n purposes without restricting their moral agency. Joseph\u2019s brethren ma-\n liciously took him into custody, and put him into a pit, with the design of\n preventing the accomplishment of his prophetic dreams. But the plan of\n God was to fulfil, those dreams. Here their plan w r as directly oppc sed to\n the plan of God. And yet, without restricting their freedom of action,\n God made their conduct directly instrumental in accomplishing his plan*\n and defeating theirs. With this example before us, we feel warranted\n in believing that God can use the free actions of men so as to accom-\n plish his purposes, even when those mea are most directly opposed to his\n purposes.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is asserted in our standards that \u201cGod foreordains whatsoever comes ' '\n to pass.\u201d This expression is objected to, as implying that God decrees\n the existence of sin. When we use the expression that God decrees sin,\n we simply mean that God determines to permit sin to exist ; and not that\n he tempts, much less that he forces or impels any one to sin. When\n God made man at first, he made him holy, and gave him sufficient power\n to perform his duty. But God fdflesaw that man w^ould sin, and did not\n determine, unavailingly, to prevent, his sinning. He determined to per-\n mit sin to take place ; and his thus determining to admit the existence of\n sin as a part of his plan is all that we mean by his decreeing sin. In the\n same way we believe that God foresaw 7 every tendency to sin that ever would\n arise amonghis creatures. Many of these tendencies to sin he restrains\n or defeats : but in some cases he permits the sinnner to take his. own\n course. It is thus, as we believe, that lie. \u201cmakes the w^rath of man, to\n praise him, and the remainder of that wraith lie restrains.\u201d And we do\n not see how it is possible to view the subject in any other light, without\n limiting either the foreknowledge or the power of God in such a way as\n would make it impossible for him to govern the world. Shall we say that\n God foresaw the existence of sin and determined to prevent it, but could\n not? Or shall we say that he did not foresee it, and was, therefore, taken\n by surprise? We believe that no Christian would be willing to make ei-\n ther of these assertions. It seems, therefore, necessary to believe that '\n God foresaw sin, and for wise reasons, unknown to us, determined to per- \\\n mit man to abuse his liberty and commit sin.\n</p>\n<p>\n It has often been asserted, and we think, with propriety, that wffien the\n divine decrees are rightly understood, they produce no more difficulty\n as to our conceptions on this subject than divine foreknowledge. Fore-\n knowledge undoubtedly supposes the fixedness or certainty of events. If\n God foreknows that a thing will take place, that thing certainly must take\n place : and all the difficulty lies in reconciling the certainty or fixedness of\n events with the moral agency of man.

He has denied the complete foreknowledge of\n God altogether. He believes that God could have foreknown every\n thing, if he had chosen ; but that he determined not to foreknow certain\n things; and that this determination afforded the occasion for the introduc-\n tion of sin and misery into the world. This scheme, as it appears to us, is the\n most erroneous and dangerous that has ever found admittance into any\n respectable part of the Christian church. Other schemes may impute\n weakness and ignorance to the Deity ; but this scheme seems to impute\n to him direct criminality. The plain meaning of it is that God Almighty\n imposed a voluntary ignorance on himself in the management of his own\n affairs, and that this voluntary ignorance has been the cause of incalcu-\n lable ruin among his creatures. Now God is the governor of the world.\n But in human governments, voluntary ignorance or neglect is a crime, of\n which the guilt must be measured by the consequences resulting from it.\n We cannot pursue this scheme any farther: we feel as if we wereitouch-\n ing upon blasphemy whilst handling this subject ; and we leave you to\n determine with what feelings the scheme ought to be rejected.\n</p>\n<p>\n We are persuaded that it would not be possible to give a full explana-\n tion of the divine decrees in the compass of a single letter.

When the settlement of a minister is contemplated, an esti-\n mate is made of the sum necessary for his stipend. This sum is raised ei-\n ther by voluntary subscription or by pew-rent. Some members of the\n congregation, as trustees, take the subscription into their own hands for\n collection, and guarantee to the pastor such an amount out of it as can be\n safely promised. Here every thing is perfectly voluntary and open. And\n if it should sometimes happen that the trustees, rather than violate their\n promise to their pastor, should be obliged to coerce the litigious to\n comply with their voluntary engagements, this, although it seldom hap-\n pens in church affairs, is nothing more than what frequently occurs in all\n the free transactions of our country.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Methodists have made severe attacks upon this plan; but we doubt\n whether their own plan, or any other which can be devised, be not equal-\n ly open to objections. In the Methodist church, the expense necessary\n for supporting the gospel is often unequally distributed. Members par-\n ticularly situated are often taxed to a great amount by means of their\n hospitality; and we have heat\u2019d some high estimates of the sums annually\n expended in this way. We have also heard great complaints against that\n part of the Methodist plan which taxes their slave members a dollar a\n year. It is true the sum is not large ; but thirty or forty years\u2019 member-\n ship at that rate might draw from a poor slave more money than he\n should equitably contribute. But we shall not dwell upon these things :\n and indeed, we only mention them to shew that whilst our opponents are\n attacking us without mercy, they are also liable to attacks at home. We\n think that the itinerant plan of the Methodists, considered as a missionary\n system, is in the main a good one. But then we think a mere missionary\n system not competent to the entire edification of the church. It causes\n their clergy to ride too much and study too little to promise an enlighten-\n ed ministry. And indeed, the Methodists themselves, in cities and other\n places, where they are numerous, have fallen into the method of sup-\n porting their ministers by subscription, or perhaps by pew-rent, in the\n manner of other denominations. This, we think, makes it the more\n strange, that we should receive so much abuse for a plan known to be\n imitated by their own church, when in circumstances to justify the imi-\n tation.\n</p>\n<p>\n But at any rate, if our plan be wrong, the people have the power of cor-\n recting it* Our church government is not despotic.

We mean the doctrine of sinless perfection in this\n life. We are aware that the New Testament writers sometimes use the\n word perfection; but at the same time they exhibit a marked difference\n between Christian perfection and sinless perfection. The propagators of\n the doctrine of sinless perfection in this life say that it is not only attain-\n able, necessary to salvation. Christians who believe them must, then,\n be in danger either of despair under a just senseoftheir imperfections, or of\n delusion and spiritual pride. They must be tempted to exclude their im-\n proper thoughts and deficient performance of duty, from the catalogue of\n the.ii sins, and to substitute the workings of blind enthusiasm and fanatic\n -zeal for the pure fervours of divine love, and strict obedienceto the precepts\n of the gospel. But the principal reasons why we consider this sinless per-\n fection as manifestly eontiary to the word of God are in the following :\n</p>\n<p>\n In the first place, the man who claims sinless perfection must entertain\n a very different opinion of himself from what the most pious men, who are\n held up as examples to us in the word of God, entertained of themselves.\n Job said, \u201c1 abhor myself, and repent in dust and ashes.\u201d Isaiah ' said,\n \u201cwo is me for I am undone ; because I am a man of unclean lips : \u2014 for\n mine eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts.\u201d St. Paul, in the last\n stage ofhis Christian course, said that he had not attained, neither was\n he already perfect:\u201d he\u201cforgot those things which were behind, and reach-\n ed forth unto those things which were before.\u201d When Paul was a Pharisee\n he thought himself perfectly without sin, and \u201cas touching the righteous-\n nessofthelaw blameless;\u201d but when he became a Christian, his views of the\n divine law and of himself, were entirely altered. In the second place, the\n man who claims sinless perfection is disqualified for using the Lord\u2019s prayer\n which our Saviour taugjit his disciples, and of course required them all to\n use. F or in that prayer there is one petition in which we must pray con-\n tinually for the forgiveness of our trespasses. But in the third place, the\n Apostle John decides the whole question of sinless perfection in a very\n serious manner. \u201cIf we say that we have no sin, we deceive ourselves,\n and the truth is not in us.\u201d This determines the point with all who duly\n reverence the bible. It shews us that the man who professes to be so\n much superior in holiness to Job, Isaiah, and Paul, is actually under a\n delusion, which excludes all proper knowledge of saving truth. John\n indeed, elsewhere says, \u201cWhosoever is born of God doth not commit sin;\u201d\n or literally translated, doth not make a business or trade of sin. But as\n this applies to tnat deliverance from sin which even the weakest Chris-\n tian obtains the moment he is regenerated, it gives no support to the doc-\n trine of sinless perfection in the present life.\n</p>\n<p>\n As the best security against error and danger of every kind, we would\n earnestly exhort to diligent and sincere self-examination. This is a duty\n often inculcated in scripture; and it is of indispensable necessity to all\n (Christians, but wore especially important to those who are just commence\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0013/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 143, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 260}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0013/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 287, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 520}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0013/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 575, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1040}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0013/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1150, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2081}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0013/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4163}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:or:al:le:tt:er:of:00:pr:es:pastoralletterof00pres:pastoralletterof00pres_0013/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/pa/st/or/al/le/tt/er/of/00/pr/es/pastoralletterof00pres/pastoralletterof00pres_0013.jp2", "height": 4163, "width": 2301, "levels": 6, "size": 690749}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"13\">\n<p>\n 13 \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n ihg a religious life. The time when a person first indulges the hope of\n the gospel is, in general, the most important period of that person\u2019s exis-\n tence. If that hope b*; built upon a wrong foundation, or admitted upon\n insufficient evidence, it is seldom dissipated until it is forever too late. It\n is a dangerous matter to suppose that mere joy, preceded by what, may\n be thought religious distress, is sufficient evidence of religion. Religious\n comfort, when genuine, must be accompanied with sincere watchfulness\n against sin, and with all holy resolutions, desires, and practice. We\n must look more to the habitual purpose ana tendency of the mind than to\n mere feeling, in order to ascertain our title to the lavor of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cItching ears; heaping to ourselves teachers or hearing the word of\n God from mere curiosity, is another evil against which the Apostle warns\n the church, as a thing extremely injurious to religion. We would not\n altogether condemn what is called occasional hearing, or the hearing of\n other denominations; but we believe that hearing the gospel from mere\n curiosity, without that reverence and close personal application which du-\n ty requires, is one of the greatest evils of the church in the present day.\n And just in proportion to the extent of the evil, and the injury it is effect-\n ing, is the difficulty of applying a remedy. General evils are so forti-\n fied by example as to keep themselves in countenance ; and we are una-\n wares led into the most offensive criminality, whilst we imagine that we\n are performing our duty. We believe that the kind of hearing just des-\n cribed is often carried so far as to subvert all the ends of the public ordi-\n nances of religion.\n</p>\n<p>\n We are afraid that two important duties are much neglected in the pre-\n sent day; and that the church greatly sniffers in consequence of that ne-\n glect. We mean the sanctification of ' the Sabbath, and family religion. If\n professors of religion are in the habit of making unnecessary journies on\n the Sabbath, or spending apart of it in unnecessary visits, they are great-\n ly guilty of the violation of their duty and the neglect of their privileges.\n The due sanctification of the Sabbath is necessary to the maintenance of\n family religion : and without family religion, which includes the pious\n education of children, the church will not prosper. Families are the ele-\n ments of all societies, whether civil or ecclesiastical; and if pure religion\n do not exist in families, it cannot be expected to exist in the church. We\n would earnestly recommend to Christian families to meet together on ev-\n ery Sabbath evening, and spend some time in catechising and reading the\n word of God, or some other book of religious instruction. We believe\n that such exercises ought not to be excluded, in common times, even by\n the desire of multiplying the public meetings of religion. Religion often\n receives a sanction in young minds from parental authority and example,\n which cannot be obtained from any other source.\n</p>\n<p>\n Finally, brethren, we must observe that the spirit of slumber which\n pervades our churches seems to have fallen upon us at a most unsea-\n sonable juncture. The Christian world is at present greatly moved. In\n innumerable places, Christians are active, both in maintaining the cause\n of religion at home, and extending its influence abroad.
