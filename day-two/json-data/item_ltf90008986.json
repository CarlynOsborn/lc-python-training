When we consider the. great number\n of those who are to-day preaching the word in the church, in\n the Sabbath school, in the young people\u2019s societies, through\n missionary boards and a great number of other organizations,\n until the world resounds with the spoken word and the songs of\n worship and praise, and see that amid all this, or, as we might\n say, in spite of all this, there is a dearth of vital Christianity, it\n makes the heart sick and the spirit sad.

These are no greater certainly than\n in the days of the apostles, and the mighty Spirit of God, the\n Holy Ghost, made short work of whatever of opposition to the\n truth then manifested itself, even in the hearts of those most\n opposed. Wherein, then, lies the difficulty? Is not the same\n Holy Ghost as prevalent and all-pervasive and as all-powerful\n to save now as then? Certainly. \u201c Why then is not the health\n of the daughter of my people recovered\u201d in full proportion, as\n compared with the apostolic age ? Suppose that every Chris\u00ac\n tian minister and teacher in the world to-day were an apostle\n in the same sense as were those who first proclaimed the gospel\n message, actuated by the same motives, as earnest, as zealous,\n as consecrated, as fully \u201cbaptized with the Holy Ghost\u201d as\n were they.

Occasionally\n we get a glimpse of the possibilities which lie buried in the\n depths of the gospel of Jesus Christ when the Holy Ghost is\n invoked, and the grace of God not frustrated, as we see, per\u00ac\n haps once in a century, or possibly once in a generation, one t\n who presents the characteristics of an apostle of the olden\n time, and instinctively we think of a Luther, of a Wickliffe, a\n Wesley, an Edwards, or a Moody, and we wonder what would\n be the result upon the world if all Christian ministers were\n similarly endowed; for we recognize that their power lies not\n with themselves, or in anything they have or are, but in being\n God-crowned and \u201cfull of the Holy Ghost.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n I purpose to show in these pages, God helping me, that the\n present conditions exist because the church has left the \u201csim\u00ac\n plicity of the gospel,\u201d which alone is the \u201cpower of God unto\n salvation\u201d when accompanied by the Holy Ghost, and has\n turned aside to follow vain delusions and the traditions of\n men, \u201cafter the rudiments of the world, and not after Christ,\u201d\n in whom \u201cdwclleth all the fullness of the Godhead.\u201d It has\n been in vain that the church has thus taught \u201c for doctrines\n the commandments of men,\u201d even as said the Christ, turning\n aside from the commandments of God that she might keep her\n own traditions, prominent among which is \u201cwater baptism,\u201d\n which to-day is, with no authority save that of human tradi\u00ac\n tion, the universal practice of the church, thereby (as might\n well be expected) causing more evil speaking, wrangling, con\u00ac\n tention, and division than perhaps any or all other questions\n combined, and certainly presenting, and building up, and per\u00ac\n petuating an everlasting, insurmountable barrier to the peace\n of Zion, and the ultimate union of the church of Jesus Christ,\u2014\n yea, more, in the emphasis of which multitudes of the race,\n by having their attention thus drawn to and centered upon\n \u201cwater baptism\u201d as the thing talked about and enjoined in\n Scripture, and upon the proper observance of which eternal life\n is predicated, and without which salvation is impossible, are be\u00ac\n ing led to embrace it as a matter of divine appointment, and\n hence that upon which they may safely rest their hopes of eternal\n salvation; for is it not true, even as they are taught, that \u201che\n that believeth and is baptized shall be saved\u201d?

It is the false teachings of the church which are thus\n side-tracking the souls of men, and causing them to miss the\n great salvation, and that, too, by attributing to an outward\n ordinance, repudiated by both Christ and his apostles, saving\n properties, thus setting it in the room and place of the grace of\n God, and causing it to usurp the attributes, work, and office of\n the Holy Spirit.\n</p>\n<p>\n Is it any wonder, since the grace of God is thus frustrated\n and the Holy Spirit is thus quenched, and Christ, who is the\n \u201c fullness of the Godhead,\u201d is deemed as not sufficient, and it is\n thought that these must be reinforced by an earthly element and\n ordinance to which men may look as of more worth than all\n the purifying grace of God, and more potent in the matter of\n the salvation of the soul than the \u201cbaptism of the Holy Ghost,\u201d\n of whom, as to any personal heart experience they are as sub\u00ac\n limely ignorant as were those twelve persons whom Paul found\n at Ephesus, who declared that they had \u201cnot so much as heard\n whether there be any Holy Ghost,\u201d\u2014 is it any wonder, in view of\n these things, I repeat, that the \u201chealth of the daughter of my\n people\u201d is not \u201crecovered\u201d ? and that, too, because the hearts as\n well as the harps of Zion still \u201c hang \u201d by the \u201c rivers of Babylon \u201d\n instead of swelling the notes of praises to the King in his\n palace.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ought we not rather to expect just this result in view of the\n declarations of Scripture, out of the mouth of both Christ and\n his apostles, namely, \u201c The flesh profiteth nothing: the w r ords\n that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life \u201d ? And\n again, Paul deals a masterly death-stroke to ritualistic observance\n in II.

The fact is, that the only circumstantial evi\u00ac\n dence of any value, having even a tendency to prove\n that water baptism was administered, lies in the state\u00ac\n ment that Christ came up \u201cfrom the water.\u201d But if\n we show that he was there for infinitely more potent\n reasons than that he might receive water baptism,\n even this slight evidence will be overthrown.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:ls:on:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ne:ls:nelsononchristia00nels:nelsononchristia00nels_0109/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 286, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 458}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:ls:on:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ne:ls:nelsononchristia00nels:nelsononchristia00nels_0109/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 572, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 916}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:ls:on:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ne:ls:nelsononchristia00nels:nelsononchristia00nels_0109/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1145, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1832}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:ls:on:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ne:ls:nelsononchristia00nels:nelsononchristia00nels_0109/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2290, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3664}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:ls:on:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ne:ls:nelsononchristia00nels:nelsononchristia00nels_0109/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/ls/on/on/ch/ri/st/ia/00/ne/ls/nelsononchristia00nels/nelsononchristia00nels_0109.jp2", "height": 3664, "width": 2290, "levels": 6, "size": 461011}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"109\">\n<p>\n THE BAPTISM OF CHRIST\n</p>\n<p>\n 95\n</p>\n<p>\n Christ\u2019s Coming Upon the Jordan.\n</p>\n<p>\n I will now give the reason assigned by Matthew and\n by all Scripture why water is mentioned in this con\u00ac\n nection.

The remarks of Peter at this time are\n couched in the following language : \u201c And when there\n had been much disputing, Peter rose up, and said unto\n them, Men and brethren, ye know how that a good\n while ago God made choice among us, that the Gentiles\n by my mouth should hear the word of the gospel, and\n believe. And God, which knoweth the hearts, bare\n them witness, giving them the Holy Ghost, even as he\n did unto us ; and put no difference between us and\n them, purifying their hearts by faith.

Every earthly seed has its\n limitations. The universal law in the physical w r orld\n is death, and no seed of an earthly character has in\n itself sufficient potentiality to escape this law of uni\u00ac\n versal mutability or corruption.

Water baptism,\n therefore, being an idolatrous religious rite, must of\n necessity bring the persons participating therein into\n the attitude of idolatrous worshipers, and hence, accord\u00ac\n ing to Paul, having \u201c fellowship with devilfe.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:ls:on:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ne:ls:nelsononchristia00nels:nelsononchristia00nels_0415/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 286, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 458}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:ls:on:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ne:ls:nelsononchristia00nels:nelsononchristia00nels_0415/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 572, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 916}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:ls:on:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ne:ls:nelsononchristia00nels:nelsononchristia00nels_0415/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1145, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1832}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:ls:on:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ne:ls:nelsononchristia00nels:nelsononchristia00nels_0415/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2290, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3664}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:ls:on:on:ch:ri:st:ia:00:ne:ls:nelsononchristia00nels:nelsononchristia00nels_0415/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/ls/on/on/ch/ri/st/ia/00/ne/ls/nelsononchristia00nels/nelsononchristia00nels_0415.jp2", "height": 3664, "width": 2290, "levels": 6, "size": 469970}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"415\">\n<p>\n LET HIM COME\n</p>\n<p>\n 377\n</p>\n<p>\n This brings us to the close of the argument.
