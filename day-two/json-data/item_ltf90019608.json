He had no especial love for his\n chosen calling, and no particular dislike. He viewed the\n matter of choosing his profession somewhat as a business\n transaction.

So the medical sensation\u00ac\n alist attempts in a similar way to produce an impression\n by contrast. Had it long been thought that medicines\n were effectual in proportion to their bulk and vastness\n generally, the homeopathist rushes to the other extreme,\n and certainly makes them ineffectual by diminutive and\n tasteless doses. The public are attracted for the time\n being by the new tricks and novel expedients of both\n medical and ministerial charlatans, and this accounts for\n their origin and temporary success, so called. But as that\n success depends only upon the novelty of the expedients\n adopted to secure it, so soon as these become an old story,\n the success is at an end, and new methods must be devised\n to stimulate curiosity.

His taste in this par\u00ac\n ticular can be more fully and easily gratified in the pulpit\n than at the bar. He determines, from no higher motive\n than the fact that he can attract an audience, to enter the\n ministry. He goes to a large city and proceeds to build\n up a church. He must attract. He knows that the plain\n preaching of the simple truths of the Bible are not attract\u00ac\n ive to the majority. He himself has no decided belief\n in such truths, nor did a desire to unfold them to others\n influence him to enter the ministry. He does not preach\n them; but every Sabbath he selects such subjects as he\n believes will attract the largest audience of those who will\n pay for their pews. The idea of a church suggests that a\n flavor of morality should be given to his discourses, and\n he flavors them accordingly as he supposes will best satisfy.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:vm:rd:as:hw:el:ln:ew:00:un:se:revmrdashwellnew00unse:revmrdashwellnew00unse_0146/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 261, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 397}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:vm:rd:as:hw:el:ln:ew:00:un:se:revmrdashwellnew00unse:revmrdashwellnew00unse_0146/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 523, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 794}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:vm:rd:as:hw:el:ln:ew:00:un:se:revmrdashwellnew00unse:revmrdashwellnew00unse_0146/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1046, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1589}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:vm:rd:as:hw:el:ln:ew:00:un:se:revmrdashwellnew00unse:revmrdashwellnew00unse_0146/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2093, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3178}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:vm:rd:as:hw:el:ln:ew:00:un:se:revmrdashwellnew00unse:revmrdashwellnew00unse_0146/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/vm/rd/as/hw/el/ln/ew/00/un/se/revmrdashwellnew00unse/revmrdashwellnew00unse_0146.jp2", "height": 3178, "width": 2093, "levels": 6, "size": 360934}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"146\">\n<p>\n 140\n</p>\n<p>\n REV.

MR. pASHWELL ,\n</p>\n<p>\n heard the strokes of the bell from the tower of the old\n First Presbyterian until three o\u2019clock had been sounded.\n Then he arose, lighted his cigar, opened the blinds, and\n seating himself in the moonlight he smoked and meditated\n until the light of the Sabbath morning was dawning in the\n east. As he did so, a consciousness of his great mistake\n was made clear to bis mind. It was his neglect to heed\n the warning of his friend Joe \u201c never to throw himself\n away.\u201d He had yielded too much to a sudden impulse, to\n a temporary fancy, had allowed the transitory fascinations\n of the beautiful face of Mabel to outweigh the more per\u00ac\n manent and substantial charms of Miss Pinch. He had\n played the part of the love-sick hero of a romance rather\n than of the prudent man of the world. He resolved that\n the lesson taught him by his unfortunate experience should\n not be in vain. Even its disgrace and humiliation he saw\n might yet prove to him a blessing sent in disguise, should\n he suitably improve the occasion. In the dim light of that\n quiet Sabbath morning, as the incense from his fragrant\n cigar gracefully ascended to the ceiling he determined to\n so improve it by at once offering to Miss Pinch the hand\n and heart which Mabel had spurned. He next decided\n upon his plans for the future. They were somewhat differ\u00ac\n ent from those of the day before. He resolved, at the end\n of his year as stated supply, to leave the church of Hamp\u00ac\n ton. Several motives would induce him to take this step.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:vm:rd:as:hw:el:ln:ew:00:un:se:revmrdashwellnew00unse:revmrdashwellnew00unse_0169/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 266, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 400}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:vm:rd:as:hw:el:ln:ew:00:un:se:revmrdashwellnew00unse:revmrdashwellnew00unse_0169/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 532, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 801}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:vm:rd:as:hw:el:ln:ew:00:un:se:revmrdashwellnew00unse:revmrdashwellnew00unse_0169/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1065, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1603}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:vm:rd:as:hw:el:ln:ew:00:un:se:revmrdashwellnew00unse:revmrdashwellnew00unse_0169/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2131, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3206}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:vm:rd:as:hw:el:ln:ew:00:un:se:revmrdashwellnew00unse:revmrdashwellnew00unse_0169/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/vm/rd/as/hw/el/ln/ew/00/un/se/revmrdashwellnew00unse/revmrdashwellnew00unse_0169.jp2", "height": 3206, "width": 2131, "levels": 6, "size": 352487}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"169\">\n<p>\n THE NEW MINISTER AT HAMPTON. 163\n</p>\n<p>\n He believed that his talents would soon open for him a\n wider field of usefulness in a larger church.
