He sought diligently to instruct them,\n and thus to convert them to the truth. If we are\n clearly to understand why the Apostle wrote as he\n did,\u2014why thus and not otherwise, \u2014 it is necessary\n to acquaint ourselves with the views of the body\n and its relation to the soul held by the men of that\n day. That which men believed was coming to them\n with the Messiah was chiefly a regenerated condition\n of society; a new kingdom \u2014 a new order of things\n \u2014 prosperity and purity. Many persons came into\n the Christian Church with that hope. But more than\n this, these persons had certain views and opinions\n as to the cause of evil. They associated it with the\n material body. To be liberated from the body was\n everything.

But they doubt\n the historical facts and the supernatural miracles.\n The latter are myths; the former, the mere allegori\u00ac\n cal scaffolding which you can take down when once\n you have your Christian ideals and Christian senti\u00ac\n ments and feelings afloat in society.\n</p>\n<p>\n Doubtless you have met with men and women who\n assume intellectual superiority and much of poetical\n sensibility, but who seem to have no backbone of\n conviction to their religiousness. There is a great\n deal of that sort of temperament to be found.

If there be no resurrection, the\n Crucifixion was not only a ' crime committed by the\n Jews, but \u2014 we dare to say it \u2014 it was a crime in that\n deific region, with which we do not associate crime.\n If the life of Jesus stops at Calvary, what does it\n say ? Simply this : \u201c I may be the best of men,\n spotless, sinless, with a consuming love in me for\n men, and yet get nothing for it but murder,\u2014\n murder, foul and most unnatural! \u201d How can one\n build up a religion on that foundation ? How can\n one build up virtue on it ?

That the\n man who wrote those appalling words on human\n depravity, in the first chapter of the Epistle to the\n Romans, should cherish still the magnificent belief\n he had in the future of man, is remarkable. It must\n have come from his perception of the weakness\n of sin compared with the strength and glory of\n redemption. No man can read these verses from\n the twentieth to the twenty-eighth of this fifteenth\n chapter of first Epistle to Corinthians and fail to\n feel how vital they are \u2014 how hopeful \u2014 how victory\n and triumph seem to hide away in this great language.\n And it is all associated with the condensed truth in\n this one passage, \u201c As in Adam all die, so in Christ\n shall all be made alive.\u201d Everything else seems to\n grow out of that. By the Christ, the Church and\n the Kingdom are to be interpreted. It would seem\n that Christ\u2019s Church has to do business in Christ\u2019s\n kingdom \u2014 that those who here on earth have been\n of his Church will have a rank not belonging to\n others; but the others, if not won by the Divine\n Love, are yet subjugated, brought under the divine\n order; when, how, I do not know; but the end is\n that God is all in all.

One would suppose that\n St. Paul, with his veracious temperament, could not\n have referred to such a custom without anger. Even\n if it were well meant, and only a silly superstition\n belonging to ignorant people who were troubled\n about their friends having died without baptism, yet\n there was no fact at the back of it to give it worth.\n Quotation by the Apostle, without rebuke, would\n seem even of the nature of toleration, if not endorse\u00ac\n ment.

In those times of\n persecution, when it was as much as a man\u2019s life was\n worth to be an avowed Christian, it was very remark\u00ac\n able how vacancies made by death of those who had\n been baptized were speedily filled by new converts\n stepping forward and taking their places. These,\n accepting Christian baptism, were regarded as bap\u00ac\n tized \u201c for the dead.\u201d The ranks were often thinned,\n but as speedily supplied with new recruits.

At the next meeting half its members\n might have been seized, imprisoned, or confined in\n dungeons whose darkness was fetid with leprosy or\n some other dire plague. In those days tyranny gave\n no account of itself to justice; yet no persecution\n was dire enough or dreadful enough to scare many of\n the Christians into a denial of their Lord. It is a\n wonderful story. They must have felt that there\n was something in Christianity of priceless value.\n The dangerous times do not seem to have been those\n when persecution\u2019s hand was heavy.

The\n question, \u201c How are the dead raised, and with what\n manner of body do they come ? \u201d is one that we have\n all asked. We see our relatives and friends die. We\n stand by the fatally sick one, and by and by the\n breathing ceases \u2014 the pulse beats no more \u2014 the\n features become rigid \u2014 the eye is glazed \u2014 the face\n looks as we have never seen it look before. There is\n no expression there. Soon the whole frame becomes\n cold, icy, rigid. And whether we are willing or not,\n we have to bury our dead out of our sight.\n</p>\n<p>\n Something has gone out of that body. That\n which vitalized it has gone. That which we could\n not touch, nor weigh, nor measure has gone. That\n which made that body animate, interesting, and\n beautiful has gone. And of all dead things nothing\n looks so dead as a dead human body.

There is a body that belongs to man\n in his state of dishonor. Another which belongs to\n him in his state of glory. There is a body which is\n corruptible. There is a body which is incorruptible.\n There is a body which belongs to a man in his state\n of weakness; there is a body which belongs to him\n in his state of power. In a word, there is a natural\n body, and there is a spiritual body.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hd:ea:th:to:li:00:th:om:_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0_0108/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 272, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 463}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hd:ea:th:to:li:00:th:om:_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0_0108/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 544, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 927}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hd:ea:th:to:li:00:th:om:_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0_0108/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1089, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1855}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hd:ea:th:to:li:00:th:om:_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0_0108/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2178, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3710}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hd:ea:th:to:li:00:th:om:_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0_0108/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/th/ro/ug/hd/ea/th/to/li/00/th/om/_0/throughdeathtoli00thom_0/throughdeathtoli00thom_0_0108.jp2", "height": 3710, "width": 2178, "levels": 6, "size": 404393}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"108\">\n<p>\n IOO\n</p>\n<p>\n THROUGH DEATH TO LIFE.\n</p>\n<p>\n That is the climax of the Apostle\u2019s reasoning.\n The natural body is the type and promise of the\n spiritual body, but it is not the spiritual body.

On the contrary, that\n which he is teaching us, with such lucid and splendid\n reasoning, in this chapter is that there is a natural\n body and there is a spiritual body, and the one is not\n the other; nor can it ever be converted into the\n other. You will have observed, if you have followed\n St. Paul\u2019s development of thought in this remarkable\n chapter, that he begins with Christ\u2019s Resurrection.\n He does not interpret the mysteries of that great fact.\n As the sacred writer tells us, \u201c Neither did his flesh\n see corruption.\u201d There was a period between the\n Resurrection of our Lord, the bringing him back to\n the earth-life, and the Ascension, in which he seemed,\n as to his body, to occupy an intermediate condition;\n a half-glorified condition. His body was not grossly\n material like our bodies are now. Some great change\n had passed upon it which made it almost independent\n of the laws of gravitation.

The Apostle comes to\n our rescue, and adds his simple words, \u201c We shall all\n be changed.\u201d Then, what hopes, what anticipations,\n what possibilities ! \u201c We shall all be changed! \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Corruption shall put on incorruption; the mortal\n shall put on Immortality.\u201d \u201cWe shall all be changed.\u201d\n Death shall be swallowed up of victory; death, of\n which disease is but the forerunner, the reminder,\n the precursor, having a constant taste of death in it;\n so that the perpetually diseased are perpetually sip\u00ac\n ping at Death\u2019s bitter cup. But \u201c we shall all be\n changed.\u201d That day we spent on our Mount of Trans\u00ac\n figuration, when we said to our Lord, \u201c It is good for\n us to be here ; let us make here a permanent abid\u00ac\n ing-place \u201d; that day was a promise of what is coming.\n It was a bird of paradise let loose from its confines to\n sing its song for awhile, and then disappear. For\n like as a man is to be judged by his best, so life is to\n be judged by what it has been in its best moments.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hd:ea:th:to:li:00:th:om:_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0_0140/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 272, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 463}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hd:ea:th:to:li:00:th:om:_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0_0140/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 544, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 927}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hd:ea:th:to:li:00:th:om:_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0_0140/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1089, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1855}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hd:ea:th:to:li:00:th:om:_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0_0140/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2178, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3710}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hd:ea:th:to:li:00:th:om:_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0:throughdeathtoli00thom_0_0140/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/th/ro/ug/hd/ea/th/to/li/00/th/om/_0/throughdeathtoli00thom_0/throughdeathtoli00thom_0_0140.jp2", "height": 3710, "width": 2178, "levels": 6, "size": 369800}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"140\">\n<p>\n 130\n</p>\n<p>\n THROUGH DEATH TO LIFE.\n</p>\n<p>\n The best is always the truest.

Ten years of experience as a teacher of economics and\n sociology have enabled the author to grasp the issues of his subject in a\n truly scientific manner, and his extended travel in Europe for the purpose\n of gathering materials for this work has enriched his knowledge of the\n contemporary condition of society with the fruits of observation. After a\n more general treatment, the social relation of Christianity, considered as\n the influence of Jesus Christ, is elaborated in a brief, clear, and conclusive\n manner with reference to the contemporary problems of Labor, Wealth,\n Marriage, Education, Legislation, and the Repression of Crime. No other\n American book approaches so near being a complete outline of sociology\n from a prevailingly ethical point of view.
