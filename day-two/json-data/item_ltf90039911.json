During the half century which suc-\n ceeded, France underwent more revolutions than I can readily\n count up ; Spain had many forms of government in rapid succes-\n sion; the dynasty of Portugal was driven for refuge to South\n America ; the empire of Germany went down in the whirlpool of\n revolution ; Russia has been convulsed by a fearful plot for insur-\n rection ; Italy was many times reconstructed ; the Pope lost and\n won temporal power, and has been almost shorn of it again ; the\n institutions of Great Britain have been thrice essentially modified\n by the annexation of Ireland ; by the reform of Parliament, which\n was, in fact, a revolution; and by opening the doors of its two\n Houses to men of all creeds ; and bloody insurrections have shaken\n English power to its foundation in Ireland, Canada, and Hindostau.\n</p>\n<p>\n During all these convulsions the United States stood unchanged,\n admitting none but the slightest modifications in its charter, and\n proving itself the most stable government of the civilized world.\n -d\u201e* \u201c \u2014 - fiave fallen on evil days.\u201d \u201c The propitious smiles of\n</p>\n<p>\n \\\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:or:at:io:no:nt:we:nt:ys:00:ba:nc:orationontwentys00banc:orationontwentys00banc_0005/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 278, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 473}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:or:at:io:no:nt:we:nt:ys:00:ba:nc:orationontwentys00banc:orationontwentys00banc_0005/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 556, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 946}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:or:at:io:no:nt:we:nt:ys:00:ba:nc:orationontwentys00banc:orationontwentys00banc_0005/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1113, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1892}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:or:at:io:no:nt:we:nt:ys:00:ba:nc:orationontwentys00banc:orationontwentys00banc_0005/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2226, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3785}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:or:at:io:no:nt:we:nt:ys:00:ba:nc:orationontwentys00banc:orationontwentys00banc_0005/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/or/at/io/no/nt/we/nt/ys/00/ba/nc/orationontwentys00banc/orationontwentys00banc_0005.jp2", "height": 3785, "width": 2226, "levels": 6, "size": 520991}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"5\">\n<p>\n ON THE TWENTY-SECOND OF FEBRUARY, 1862.

Nay, the corrupt influence invaded even\n the very home of justice. The final decree of the Supreme Court,\n in its decision on a particular case, must he respected and obeyed ;\n the present chief-justice has, on one memorable appeal, accompan-\n ied his decision with an impassioned declamation, wherein, with\n profound immorality, which no one has as yet fully laid bare, treat-\n ing the people of the United States as a shrew to be tamed by an\n open scorn of the facts of history, with a dreary industry collecting\n cases where justice may have slumbered or weakness been op-\n pressed, compensating for want of evidence by confidence of asser-\n tion, with a partiality that would have disgraced an advocate\n neglecting humane decisions of colonial courts and the enduring\n memorials of colonial statute-books, in his party zeal to prove that\n the fathers of our country held the negro to have \u201c no rights which\n the white man was bound to respect,\u201d he has not only denied the\n rights of man and the liberties of mankind, but has not left a foot-\n hold for the liberty of the white man to rest upon.\n</p>\n<p>\n That ill-starred disquisition is the starting-point of this rebellion,\n which, for a quarter of a century, had been vainly preparing to\n raise its head. \u201c When courts of justice fail, war begins.\u201d The so-\n called opinion of Taney, who, I trust, did not intend to hang out the\n flag of disunion, that rash offense to the conscious memory of the\n millions, upheaved our country with the excitement which swept\n over those of us who vainly hoped to preserve a strong and suffi-\n cient though narrow isthmus that might stand between the conflict-\n ing floods. No nation can adopt that judgment as its rule and live ;\n the judgment has in it no element of political vitality; I will not\n say it is an invocation of the dead past ; there never was a past that\n accepted such opinions.

The argument from the difference of race\n which Taney thrusts forward with passionate confidence, as a proof\n of complete disqualification, is brought forward by Montesquieu as\n a scathing satire on all the brood of despots who were supposed to\n uphold slavery as tolerable in itself. The rights of mankind, that\n precious word which had no equivalent in the language of Hindo-\n stan, or Judea, or Greece, or Eome, or any ante-Christian tongue,\n found their supporter in Washington and Hamilton, in Franklin and\n Livingston, in Otis, George Mason, and Gadsden ; in all the great-\n est men of our early history. The one rule from which the makers\n of our first Confederacy, and then of our national Constitution,\n never swerved, is this : to fix no constitutional disability on any\n one. Whatever might stand in the way of any man from opin-\n ion, ancestry, weakness of mind, inferiority or inconvenience of any\n kind, was itself not formed into a permanent disfranchisement.\n The Constitution of the United States was made under the recog-\n nized influence of \u201c the eternal rule of order and right,\u201d so that,\n as far as its jurisdiction extends, it raised at once the numerous\n class who had been chattels into the condition of persons; it\n neither originates nor perpetuates inequality.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is another trait in Washington\u2019s character which may particu-\n larly interest this opulent city, where enterprise, and skill, and\n industry are forever producing and amassing wealth, that while he\n held the acquisition of fortune by honest ways a proper object of\n desire, he drew a careful distinction between the pursuits of busi-\n ness and the service of his country. He held that every man must\n be ready to devote to the good of his country his ability, his wealth,\n and his life ; and he never suffered the public service to become to\n him a source of gain. It is rumored that men among us have\n known how to obtain from the government, for a moderate, and\n incidental, and essentially irresponsible use of little else than their\n judgment, sums of money which exceed the whole direct tax levied\n upon one of our smaller States. If this be so, while it implies a\n shameful want of patriotism in individuals, it implies also a blam-\n able want of sagacity in the executive departments which must\n have made their selections of agents perversely or blindfold.

He took care of their honor even\n more carefully than if it had been his own.

The just\n indignation which is felt at the conspirators who struck at our life\n as a nation, might exult when several of the least worthy of them\n fell into our hands.

Let the Euro-\n pean skeptic about the large extension of the suffrage come among\n us, and we will show him a spectacle wonderful in his eyes, grand\n beyond his power of conception.

The foreigners\n whom we have taken to our hearts and received as our fellow-cit-\n izens have been true to the country that has adopted them, have\n been sincere, earnest, and ready for every sacrifice. Slavery is the\n slow poison which has wrought all the evil ; and a proud and self-\n ish oligarchy are the authors of the conspiracy.\n</p>\n<p>\n A rumor reaches us, let us hope it is unfounded, that three pow-\n ers in Europe have combined to force a monarchical government\n upon the neighboring commonwealth of Mexico, at a time when\n she seems, if left to herself, better able to govern herself than ever\n heretofore. I confess I am unable to devise what material or what\n political interest of England can be promoted by this untoward\n pretension. Besides, America has never been a propagandist ; our\n people, even in the days of our Revolution, made no war on mon-\n archy, and did not even ask or seem to wish that their example\n might sway nations under different circumstances from our own.\n They left each hemisphere to take care of itself.

The famous Fairfax meeting, at\n which Washington presided, on the 18th of July, 1774, led public\n opinion in declaring that it was li the most earnest wish of America\n to see an entire stop forever put to the wicked, cruel, and unnat-\n ural trade in slaves.\u201d The traffic was then condemned as an im-\n morality and a crime. The sentiment was thoroughly American,\n and became the tradition, the living faith of the people. The cen-\n turies clasp hands and repeat it one to another ! Yesterday the\n sentiment of Jefferson, that the slave-trade is a piratical warfare\n upon mankind, was reaffirmed by carrying into effect the sentence\n of a high tribunal of justice; and to save the lives and protect the\n happiness of thousands, a slave-trader was executed as a pirate and\n an enemy of the human race.\n</p>\n<p>\n This day furnishes a spectacle of still more terrible retributive\n justice. The President of the pretended Confederate States of\n America is compelled to do public penance in his robes of office, for\n foolishly and wickedly aspiring to power that does not and can not\n exist, that dissolves and disappears as he draws near to grasp it.\n Missouri, which he has invaded, rises against him; Kentucky,\n where he desired to usurp authority, throws him off with indignant\n scorn ; Eastern Tennessee, where Andrew Johnson must soon be\n speaking for Union with clarion notes of patriotism, starts to her\n feet in time to protest against the usurper ; the people of Virginia,\n in their hearts, are against him ; perhaps even the majority of the\n inhabitants of Richmond may be weary of his aspirations ; and as\n he goes forth to-day to array himself in the unreal state for which\n he panted, his consideration drops away from him in the presence\n of his worshipers, irretrievably and forever; his conscience stings\n him with remorse for his crime ; and the course of events convicts\n him of arrogance and folly. His elevation is but to a pillory,\n where he stands the derision of the world.

But this leads, at length, to\n a more formal and permanent despotism. The disorders and mis-\n eries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek se-\n curity and repose in the absolute power of an individual; and,\n sooner or later, the chief of some prevailing faction, more able or\n more fortunate than his competitors, turns this disposition to the\n purposes of his own elevation on the ruins of public liberty.\n</p>\n<p>\n Without looking forward* to an extremity of this kind (which,\n nevertheless, ought not to be entirely out of sight), the common\n and continual mischiefs of the spirit of party are sufficient to make\n it the interest and duty of a wise people to discourage and restrain\n it.\n</p>\n<p>\n It serves always to distract the public councils and enfeeble the\n public administration. It agitates the community with ill-founded\n jealousies and false alarms; kindles the animosity of one part\n against another; foments, occasionally, riot and insurrection.

This, within certain limits, is\n probably true ; and in governments of a monarchical cast, patriot-\n ism may look with indulgence, if not with favor, upon the spirit\n of party. But in those of the popular character, in governments\n purely elective, it is a spirit not to be encouraged. From their\n natural tendency, it is certain there will always be enough of that\n spirit for every salutary purpose. And there being constant danger\n of excess, the effort ought to be by force of public opinion to miti-\n gate and assuage it. A fire not to be quenched, it demands a uni-\n form vigilance to prevent its bursting into a flame, lest, instead of\n warming, it should consume.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is important, likewise, that the habits of thinking, in a free\n country, should inspire caution in those intrusted with its adminis-\n tration, to confine themselves within their respective constitutional\n spheres, avoiding, in the exercise of the powers of one department,\n to encroach upon another. The spirit of encroachment tends to\n consolidate the powers of all the departments in one, and thus to\n create, whatever the form of government, a real despotism. A\n just estimate of that love of power and proneness to abuse it which\n predominate in the human heart is sufficient to satisfy us of the\n truth of this position. The necessity of reciprocal checks in the\n exercise of political power, by dividing and distributing it into\n different depositories, and constituting each the guardian of the\n public weal, against invasions by the others, has been evinced by\n experiments, ancient and modern \u2014 some of them in our own coun-\n try and under our own eyes. To preserve them must be as neces-\n sary as to institute them. If, in the opinion of the people, the\n distribution or modification of the constitutional powers be, in any\n particular, wrong, let it be corrected by an amendment in the way\n which the constitution designates. But let there be no change by\n usurpation ; for though this, in one instance, may be the instru-\n ment of good, it is the customary weapon by which free govern-\n ments are destroyed. The precedent must always greatly overbal-\n ance, in permanent evil, any partial or transient benefit which the\n use can, at any time, yield.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of all the dispositions and habits which lead to political prosper-\n ity, religion and morality are indispensable supports. In vain\n would that man claim the tribute of patriotism who should labor\n to subvert these great pillars of human happiness, these firmest\n props of the duties of men and .citizens. The mere politician,\n equally with the pious man, ought to respect and to cherish them.\n A volume could not trace all their connections with private and\n public felicity. Let it simply be asked, Where is the security for\n property, for reputation, for life, if the sense of religious obligation\n desert the oaths which are the instruments of investigation in\n courts of justice?

The nation which indulges toward another an habitual\n hatred, or an habitual fondness, is, in some degree, a slave. It i\u00ab\n a slave to its animosity or to its affection, either of which is suf-\n ficient to lead it astray from its duty and its interest. Antipathy\n in one nation against another disposes each more readily to offer\n insult and injury, to lay hold of slight causes of umbrage, and to be\n haughty and intractable when accidental or trifling occasions of\n dispute occur. Hence, frequent collisions, obstinate, envenomed,\n and bloody contests. The nation, prompted by ill-will and resent-\n ment, sometimes impels to war the government, contrary to the\n best calculations of policy. The government sometimes partici-\n pates in the national propensity, and adopts, through passion, what\n reason would reject ; at other times it makes the animosity of the\n nation subservient to projects- of hostility, instigated by pride, am-\n bition, and other sinister and pernicious motives. The peace often,\n sometimes perhaps the liberty of nations, has been the victim.\n</p>\n<p>\n So, likewise, a passionate attachment of one nation to another\n produces a variety of evils. Sympathy for the favorite nation,\n facilitating the illusion of an imaginary common interest, in cases\n where no real common interest exists, and infusing into one the\n enmities of the other, betrays the former into a participation in the\n quarrels and wars of the latter, without adequate inducement or\n justification. It leads also to concessions to the favorite nation of\n privileges denied to others, which is apt doubly to injure the nation\n making the concessions, by unnecessarily parting with what ought\n to have been retained, and by exciting jealousy, ill-will, and a dis-\n position to retaliate, in the parties from whom equal privileges are\n withheld ; and it gives to ambitious, corrupted, or deluded citizens\n (who devote themselves to the favorite nation), facility to betray or\n sacrifice the interest of their own country, without odium, some-\n times even with popularity ; gilding with the appearance of a vir-\n tuous sense of obligation, a commendable deference for public opin-\n ion, or a laudable zeal for public good, the base or foolish compli-\n ances of ambition, corruption, or infatuation.\n</p>\n<p>\n As avenues to foreign influence in innumerable ways, such attach-\n ments are particularly alarming to the truly enlightened and\n independent patriot. How many opportunities do they afford\n to tamper with domestic factions, to practice the art of seduc-\n tion, to mislead public opinion, to influence or awe the public\n councils ! Such an attachment of a small or weak toward a great\n and powerful nation dooms the former to be the satellite of the\n latter.\n</p>\n<p>\n Against the insidious wiles of foreign influence (I conjure you to\n believe me, fellow-citizens) the jealousy of a free people ought to\n be constantly awake, since history and experience prove that for-\n eign influence is one of the most baneful foes of republican govern-\n ment.

Real patriots, who may resist the\n intrigues of the favorite, are liable to become suspected and odious,\n while its tools and dupes usurp the applause and confidence of the\n people, to surrender their interests.\n</p>\n<p>\n The great rule of conduct for us, in regard to foreign nations, is,\n in extending our commercial relations, to have with them as little\n political connection as possible. So far as we have already formed\n engagements, let them be fulfilled with perfect good faith. Here\n let us stop.\n</p>\n<p>\n Europe has a set of primary interests, which to us have none oi\n a very remote relation. Hence she must be engaged in frequent\n controversies, the causes of which are essentially foreign to our\n concerns. Hence, therefore, it must be unwise in us to implicate\n ourselves, by artificial ties, in the ordinary vicissitudes of her\n politics, or the ordinary combinations and collisions of her friend-\n ships or enmities.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our detached and distant situation invites and enables us to\n pursue a different course. If we remain one people, under an\n efficient government, the period is not far off when we may defy\n material injury from external annoyance, when we may take such\n an attitude as will cause the neutrality we may at any time resolve\n upon to be scrupulously respected \u2014 when belligerent nations, under\n the impossibility of making acquisitions upon us, will not lightly\n hazard the giving us provocation \u2014 when we may choose- peace or\n war, as our interest, guided by justice, shall counsel.\n</p>\n<p>\n Why forego the advantages of so peculiar a situation ? Why\n quit our own to stand upon foreign ground? Why, by interweav-\n ing our destiny with that of any part of Europe, entangle our\n peace and prosperity in the toils of European ambition, rivalship,\n interest, humor, or caprice ?\n</p>\n<p>\n It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliances with\n any portion of the foreign world ; so far, I mean, as we are now\n at liberty to do it ; for let me not be understood as capable of\n patronizing infidelity to existing engagements. I hold the maxim\n no less applicable to public than to private affairs, that honesty is\n always the best policy. I repeat it, therefore, let those engage-\n ments be observed in their genuine sense. But, in my opinion, it\n is unnecessary, and would be unwise, to extend them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Taking care always to keep ourselves, by suitable establish-\n ments, on a respectable defensive posture, we may safely trust to\n temporary alliances for extraordinary emergencies.\n</p>\n<p>\n Harmony, and a liberal intercourse with all nations, are recom-\n mended by policy, humanity, and interest. But even our commer-\n cial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand; neither\n seeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences ; consulting\n the natural course of things ; diffusing and diversifying, by gentle\n means, the streams of commerce, but forcing nothing ; establish-\n ing, with powers so disposed, in order to give trade a stable\n course, to define the rights of our merchants, and to enable the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:or:at:io:no:nt:we:nt:ys:00:ba:nc:orationontwentys00banc:orationontwentys00banc_0025/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 272, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 470}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:or:at:io:no:nt:we:nt:ys:00:ba:nc:orationontwentys00banc:orationontwentys00banc_0025/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 545, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 940}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:or:at:io:no:nt:we:nt:ys:00:ba:nc:orationontwentys00banc:orationontwentys00banc_0025/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1091, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1881}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:or:at:io:no:nt:we:nt:ys:00:ba:nc:orationontwentys00banc:orationontwentys00banc_0025/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2183, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3763}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:or:at:io:no:nt:we:nt:ys:00:ba:nc:orationontwentys00banc:orationontwentys00banc_0025/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/or/at/io/no/nt/we/nt/ys/00/ba/nc/orationontwentys00banc/orationontwentys00banc_0025.jp2", "height": 3763, "width": 2183, "levels": 6, "size": 533809}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"25\">\n<p>\n WASHINGTON\u2019S FAItEWELL ADD11ESS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 125\n</p>\n<p>\n government to support them, conventional rules of intercourse,\n the best that present circumstances and mutual opinions will per-\n mit, but temporary, and liable to be, from time to time, abandoned\n or varied, as experience and circumstances shall dictate ; con-\n stantly keeping in view that it is folly in one nation to look for dis-\n interested favors from another ; that it must pay, with a portion\n of its independence, for whatever it may accept under that char-\n acter ; that by such acceptance it may place itself in the condition\n of having given equivalents for nominal favors, and yet of being\n reproached with ingratitude for not giving more.
