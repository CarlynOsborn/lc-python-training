My sincere regret is excited, not so much by the simple circum-\n stance that an assault has been made, as by the spirit and manner in\n which it has been thought proper to conduct it. I presume not to\n question any man\u2019s right to assert and maintain his principles where-\n ever and whenever occasion offers : nor is it for me to judge his mo-\n tives in so doing. If he can justify them to his conscience and his\n God, it is well. Nay, so far from lamenting that an attempt should\n be made to sustain what is conscientiously believed to be truth, and\n opposing what upon mature reflection and diligent examination ap-\n pears to be error, so far from dis-esteeming him who undertakes it,\n it is with me a subject of satisfaction, to perceive that the adherents to\n any Christian system entertain more than a professed attachment to\n their distinctive principles ; that they are not willing to perpetuate\n these as so many grounds of division among Christians which, after\n all, they do not think worth contending for ; but considering them as\n of sufficient importance to justify a \u201cschism in the body\u201d of Christ,\n and to continue the disunion of those who bear his name ; they con-\n sider them sufficiently important too, to be proclaimed and maintained,\n and I honor the man who evinces the moral courage to breast the\n outcries of \u201c bigotry\u201d and \u201c illiberally,\u201d with which many are ready\n to meet him, and who does not shrink from the duty, the imperious\n duty of assailing error and asserting truth, whenever its interests re-\n quire it. Yet of the gentleman and the Christian, it is not unreason-\n able to expect, we have a right to require, that even error be assailed,\n and that truth be defended, in the manner of a gentleman and in the\n spirit of a Christian. I regret, sincerely and deeply regret, the man-\n ner and the spirit which characterized the undertaking referred to.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0004/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 266}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0004/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 302, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 533}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0004/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 605, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1066}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0004/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2133}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0004/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2421, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4267}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0004/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ap/ol/og/yf/or/ch/ur/ch/00/gu/io/apologyforchurch00guio/apologyforchurch00guio_0004.jp2", "height": 4267, "width": 2421, "levels": 6, "size": 749773}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"4\">\n<p>\n 4\n</p>\n<p>\n That the attack, and especially such an attack, was unprovoked and\n uncalled for, and therefore not to be expected, the discourse which\n contains it, will itself evince.

Regard to the feelings of his respectable and respect-\n ed parishioners, would constrain me to utter nothing, which might be\n construed into an uncharitable reflection upon them, even by the\n most censorious. But a sense of duty to the people of my charge\n and to the Church of my Redeemer, impels me to the course which\n is here adopted. The interests of that Church demand a prompt re-\n ply, a vindication of her character from the reproaches of her un-\n provoked assailant, a refutation of the assertions and of the attempts\n at argument, by which he would seek to harm her \u2014 while it is our in-\n estimable privilege, that we possess a certain standard of truth to\n which we can appeal, it is no less our duty, than our privilege to have\n recourse to it. -An inspired Apostle directs, enjoins ; commands us\n \u201c believe not every spirit, but try the spirits whether they are of\n God.\u201d* And especially is it the solemn and imperious duty of every\n person, who bears the office of a Christian Minister, a watchman over\n the house of Israel to \u201c be ready with all faithful diligence, to banish\n and drive away from the Church all erroneous and strange doc-\n trines contrary to God\u2019s word\u201d! \u2014 \u00a3 - to contend earnestly for the faith\n once delivered to the saints. Were I to pass over the attack\n which has been made upon the Church and its friends, I should deem\n myself faithless to the trust committed to my charge, and unworthy\n of the confidence of my flock. Trusting to their firm and united sup-\n port, but especially to his whose protection is pledged to his Church,\n I cannot hesitate or shrink from the solemn obligation. Nor am I\n aware that this discharge of duty, necessarily involves any sacrifice\n of Christian charity or courtesy towards those who differ from us,\n or on their part, towards ourselves. At all events, we are not re-\n sponsible for the results. We have neither sought nor provoked\n controversy. We act merely on the defensive.

Two leading topics will here\n claim our attention ; the organization of the Church and its ministry.\n Let us proceed then, in the first place, to contemplate the form of\n government and ecclesiastical constitution, of that Society, which is\n believed to be \u201c the purest sample of the primitive Church, that i3\n now in the world.\u201d \u201c This ancient Church, (we are informed,) from\n the beginning to the present time, was [has been?] of the Congre-\n gational order\u201d \u2014 \u201clike all the primitive Churches of New-England.\u201d\n But if the \u201c not unfrequent question\u201d be repeated, what is \u201c the Con-\n gregational order,\u201d \u201cwhat is the constitution of a Congregational\n Church,\u201d we are yet without any other than a very vague and con-\n fused reply. If it is to be found in the features of similitude which\n marked \u201c the primitive Churches of New-England,\u201d it is a meagre\n skeleton indeed ; from which the existing state of things shows, that\n the life and soul have long since departed. The particulars in which\n \u201c this ancient Church,\u201d at the present day, bears any resemblance\n to those which were common to the primitive Churches, are trifling\n enough, as we shall have occasion to show. If the inquirer, anx-\n ious to conform to the purest sample of the primitive Church, repeat\n the \u201cnot unfrequent inquiry, what is the constitution of a Congre-\n gational Church ?\u201d still must he remain at a loss to say or under-\n stand, what it is. True, we are told \u201c it is the Bible \u2014 to the law and\n to the testimony, is the ultimate resort \u2014 in every case of discipline,\n we resort to the Bible for decision \u2014 in all cases, the ultimate decis-\n ion is, what saith the Book.\u201d But is it necessary to remark, how ex-\n tremely equivocal any such pretension must prove, when we see the\n number of sects, all possessing the same implicit adherence to the\n Bible , and yet widely differing in their views of it ? The answer is\n certainly very unsatisfactory, do not all Christian denominations\n make the same professions ? Amongst all the varying and conflict-\n ing sects of the day, is not the same avouched ? and yet how essen-\n tially do they differ. Even among those very Societies for which\n such a peculiar deference for the Bible is so exclusively asserted, op-\n positions of opinion obtain as wide as creation.

' * The\n</p>\n<p>\n * To give the reader some idea of the conflicting views which they are compelled\n to adopt, who undertake the impracticable task of reconciling their opposition to\n Episcopacy, with the facts of Scripture, a few instances are here referred to.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c It was the opinion of the principal divines, who first settled New England and\n Connecticut, that in every Church completely organized, there was a Pastor,\n Teacher, ruling Elders, and Deacons.\u201d These distinct offices, they imagined,\n were clearly taught in the passages, Rom. xii. 7. 1 Cor. xii. 28. 1 Tim. v. 17.\n Eph. iv. 11. (See Trumbull, vol. l,page 295, and Hooker there quoted.) On\n the other hand, the practice of the purest sample of the primitive Church, pro-\n nounces such an opinion unscriptural.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some Churches regarded ruling Elders as scriptural officers of a Christian\n Church, and essential to a conformity to the primitive pattern. Others again re-\n ject them, and Dr. Dwight pronounces the defection , with respect to these offi-\n cers, from the practice of the first settlers of New-England, an error in ecclesias-\n tical government. (Dwight\u2019s Theology, Sermon clxii.)\n</p>\n<p>\n Some Churches had Pastors and Teachers, as distinct officers; others do not\n allow them. The early Ministers of this Society maintained, that all the Pastor\u2019s\n office and power was confined to his own Church and Congregation, and that the\n administering of Baptism and the Lord\u2019s Supper, in other Churches, was irregular.\n Hence, an ordained Minister, called from one Church to become the Pastor of an-\n other, was required to be again ordained.

But further, the very passages\n specified, to prove that St. Paul \u201c places the whole power in the\n Church,\u201d establish the direct contrary. \u201c I verily, (says he,)\n as absent in body, but present in spirit, have judged already, as\n though I were present, him that hath so done this deed, in the name\n of our Lord Jesus, (you and my spirit being assembled together,)\n with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ, to deliver such an one unto\n Satan,\u201d* & c. This passage is referred to, as furnishing an example\n of the primitive Church. Here we are told, that St. Paul \u201c writes\n to the brethren of the Church at Corinth, (which then was probably\n without a pastor,) to exercise the Church\u2019s power of discipline upon\n the open offender among them, and excind him from their fellowship.\u201d\n \u201cAfterwards, when he found this offender become a penitent, he\n writes to them, that they ought to forgive and comfort him.\u201d The\n whole force of the argument in favor of Congregationalism, rests\n upon the assumption , that at the time when the Apostle wrote, \u201c the\n Church at Corinth was probably without a Pastor.\u201d Whatever, upon\n the admission of such a probability , may be the inference, the con-\n trary is fatal to the Congregational cause. Even supposing, for a\n moment, that the Church was without a Pastor, the language of the\n Apostle, as will presently appear, is more than the advice of a Chris-\n tian, and especially of a Congregational Minister, to a destitute So-\n ciety \u2014 and should the case prove to be probably contrary to such\n unfounded supposition, in what possible way can the Apostle\u2019s dicta-\n tion be reconciled with Congregational principles ? But the supposi-\n tion is extremely improbable ; and being necessary to the point,\n which it is introduced to establish, it requires satisfactory proof. The\n probability, nay, the evident fact, is in direct opposition to the decla-\n ration. In the first place, there were more than a single Church or\n congregation in Corinth ; for St. Paul himself, though he addresses\n his Epistle to \u201cthe Church of God which is at Corinth, \u201df speaks\n also, of \u201c the Churches \u201d there ;J and it is exceedingly improbable,\n that in so important a city as that of Corinth, several congregations\n should at the same time be destitute of their pastors. In the next\n place, a portion of this very Epistle, \u00a7 is occupied with censures up.\n on the irregularities of the Corinthians, in the celebration of the\n Lord\u2019s supper, and directions for its proper reception.

After enumerating their various\n intimations, (not direct proofs,) in support of the opinion which he adopts, he adds,\n \u201c had the baptism of infants been introduced in any age, subsequent to that of the\n Apostles, these things could not have been, nor could the history of them have\n been found.\u201d And why is not the same, reasoning, and the more express \u201c testi-\n mony of the Fathers,\u201d equally applicable to the subject of the ministry ; and why\n do they not prove equally conclusive in this as in the former case ?

But here we have an argument in favor of the\n Congregational scheme of one order , and \u201c but two offices\u201d based\n upon the fact \u2014 that the names Bishop and Elder are used indis-\n criminately of the same persons. Now any attempt to found an ar-\n gument upon the use of these terms, only betrays the author\u2019s igno-\n rance of the merits of the question which he has undertaken to dis-\n cuss. That the word \u201c Bishop,\u201d is applied in Scripture to the sec-\n ond order of the ministry, has never been disputed, and is freely con-\n ceded, and the opponents of Episcopacy are sincerely welcome to\n all the advantage they can possibly derive from the fact. The use\n of names is a matter of very little moment ; things are the important\n subjects. The term Bishop signifies an overseer , and it is equally\n applicable in this general sense, to the overseer of a single congre-\n gation, and of a Diocese or several congregations. Its application\n to the former, does not disprove the existence of the more general\n overseer in the exercise of peculiar powers. If Scripture sustains\n the position that there were three distinct grades or orders of Minis-\n ters, one of which, exclusively exercised the powers peculiar to that\n office which now belongs to a Bishop, another of which discharged\n the more limited functions of a Presbyter, and to the third of which,\n were assigned the present duties of a Deacon \u2014 it cannot be denied\n that in such a case we should have all the precedent requisite to au-\n thorize the perpetuity of said distinctions \u2014 it would be idle to argue\n that there was \u201cno superior order in the ministry,\u201d that all were \u201c of\n the same standing and of equal authority\u201d \u2014 although the names now\n appropriated to two respective orders were at first applied to one\n and the same. Nor yet does the application to one order of a title\n generally appropriated to another, as of \u201c Presbyter\u201d to an Apostle,\n establish the equality of the two. Christ is styled an \u201c Apostle and\n High Priest,\u201d* a \u201cBishop,\u201d! a \u201c Deacon.\u201d! Would any one thence\n infer that he possessed no power and authority in the Church above\n that of an Apostle, or Bishop, or Presbyter, or Deacons ? In order\n to establish the Congregational scheme, it is not enough to show that\n a Presbyter at Ephesus, was called a Bishop. It is necessary to\n disprove the ministerial character of St. Stephen and St. Philip, to\n show that though Deacons, yet being ordained with prayer and the\n impositions of hands, \u00a7 engaged in preaching the Gospel, || and bap-\n tizing,^ theirs was not to be ranked as a grade of the ministry.

And let us suppose, that in support of this\n opinion, they should urge, that we had instituted a Senate, \u201c but ad-\n mitted no superiority among them that, although there did\u2019appear\n some indications of a disposition on their part, to exercise peculiar\n powers, yet, that an authentic document, expressly declared, \u201c that\n all men are born free and equal consequently, there was no such\n distinction as two houses in the legislature, there was no such body\n recognized as a House of Representatives, the genius of the Con-\n stitution prohibited any such thing. The argument would be fully\n as conclusive, as that under consideration, and just about as wise.\n \u201cJesus ordained the twelve, but admitted no superiority among\n them\u201d therefore, the Fathers of \u201cthe purest sample of the primitive\n Church,\u201d acknowledged no superior order in the ministry. In what\n possible manner does the fact justify the inference ? Our Lord\n might have ordained the twelve, with equal authority, and ten thou-\n sand inferior orders would never have affected their equality with\n each other, as a superior order in the ministry ; their existence does\n not disprove the divine appointment of another and another order\n</p>\n<p>\n and in what manner their equality could at all interfere with the\n</p>\n<p>\n institution of the subordinate grades, it is difficult to conjecture.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another instance adduced, in support of the divine authority of\n Congregationalism, is the alleged ordination of St. Paul at Antioch.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0034/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 266}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0034/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 302, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 533}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0034/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 605, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1066}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0034/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2133}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0034/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2421, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4267}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0034/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ap/ol/og/yf/or/ch/ur/ch/00/gu/io/apologyforchurch00guio/apologyforchurch00guio_0034.jp2", "height": 4267, "width": 2421, "levels": 6, "size": 658691}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"34\">\n<p>\n 34\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2014 \u201c Now there were in the Church that was at Antioch, certain\n prophets and teachers ; as Barnabas and Simeon \u2014 and Lucius of\n Cyrene and Manaen \u2014 and Saul.

But that Ignatius \u201c uniformly ad-\n dresses the Bishop and Presbyters of a single Congregation,\u201d is an\n assertion entirely destitute of foundation. He uniformly addresses\n no Bishop or Presbyter whatever. With the exception of that to Pol-\n ycar ' p, all his genuine epistles are addressed to the churches, respect-\n ively named in them. When he speaks in them moreovetr, of heir\n Bishops, Presbyters, and Deacons, they furnish not a particle of evi-\n dence, that these officers were limited to a single Congregation. So\n much for assertion. That the Bishops he mentions, were not Dioce-\n san Bishops ; that they were restricted to a single congregation, is\n rendered highly improbable by the fact, that he uniformly enumer-\n ates the Presbyters and Deacons in connexion with and as being sub-\n ject to one single Bishop. One of his epistles likewise is addressed\n to the Church at Ephesus \u2014 the very Church which in St. Paul\u2019s\n time had its number of Presbyters whom he called together at Mile-\n tus \u2014 that Church in which Timothy had been left with power and\n authority, \u201c to charge some\u201d with respect to the doctrines which\n they were to teach, as distinct from others \u2014 to ordain, sit in judg-\n ment upon, and rebuke an Elder. In that very Church, subject\n to their Apostle Timothy, were several \u201c elders,\u201d* or as they were\n then termed, Bishops. This the author of the \u201cRetrospect\u201d himself,\n maintains. Paul says he \u201c writes (?) to the Elders of Ephesus, and\n addresses them as Bishops, and each of these Bishops, he informs us,\n was \u201cthe senior\u201d among \u201cseveral elders,\u201d who were frequently found\n in the primitive Church ; as many Bishops, then as there were, so many\n Churches there were. Consequently, at Ephesus there were several\n Churches in the time of St. Paul and Timothy. Therefore, unless it can\n be shown that in a very short period, Christianity was on the decline,\n in a church too addressed as \u201cdeservedly happy,\u201d and \u201cblessed\n through the greatness and fulness of God,\u201d Onesimus, Bishop of\n Ephesus, must have been Bishop of more than a single congrega-\n tion.

Still their rank does not affect the question of\n their existence, and Polycarp\u2019s neglect to \u201c mention the name Bish.\n op,\u201d would as much decide against the existence of the one acknowl-\n edged order called by that name, or of the senior order whom it is suppo-\n sed to have designated, as it would against that of the superior order.\n If indeed Bishops were of the more ordinary grade of ministers, the\n silence respecting them would be much more unaccountable, than it\n is upon the reasonable supposition, that at the time of their being\n written to, the Church was destitute of a Bishop, in the higher sense\n of the term. And what is there remarkable, that in an Epistle, but\n about half the length of an ordinary sermon, the writer does not in-\n troduce every circumstance which the history of the Church might\n call up. Noris it true, as asserted, that Polycarp \u201c confines himself to\n the term Presbyter.\u201d He speaks of \u201cthe Deacons as the ministers\n of God in Christ,\u201d and directs the Philippians to be \u201c subject to the\n Priests and Deacons, as unto God and Christ.\u201d His Epistle moreo-\n ver is addressed to the Church to which he wrote, in the name of\n \u201c Poly carp, and the Presbyters that are with him not the other\n Presbyters, remark, as he would have said, were he himself one of the\n order, but \u201cPolycarp, and the Presbyters.\u201d But however some may\n choose to interpret his sentiments, he fully subscribes to what Igna-\n natius had enjoined, saying of \u201c the Epistles of Ignatius which he\n wrote unto us, together with what others of his have come to our\n hands,\u201d by which the Philippians might \u201c be greatly profited,\u201d that\n \u201cthey treat of faith and patience, and of all things that pertain to\n edification in the Lord Jesus.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It is further asserted, that \u201cClement of Rome never speaks of three\n orders.\u201d But from assertion, let us appeal to fact. Admonishing\n the Corinthians how it \u201c behoves them to take care they do all\n things in order, whatsoever our Lord has commanded us to do,\u201d\n \u201cthat God has ordained by his supreme will and authority, by what\n persons their offerings and service to God are to be performed,\u201d he\n instructs them that \u201ccare must be had of the persons that minister unto\n him.\u201d \u201c For,*\u2019 adds he, \u201c the Chief Priest has his proper services,\n and to the Priests their proper place is appointed ! and to the Levites\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0048/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 266}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0048/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 302, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 533}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0048/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 605, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1066}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0048/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2133}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0048/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2421, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4267}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0048/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ap/ol/og/yf/or/ch/ur/ch/00/gu/io/apologyforchurch00guio/apologyforchurch00guio_0048.jp2", "height": 4267, "width": 2421, "levels": 6, "size": 620938}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"48\">\n<p>\n 48\n</p>\n<p>\n appertain their proper ministries ; and theLayman is confined within\n the bounds of what is commanded to Laymen.\u201d \u2014 \u201c Let every one of\n you therefore, brethren, bless God in his proper station \u2014 not exceed-\n ing the rule of his service that is appointed to him.\u201d Now not to in-\n sist that writing to men over whom the Jewish ministry was not then\n exercised, the writer applies terms derived from it, to the different\n orders of the Christian ministry : the simple question is asked, what\n propriety could there be, in illustrating the Christian\u2019s duty of subor-\n dination, by such reference ; when no parallel existed between the\n Jewish and Christian ministry, in respect to a diversity of orders ?\n Again he says \u201c the Apostles having received their command, being\n orderly sent by Christ, and preaching through countries and cities,\n they appointed the first fruits of their conversion, to be Bishops and\n Ministers over such as should afterwards believe, having first proved\n them by the spirit.

It matters not, by what names the several orders were distin-\n guished ; the question is, did these orders exist and in the nature of\n them is there aught, requiring their perpetuity ? The existence of\n two orders is virtually admitted, although to preserve the al-\n leged equality in the ministry, there is a distinction made as if\n there were but one order in the ministry , while in the\n church there were two offices under which the inferior order in\n the ministry is ranked.

That there was a distinct class of\n persons called Deacons none deny, but by some their station is denom-\n inated an office in the church, not an order in the ministry. Upon what\n grounds the distinction ismade,it is difficult to imagine. Whatever some\n who, at the present day assume the name, may esteem the duties of the\n office, the primitive Deacon was commissioned to preach and to bap-\n tize as we find Philip engaged in doing.* Hence we infer that his was\n an order in the ministry ; and that it is not only the right, but the\n solemn duty of all who hold that sacred office, to preach and bap-\n tise likewise. But this order was not authorised to administer con-\n firmation ; for we find that when through the preaching of Philip,\n \u00ab Samaria had received the word of God,\u201d Peter and John were sent\n thither, who \u201c laid their hands on them that were baptized, in the\n name of the Lord Jesus, \u201dt thus performing a rite, to which Philip\n was incompetent. Neither did this order in any case ordain, or ex-\n ercise jurisdiction.

God.\u201d1T He prescribes to him the qualifica-\n cations necessary for those persons who were to be ordained presby-\n ters and deacons,** and solemnly charges Timothy as a responsible\n person, impartially to observe the directions given to him.tt These\n clearly manifest, that he singly possessed authority , to charge some res-\n pecting the doctrines they were to teach to receive an accusation\n against an elder ;\u00a7\u00a7 to rebuke them that sinned ;|||| to honor those that\n rule well ;1MT to lay hands on such as were to be ordained ;*** and to\n commit the things which he had heard, to faithful men, who should teach\n others also.JJJ So Titus was left in Crete, with the express purpose\n that he should \u201c set in order the things that were wanting, and ordain\n elders in every city ;\u201d\u00a7\u00a7\u00a7 that he should rebuke sharply, and with\n all authority ;||i||| that he should admonish or reject the heretic. 1HI1T\n Will it be said that Timothy and Titus were mere Congregational\n ministers, \u201c of the same standing and of equal authority\u201d with \u201c the\n</p>\n<p>\n * Compare Acts i. 26, with verse 22. t Acts vi. 6.\n</p>\n<p>\n t Acts xiv. 23. \u00a7 2 Tim. i. 6. 1 Tim. iv. 14. .\n</p>\n<p>\n Ii 1 Tim. i. 3.

To learn the Scrip-\n tural powers of a presbyter, we may refer among other instances, to\n the charge delivered by St. Paul to the elders of Ephesus, assembled\n at Miletus. * There the Apostle directs them to \u201c take heed\u201d unto\n themselves \u2014 to take heed unto \u201c all the flock over which the Holy\n Ghost had made [them] overseers\u201d \u2014 as shepherds \u201c to feed the\n Church of God, which he hath purchased with his own blood\u201d \u2014 to\n \u201cwatch\u201d against the \u201cgrievous wolves\u201d which should enter in\n among them ; against those who should arise from among themselves,\n \u201cspeaking perverse things, to draw away disciples after them.\u201d Here\n we find no reference whatever, to their powers of ordination ; no re-\n cognition whatever of their authority, to exercise discipline over oth-\n ers in the ministry, although an occasion is stated which would loud-\n ly call for it, if they indeed, possessed the authority. But, there is\n not the most remote intimation, of their holding any such powers as\n were indisputably exercised by the Apostles, and were manifestly\n recognized in Timothy and Titus. In perfect consistency with this\n view, we find St. Paul giving to Timothy directions respecting the\n qualifications of a Bishop or Presbyter, whose duty is represented to\n be, that he \u201ctake care of the Church of God.\u201dt St. Peter, like-\n wise exhorts the elders to \u201c feed the flock of God,\u201d \u201c taking the over-\n</p>\n<p>\n Acts xx. 23\u201435.\n</p>\n<p>\n f 1 Tim iii. 5\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0053/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 266}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0053/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 302, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 533}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0053/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 605, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1066}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0053/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2133}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0053/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2421, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4267}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0053/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ap/ol/og/yf/or/ch/ur/ch/00/gu/io/apologyforchurch00guio/apologyforchurch00guio_0053.jp2", "height": 4267, "width": 2421, "levels": 6, "size": 607003}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"53\">\n<p>\n 53\n</p>\n<p>\n sight thereof,\u201d* but in neither case do we hear a syllable about ordi-\n nation, or \u201cequal standing and authority.\u201d In the Church of Ephe-\n sus, then, we find most assuredly three distinct orders in the ministry.\n An Apostle, Timothy, possessing the exclusive power to ordain, to\n receive an accusation against, to sit in judgment, and pronounce\n sentence upon a Presbyter. Presbyters or Bishops, subject to him\n in the exercise of such powers, and Deacons, capable of promotion\n to a higher degree upon using their office well.

Such\n wild assertions, as deny to the Apostles any \u201c power over the Churches,\u201d or limit\n theirs to \u201c the equal authority of the teachers in the Church, a Presbytery of\n elders,\u201d are rarely to be met with. But to obviate the force of the argument, in behalf\n of Episcopacy, it is usual to contend that theirs were extraordinary powers, and\n that the office of the Apostles was to terminate with their decease. As this how\n ever is not the ground assumed in the \u201c halfcentury sermon,\u201d it is sufficient to re-\n mark, that the supposition of the temporary nature of the Apostolic office, is not\n sustained by any scripture intimation, and is contrary to facts. It has never yet\n ceased. The testimony of the Fathers, abundantly proves, that under the name\n Bishops, the Apostles had successors to themselves, in all the functions essential to the\n well being of the Church. Apostles, Presbyters, and Deacons were appointed in the\n Church under the authority of divine direction. They who presume to reject them\n from the Church, should be well persuaded of their right so to do. What was the\n divine intention in regard to the perpetuity of the ministry, under its primitive or-\n ganization, if we are permitted to appeal to facts, facts will show. If Bishops actu-\n ally succeed to the Apostles, we may presume it was intended they should so suc-\n ceed. How is the fact to be determined? from scripture? must we look to the\n writings of the Apostles to learn what occurred after their departure? No, we must\n appeal to the testimony of the Fathers, of Apostolic men, who knew the mind\n and acted under the immediate direction of those inspired men. If all Scripture were\n doubtful on this point, unquestionably the records of history would be admitted in\n illustration. Especially then, when we find a ministry in several orders, existing\n under divine appointment, and in the writings of the Fathers evidences of a cor-\n responding diversity of orders, still continued, and spreading with the growth of\n the Church, the inference is certainly just, that that institution was designed to be\n permanent.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0054/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 266}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0054/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 302, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 533}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0054/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 605, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1066}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0054/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1210, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2133}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0054/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2421, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4267}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ap:ol:og:yf:or:ch:ur:ch:00:gu:io:apologyforchurch00guio:apologyforchurch00guio_0054/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ap/ol/og/yf/or/ch/ur/ch/00/gu/io/apologyforchurch00guio/apologyforchurch00guio_0054.jp2", "height": 4267, "width": 2421, "levels": 6, "size": 721766}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"54\">\n<p>\n 54\n</p>\n<p>\n best period of its history, down to the sixteenth century, we observe three\n orders of ministers universally existing in the Christian Church \u2014 al-\n ways and everywhere.

There is between the Congregationalist and\n the consistent Presbyterian, an essential distinction, as wide as that\n which places the former in opposition to Episcopacy, and still wider\n than that which separates the two latter. The principles of the Pres-\n byterian and Episcopalian both assert the divine institution of the\n ministry, i. e. of an order of men \u201c to preach the word, administer\n the sacraments, dispense discipline \u2014 and to commit these powers to\n other faithful men.\u201d* Both recognize the necessity of an authority\n derived in direct succession from Christ, the Head of the Church,\n and source of all power therein. Both \u201c maintain that none are reg-\n . ularly invested with the ministerial character, or can with propriety\n be recognized in this character, but those who have been set apart\n to the office, by persons lawfully clothed with the power of ordain-\n ing.\u201d They differ as to the manner in which the succession is con-\n tinued. While one maintains that it was to be handed down through\n the line of Bishops, the other recognizes the Presbytery as the con-\n stituted means of perpetuating the ministerial office.

At one period, the whole Israelitish Church\n was reduced to < \u00a3 seven thousand\u201d* souls, while at another, \u201c all the\n world wondered after the beast, \u201df and \u201c worshipped\u201d him ; and\n when He, who spake, as never man spake, \u201dJ who was anointed\n with the fullness of the spirit, gathered but a \u201c little flock, \u201d|| in the\n whole course of his ministry, while the Galilean Judas, \u00a7 and false\n Christs, and false prophets, in a short time could number their mul-\n titudes, it is astonishing that any such criterion should be adopted.\n Nor is it a very easy matter to determine in all cases, the measure of\n light which a Church possesses, or what the term may signify.\n \u201c The blind who lead the blind, \u201d1F may think with them, that they are\n enjoying a wonderful share of illumination, and cry \u201c we see,\u201d**\n and yet remain enveloped in the gross darkness of spiritual night. So\n too, growth in strength and numbers is a very equivocal test of \u201c di-\n vine favor.\u201d The very corruptions of a Church may tend to such\n results. It may be \u201c adulterated,\u201d by other than \u201c anti -republican\n sentiments.\u201d \u201c The laws which came from heaven,\u201d may be \u201cso-\n phisticated by\u201d other than \u201cthe illusions of imperial or pontifical im-\n positions.\u201d Even the laws and institutions of heaven may be per-\n verted to subserve the selfish interests of designing men. Repeated-\n ly have they been so, and what has been, may be again. There is\n nothing so sacred, nothing so holy, but demagogues and hypocrites\n have been found, ready to degrade it to an instrument of their un-\n hallowed purposes. Religion and the Church have been, and may\n be again corrupted, to flatter the pride and self-sufficiency, so natu-\n ral to the human heart.

Repentance and faith are the terms of\n salvation which the word of God requires, and if these do not em-\n brace \u201c change of heart,\u201d then has no Church a right to make this\n a term of communion.

Very different was the judgment which\n the early reformers, entertained of the claims of Episcopacy.
