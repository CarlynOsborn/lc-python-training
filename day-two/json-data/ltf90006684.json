The author seems to have been\n influenced chiefly by other considerations; and, in the opinion of\n the editor, with the most happy success. Mrs. Bryan did not\n profess to prepare a work suited to the highest stages of education.\n Her aim was to accommodate an important science to the literary\n taste and intellectual apprehensions of persons, within whose reach\n Natural Philosophy had not previously been placed\u2014to accommo\u00ac\n date to the use of schools generally a science, which had hitherto\n been considered too abstruse and uninteresting for any, whose\n minds had not been disciplined and invigorated by long and regu-\n ' lar habits of study. Instead of exhausting the intellectual ener\u00ac\n gies of youth in committing to memory definitions and mathemati\u00ac\n cal demonstrations, which would not be understood, she proposed\n to illustrate the great principles ofNatural Philosophy by compari\u00ac\n sons of the most familiar kind ; and, it is believed, Mrs. Bryan has\n done more, in this way, towards giving youth a taste for the study\n ef philosophy than all others who have published treatises on the sub\u00ac\n ject. In her preface she remarks:\u2014\u201c It is with increased diffidence\n that the author offers this little work *o the publick. The encou\u00ac\n raging reception which the Conversations on Chemistry and Politi\u00ac\n cal Economy have met with has induced her to venture on publish\u00ac\n ing a short course on Natural Philosophy.

Many of the Questions are to be answered\n from the Plates ; but if the several Plates were placed opposite the\n different portions of the work to which they relate, the answers\n might be read from the explanations there given instead of being\n recited from the figures as intended.\n</p>\n<p>\n J.

I can teach\n her the common routine of children\u2019s lessons tolerably\n well; but she is such an inquisitive little creature, that\n she is not satisfied without an explanation of every diffi\u00ac\n culty that occurs to her, and frequently asks me questions\n which I am at a loss to answer. This morning, for in\u00ac\n stance, when I had explained to her that the world was\n round like a ball, instead of being flat as she had suppos\u00ac\n ed, and that it was surrounded by the air, she asked me\n what supported it. I told her that it required no sup\u00ac\n port; she then inquired why it did not fall as every\n thing else did. This I confess perplexed me ; for I had\n myself been satisfied with learning that the world floated\n in the air, without considering how unnatural it was that\n so heavy a body, bearing the weight of all other things,\n should be able to support itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B.

Height and depth are the same dimension,\n considered in different points of view ; if you measure a\n body, or a space, from the top to the bottom, you call it\n depth ; if from the bottom upwards, you call it height;\n thus the depth and height of a box are, in fact, the same\n thing.\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily.

You conceive that a body having length,\n breadth, and depth, cannot be without form, either sym\u00ac\n metrical or irregular.\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily.

I am so much accustomed to see bodies firm and\n solid, that it never occurred to me that any power was\n requisite to unite the particles of which they are composed.\n But the attraction of cohesion does not, I suppose, exist\n in liquids ; for the particles of liquids do not remain to\u00ac\n gether so as to form a body, unless confined in a vessel ?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B. I beg your pardon; it is the attraction of\n cohesion which holds this drop of water suspended at the\n end of my finger, and keeps the minute watery particles\n of which it is composed united. But as this power is\n stronger in proportion as the particles of bodies are more\n closely united, the cohesive attraction of solid bodies\n is much greater than that of fluids. The thinner and\n lighter a fluid is, the less is the cohesive attraction of\n its particles, because they are further apart; and in elastic\n fluids, such as air, there is no Cohesive attraction among\n the particles.\n</p>\n<p>\n 25.

They have a natural tendency to fall, it i &\n true ; but that tendency is produced entirely by the at\u00ac\n traction of the earth; the earth being so much larger\n than any body, on its surface, forces every body, which\n is not supported, to fall upon it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily. If the tendency which bodies have to fall\n results from the earth\u2019s attractive power, the earth itself\n can have no such tendency, since it cannot attract itself,\n and therefore it requires no support to prevent it from\n falling. Yet the idea that bodies do not fall of their own\n accord, but that they are drawn towards the earth by its\n attraction, is so new and strange to me, that I know not\n how to reconcile myself to it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B. When you are accustomed to consider the\n fall of bodies as depending on this cause, it will appear\n to you as natural, and surely much more satisfactory, than\n if the cause of their tendency to fall were totally unknown.\n Thus you understand, that all matter is attractive, from\n the smallest particle to the largest mass ; and that bodies\n attract each other with a force proportional to the quan\u00ac\n tity of matter they contain.\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily.

True. There is, however, this difference\n between the attraction of particles and that of masses, that\n the former is stronger than the latter, in proportion to the\n quantity of matter. Of this you have an instance in the\n attraction of capillary tubes, in which liquids ascend by\n the attraction of cohesion, in opposition to that of gravity.\n It is on this account that it is necessary that the bore of\n the tube should be extremely small; for if the column of\n water within the tube is not very minute, the attraction\n would not be able either to raise or support its weight, in\n opposition to that of gravity.\n</p>\n<p>\n You may observe, also, that all solid bodies are enabled\n by the force of the cohesive attraction of their particles\n to resist that of gravity, which would otherwise disunite\n them, and bring them to a level with the ground, as it\n does, in the case of liquids, the cohesive attraction of which\n is not sufficient to enable it to resist the power of gravity.*\n</p>\n<p>\n * The power of gravitation is greatest at the surface of the\n earth, whence it decreases both upwards and downwards; but\n not in the same proportion. The force of gravity upwards is as\n the square of the distance from the centre. That is, gravity at\n the surface of the earth, which is about 4000 miles from the cen\u00ac\n tre, is four times more powerful than it would be at double that\n distance, or 8000 miles from the centre. Gravity and weight may\n be taken, in particular circumstances, as synonymous terms. We\n say, a piece of lead weighs a pound, or sixteen ounces ; but if by\n any means it could be carried 4000 miles above the surface of the\n earth, it would weigh only one fourth of a pound, or four ounces ;\n and if it could be transported to 8000 miles above the earth,\n which is three times the distance from the centre that the surface\n is, it would weigh only one ninth of a pound, or something less\n than two ounces.\n</p>\n<p>\n And it is demonstrated, that the force of gravity downwards de\u00ac\n creases, as the distance from the surface increases, so that at one\n half the distance from the centre to the surface, the same weight\n</p>\n<p>\n 58.

The air forces bodies which are lighter than\n itself to ascend; those that are of an equal weight will\n remain stationary in it; and those that are heavier will\n descend through it; but the air will have some effect on\n these last; for if they are not much heavier, they will with\n difficulty overcome the resistance they meet with in pass\u00ac\n ing through it, they will be borne up by it, and their fall\n will be more or less retarded.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B. Very well. Observe how slowly this light feather\n falls to the ground, while a heavier body, like this marble,\n overcomes the resistance which the air makes to its descent\n much more easily, and its fall is proportionally more rapid.\n I now throw a pebble into this tub of water; it does not reach\n the bottom near so soon as if there were no w r ater in the tub,\n because it meets with resistance from the water. Suppose\n that we could empty the tub,not only of water,but of air also,\n the pebble would then fall quicker still, as it would in that\n case meet with no resistance at all to counteract its gravity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus you see that it is not the different degrees of\n gravity, but the resistance of the air, which prevents bo\u00ac\n dies of different weight from falling with equal velocities;\n if the air did not bear up the feather, it would reach the\n ground as soon as the marble.\n</p>\n<p>\n Caroline.

That is very natural; for as the body is in\u00ac\n ert, and can move only because it is impelled, it will move\n only in the direction in which it is impelled.

Yes ; the rate at which a body movesf or the\n shortness of the time which it takes to move from one\n place to another, is called its velocity ; and it is one of\n the laws of motion that the velocity of the moving body is\n proportional to the force by which it is put in motion.\n</p>\n<p>\n We must distinguish between absolute and relative ve\u00ac\n locity.\n</p>\n<p>\n The velocity of a body is called absolute , if we consider\n the motion of the body in space, without any reference to\n that of other bodies.

The relative\n velocity of a body is the degree of rapidity of its motion\n compared with that of another body ; thus, if one ship\n sail three times as far as another ship in the same space\n of time, the velocity of the former is equal to three times\n that of the latter.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B.

If the stroke of the wings be\n greater than is required merely to support the bird, the\n re-action of the air will make it rise ; if it be less, it will\n gently descend ; and you may have observed the lark,\n sometimes remaining with its wings extended, but mo\u00ac\n tionless : in this state it drops rapidly into its nest.\n</p>\n<p>\n Caroline.

You have seen a mop trundled, and have\n observed that the threads which compose the head of\n the mop fly from the centre ; but being confined to it at\n one end, they cannot part from it; whilst the water they\n contain, being unconfined, is thrown off in straight lines.\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily.

Very well. And observe, that the point to\n which the motion of a small body, such as the ball with\n the string, which may be considered as revolving in one\n plane, is confined, becomes the centre of its motion.\n But when the bodies are not of a size or shape to allow\n of oar considering everv part of them as moving in the\n same plane, they in reality revolve round a line, which\n line is called the axis of motion.

(fig. 8.) If you were to carry a rod\n or pole with an equal weight fastened at each end of it,\n you would hold it in the middle of the rod, in order that\n the weights should balance each other; whilst if it had\n unequal weights at each end, you would hold it nearest\n the greater weight, to make them balance each other.\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily.

One of the great benefits resulting from the use\n of machinery is, that it gives us a sort of empire over the\n powers of nature, and enables us to make them perform\n the labour which would otherwise fall to the lot of man.\n When a current of wind, a stream of water, or the ex\u00ac\n pansive force of steam, performs our task, we have only\n to superintend and regulate their operations.\n</p>\n<p>\n The fourth mechanical power is the inclined plane ;\n this is nothing more than a slope, or declivity, frequently\n used to facilitate the drawing up of weights.

By friction, do you mean one part of the\n machine rubbing against another part contiguous to it ?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B. Yes ^friction is the resistance which bodies\n meet with in rubbing against each other ' ;^. there is no such\n thing as perfect smoothness or evenness id nature : polished\n metals, though they wear that appearance more than any\n other bodies, are far from really possessing it; and their\n inequalities may frequently be perceived through a good\n magnifying glass. When, therefore, the surfaces of the\n two bodies come into contact, the prominent parts of the\n one will often fall into the hollow parts of the other, and\n occasion more or less resistance to motion.\n</p>\n<p>\n Caroline. But if a machine is made of polished metal,\n as a watch, for instance, the friction must be very trifling ?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B. In proportion as the surfaces of bodies are\n well polished, the friction is doubtless diminished; but it\n is always considerable, and it is usually computed to de\u00ac\n stroy one-third of the power of a machine. Oil or grease is\n used to lessen friction; it acts as a polish by filling up the\n cavities of the rubbing surfaces, and thus making them\n slide more easily over each other.\n</p>\n<p>\n Caroline. Is it for this reason that wheels are greased,\n and the locks and hinges of doors oiled ?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B. Yes; in these instances the contact of the\n rubbing surfaces is so close, and the rubbing so continual,\n that notwithstanding their being polished and oiled, a con\u00ac\n siderable degree of friction is produced.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are two kinds of friction; the one occasioned\n by the sliding of the flat surface of a body, the other by\n the rolling of a circular body ; the friction resulting from\n the first is much the most considerable, for great force\n is required to enable the sliding body to overcome\n</p>\n<p>\n 266.

The\n moon attracts the earth, as well as the earth the moon ;\n but as the latter is the smaller body, her attraction is pro\u00ac\n portionally less; therefore neither the earth revolves round\n the moon, nor the moon round the earth; but they both\n revolve round a point, which is their common centre of\n gravity, and which is as much nearer the earth than the\n moon, as the gravity of the former exceeds that of the\n latter.\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily. Yes, I recollect your saying, that if two bodies\n were fastened together by a wire or bar, their common\n centre of gravity would be in the middle of the bar, pro\u00ac\n vided the bodies were of equal weight; and if they differed\n in weight, it would be nearer the larger body. If then\n the earth and moon had no projectile force which pre\u00ac\n vented their mutual attraction from bringing them to\u00ac\n gether, they would meet at their common centre of gravity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Caroline. The earth then has a great variety of mo\u00ac\n tions, it revolves round the sun, upon its axis, and round\n the point towards which the moon attracts it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B. Just so; and this is the case with every\n planet which is attended by satellites. The complicated\n effect of this variety of motions, produces certain irregu\u00ac\n larities, which, however, it is not necessary to notice at\n present.\n</p>\n<p>\n 323.

He performs his revolution round the sun in\n about 87 days, which is consequently the length of his\n year.

You are perfectly right, Caroline ; it was\n by this means that the difference of gravity was discover\u00ac\n ed, and the true figure of the earth ascertained.\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily. But how do they contrive to regulate their\n time in the equatorial and polar regions ? for, since in\n this part of the earth the pendulum of a clock vibrates\n exactly once in a second, if it vibrates faster at the poles\n and slower at the equator, the inhabitants must regulate\n their clocks in a different manner from ours.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B. The only alteration required is to lengthen\n the pendulum in one case, and to shorten it in the other ;\n for the velocity of the vibrations of a pendulum depends\n on its length ; and when it is said, that a pendulum vi\u00ac\n brates quicker at the pole than at the equator, it is sup\u00ac\n posing it to be of the same length. A pendulum which\n vibrates a second in this latitude is 36 2 inches long. In\n order to vibrate at the equator in the same space of time,\n it must be lengthened by the addition of a few lines ;\n and at the poles, it must be proportionally shortened.*\n</p>\n<p>\n I shall now, I think, be able to explain to you the va\u00ac\n riation of the seasons, and the difference of the length of\n the days and nights in those seasons ; both effects result\u00ac\n ing from the same cause.\n</p>\n<p>\n In moving round the sun, the axis of the earth is not\n perpendicular to the plane of its orbit.

The force of gravitation is greater, it is well known, at the\n poles than at the equator ; and since the vibration of pendulums\n is occasioned by gravity, the lengths of pendulums vibrating in the\n same time must evidently be proportioned to the gravities at the\n places where they vibrate. Accordingly, it is found, by observa\u00ac\n tion, in order to vibrate, at the equator, in the same space, the\n pendulum must not be lengthened, as above stated, but shortened ;\n and at the poles, it mustf not be shortened, but proportionally\n lengthened.\n</p>\n<p>\n 456.

Those parts of the earth which are once heat\u00ac\n ed, retain the heat for some length of time, and the addi\u00ac\n tional heat they receive, occasions an elevation of tem\u00ac\n perature, although the days begin to shorten, and the\n sun\u2019s rays fall more obliquely. For the same reason, we\n have generally more heat at three o\u2019clock in the afternoon,\n than at twelve when the sun is on the meridian.*\n</p>\n<p>\n * There are also other causes which have an effect on tempera\u00ac\n ture. When the sun\u2019s rays strike upnn the land, they are stop\u00ac\n ped and accumulated at the surface. They are then reflected\n into the air and to surrounding objects ; so that the reflected\n heat is often greater than the direct heat of the sun. Hence, the\n heat in valleys where the rays are reflected by the hills and moun\u00ac\n tains,-is sometimes very great. In an elevated valley in Switzer\u00ac\n land, the heat is so much increased by reflection ' , that in the cen\u00ac\n tre there is a spot of perpetual verdure, in the midst of perpetual\n snows and glaciers; & nd there are plains on the Himmaleh moun\u00ac\n tains 15,000 feet above the level of the sea, which produce fine\n pasturage ^and, at the height of 11,000 feet, which is above the\n region of perpetual snows on the Andes, in the same latitude, bar\u00ac\n ley and buckwheat flourish. But, unless heat is thus increased, it\n is reckoned as continually diminishing as we ascend above the\n level of the sea. especially on lofty mountains, where it is reflected\n into the dry, clear air around them, and is carried off by the winds\n which, sweep over them, without any opportunity for accumula\u00ac\n tion. Thus an elevation of 500 yards produces } the same effect as\n a distance of 5,000 miles from the equator. At the height of\n 6,000 or 8,000 feet under the tropicks, we find the same climate as\n in latitude 49\u00b0 in France. At 15,000 feet we find the frosts of\n the frigid zone ; and at 15,730 feet, the mountains; based upon\n the most scorching plains, are capped with perpetual snow.\n</p>\n<p>\n 482.

It is owing to the spheroidal figure of the\n earth. The elevation about the equator produces much\n the same effect as if a similar mass of matter, collected in\n the form of a moon, revolved round the equator. When\n this moon acted on the earth in conjunction with or in op\u00ac\n position to the sun, variations in the earth\u2019s motion would\n be occasioned, and these variatipns produce what is called\n the precession of the equinoxes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily. What does that mean 1 I thought the equi\u00ac\n noctial points, or nodes, were fixed points in the heavens,\n in which the equator cuts the ecliptick.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B. These points are not quite fix^d, but have an\n apparently retrograde motion, that is to say, instead of\n being every revolution in the same place, they move back\u00ac\n wards. Thus if the vernal equinox is at A, (fig. 1, plate\n XI.) the autumnal one will be at B instead of at C, and\n the following vernal equinox at D instead of at A, as\n would be the case if the equinoxes were stationary at op\u00ac\n posite points of the earth\u2019s orbit.\n</p>\n<p>\n Caroline. So that when the earth moves from one equi\u00ac\n nox to the other, though it takes half a year to perform\n the journey, it has not travelled through half its orbit.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B. And, consequently, when it returns again to\n the first equinox, it has not completed the whole of its\n orbit. In order to ascertain when the earth has perform\u00ac\n ed an entire revolution in its orbit, we must observe when\n the sun returns in conjunctiqn with any fixed star ; and\n this is called a sidereal ^year. Supposing a fixed star si\u00ac\n tuated at E, (fig. 1, plate XI.) the sun would not appear in\n conjunction with it till the earth had returned to A, when\n it would have completed its orbit.\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily.

You have discovered, Emily, a mode of find\u00ac\n ing the longitude, which I have the pleasure to tell you,\n is universally adopted : watches of a superiour construc\u00ac\n tion, called chronometers, or time-keepers, are used for\n this purpose ; but the best watches are liable to imperfec\u00ac\n tions, and should the time-keeper go too fast, or too slow,\n there would be no means of ascertaining the errour; im\u00ac\n plicit reliance cannot consequently be placed upon them.\n Recourse is therefore had to the eclipses of Jupiter\u2019s\n satellites. A table is made of the precise time at which\n the several moons are eclipsed to a spectator at London;\n when they appear eclipsed to a spectator in any other\n spot, he may, by consultihg the table, know what is the\n hour at London ; for the eclipse is visible at the same\n moment from whatever place on the earth it is seen.\n He has then only to look at the watch which points out\n the hour of the place in which he is, and by observing the\n difference of time there, and at London, he may immedi\u00ac\n ately determine his longitude.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let us suppose, that a certain moon of Jupiter is al\u00ac\n ways eclipsed at six o\u2019clock in the evening ; and that a\n man at sea consults his watch, and finds that it is ten\n o\u2019clock, at night, where he is situated, at the moment the\n eclipse takes place ; what will be his longitude ?\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily. That is four hours later than in London: four\n times fifteen degrees makes 60 ; he would, therefore, be\n sixty degrees east of London, for the sun must have pass\u00ac\n ed his meridian before it reaches that of London.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B.

This is supposed\n to be owing to the extreme minuteness of their particles,\n which, rather than submit to compression, force their\n way through the pores of the substance which confines\n them. This was shown by a celebrated experiment\n made at Florence many years ago. A hollow globe of\n gold was filled with water, and on its being submitted to\n great pressure, the water was seen to exude through the\n pores of the gold, which it covered with a fine dew.\n Fluids gravitate in a more perfect manner than solid\n bodies ; for the strong cohesive attraction of the particles\n of the latter in some measure counteracts the effects of\n gravity. Jn this table, for instance, the cohesion of the\n particles of wood enables four slender legs to support a\n considerable weight. Were the cohesion destroyed, or,\n in other words, the wood converted into a fluid, no sup\u00ac\n port could be afforded by the legs, for the particles no\n</p>\n<p>\n shot may be placed,and between these, other still smaller, or gravel,\n or sand, may be diffused. In a similar manner, a certain quantity\n of particles of sugar can be taken up in water without increasing\n its bulk, and when the water has dissolved the sugar, salt may be\n dissolved in it, and yet the bulk remain the same : and admitting\n that the particles of water are round, this is easily accounted for.\n</p>\n<p>\n 576.

Smooth, if you please, but not flat ; for the\n definition of the equilibrium of a fluid is, that every part\n of the surface is equally distant from the point to which\n gravity tends, that is to say, from the centre of the earth;\n hence the surface of all fluids must be bulging, not flat,\n since they will partake of the spherical form of the globe.\n This is very evident in large bodies of water, such as the\n ocean, but the sphericity of small bodies of water is so\n trifling, that their surfaces appear flat.\n</p>\n<p>\n This level, or equilibrium of fluids is the natural re\u00ac\n sult of their particles gravitating independently of each\n other ; for when any particle of a fluid accidentally finds\n itself elevated above the rest, it is attracted down to the\n level of the surface of the fluid, and the readiness with\n which fluids yield to the slightest impression will enable\n the particle by its weight to penetrate the surface of the\n fluid and mix with it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Caroline.

Hence he inferred that, though of equal\n weight, the bulk of the silver was greater than that of the gold, and\n that the quantity of water displaced was, in each experiment, equal\n to the bu\u2019k of the metal.

In such situations, therefore, it\n is necessary to dig very deep, in order to meet with a\n spring ; and when we give it vent, it can rise only as\n high as the reservoir from whence it flows, which will be\n but little, as the reservoir must be situated at some con\u00ac\n siderable depth below the summit of the hill.\n</p>\n<p>\n Caroline.

The composition of the\n two winds north and east, produces a constant north-east\n wind ; and that of the two winds south and east, produces\n a regular south-east wind : these winds extend to about\n thirty degrees on each side of the equator, the regions fur\u00ac\n ther distant from it experiencing only their respective\n north and south winds.*\n</p>\n<p>\n Caroline.

The light air about the equator, which ex\u00ac\n pands and rises into the upper regions of the atmosphere,\n ultimately flows from thence back to the poles, to restore\n the equilibrium: if it were not for this resource, the po\u00ac\n lar atmospherick regions would soon be exhausted by the\n stream of air, which, in the lower strata of the atmosphere,\n they are constantly sending towards the equator.\n</p>\n<p>\n Caroline.

Exactly. I can show you an example of this\n circulation on a small scale. The air of this room being\n more rarefied than the external air, a wind or current of\n air is pouring in from the crevices of the windows and\n doors, to restore the equilibrium ; but the light air with\n which the room is filled must find some vent, in order to\n make way for the heavy air which enters.

I have heard, Mrs. B., that the periodical\n winds are not so regular on land as at sea; what is the\n reason of that ?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B. The land reflects into the atmosphere a\n much greater quantity of the sun\u2019s rays than the water ;\n therefore that part of the atmosphere which is over the\n land is more heated and rarefied than that which is over\n the sea: this occasions the wind to set in upon the land,\n as we find that it regularly does on the coast of Guinea,\n and other countries in the torrid zone.\n</p>\n<p>\n E?nily. I have heard much of the violent tempests oc\u00ac\n casioned by the breaking up of the monsoons ; are not\n they also regular trade winds ?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B. They are called periodical trade-winds, as\n they change their course every half-year. This varia\u00ac\n tion is produced by the earth\u2019s annual course round the\n sun, when the north pole is inclined towards that lumina\u00ac\n ry one half of the year, the south pole the other half.

Since so large a portion of the atmosphere as\n is over the torrid zone is in continued agitation, these agi\u00ac\n tations in an elastick fluid, which yields to the slightest\n impression, must extend every way to a great distance ;\n the air, therefore, in all climates, will suffer more or less\n perturbation, according to the situation of the country,\n the position of mountains, valleys,- and a variety of other\n causes: hence it is easy to conceive, that almost every\n climate must be liable to variable winds.\n</p>\n<p>\n * The south-west monsoon, which blows from April to October,\n brings with it floods of rain, and dreadful tempests.

Those bodies are called sonorous, which pro\u00ac\n duce clear, distinct, regular, and durable sounds, such as\n a bell, a drum, musical strings, wind instruments, & c.\n They owe this property to their elasticity ; for an elastick\n body, after having been struck, not only returns to its\n former situation, but having acquired momentum by its ve\u00ac\n locity, like the pendulum, it springs out on the opposite\n side. If I draw the string A B, which is made fast at\n both ends, to C, it will not only return to its original po\u00ac\n sition, but proceed onwards to D.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is its first vibration, at the end of which it will re\u00ac\n tain sufficient velocity to bring it to E, and back again to\n F, which constitutes its second vibration ; the third vibra\u00ac\n tion will carry it only to G and H, and so on till the re\u00ac\n sistance of the air destroys its motion.\n</p>\n<p>\n The vibration of a sonorous body gives a tremulous mo\u00ac\n tion to the air around it, very similar to the motion com\u00ac\n municated to smooth water when a stone is thrown into it.\n This first produces a small circular wave around the\n spot in which the stone falls ; the wave spreads, and\n gradually communicates its motion to the adjacent wa\u00ac\n ters, producing similar waves to a considerable extent.\n The same kind of waves is produced in the air by the\n</p>\n<p>\n 728.

But if I strike any one note of the piano\u00ac\n forte repeatedly, whether quickly or slowly, it always gives\n the same tone.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B. Because the vibrations of the same string, at\n the same degree of tension, are always of a similar dura\u00ac\n tion, The quickness or slowness of the vibrations relate\n to the single tones, not to the various sounds which they\n may compose by succeeding each other.

Yes. Among the variety of tones, there are\n some which, sounded together, please the ear, producing\n what we call harmony, or concord. This arises from the\n agreement of the vibrations of the two sonorous bodies ;\n so that some of the vibrations of each strike upon the ear\n at the same time. Thus, if the vibrations of two strings\n are performed in equal times, the same tone is produced\n by both, and they are said to be in unison.\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily. Now, then, I understand why, when I tune\n my harp in unison with the piano-forte, I draw the strings\n tighter if it is too low, or loosen them if it is at too high a\n pitch ; it is in order to bring them to vibrate, in equal\n times, with the strings of the piano-forte.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B. But concord, you know, is not confined to\n unison ; for two different tones harmonize in a variety of\n cases.

Is not that a strong\n argument against your theory ?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B. Not an unanswerable one, I hope. The\n image on the retina, it is true, is reversed, like that in the\n camera obscura; as the rays, unless from a very small\n object, intersect each other on entering the pupil, in the\n same manner as they do on entering the camera obscura.\n The scene, however, does not excite the idea of being in\u00ac\n verted, because we always see an object in the direction\n of the rays which it sends to us.\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily. I confess I do not understand that.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B. It is, I think, a difficult point to explain\n clearly. A ray which comes from the upper part of an ob\u00ac\n ject describes the image on the lower part of the retina;\n but experience having taught us that the direction of that\n ray is from above, we consider that part of the object it\n represents as uppermost.

When I want to see an object above me, I\n look up ; when an object below me, I look down. Does\n not this prove that I see the objects themselves ? for if I\n beheld only the image, there would be no necessity for\n looking up or down, according as the object was higher\n or lower than myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B. I beg your pardon. When you look up to\n an elevated object, it is in order that the rays reflected\n from it should fall upon the retina of your eyes ; but the\n very circumstance of directing your eyes upwards con\u00ac\n vinces you that the object is elevated, and teaches you to\n consider as uppermost the image it forms on the retina,\n though it is, in fact, represented in the lowest part of it.\n</p>\n<p>\n When you look down upon an object, you draw your\n conclusion from a similar reasoning; it is thus that we\n see all objects in the direction of the rays which reach\n our eyes.\n</p>\n<p>\n 808.

By amalgamat\u00ac\n ing it with tin-foil, it becomes of the consistence of paste,\n attaches itself to the glass, and forms in fact a mercurial\n mirror, which would be much more perfect without ' its\n glass cover ; for the purest glass is never perfectly transpa\u00ac\n rent ; some of the rays therefore are lost during their pas\u00ac\n sage through it, by being eifher absorbed, or irregularly\n reflected.\n</p>\n<p>\n This imperfection of glass mirrors has introduced the\n use of metallick mirrors, for optical purposes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily. But since all opaque bodies reflect the rays\n of light, I do not understand why they are not all mir\u00ac\n rors.\n</p>\n<p>\n Caroline. A curious idea indeed, sister ; it would be\n very gratifying to see one\u2019s self in every object at which\n one looked.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. j B. It is very true that all opaque objects reflect\n light; but the surface of bodies in general is so rough\n and uneven, that their reflection is extremely irregular,\n which prevents the rays from forming an image on the\n retina. . This you will be able to understand better, when\n I shall explain to you the nature of vision, and the struc\u00ac\n ture of the eye.\n</p>\n<p>\n You may easily conceive the variety of directions in\n which rays would be reflected by a nutmeg grater, on ac\u00ac\n count of the inequality of its surface, and the number of\n holes with which it is pierced. All solid bodies resemble\n the nutmeg-grater in these respects, more or less ; and it\n is only those which are susceptible of receiving a polish,\n that can be made to reflect the rays with regularity. As\n hard bodies are of the closest texture, the least porous,\n and capable of taking the highest polish, they make the\n best mirrors; none therefore are so well calculated for\n this purpose as metals.\n</p>\n<p>\n Caroline.

The power which causes the deviation of\n the ray appears to be the attraction of the denser medium.\n Let us suppose the two mediums to be air and water ; if\n a ray of light passes from air into water, it is more strong\u00ac\n ly attracted by the latter on account of its superiour den-\n sity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily.

But if it fall obliquely, as the ray C B, the water will\n attract it out of its course. Let us suppose the ray to\n have approached the surface of a denser medium, and\n that it there begins to be affected by its attraction ; this\n attraction, if not counteracted by some otl\\er power, would\n draw it perpendicularly to the water, at B ; but it is also\n impelled by its projectile force, which the attraction of\n the denser medium cannot overcome ; the ray, therefore,\n acted on by both these powers, moves in a direction be\u00ac\n tween them, and instead of pursuing its original course to\n D, or being implicitly guided by the water to E, proceeds\n towards F, so that the ray appears bent or broken.\n</p>\n<p>\n Caroline.

This can be done by letting the coloured\n rays, which have been separated by a prism, fall upon a\n lens, which will converge them to a focus ; and if, when\n thus re-united, we find that they appear white as ey did\n before refraction, I hope that you will be convinced that\n the white rays are a compound of the several coloured rays.\n The prism P, you see, (fig. 5.) separates a ray of white\n light into seven coloured rays, and the lens L L brings\n them to a focus at F, where they again appear white.\n</p>\n<p>\n Caroline.

Dr. Wollaston observed\n that, by increasing the breadth of the aperture by which\n the line of light was admitted, the space occupied by each\n coloured ray in the spectrum was augmented in proportion\n as each portion encroached on the neighbouring colour\n and mixed with it; so that the intervention of orange and\n yellow, between the red and green, is owing, he supposes,\n to the mixture of these two colours, and the blue is blend\u00ac\n ed on the one side with the green, and on the other\n with the violet, forming the spectrum as it was originally\n observed by Sir Isaac Newton, and which I have just\n shown you.\n</p>\n<p>\n The rainbow, which exhibits a series of colours so ana\u00ac\n logous to those of the spectrum, is formed by the refraction\n of the sun\u2019s rays in their passage through a shower of\n rain, every drop of which acts as a prism, in separating\n the coloured rays as they pass through it.*\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily.

No doubt the same effect is produced by the\n refraction of a lens as by the reflection of a concave mir\u00ac\n ror : in the first, the rays pass through the glass and con\u00ac\n verge to a focus behind it; in the latter, they are reflect\u00ac\n ed from the mirror, and brought to a focus before it. A\n lens, when used for the purpose of collecting the sun\u2019s\n rays, is called a burning glass.

I mean to say, that it has a general tenden\u00ac\n cy to reflect rays. Pale coloured bodies reflect all the co\u00ac\n loured rays to a certain degree, which produces their pale\u00ac\n ness, approaching to whiteness ; but one colour they re\u00ac\n flect more than the rest; this predominates over the white,\n and determines the colour of the body. Since, then, bo\u00ac\n dies of a pale colour in some degree reflect all the rays of\n light, in passing through the various colours of the spec\u00ac\n trum, they will reflect them all with tolerable brilliancy ;\n but will appear most vivid in the ray of their natural co\u00ac\n lour. The green leaves, on the contrary, are of a dark\n colour, bearing a stronger resemblance to black, than to\n white; they have, therefore, a greater tendency to ab\u00ac\n sorb, than to reflect rays; and reflecting very few of any\n but the blue and yellow rays, they will appear dingy in\n passing through the other colours of the spectrum.\n</p>\n<p>\n Caroline. They must, however, reflect great quan\u00ac\n tities of the green rays to produce so deep a colour.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. jB. Deepness or darkness of colour proceeds\n rather from a deficiency than an abundance of reflected\n rays. Remember that bodies are, of themselves, black;\n and if a body reflects only a few green rays, it will appear\n of a dark green ; it is the brightness and intensity of the\n colour which show that a great quantity of rays are re\u00ac\n flected.\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily. A white body, then, which reflects all the\n rays, will appear equally bright in all the colours of the\n spectrum.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B.

The light of a candle is not so pure as that\n of the sun ; it has a yellowish tinge, and when refracted\n by the prism, the yellow rays predominate ; and as blue\n bodies reflect the yellow rays in the next proportion,\n (being next in order of refrangibility,) the superabundance\n of yellow rays gives to blue bodies a greenish hue.\n</p>\n<p>\n Caroline.

It arises from some chemical change, which\n takes place in the internal arrangement of the parts, by\n which they lose their tendency to reflect certain colours,\n and acquire the power of reflecting others. A withered\n leaf thus no longer reflects the blue rays ; it appears,\n therefore, yellow, or has a slight tendency to reflect seve\u00ac\n ral rays which produce a dingy brown colour.\n</p>\n<p>\n An ink-spot on linen at first absorbs all the rays ; but\n exposed to the air, it undergoes a chemical change, and\n the spot partially regains its tendency to reflect colours,\n but with a preference to reflect the yellow rays, and such\n is the colour of the iron-mould.\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily.

I comprehend the nature of these two oppo\u00ac\n site defects very well; but I cannot now conceive, how\n any sight can be perfect: for if the crystalline humour is\n of a proper degree of convexity, to bring the image of dis\u00ac\n tant objects to a focus on the retina, it will not represent\n near objects distinctly ; and if, on the contrary, it is adapt\u00ac\n ed to give a clear image of near objects, it will produce\n a very imperfect one of distant objects.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. B. Your observation is very good, Emily: and\n it is true, that every person would be subject to one of\n these two defects, if we had it not in our power to in\u00ac\n crease or diminish the convexity of the crystalline humour,\n and to project it towards, or draw it back from the object,\n as circumstances require. In a young well constructed\n eye, the two muscles to which the crystalline humour is\n attached, have so perfect a command over it, that the focus\n of the rays constantly falls on the retina, and an image is\n formed equally distinct both of distant objects, and of\n those which are near.\n</p>\n<p>\n Caroline.

The cornea of the eye of a fish is not more '\n convex than the rest of the ball of the eye ; but to supply\n this deficiency, their crystalline humour is spherical, and\n refracts the rays so much, that it does not require the as\u00ac\n sistance of the cornea to bring them to a focus on the re\u00ac\n tina.\n</p>\n<p>\n Emily.

Its plan seems to us ju\u00ac\n dicious, and its directions so plain, as scarcely to admit of misunderstanding It is in many respects an\n improvement on the Spelling Books witn whicn we are acquainted, and we wish you every success in its\n circulation.

Well printed from stereotype\n plates, on good paper.\n</p>\n<p>\n In numerous towns, the School Committees have given particular directions for the introduction of the\n Pronouncing Testament: and the attaching of Walker\u2019s pronunciation to the work, will undoubtedly\n render the Testament a more universal companion in schools. Early habits of pronunciation are diffi\u00ac\n cult to be changed, which renders it important to acquire those habits which are correct. The Spel\u00ac\n ling Books, which are now fast coming into use, are founded on the principles of Mr. Walker; and it\n cannot fail to be beneficial to have reading lessons marked agreeably to the same principles.\n</p>\n<p>\n *** The Pronouncing Testament has been recommended by numerous instructers and other literary\n persons, from which the following are selected.\n</p>\n<p>\n From the Rev.

The book is airanged in\n Chapters, each embracing a distinct \u2022 ortion of the Scriptures, and forming a lesson of moderate length.\n 2uestions intended to secure the pupil\u2019s attention, and imnress the subject on his memory, are annexed\n ,o every chapter , and a fow piactlcal observations are subjoined, as a proper conclusion of the lesson.\n The plan of*this work, is, we think, one w \u2019ich cannot fail to render it eminently useful.

The design in which it orgi-\n aated, viz. to promote the more general use of the Scriptures in our seminaries of learning, is one, of\n which every real friend of the rising generation must heartily approve. The selections are judiciously\n made, from both the Old and New Testament. The omission, in the Biblical Reader, of those passages\n and expressions of the sacred writings, which would be likely to diminish in youth, that solemnity\n with which these writings should be read, constitutes one of its excellencies. The questions, designed\n to be proposed at the close of the respective chapters, are well designed to enforce attention to the\n exercise of reading. The Practical Observations are well adapted to the purpose, explained by the\n author. On the whole, we think that this \u2022compilation should be placed among a choice collection of\n School Books, which \\vii* be used in our Academies and Schools, of highest merit. We cheerfully\n and earnestly recommend it to the publick patronage.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n F om the Episcopal Register, a Magazine published in Middlebury , Vt.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u20ac < We have been furnished with a copy of the Biblical Reader, and gladly avail ourselves of this meth\u00ac\n od and opportunity to express our cordial approbation of the plan of the work, and the manner in which\n It is executed. Large and judiciously selected portions of Holy Scripture, in which dark passages and\n difficult words arc seldom found to occur, are compiled in an ordinary sized f2mo. volume, divided into\n udicious sections and pauses, accompanied with leading questions, and a very short pious commentary up-\n ; > neach. In its place, and for its designed uses, the Biblical Reader cannot fail, we think, to be employed\n \u25a0yith benefit. And we cannot but think, that the Christian publick will have sufficient intelligence\n & appreciate, and liberality to reward, the commendable efforts, for the spiritual benefit of the young,\n > f the Reverend Author.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n From the Boston Recorder and Telegraph\n</p>\n<p>\n u Whoever considers the immense influence exerted on the human mind by means of early instruc-\n jons and associations, wiil of necessity, if,he possess any benevolence, feel a deep interest in the char\u00ac\n acter of the books made use of in our common schools We are astonished that the improvements now\n naking in these publications should have been delayed so long. A* to reading book-, especially, it was\n he case,adozen years ago,in many schools, that not only no portion of the Bible was read, hut books\n #ere i ntroduced, containing expressions positively immoral and profane. Now let any parent, who loves\n lis children, and desires their true welfare, considei^how easily their young minds treasure up and adopt\n uch expressions, and we are sure they will be distressed that temptations should so needlessly be thrown\n n their way. But if, on the contrary, the Bible, or some other treasure of important truths be placed\n n their hands at school, this same disposition to identify what they read with their own sentiments\u2014\n o adopt it on trust\u2014to take its correctness for granted\u2014is put to good account, and may be the means,\n ooner or later, of securing to them an unspeakable good. In this point of view, we have examined, with\n nuch pleasure, a book just published by Lincoln & Edmands, entitled, the Biblical Reader, it consists\n of extracts from the sacred Scriptures, judiciously chosen, together with brief practical observations at\n .he close of each chapter, and also a few questions for the examination of scholars. The number of\n ;ages is 472 ,1 imo. Of 237 chapters which it contains, 163 arc from the Old Testament, and 72 from\n the New.

H.\n u The Biblical Reader is a book with which I am well pleased. The contents being chiefly from\n the Holy Scriptures cannot be otherwise than excellent. This excellence is greatly enhanced by the\n judicious selection of the Compiler; and by the apt, instructive, and interesting remarks, appended to\n to each chapter. It is a choice Manual for the School and for the family. I think the book will have\n patronage, and I am sure the influence will be useful,\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n A 2\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:sa:ti:on:so:nn:00:ma:rc:_1:conversationsonn00marc_1:conversationsonn00marc_1_0266/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 224, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 415}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:sa:ti:on:so:nn:00:ma:rc:_1:conversationsonn00marc_1:conversationsonn00marc_1_0266/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 449, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 830}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:sa:ti:on:so:nn:00:ma:rc:_1:conversationsonn00marc_1:conversationsonn00marc_1_0266/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 898, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1661}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:sa:ti:on:so:nn:00:ma:rc:_1:conversationsonn00marc_1:conversationsonn00marc_1_0266/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1796, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3323}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:sa:ti:on:so:nn:00:ma:rc:_1:conversationsonn00marc_1:conversationsonn00marc_1_0266/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nv/er/sa/ti/on/so/nn/00/ma/rc/_1/conversationsonn00marc_1/conversationsonn00marc_1_0266.jp2", "height": 3323, "width": 1796, "levels": 6, "size": 558640}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"266\">\n<p>\n 6\n</p>\n<p>\n LINCOLN & EDMANDS\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n THE CLASSICAL READER.

Price 9 dolls a doz.\n</p>\n<p>\n Extract from the Preface.\n</p>\n<p>\n While a demand exists for new school books, a spirit of improvement in our schools is denoted, and\n the crest cause of education is in evident prosperity We shall begin to despair of that cause, when\n instructors, parents, and pupils, are content with the elements whi ch have long been iu use, and cease\n to call on the press for novelty and variety.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our general rules in selection and arrangement have been these ; to make our most copious draughts\n on the literature of the present age ; to give as great a variety of authors as possible ; and to introduce\n a good proportion of native American literature.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is still another rule, to which we have endeavoured most, rigidly to adhere. We have felt our\u00ac\n selves called upon by every sentiment of duty, and of regard to the happiness and well being of the\n rising generation, to admit no piece into our book, of the good tendency of which, there could be the\n slightest doubt. Eloquence, wit, and fine writing, have been no apology with us, if any offence has\n been offered to morality or religion.\n</p>\n<p>\n Recommendations.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Editor of the Eoston Commercial Gazette says of the work, \u201cWe have examined, with some\n attention, a duodecimo volume of 420 PP* recently published , with the title of * Classical Reader.\u2019\n We think great judgment aud taste are discovered in the selection, indeed, such is the character of\n the Editors, that no compositions would be expected to find a place in the work, other than those which\n breathe the most exalted moral spirit. The frequent perusal of the articles in this volume, whether\n in school or the study, cannot fail to aid in fo ming a pure literary taste, and at the same time to imbue\n the susceptible mind of youth with an ardent love of virtue . Some of the essays are calculated directly\n to excite sentiments of piety and gratitude to the Great Author of all good.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n From the American Traveller .\n</p>\n<p>\n u The Classical Reader, just from the press of Lincoln & Edmands, has already received the favourable\n notice of several of our cotemporaries. From what we have examined of the work, we are sure it ha $\n received no common degree of care ' and pains from its compilers, the Rev. Mr. Greenwood, and Mi. G.\n B. Emerson ; and they may safely look forward for its favourable reception among our enlightened and\n discriminating instructors. To sum it up in one figure, the cabinet they have collected, contains more\n than two hundred brilliant specimens, a large proportion of which, though new, are rich in the products\n of our native mines- And it cannot be a subject of regret that they have passed over old and long desert\u00ac\n ed stores to cull the most sparkling gems from the newly wrought veins of Irving, Webster, Everett,\n Channing, Sparks, Biyant, and Percival . \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Extract from the Christian Examiner, for Sept, and O ' t. 1826.\n</p>\n<p>\n < c This book bears ample testimony to the good taste and various reading of its compilers. It deserves\n a place not only upon the forms of our schools : it should also be found upon the shelves of all who*\n would possess, in a neat and compact volume, specimens of the choicest literature of the past, and the\n passing age It professed ly draws most copiously from works of the present day ; and, while looking\n at those produced within the last few years, it is grateful to our patriotic feelings, to see our own writers\n standing side by side with the best of England\u2019s, not orcl > without a blush upon thei r taces or our own,\n but with a conviction that they bestow as mu < h honour as they receive by their station. But that which\n gives this School Book a better claim to the pubiick favour, than its high literary character, is, not its\n mere perfect freedom from every thing offensive to religion and morality, bnt the correct, elevating,,\n and persuasive lone of moral and religious sentiment that pervades every serious piece In the volume.\n Our youth cannot become familiar with it, without becoming better. In this point of view, we regard\n it as inestimable.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n From the American Journal of Education for Jan. 1827.\n</p>\n<p>\n No parent whose circumstances afford him the high privilege t\u00bbf educating his children in such a man\u00ac\n ner as to make them respectable in life, should consider the business of educati n as completed, while\n they are It ft unprovided with the means of early acquiring that mental refinement which results from\n an early taste for literary reading The moral influence of such a taste, though it is too commonly o-\n verlooked, i s, we believe, of incalculable value. It is unnecessary to mention the high and varied range\n of thought, the lofty emotion, the pure and generous sentiments, which predominate in a judicious\n compilation such as the one before us, or to expatiate on the force or the fertility of association in.the\n juvenile mind, by which it necessarily transfers to its own conceptions the character of those on which\n it habitually dwells, in contemplating the sentiments of others. There is a vast amount of involuntary\n and imperceptible moral improvement thus gradually imbibed, which has often a more deep and per\u00ac\n manent effect on the formation of character, than all the direct precepts, which parents and teachers are\n too apt to suppose form the sum of moral instruction.\n</p>\n<p>\n We are happy, therefore, to see another valuable addition to the list of reading books,\u2014one which\n has been compiled with a strict regard to the tendency of the pieces it contains, and which bears the\n stamp of so high a standard of literary taste. In these respects the Classical ' Reader is highly credible\n to its editors; and, indeed, when compared with the best * class books\u2019 and ' readers* used in England, the\n work says much for the progress of education and taste in this country.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the doraestick circle, an hour spent in reading by rotation from its pages, would certainly contrib\u00ac\n ute to social enjoyment, and to the formation of an easy and graceful style of reading,\u2014an accomplish\u00ac\n ment highly important to all parents who are desirous of acquiring the power of securing the attention*.\n</p>\n<p>\n \\ interesting the feelings of their children.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:sa:ti:on:so:nn:00:ma:rc:_1:conversationsonn00marc_1:conversationsonn00marc_1_0267/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 229, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 414}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:sa:ti:on:so:nn:00:ma:rc:_1:conversationsonn00marc_1:conversationsonn00marc_1_0267/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 459, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 828}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:sa:ti:on:so:nn:00:ma:rc:_1:conversationsonn00marc_1:conversationsonn00marc_1_0267/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 919, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1656}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:sa:ti:on:so:nn:00:ma:rc:_1:conversationsonn00marc_1:conversationsonn00marc_1_0267/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1839, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3312}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:sa:ti:on:so:nn:00:ma:rc:_1:conversationsonn00marc_1:conversationsonn00marc_1_0267/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nv/er/sa/ti/on/so/nn/00/ma/rc/_1/conversationsonn00marc_1/conversationsonn00marc_1_0267.jp2", "height": 3312, "width": 1839, "levels": 6, "size": 527330}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"267\">\n<p>\n SCHOOL-BOOK ADVERTISER. 7\n</p>\n<p>\n From the Christian Register for October 23.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our reader^ will be pleased to see on our last page, a letter of Milton containing an account of his blind\u00ac\n ness.

That its\n merits render it worthy of the career of usefulness for which it is designed, no one, we think, will doubt\n who has perused it. Mr. Alger\u2019s method extends to every word in which it would seem that a mispronun\u00ac\n ciation could possibly be made. .This idea % we think, a happy one ; for many errors In common reading\n are those which the reader is accustomed to make in conversation, and which ha hit makes him transfer to\n his style of reading.\u2014If in these circu distances, his oook affords him no guidance or correct i < n, but in the\n moie difficult words, he is still liable to numberless inaccuracies which be has never suspected\n</p>\n<p>\n The Pronouncing Bible will prove a radical cure of such evils. It hems the case less reader in on every\n side, and leaves him no opportunity of watering off into error This wotk will perhaps do more than\n has been effected by all the dictionaries heretofore published, to produce throughout the United States,a\n uniform and chaste pronunciation of the English language.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n From Rev* Mr. Picrpont, Pastor of the Churvh in Hollis Street , Boston, to the publishers.\n</p>\n<p>\n Boston, Sept. 2. 1824.\n</p>\n<p>\n Next in valufe to those things that he ; p us to a correct understanding of the documents of our religion,\n are those which help us to a correct reading of them. Inaccuracy in the pronunciation of many words in\n the Sac red Volume,especially ot proper names, is an eyil that is not confined to f amilies, at their domes-\n tick devotions: it finds its way into our school-houses, and even intrudes itself into too many of our\n pulpits : producing in the church a diversity of tongues, that is a proof of any thing but apostolical gifts.\n Every judicious effort to remedy this evil deserves,and will meet, the approbation and patronage of an\n enlightened Christian community and l am gratified to find that Mr. Alger\u2019s edition of the New Testa\u00ac\n ment, in which Walker\u2019s pronunciation has been indicated in the text, has so far succeeded, as to en\u00ac\n courage you to publish the whole Bible upon the same plan.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the pronunciation of the Hebrew names that occur in the holy scriptures, I should not, indeed, con\u00ac\n sider myself bound by the authority of Walker 60 implicitly as when it is applied to the pronunciation\n of the English language generally, or of Greek and Latin proper names. In the pronunciation of the\n Hebrew names, however, I should very infrequently depart from his authority ; and, so long as there is\n no higher standard than his, accessible to the great proportion even of well educated Christians, much will\n be done when readers of all classes shall be enabled readily to refer to that; and still more, when his\n pronunciation of our vernacular tongue shall be obtruded upon their notice whenever they consult the\n oracles of life\n</p>\n<p>\n From Mr. Alger\u2019s industry, and his well known accuracy in preparing works of this kind,I am per\u00ac\n suaded that the publick will be furnished with as correct an edition of the work which you have in hand,\n as could reasonably beexpected from any man; and I most heartily wish you success in your laudable\n enterprise.

It is of great importance that children be early accustomed to\n conform to a correct standard of orthoepy ; and we cannot conceal the fact, if we would, that almost\n a total disregard to accuracy and system, in this particular, prevails, not only in families and commpa\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:sa:ti:on:so:nn:00:ma:rc:_1:conversationsonn00marc_1:conversationsonn00marc_1_0270/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 224, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 415}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:sa:ti:on:so:nn:00:ma:rc:_1:conversationsonn00marc_1:conversationsonn00marc_1_0270/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 449, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 830}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:sa:ti:on:so:nn:00:ma:rc:_1:conversationsonn00marc_1:conversationsonn00marc_1_0270/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 898, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1661}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:sa:ti:on:so:nn:00:ma:rc:_1:conversationsonn00marc_1:conversationsonn00marc_1_0270/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1796, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3323}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:sa:ti:on:so:nn:00:ma:rc:_1:conversationsonn00marc_1:conversationsonn00marc_1_0270/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nv/er/sa/ti/on/so/nn/00/ma/rc/_1/conversationsonn00marc_1/conversationsonn00marc_1_0270.jp2", "height": 3323, "width": 1796, "levels": 6, "size": 539317}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"270\">\n<p>\n 10\n</p>\n<p>\n LINCOLN & EDM4NDS\n</p>\n<p>\n schools, but also in too many of our academies and colleges.
