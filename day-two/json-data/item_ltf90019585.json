You Gentiles are free\n from the Law of Moses, and ever have been (v. 24).\n And you Jewish Christians can hear Moses in your\n synagogues, wherever you are and whenever you\n wish. But remember that Christianity is a new\n beginning, in and from Christ, who only is to be named\n as its Author and Fountain-head (vs. 7, 11, 26), and\n that it is not a revised or extended Judaism, or an out\u00ac\n growth of it, and therefore, that while you need not\n feel bound to abruptly abandon all that ages have\n made sacred to you, you are also not to enforce it along\n with Christianity, upon converts to the latter only\n (v. 19).\n</p>\n<p>\n The absence of any mention of the Lord\u2019s Day in\n this account is nothing against the authority of that\n Day.
