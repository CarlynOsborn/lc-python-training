yogis of India, and to inquire into their nature and\n the method of their production.\n</p>\n<p>\n The feats performed by Indian fakirs are\n numerous, but I shall describe those most com-\n monly witnessed : the mango-tree trick, the basket\n trick, the bowl of water trick, the dry sands trick,\n the rope and dismembered body test, levitation,\n snake charming, burial alive, etc.\n</p>\n<p>\n As so much is heard of Indian magic, and the\n powers of the Oriental performer, it may be well\n to examine their performances somewhat criti-\n cally, and to see how far we are entitled to as-\n sume that there is anything in them suggesting\n the supernormal, anything calling for explana-\n tions that necessitate the operation of laws \u201cother\n than those known to Western science.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n THE MANGO-TREE TRICK.\n</p>\n<p>\n I shall begin by describing the famous mango-\n tree trick \u2014 perhaps the best known of all the\n feats performed by the Indian conjuror.

The leaf and twigs\n of the mango-tree are exceedingly tough and\n pliable, almost like leather, and can be folded or\n compressed into a very small space without break-\n ing the stems and the leaves, and, when this\n pressure is released, the leaves will resume their\n former expanded condition very rapidly, without\n showing any traces of the folding process. The\n leaves can be turned upon themselves and rolled\n into a tight ball, in which folded condition they\n occupy very little space, and yet will resume their\n extended condition when this pressure is released.\n And this brings me to the heart of my explanation.\n</p>\n<p>\n The mango seed that is placed in the mound\n of earth is especially prepared before the per-\n formance, by the fakir, in the following manner :\n He splits the seed open, scoops out its contents,\n dries it somewhat, then places within it a shoot\n of a mango-tree folded and compressed so as to\n fit into the mango seed. It must be remembered\n that the mango seed is no small thing, but is about\n two inches long (sometimes more) by an inch to\n an inch and a half broad.

This the conjuror proceeds to\n fill with water. There is no trick about the pail,\n and the water is ordinary water, which may be\n supplied from any source. The conjuror then\n extracts a handful of dry sand from a bag and\n blows it hither and thither, showing it to be ex-\n ceedingly dry. A handful of this sand is then\n carefully deposited in the bottom of the pail, in\n the water, and everyone can see it, resting peace-\n fully at the bottom of the pail. The conjuror then\n carefully washes and wipes his hands, and shows\n them perfectly clean and empty. Then, placing\n one hand in the water, he extracts from the pail\n a handful of the sand, and shows it to be just as\n dry as when it was placed in the pail. Blowing\n sharply into his hand, the sand flies in every di-\n rection, showing it to be still perfectly dry.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is a very ingenious trick, and could\n never be discovered unless its secret were ex-\n plained.

While\n covering the bowl with the handkerchief the\n j uggler found occasion to scratch off a wax pellet,\n covering an air-hole, this allowing the cold water\n to run down into the empty space in the foot of\n the bowl.

The evidence, as it stands, is certainly\n inconclusive, in any case, and though there is a\n certain analogy between these performances and\n those of D. D. Home, e. g., the inaccuracy in\n recording, the doubt surrounding these phe-\n nomena can be said to offer no direct support to\n the theory of hallucination in Home\u2019s case, which\n must stand or fall on its own merits.
