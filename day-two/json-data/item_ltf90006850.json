I should have been happy, indeed, to\n visit this Seat of Science at any time; to see so many of our geneious\n youth from all parts \u00a9f our State, and many parts of our country, as\u00ac\n sembled here, and pursuing those liberal studies which are to qualify\n them for the various walks of life that are waiting to receive them;\n but I feel particularly so to visit it now, under your auspices, and to\n find myself here this afternoon, in the midst of this assembly, and in\n the bosom of a Society formed for the purest purpose, and which pro\u00ac\n mises to confer the most important benefits upon this Institution, and\n upon our whole State: 1 rejoice with all my heart in the establishment\n of such an association, and not merely for its work\u2019s sake, but also be\u00ac\n cause it gives us an assurance that Religion, whose influences are so\n benign, and so indispensable to the prosperity of every Seminary of\n Learning, has come into this \u201c Temple of Science and Liberty,\u201d and\n has found here a sanctuary and a shrine. I rejoice, too, that she has\n come into it in the best manner; not by compulsion or restraint; but\n freely, naturally\u2014according to her own nature, that is, divinely\u2014and\n like an Angel of Light, to brighten the scene about her by the beauty\n of her countenance, and the sweetness of her smile. And I must add,\n that she has come into it in her fairest form, in the body of a Society\n based upon the Bible, which is the common possession, and the com\u00ac\n mon bond of Christians of all denominations, and in the circulation of\n which, they ean all so happily and so harmoniously unite. I rejoice,\n then, with all my heart, in the establishment of your association; and\n I shall certainly feel myself most happy, as well as most honored, if I\n shall be able, by any thing that I can say, to animate and encourage\n you to a more earnest, zealous, and impassioned prosecution of the no\u00ac\n ble work in which you are engaged.\n</p>\n<p>\n And it is a noble work, indeed. For, what is it that you have un\u00ac\n dertaken to do? You have united yourselves together, in alliance\n with the great confederation of Christians in all parts of our country,\n to send the Bible, the Word of God, as far as possible, throughout all\n our land, and throughout all the earth. And what can 1 say in praise\n of such an engagement, beyond what is obviously implied in the cha\u00ac\n racter of the Bible itself? Undoubtedly it is a good work to circulate\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:ma:xw:addressdelivered00maxw:addressdelivered00maxw_0004/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 308, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 511}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:ma:xw:addressdelivered00maxw:addressdelivered00maxw_0004/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 616, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1023}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:ma:xw:addressdelivered00maxw:addressdelivered00maxw_0004/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1233, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2046}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:ma:xw:addressdelivered00maxw:addressdelivered00maxw_0004/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2467, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4093}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:ma:xw:addressdelivered00maxw:addressdelivered00maxw_0004/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ad/dr/es/sd/el/iv/er/ed/00/ma/xw/addressdelivered00maxw/addressdelivered00maxw_0004.jp2", "height": 4093, "width": 2467, "levels": 6, "size": 751621}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"4\">\n<p>\n 4\n</p>\n<p>\n any good book.

But the Bible,\n you will allow me to say, considering it for a moment as a mere man\u2019s\n book, and dropping its divinity, (that divinity that stirs and speaks in\n every page and sentence of it,) the Bible is the best book in the world.\n It contains the collected compositions of the most extraordinary club\n or constellation of writers, historians, sages, philosophers, and poets,\n that the world has ever seen. It gives you the most important and in\u00ac\n teresting information, upon the most important and interesting subjects,\n and such as you will find in no other volume. Here is history, the\n oldest extant; the history of our earth, from its origin to its end; from\n its first kindling in Chaos, to the final conflagration that shall wrap all\n its glories and itself in one pall of flame. Then you have the history\n of man\u2014of our own race\u2014of the formation of the first man out of\n the earth, and of the first woman, subducted from his side as he lay\n asleep, or tranced, on the flowery sward, and dreaming, perhaps, (as\n the poet has beautifully imagined,) of the lovely apparition that waste\n beam upon his sight when he awoke, as he did, to find her there\u2014be\u00ac\n fore him\u2014in all her charms, for his eyes, and for his heart. Then\n you have the vision, (if it is no more,) of that happy Garden of Para \u00ac\n dise, with those two sacramental trees, the Tree of Life, and the Tre\n of Knowledge\u2014soon to become the Tree of Death; for the Serpent\n enters upon the scene, and you have the temptation\u2014the transgression,\n with all its tragic consequences, (still felt or feared in all our hearts ;)\n the expulsion of the sinful pair from the Garden into the world, now\n cursed for their sake; with the Cherubim, and the Sword at the Easle ,\n Gate, turning every way, to bar the returnof the guilty rebels to the Tn \"\n of Life. Then you have the story of Cain and Abel, the first murde\n and the first martyr. Then you have the stories of the Patriarchs,\n sons of God, and sires of men\u2014the astonishing and astounding fact of\n the Deluge, (attested more and more by all the most modern discove-\n ries of science,) with the salvation of Noah and his family in the Arli\n with two of every sort of living thing, from the awful wreck of Na\u00ac\n ture, and the re-peopling of the earth from the new stocks. Then you\n have the stories of Abraham, the Father ot the Faithful, and wor y\n to be so\u2014walking and talking with God\u2014entertaining angels ;\n wares\u2014praying for Sodom and Gomorrah\u2014but in vain ; for their sins\n were full, and their judgment come; and you see them destroyed hy\n a rain of fire and brimstone from heaven, (proved by the bitter ers\n of the Dead Sea, that still rankle around that silent shore;)\u2014of Isaac\n and his beloved Rebekah\u2014and of Jacob, who wrestled with the A yg d\n of the Covenant, and prevailed.

Then you have the memorable and magnifi\u00ac\n er t descent of Jehovah upon Mount Sinai, and the giving of his sa\u00ac\n cred and inviolable law, with all the \u201cpomp and circumstance\u201d of that\n tremendous transaction, so grandly and so graphically detailed, that\n you cannot doubt its reality.

Along\n ith all this, too, and interspersed among its various parts, you have\n lessons of wisdom, in a thousand different forms, in allegories, fables,\n jarkiing sentences, gems of thought, that seem to shew the depth as\n ell as riches of the mine out of which they have been taken. Then\n you have \u201call the law and story strewed with hymns,\u201d and songs of\n victory, and elegies of lamentation, and graced with passages of power\n and pathos that \u201c move harmonious numbers\u201d in every tuneful breast;\n for \u201call the books of the Bible,\u201d as Cowley says, \u201care either most ad\u00ac\n mirable and exalted pieces of poetry, or the best materials in the world\n for it.\u201d Truly, then, may we say, that this book is the very best in\n he world to improve the mind of man: And, accordingly, you find\n that no book is so popular, or has so much influence and effect in form\u00ac\n ing and informing the intellect of the great mass of the people of eve\u00ac\n ry Christian country.

O!\n she will talk to you by the hour, or day, (as long as you will listen to\n her,) upon all the topics which you can suggest\u2014and finely and fan\u00ac\n cifully enough\u2014and you will be charmed with her volubility, of course;\n (for she has a perfect phluaria;) but, after all, you will be compelled\n to say that, with all her eloquence, she is most lamentably and most\n shamefully ignorant. Why she does not even know that there is a\n God\u2014that is, a real one. She admits, indeed, that there is a Cause of\n Causes, a Mind of the World, a Sovereign Intellect, or something of\n that sort. But she doubts whether he actually made the world, which\n was perhaps coeval with himself\u2014though it is possible, and even pro\u00ac\n bable, that he formed or fashioned it out of the primal matter, the ele\u00ac\n mental water which he found circumfused, and ready for his plastic\n hand. But if he formed, or even made it, it is doubtful whether he\n governs it. If he does, however, it can only be by general laws, by\n natural causes producing material effects, but not for any moral pur\u00ac\n poses, which, are, of course, immaterial. And as for men, it is quite\n clear from all their conduct, that he takes no cognizance of their ac\u00ac\n tions; but leaves them to follow their own fancies, and live as they list.\n Then she knows nothing, or next to nothing, of a future state of re\u00ac\n wards or punishments. She is not at all sure, indeed, that the soul is\n immortal. She hopes that it is, but she fears that it is not; and if she\n rather believes that it is, it is only because she has heard that it was so\n from the tradition of the ancients , (a tradition, by the way, evidently\n glanced from our Bible ;) so it is a matter of faith with her rather than\n of reason.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, it is easy to see that, with such a creed as this, there can bo\n no Religion; for there is no God to serve and worship; there is none\n at least who you can know would accept service or worship, and why\n should you waste either upon him? And there can be no morality ;\n for the only basis of morality is Religion, and there is no Religion\u2014\n at least there can be no such thing as duty; and there can be no such\n thing as obligation ; for there is no law , and no authority to enforce\n it. Accordingly, you find, that your Philosophy can only talk to you\n of the to kalon, the to prepon, the to ophelimon, the to epaineton, and\n all that. She can recommend virtue as something fine, and graceful,\n and profitable, and laudable, (and so it is indeed,) but she cannot tell\n you what it is, nor can she enforce its claims by any sanctions worth\n the name. So you see, as you might expect, that in spite of all her\n fine and flowery discourses, the crowd about her are sunk in the gross\u00ac\n est sensuality, and her warmest votaries are, for the most part, openly\n licentious in their lives, while some of the very best of them are strong\u00ac\n ly suspected at least of what we now call shameful immoralities, or\n even flagitious crimes. Such is your Philosophy.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, open your Bible, a\u00bbd see the difference, the contrast. The\n very first sentence that you read in it is, In the beginning Gotl created\n the heaven and the earth. And as you read along, you find that you\n have his character more and more brightly displayed in all its glories,\n lie is omnipotent, and omniscient. He not only made the world, but\n he governs it.

It contains the gospel of the grace of God \u2014\n that is, the doctrine of the salvation of man by tiie vicarious\n sacrifice of Christ. For we read in our book, that all mankind\n are by nature dead in trespasses and sins, yet that God so loved the\n world that he gave his only begotten Son to die, that whosoever believ -\n cth in him might not perish, but have everlasting life. And this doc\u00ac\n trine is, indeed, the very glory of the Bible. It is the point, in fact, in\n which ail the scattered rays of its sublimity and beauty can centre and\n unite. It is this, accordingly, which makes the Christian reader press\n it to his heart, and, if his mind is imbued with Greek and Roman lore,\n compels him to exclaim with Augustine, \u201c In Plato, Cicero, and other\n writers of the same sort, I find many things that are finely written,\n and some that are even moderately affecting ; but in none of them all\n do I find these words: come unto me, all ye that labor and are heavy-\n laden and I will give you rest \u201d No\u2014there is no such sentence in any\n of them ; and it is indeed worth all the classics.\n</p>\n<p>\n But it may be said that this doctrine is unreasonable, and it is indeed,\n as I have already admitted, above reason; yet it is not against reason.\n On the contrary, it follows fairly, and almost logically from those very\n principles which, we have seen, Nature recognizes as her own, coupled\n with the fact of the fall of man \u2014a fact indeed which she will hard\u00ac\n ly admit, but w ' hich is proved upon her by all that is about her, and\n within her; by the disorders in the natural and moral w r orld\u2014by thun\u00ac\n der and lightning in their angry moods\u2014by plague and famine\u2014by\n war and desolation\u2014by the strangeness of sorrow ' \u2014by the monstrosity\n of death\u2014and by that horror of horrors, the dread of a death after\n death, a death that cannot die\u2014aye, by her own conscious and coward\n heart. For that fact did not alter the nature of God, nor the nature of\n his law, nor the duty and obligation of man to obey it, nor the penalty\n for the breach of it. It only altered Nature herself\u2014put her, as it\n W\u2019ere, in an unnatural state\u2014and so made it necessary for God (that\n is, if he were to shew mercy at all,) to introduce some such system of\n supervenient grace as that\u2014and w ' hy not the very one?\u2014which the\n Bible reveals; by which, as we read, he can be just, and yet the justi-\n fier of every one that believeth in Christ. So, then, the doctrine of\n grace is not unreasonable; but Christianity, considered only as a science,\n merits indeed the compliment which one of your own Professors has\n paid it, when he says, that it \u201c may well be called the most philosophi\u00ac\n cal of all religions\u201d\u2014though I should myself rather choose to say\n that it is, in fact, the only real religion, and the only true philosophy in\n the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n And now, gentlemen, can any one doubt for a moment, that it is a\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:ma:xw:addressdelivered00maxw:addressdelivered00maxw_0009/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 308, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 511}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:ma:xw:addressdelivered00maxw:addressdelivered00maxw_0009/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 616, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1023}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:ma:xw:addressdelivered00maxw:addressdelivered00maxw_0009/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1233, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2046}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:ma:xw:addressdelivered00maxw:addressdelivered00maxw_0009/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2467, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4093}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:ma:xw:addressdelivered00maxw:addressdelivered00maxw_0009/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ad/dr/es/sd/el/iv/er/ed/00/ma/xw/addressdelivered00maxw/addressdelivered00maxw_0009.jp2", "height": 4093, "width": 2467, "levels": 6, "size": 629606}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"9\">\n<p>\n 9\n</p>\n<p>\n good work to circulate such a book?

Do you doubt the truth of this position ? Look\n at England\u2014France\u2014Germany. The Schoolmaster is abroad; out\n the Preacher was out before him. Societies for the diffusion of useful\n knowledge are doing much; but the Bible Society, and other kindred\n Societies, showed them the way. And such has been our own expe\u00ac\n rience. If you wish, then, to diffuse intelligence among the people\n you should, by all means, circulate the Bible.\n</p>\n<p>\n But intelligence alone will not qualify the people for self-govern\u00ac\n ment. For look about you for a moment, and tell me, how often d,\n you see the most gifted genius the slave of his own passions, and 1 ' \u2022\n victim of his own vices, which his talents, in fact, have only served\n inflame, and exasperate for his ruin and disgrace? No\u2014you mT!\n give him something more than science, and learning, and letters\u2014yen.\n must give him a spirit of sobriety\u2014a spirit of self-control\u2014to make\n him master of himself; and that you can do only by giving him the\n spirit of religion and morality\u2014the spirit of the Bible. And so you must\n deal with the whole mass of the people. It is not sufficient to give\n them knowledge, (if you could do that without the Bible,) but v\n must give them a spirit of order\u2014a spirit of respect and reverence\n constitutional liberty\u2014a sacred regard to the constitution which tl\n have established not only to limit the powers of their public servant .\n but (what they are still more apt to forget,) to curb their own fi\n freedom\u2014to bind beforehand their own factious, and sometimes frai.\n will\u2014in a word, you must give them religion and morality. Accord\u00ac\n ingly, you find the Father of his Country\u2014our own Washingto\n proclaiming, as with the voice of an oracle, \u201cOf all the dispositi\n and habits which lead to political prosperity, Religion and Moral\n are indispensable supports.\u201d But religion and morality, as we 1\n seen, are found only in the Bible. If you wish, then, to serve\u2014per\u00ac\n haps I might say, to save your country\u2014you will hasten to circu-lnv\n the Bible, as soon and as far as possible, through the whole mass of\n the people. Indeed, after what I have read of the fates of other ?\n publics, and what I have seen of the progress of our own governor.
