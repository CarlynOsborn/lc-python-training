discovery of America in 1492 by Christopher Co-\n lumbus was one of the most remarkable events in the his-\n tory of the world. In itself considered, it was wonderful\n that an entire continent should now, for the first time, be\n made known to the civilized nations of Europe ; while the\n effects of this discovery on the destiny of the human race\n are incalculable.

But this seemed\n too slow a process to those who were suffering the combined\n ills of excessive taxation and poverty. Some imagined that\n the establishment of a paper currency would free them from\n all their embarrassments, and for this they became clamor-\n ous. As the numerical strength of the party increased,\n they increased their demands. Some went so far as to re-\n quire an abolition of debts and an equal distribution of\n property. The excitement rose to such a pitch that in\n 1786, while the assembly was sitting at Exeter, about two\n hundred persons assembled at Kingston, and proceeded to\n the seat of government, armed with guns, swords, clubs,\n and scythes, and demanded an answer to their petitions.\n The president, General John Sullivan, stated the reasons\n why the assembly could not comply with their wishes.\n ' Meanwhile the members of the assembly were held as pris-\n oners, the mob having placed sentries at the doors, and\n threatened death to any one who should attempt to escape\n before their demands were granted.

accurate, and reliable a descrip-\n tion of all the cities and towns in the State of New\n Hampshire as the marked and constant changes\n incident to rapid increase of population in some\n places, and the ever- varying tide of business in its\n almost innumerable departments, every where, will\n admit. The geographical position of each town, its\n geological features, as well as whatever is interest-\n ing in its mineralogy, have been as carefully and\n fully described as the means at our command would\n enable us to do.

In 1768 it was settled\n by William Keyes, Samuel Hooper, and John Rogers, who\n removed thither with their families.

In 1738 two men, named Blan-\n chard and Shepherd, having proceeded a short distance from\n the garrison kept in town, were surprised by a party of seven\n Indians, who suddenly rose from behind a log within a few\n feet of them. All the Indians at once fired, but without\n effect. Blanchard and his companion returned the fire\n upon the savages, but to no purpose. Shepherd then\n made his escape ; but Blanchard was taken. The Indians\n wounded and mutilated him so badly that he survived but\n a few days. During the French and Indian war, frequent\n attacks were made upon the inhabitants of this town. On\n one occasion they broke into the house of Thomas Clough,\n and, finding no one within, plundered it of its contents.\n Finding a negro servant of Clough, with a boy named\n Jackson, at work in a field not far distant, the Indians took\n them to Canada, where they remained until the close of\n the war in 1749. In the spring of 1752 two Indians,\n named Sabatis and Christi, came into the settlement, where\n they were kindly entertained by the people for several\n weeks. At length they left suddenly, forcing away with\n them two negroes, one of whom soon succeeded in making\n his escape, and returned.

While\n in this condition, such was their conduct that strong and\n bitter feelings were excited against them.

The first settlers were several families by the\n names of Parker, Farnsworth, and Sartwell, from Groton,\n Massachusetts. They were soon followed by a family named\n Hastings, from Lunenburg, and another named Stevens, from\n Rutland. In 1743 a fort was built in this place, under the\n direction of Colonel Stoddard, of Northampton. Mills were\n first erected in 1744. It was in this year that the Cape\n Breton war began. Charlestown, being more than 30 miles\n from any settlement, was, during this period, the scene of\n much suffering and privation. In the spring of 1746 a\n party of Indians suddenly appeared, and took John Spaf-\n fgrd, Isaac Parker, and Stephen Farnsworth, as they were\n driving their teams. Their cattle were soon after found\n dead, with their tongues cut out. The men were carried to\n Canada, and after some time returned to Boston under a\n flag of truce. In May following the Indians again made\n their appearance at Number Four. About evening some\n women went out to milk their cows, attended by Major Jo-\n siah Willard and several soldiers as a guard, when eight\n Indians, who were concealed in a barn, fired on them, and\n killed Seth Putnam. While they were scalping him, Wil-\n lard and two of his men fired on them and mortally wound-\n ed two of them, when the Indians retreated, carrying their\n dying companions with them. A few days after, as Cap-\n tain Paine, with about 20 of his men, were going out to view\n the place where Putnam was killed, they fell into an am-\n bush. The enemy rose up from the bushes, fired, and then\n endeavored to cut off the retreat of Paine and his compa-\n ny. The noise being heard at the fort, Captain Phinehas\n Stevens, with a party of men, rushed out to their relief.\n A warm skirmish followed, in which five men were killed\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0152/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 147, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 258}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0152/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 295, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 516}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0152/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 591, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0152/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1183, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2064}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0152/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2366, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4129}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0152/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wh/am/ps/hi/re/as/it/00/ch/ar/_0/newhampshireasit00char_0/newhampshireasit00char_0_0152.jp2", "height": 4129, "width": 2366, "levels": 6, "size": 560734}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"152\">\n<p>\n 136\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW HAMPSHIRE AS IT IS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6H both sides, and one of.

Feeling cer-\n tain of success, before they carried this plan into effect,\n they demanded a cessation of arms till sunrise ; which was\n granted. In the morning, Debeline advanced towards the\n fort with 50 men, bearing a flag of truce, which he stuck\n in the ground. He demanded a parley, which was agreed\n to. A French officer, with a soldier and an Indian, then\n came forward and proposed that the garrison should bind\n up a quantity of provisions in their blankets, and, having\n laid down their arms, allow themselves to be conducted as\n prisoners of war to Montreal.

The Frenchman, with insolence,\n replied, \u201c Go, see if your men dare fight any longer, and\n give me a quick answer.\u201d Stevens went into the fort, and\n asked his men whether they would fight, or surrender. It\n was at once and unanimously resolved to fight. This was\n immediately communicated to the enemy, who thereupon\n resumed their shouting and fighting, keeping it up all that\n day and the night following.

Two\n Indians then came forward and proposed to Stevens that,\n if he would sell them provisions, they would withdraw.\n He answered, that to sell an enemy provisions for money\n was contrary to the law of nations ; but he would pay them\n five bushels of corn for every captive for whom they would\n give a hostage, until the captive could be brought from\n Canada.

In 1754 the\n French war began, and the inhabitants were once more\n obliged to resort to the fort for safety. From infancy the\n settlers had been trained to scenes of hardship and danger\n unknown to their descendants. When they attended pub-\n lic worship, or cultivated their lands, they proceeded forth\n from the fort armed for battle, and worshipped or toiled\n under protection of a sentinel. In their depredatory ex-\n cursions, the Indians preferred prisoners to scalps, and\n generally killed but few excepting those who were likely\n to escape or appeared too formidable to be encountered\n with success. On the 29th of August, 1754, the Indians,\n early in the morning, attacked the house of James Johnson,\n who, with his wife, her sister, and three children, and two\n men, Peter Labaree and Ebenezer Farnsworth, were taken\n prisoners. On the second day of the journey, about 15 miles\n from Charlestown, in the wilderness, Mrs. Johnson was\n delivered of a child, who, from the peculiar circum-\n stances attending its birth, was named Captive. The In-\n dians halted one day on account of the woman, and on the\n next day took up their march, carrying her in a littei\n which they made for that purpose.

The buildings are spacious and convenient. The\n style of architecture is rather with reference to substantial\n purposes than otherwise. The buildings consist of a main\n or central body, 48 by 44 feet, four stories high, erected\n in 1843 ; a north wing, 90 by 36 feet, four stories high,\n erected in 1852 ; and a commodious building designed\n for unsafe and turbulent maniacs. An appropriation of\n $20,000 has been made by the legislature for the construc-\n tion of a south wing corresponding with the north wing.\n There is connected with the institution a valuable farm,\n the labor upon which is performed by the inmates of the\n asylum. This institution has an excellent reputation,\n and has continued to increase, not only in ' the number com-\n mitted to its care, but correspondingly in the number dis-\n charged as wholly or partially recovered. Dr. John E.\n Tyler is at present the superintendent. Its productive\n funds amount to $33,000 \u2014 $15,000 of which was a legacy\n of the late Countess Rumford, and $3000 of the late Mr.\n Chandler.

The travelled road,\n from which the land gradually descends in both directions,\n commands an extensive and delightful prospect of bays,\n islands, and distant mountains. On this neck of land was\n commenced the first settlement of the town, in 1623, by a\n company in England styled the \u201c Company of Laconia.\u201d\n The purpose of the settlement was to establish a fishery\n around the mouth of the Piscataqua ; to accomplish which,\n Edward and William Hilton, fishmongers of London, were\n sent hither. These two men commenced their operations\n on the Neck, called by the Indians Winnichahannat ; but\n they named it at first Northam, afterwards Dover. For\n many years this spot included the principal part of the\n population of the town. Here was erected the first meet-\n ing house, surrounded with entrenchments and flankarts,\n the remains of which are still pointed out. But in pro-\n cess of time the current of population began to change\n and settle around the Falls, four miles north of the Neck,\n where is now the beautiful and prosperous village of Dover.\n The descent of the falls in this place is very rapid, being\n 32 feet within a short distance. As this water power began\n to be developed a new vigor was added to business, and\n wealth rapidly followed. During the earlier periods of the\n settlement this town was much frequented by the Indians,\n and often suffered greatly from their sudden and repeated\n attacks. In 1675, Major Waldron, by a stratagem, the\n justice and prudence of which have been questioned, suc-\n ceeded in securing about 200 Indians in Dover, who had\n at times betrayed signs of hostility. Seven or eight who\n had been guilty of some misdemeanor were immediately\n hung, and the rest were sold into slavery.

This river, so called from the abundance\n of oysters found at its mouth, takes its rise from Wheel-\n wright\u2019s Pond, in Lee, and after winding nearly its whole\n course through Durham, and furnishing in its progress\n several excellent mill seats, falls into the Piscataqua. The\n soil of this town is generally hard and strong. On both\n sides of Oyster River is a deep, argillaceous loam, favorable\n to the growth of grasses, of which very heavy crops are\n cut every year. The farmers devote much of their time\n to the production of hay for the Boston market. More\n than 1000 tons are annually exported. A chain of granite\n ledge extends through the town, which seems to be of\n primitive formation. There was formerly a large erratic\n bowlder of sienitic granite in the soutlnwest part of the\n town, so carefully poised upon two other pieces of the\n same material that it was visibly moved by the wind.

Two days after they made another attack,\n destroyed several houses, and killed two persons. In 1694,\n when a large number of the inhabitants had marched to\n the westward, the Indians, who were lurking in the woods\n about Oyster Eiver, having carefully ascertained the number\n of men in the garrison, rushed upon them as they were going\n to their morning devotions, and, having cut off their retreat\n to the house, put them all to death except one, who fortu-\n nately escaped. They then assailed the house, in which\n were only two boys, besides the women and children. The\n boys kept them off for some time, and wounded several of\n them. At length the Indians set fire to Jthe house ; but\n even then the boys would not surrender until the Indians\n had promised to spare their lives. They, however, treach-\n erously murdered three or four children, one of whom they\n pierced with a sharp stake in the presence of its mother.\n The women and children were carried captive, but one of\n the boys made his escape the following day. The next\n spring the Indians narrowly watched the frontiers, to deter-\n mine the safest and most vulnerable points of attack. The\n settlement at Oyster Eiver was selected for destruction.\n Here were twelve garrisoned houses, fully sufficient for the\n reception of the inhabitants ; but, not apprehending any\n danger, many of the families remained in their unfortified\n houses, and those who were in the garrison were by no\n means prepared for a siege, as they were nearly destitute\n of powder. One John Dean, whose house stood near the\n Falls, happening to rise very early for a journey, was shot\n as he came out of his door. The attack was now commenced\n with vigor on all points where the enemy were ready. Of\n the twelve garrisoned houses five were destroyed \u2014 namely,\n Adams\u2019s, Drew\u2019s, Edgerly\u2019s, Meader\u2019s, and Beard\u2019s.

There are four\n meeting houses, five religious societies, sixteen stores, eight\n saw and gristmills, three hotels, seven blacksmith shops,\n one iron foundery, five tanneries, eight wheelwright and\n furniture shops, two sash and blind factories, one bobbin\n factory, two harness makers\u2019 shops, two clothing stores,\n and one cotton factory.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the cotton factory about 20 hands are employed.\n The goods manufactured consist mostly of yarn and twine.\n The village, and in fact the whole town, presents a picture\n of thrift & nd industry seldom equalled.

The\n Congregational church was organized October 18, 1738.\n Since that time it has had only six different ministers.\n The present pastor, Bey. Zedekiah S. Barstow, D.

Keene was originally granted\n by Massachusetts. Its first settlement began about the\n year 1734, by Jeremiah Hall, Elisha Boot, Nathaniel\n Bockwood, Seth Heaton, Josiah Fisher, Nathan Blake, and\n others. Its original name was Upper Ashuelot. It was\n incorporated under its present name April 11, 1753. The\n name was given in honor of an English nobleman. Sir\n Benjamin Keene. In 1736 a meeting house was erected,\n and two years later a minister was settled.\n</p>\n<p>\n Like all other frontier settlements, it received its full share\n of Indian depredations and cruelty. In 1745 the Indians\n killed Josiah Fisher, a deacon of the church ; and in the\n year following they attacked the fort, the only safe retreat\n of the inhabitants. They were discovered by Captain\n Ephraim Dorman just in time to prevent their taking it.\n He was attacked by two Indians, but boldly defended him-\n self against them, and reached the fort in safety. A furious\n assault followed, in which John Bullard was killed.

It is situated on a peninsu-\n la on the south side of Piscataqua Piver, three miles from\n the ocean. Its location is pleasant and healthy \u2014 the land\n sloping by a gentle declivity towards the harbor. In\n the central or business palt of the city the streets are\n mostly paved. The buildings are of brick, and of a style\n somewhat antiquated ; but there are many well-constructed\n and elegant mansions. \u201c As for antiquity, the city of\n Portsmouth is one of the earliest discovered and first set-\n tled places in New England. In the beginning of the\n seventeenth century, some merchants of Bristol, England,\n having formed a private company for the investigation of\n this country, employed for that service Captain Martin\n Pring, of Bristol, a skilful navigator, and much praised by\n Gorges. They placed under his command two vessels, aus-\n piciously named the Speedwell and the Discoverer. In\n the year 1603 he set sail for America, and was enabled\n to speed so well as to be the first discoverer of New Hamp-\n shire. Just 250 years ago (i. e., from 1853) he entered\n the channel of our river, and explored it for three or four\n leagues.

The population in 1790 was 4720 ; in 1800,\n 5339 ; in 1810, 6934 ; in 1820, 7327 ; in 1830, 8032;\n in 1840, 7887 ; in 1850, 9700. The wealth of the city\n is very considerable, and its present condition decidedly\n prosperous. The cleanliness of the streets, the neatness\n of the houses, the number of trees which ornament the\n streets, and the many fine gardens scattered throughout\n the town, give the place a pleasant and inviting appearance*\n while its quietness and proximity to the sea and neighbor-\n ing beaches render it a delightful summer resort. From\n 1623 until 1641, Portsmouth, including Kittery, Dover,\n and Exeter, was an independent republic. It then, with\n Exeter, placed itself under the jurisdiction of Massachu-\n setts. This connection continued until 1679, when New\n Hampshire was formed into a separate province. It was\n incorporated, with its present limits, May 28, 1643.

Rochester was granted by Massachusetts to\n several proprietors, in 127 shares. Its area then consisted\n of 60,000 acres. Since that time 38,000 acres have been\n taken to form other towns. It was incorporated May 10,\n 1722. Captain Timothy Roberts moved into this town\n with his family December 28, 1728, and was the first per-\n manent settler. He was soon followed by Eleazar Ham,\n Benjamin Frost, Joseph Richards, Benjamin Tibbets, and\n others. Until Canada was taken, in 1760, by the British\n and American forces, it remained a frontier town ; the\n people wefe poor, and often distressed, but not discouraged.\n When war broke out with the Indians they were obliged\n to move their families into garrisons, and to watch night\n and day ; nor could they cultivate* their little patches of\n cleared land but at the hazard of their lives, protecting\n themselves with such numbers as they could muster from\n their feeble settlement. The men were bold, hardy, and\n industrious, and their sons were early trained to the use of\n arms. They soon became a terror to the Indians, and did\n not suffer so much from depredations as many other towns\n whose situations were far less exposed. In June, 1746, Jo-\n seph Heard, Joseph Richards, John Wentworth, and Ger-\n shom Downs were killed, and John Richards wounded,\n captured, and carried to Canada, whence he soon returned.\n Jonathan Door, a boy, was also carried captive to Canada.\n In May, 1748, the wife of Jonathan Hodgdon was killed\n on a Sunday morning by the Indians, because she refused\n to accompany them to Canada, A few years after the set-\n tlement of the town a Congregational church was gathered.\n There are also societies of Methodists and Freewill Bap-\n tists.

It is located in the south-east corner of the state,\n 15 miles south from Portsmouth, 8 south-east from Ex-\n eter, and about 45 south-east from Concord. It lies on\n the great eastern route from Boston to Portland. The\n Eastern Railroad passes nearly through the centre of the\n town. The southerly part was formerly included within\n the limits of Massachusetts. The old line from the \u201c Bound\n Rock,\u201d at the mouth of the river, on which is yet observ-\n able the inscription, \u201c A. D. 1657, H. B.,\u201d can still be\n traced to a rock near the \u201c Brick School House,\u201d marked\n \u201c B. T.,\u201d thence inland. The remainder of the territory\n was a part of \u201c \u00a9Id Hampton.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The west part of the town is undulating. The middle and\n eastern portions are comparatively level. The soil is light,\n but productive. Extensive tracts are coveied with a heavy\n and valuable growth of wood and timber. There are also\n large plains of salt marsh. Cam\u2019s Brook, rising in Salisbury,\n Massachusetts, passes through the south-east part of the\n town, and affords a few water privileges of moderate power,\n which are occupied by saw and gristmills. Near its mouth\n is a valuable tide mill, formerly known as Walton\u2019s \u2014 now\n Robbins\u2019s \u2014 mill. Several small streams rising in this and\n adjacent towns, and uniting in the broad marsh along the\n eastern border forms Seabrook River, which, in its course to-\n wards the ocean, unites with Hampton River. The beach is a\n favorite resort in the warm season. Titcomb\u2019s Hill, partly\n in this town and partly in South Hampton, and Grape Hill,\n in the south-west part of the town, lying partly in Massa-\n chusetts, are fine elevations, which afford extensive and\n beautiful prospects of the surrounding country.

A\n friend who was with Lancaster stopped, on his way, at the\n house of the late Edward Gove, to \u201c drink a syllabub ,\u201d and\n thus escaped.

There are numerous locali-\n ties in this town of a character highly interesting to the\n geologist and mineralogist. The rock formation consists of\n gneiss and granite, overlaid by strata of micaceous, horn-\n blende, and chlorite slate. The direction of the strata is\n north by east \u2014 dip, south, 80\u00b0. Near the north-western\n corner of the town the argillaceous slate rocks occur, over-\n lapping the older primary strata.

There is a strong chalybeate spring\n in the eastern part of the town, which is quite celebrated ;\n it is highly charged with salts of iron, and possesses tonic\n properties. From the soil around this spring copperas has\n been manufactured by leaching and evaporation. Bog\n iron ore, in small quantities, is found in various localities.\n Near Little Sugar River is a large and valuable mine of\n copper and iron pyrites. Its location is favorable for\n working, and, from the fact that the vein is one foot nine\n inches in width three feet from the surface, and constant-\n ly widens as it descends, it is believed to contain almost\n an inexhaustible supply. Near this mine a new mineral\n was discovered by Dr. Jackson, and named by him chlo-\n rophyllite. It occurs in the sienite rocks, which are found\n embedded in gneiss. Crystals of magnetic iron ore, in\n octahedral forms, are found .disseminated in green mica ;\n also garnets and radiated actinolite.* Iolite, a fine, deli-\n cate, blue-colored stone, which is valued highly by jewel-\n lers, and titanium, valued in the arts of porcelain painting\n and in the manufacture of mineral teeth, are found here in\n considerable quantities.\n</p>\n<p>\n Unity was granted, July 13, 1764, to Theodore Atkin-\n son, Meshech Weare, and 45 others.

This town is\n distinguished for its excellent schools, and its valuable\n efforts to promote the interests of education. It has within\n a few years adopted the Somersworth Act, and has erected\n a large, convenient, and handsome building for a high\n school. The school fund is $1577 50. In the village\n are seven stores, one hotel, three meeting houses, \u2014 one\n Unitarian, one Congregational, and one Methodist \u2014 and\n about a mile south-east from the village is a meeting\n house owned by the Universalist society. There are two\n shoe manufactories, with a capital of $1700, furnishing\n employment for 15 hands ; one shirt manufactory, where\n about 250 hands are engaged ; one carriage factory,\n employing 12 hands, besides some 12 or 15 other shops\n for various purposes. At the bridge which crosses the\n river near this place, first erected in 1785, is a most sub-\n lime and interesting view. The river is confined in a\n narrow channel between steep rocks, and for nearly a quar-\n ter of a mile is forced onward with great impetuosity, and\n loud, deep roaring. The fall is in no place perpendicular,\n the waters falling 42 feet in the distance of 160 rods.\n On the west side of the falls is a canal, with nine locks.\n Around the falls is an interesting locality of minerals.\n The almost incredible effects of the current of the river at\n this place afford striking and beautiful illustrations of the\n science of geology. A channel has been worn into a solid\n rock, or bed of granite, to a depth of 10 or 15 feet; and\n this was in all probability effected while the water was\n pouring over the precipitous hillsides south of the present\n bed, and before the rocks which form the present cataract\n had ever been sprinkled by the foam of the dashing waves.\n 35*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0440/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 143, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 259}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0440/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 287, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 518}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0440/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 575, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0440/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1150, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2075}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0440/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4151}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0440/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wh/am/ps/hi/re/as/it/00/ch/ar/_0/newhampshireasit00char_0/newhampshireasit00char_0_0440.jp2", "height": 4151, "width": 2301, "levels": 6, "size": 514358}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"440\">\n<p>\n 414 NEW HAMPSHIRE AS IT IS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here the effects of the current upon the rocks are still\n more wonderful.

In the spring of 1755, an Indian, named Philip\n by the whites, who had acquired the English language\n sufficiently for conversation, came into the town of Wal-\n pole, and visited the house of one Mr. Kilburn, pretending\n that he was on a hunting excursion, and in want of pro-\n visions. He was kindly received, and furnished with every\n necessary, such as flints, flour, & c. Soon after he left,\n however, it was ascertained that he had visited nearly all\n the settlements on Connecticut River about the same time,\n and with the same plausible errand. Kilburn had already\n learned something of Indian finesse and strategy, and at\n once suspected, as it afterwards proved, that Philip was a\n wolf in sheep\u2019s clothing. Not long after this intelligence\n was sent by General Shirley, through a friendly Indian, to\n all the forts, that four or five hundred Indians were collected\n in Canada, whose designs were to destroy all the white\n population on Connecticut River. The reception of such\n news threw a gloom over the weak and defenceless settle-\n ments. What could they do ? To desert their homes,\n their cattle, and crops would be to give up all to the\n destruction of the Canadian savages. Accustomed to all\n the hardships and dangers of the frontier life, they boldly\n ^solved to defend themselves and their property, or die on\n their own thresholds. Kilburn and his men now strength-\n ened their position with such fortifications as their rude\n implements and pressing circumstances would allow, hastily\n surrounding their dwellings with a palisade of stakes\n driven into the ground.

The amount of snow is much less\n constant, varying from less than a foot during the whole\n winter, as sometimes happens near the sea, to 10 or 18\n feet, as sometimes among the mountains. Usually there is\n more, both of rain and snow, inland than on the coast,\n although the number of cloudy and unpleasant days is less.\n The proportion of pleasant days to the whole number of\n days in the year is about one third, and there are not quite\n as many in which some snow or rain falls ; the rest are\n variable days, not actually stormy, but only more or less\n dark and cloudy. New Hampshire storms are not generally\n of great violence, or long duration, unless near the sea,\n but, as every one knows, differ much in these respects.\n The larger storms almost invariably move from the south-\n west to the north-east. They are usually preceded by a\n calm atmosphere, and a high elevation of the barometer.\n They commence with easterly winds, and a depression of\n the mercurial column, often very rapid, which reaches its\n limit at the crisis of the storm. Sometimes, especially in\n exposed situations, they are followed by strong westerly\n gales ; but these are seldom violent enough to do any\n damage.

Such, in a re-\n markable degree, has been the fate of the science of geol-\n ogy. Sharp has been the conflict and severe the ordeal\n through which it has passed before it could be received\n into the inner temple of the older and accredited sciences.\n</p>\n<p>\n Until within a recent period there was no information\n concerning the geological structure and the mineral charac-\n teristics of New Hampshire, excepting that which was col-\n lected by private and individual research, and which was,\n of course, limited and defective. But in June, 1839, a\n law was passed, authorizing the governor to appoint a state\n geologist, in order to make \u201c a thorough geological and min-\n eralogical survey of this state.\u201d The state geologist, \u201c by\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0480/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 143, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 259}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0480/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 287, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 518}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0480/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 575, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0480/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1150, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2075}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0480/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4151}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0480/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wh/am/ps/hi/re/as/it/00/ch/ar/_0/newhampshireasit00char_0/newhampshireasit00char_0_0480.jp2", "height": 4151, "width": 2301, "levels": 6, "size": 532352}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"480\">\n<p>\n 454\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW HAMPSHIRE AS IT IS.\n</p>\n<p>\n and with the consent of the governor and council,\u201d was re-\n quired to appoint an assistant for the purpose of analyzing\n such rocks, ores, soils, and other substances as should be\n presented to him for that purpose.

But, besides these, a discovery was made a\n few years since which is accounted of great value to the\n science of geology.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the construction of the railroad from Concord to\n Lebanon it was found necessary to make a deep cut in the\n town of Orange, near what is termed the Summit, it being\n the highest land between the Connecticut and Merrimack\n Rivers, over 900 feet above the bed of those streams, and\n dividing the streamlets which flow into them. On this\n height of land were discovered, in the solid granite, pot\n holes over fortr feet in diameter at the top, two feet at the\n bottom, and eleven feet in depth. These were worn\n smooth, like those at Bellows Falls, and in them stones\n rounded and polished similar to those found in pot holes\n formed in our own times.

The\n old Notch Tavern, now called the Willey House, stood on\n the westerly side of the road in the Notch, at the foot of\n an abrupt elevation 2000 feet in height. Adjoining the\n house were a barn and wood house, in front was a beautiful\n little meadow, and along the eastern precipice flowed the\n Saco. This house was occupied, in 1826, by Captain Sam-\n uel Willey and his family, consisting of his wife, five chil-\n dren, and two men named Nickerson and Allen. In the\n month of June an avalanche, or slide, came down from the\n mountain, and crossed the road, a few rods north of the\n house, which led Captain Willey to prepare a place\n of refuge to which they might flee in case there should\n be signs of another slide. On the 28th of August, af-\n ter several successive days of rainy weather, there were\n closing showers, in which the rain poured down in tor-\n rents, raising the rivers to an unusual height, and caus-\n ing numerous slides among the mountains. A traveller,\n passing through the Notch a day or two after, found the\n house deserted. An immense slide, coming down directly\n in the rear of the house, had been divided by a huge block\n of granite about five rods distant, and passing on each side\n of the house had again united in front. The barn and\n other out-buildings were destroyed ; the house alone es-\n caped unharmed.

At the latter place is a first-class hotel,\n called the \u201cConway House,\u201d under the charge of Mr.\n Fabyan, proprietor of the \u201c Mount Washington House.\u201d\n Twenty-four miles from Conway is the \u201c Mount Crawford\n House,\u201d or \u201cOld Crawford\u2019s,\u201d the late residence of Abel\n Crawford, the \u201cPatriarch of the Mountains,\u201d who died\n here at an advanced age in 1851. The house is kept by\n Mr. Davis, who married a daughter of Mr. Crawford. It\n is a favorite resort of anglers and sportsmen. Horses can\n be obtained here to ascend Mount Crawford, and from its\n summit, over a range of hills, to the top of Mount Wash-\n ington. Six miles farther on is the \u201cJVIlley House,\u201d a\n large and well-conducted hotel, located near the old \u201c Notch\n Tavern,\u201d previously described. The \u201c Crawford House,\u201d\n or \u201cTom Crawford\u2019s,\u201d is two miles from this place, near\n the Gate of the Notch.

It does not appear that\n the interests of learning were ever lost sight of, though the\n poverty and distress of the people, occasioned, or at least\n increased, by their many severe conflicts with the Indians,\n prevented the full accomplishment of their laudable de-\n signs. The first law relating to schools passed by New\n Hampshire after it became an independent province was\n enacted in 1693, in the midst of a bloody struggle with\n the French and Indians. This law provided for the estab-\n lishment of a school in every town, subjecting those to a\n penalty of ten pounds which should fail to comply with its\n requirements. Other laws relating to this subject were\n passed from time to time, as the exigencies of the public\n seemed to demand.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c The old laws of New Hampshire,\u201d says Dr. Belknap,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0508/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 143, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 259}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0508/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 287, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 518}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0508/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 575, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0508/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1150, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2075}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0508/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4151}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0508/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wh/am/ps/hi/re/as/it/00/ch/ar/_0/newhampshireasit00char_0/newhampshireasit00char_0_0508.jp2", "height": 4151, "width": 2301, "levels": 6, "size": 598619}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"508\">\n<p>\n 480\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW HAMPSHIRE AS IT IS.\n</p>\n<p>\n writing in 1792, \u201c required every town of one hundred\n inhabitants to keep a grammar school, by which was meant\n a school in which the learned languages should be taught,\n and youth might be prepared for admission to a university.\n The same preceptor was obliged to teach reading, writing,\n and arithmetic, unless the town were of sufficient ability to\n keep two or more schools, one of which was called a gram-\n mar school, by way of distinction.\u201d But these laws were\n not always carried into effect.

Occum\n proved to be a person of superior abilities, which encour-\n aged Dr. Wheelock to persevere in his efforts to spread\n the gospel among the savages. But finding that it was\n difficult to accomplish this by means of white missionaries,\n he conceived the plan of founding a school at which he\n might receive Indian boys, and prepare them for mission-\n aries and teachers. In pursuance of his design, he re-\n ceived into his family, in 1754, two boys of the Delaware\n nation.\n</p>\n<p>\n The school soon began to attract the attention of the\n public, and to receive the aid of the charitable. In 1763\n the General Court of Massachusetts voted that they would\n bear the expense of the education, board, and clothing of\n six children of the Six Nations for one year. Thev were\n accordingly selected, and admitted to the school.\n</p>\n<p>\n Among the early benefactors of the school was Mr.\n Joshua Moor, of Mansfield, Connecticut, who gave a school\n house and about two acres of land.

He\n preached in all the principal cities of England and Scot-\n land with great success. Between 9000 and 10,000\n pounds sterling were collected, and a board of trustees ap-\n pointed to receive the funds, to be drawn by Dr. Whee-\n lock, as he should have need. Of this board the Right\n Hon. William Legge, Earl of Dartmouth, was president.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Wheelock now determined to establish a college in\n connection with his school. But as there was already a\n flourishing institution of that kind in Connecticut, it was\n deemed expedient to locate it elsewhere. Moreover, the\n progress of civilization had driven the Indians from his\n immediate vicinity, and it was thought that by removing to\n the wilderness he might more successfully carry out his\n views. After listening to various proposals, and consult-\n ing the trustees in England, he fixed upon the western\n part of New Hampshire as the most suitable locality for\n the infant college, though he did not then decide upon the\n precise spot.\n</p>\n<p>\n The next step was to obtain a charter, which was granted\n by John Wentworth, the royal governor of the province,\n in the name of George III., ordaining \u201cthat there be a\n college erected in our said province of New Hampshire,\n by the name of Dartmouth College, for the education and\n instruction of youth of the Indian tribes in this land in\n 41 *\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0514/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 143, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 259}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0514/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 287, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 518}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0514/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 575, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0514/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1150, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2075}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0514/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4151}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0514/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wh/am/ps/hi/re/as/it/00/ch/ar/_0/newhampshireasit00char_0/newhampshireasit00char_0_0514.jp2", "height": 4151, "width": 2301, "levels": 6, "size": 626114}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"514\">\n<p>\n 486 NEW HAMPSHIRE AS IT IS.\n</p>\n<p>\n reading, writing, and all parts of learning which shall\n appear necessary and expedient for civilizing and Christian-\n izing children of pagans, as well as in all liberal arts and\n sciences; and also of English youth and any others.\u201d\n This was dated December 13, 1769.

Other donations, both\n of land and money, were made by various individuals in\n New Hampshire and in the eastern part of Vermont, then\n called the New Hampshire Grants.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the spring of 1770, Dr. Wheelock, with two com-\n panions, set out on an exploring tour, in order to choose the\n most eligible place for the college and school. After visit-\n ing several proposed localities, he finally selected Hanover ;\n and in the autumn of the same year he removed thither\n with his family and pupils, making in all about seventy\n persons. There were no accommodations, excepting two\n or three log houses. The location was an extensive plain,\n shaded with a growth of lofty pines. Upon a few acres\n the trees had been felled previously to his arrival.

He\n says, \u201c I believe I made tolerable progress in most branches\n which I attended to while in this school. But there was\n one thing I could not do. I could not make a declama-\n tion. I could not speak before the school. The kind\n and excellent Buckminster sought especially to persuade\n me to perform the exercise of declamation like other\n boys, but I could not do it. Many a piece did I commit\n to memory, and recite and rehearse in my own room, over\n and over again ; yet when the day came, when the school\n collected to hear declamations, when my name was\n called, and I saw all eyes turned to my seat, I could not\n raise myself from it.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n By determined will and repeated trials, he, however, at\n length overcame this extreme diffidence, and began very\n soon to be distinguished for his oratorical powers.\n</p>\n<p>\n The following anecdote is related of him while connected\n with this school.

By diligent atten-\n tion to the duties of his profession, he soon obtained an\n extensive and reputable practice, and acquired for himself\n a rank at a bar at which lawyers who are among the most\n distinguished in the Union have practised.\n</p>\n<p>\n Even while a student, Mr. Woodbury\u2019s ardent tempera-\n ment would not suffer him to remain an inactive spectator\n of the political struggles that then agitated the country\n</p>\n<p>\n * See plate.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0564/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 143, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 259}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0564/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 287, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 518}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0564/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 575, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1037}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0564/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1150, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2075}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0564/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4151}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0564/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wh/am/ps/hi/re/as/it/00/ch/ar/_0/newhampshireasit00char_0/newhampshireasit00char_0_0564.jp2", "height": 4151, "width": 2301, "levels": 6, "size": 571094}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"564\">\n<p>\n 528\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW HAMPSHIRE AS IT IS.\n</p>\n<p>\n with more intensity, probably, than at any other period\n of its history ; and, accordingly, we find hitp mingling\n in the strife,* and taking part upon the side of democ-\n racy.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1816 the political character of the state became\n changed.

In August, 1831, then\n a few months short of his majority, young Greeley arrived\n in the city of New York, where, in the course of a few\n years, he was destined to play so important a part in the\n great drama of life, the closing scene of which is by no\n means yet enacted.

It is not often that fame and wealth have\n started from smaller or more humble beginnings.\n</p>\n<p>\n For about eighteen months he worked as a journeyman\n printer in the city of New York. His labors were un-\n steady, for it was not his good fortune to find constant em-\n ployment. In the spring of 1833 he went into the printing\n business with another young printer named Storey.

All men are born equally free and independent; therefore\n all government of right originates from the people, is founded in consent\n and instituted for the general good.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. All men have certain natural, essential, and inherent right ' s; among\n which are, the enjoying and defending life and liberty \u2014 acquiring, pos-\n sessing, and protecting property \u2014 and, in a word, of seeking and obtaining\n happiness.\n</p>\n<p>\n 0\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. When men enter into a state of society, they surrender up some of\n their natural rights to that society, in order to insure the protection of\n others ; and without such an equivalent the surrender is void.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Among the natural rights, some are in their very nature unalienable,\n because no equivalent can be given or received for them. Of this kind are\n the RIGHTS OF CONSCIENCE.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Every individual has a natural and unalienable right to worship God\n according to the dictates of his own conscience and reason ; and no sub-\n ject shall be hurt, molested, or restrained in his person, liberty, or estate, for\n worshipping God in the manner and season most agreeable to the dictates\n of his own conscience, or for his religious profession, sentiments, or persua-\n sion ; provided he doth not disturb the public peace, or disturb others in\n their religious worship.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. As morality and piety, rightly, grounded on evangelical principles,\n will give the best and greatest security to government, and will lay in the\n hearts of men the strongest obligations to due subjection ; and as the\n knowledge of these is most likely to be propagated through a society by the\n institution of the public worship of the Deity, and of public instruction\n in morality and religion ; therefore, to promote those important purposes,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0609/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 143, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 258}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0609/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 287, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 516}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0609/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 575, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0609/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1150, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2064}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0609/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4129}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wh:am:ps:hi:re:as:it:00:ch:ar:_0:newhampshireasit00char_0:newhampshireasit00char_0_0609/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wh/am/ps/hi/re/as/it/00/ch/ar/_0/newhampshireasit00char_0/newhampshireasit00char_0_0609.jp2", "height": 4129, "width": 2301, "levels": 6, "size": 517531}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"609\">\n<p>\n 569\n</p>\n<p>\n dON STITUTION OF NEW HAMPSHIRE.\n</p>\n<p>\n the people of this state have a right to empower, and do hereby fully em-\n power the legislature to authorize from time to time the several towns, par-\n ishes, bodies corporate, or religious societies within this state, to make\n adequate provision, at their own expense, for the support and maintenance\n of public Protestant teachers of piety, religion, and morality :\n</p>\n<p>\n Provided , notwithstanding , That the several towns, parishes, bodies cor-\n porate, or religious societies shall at all times have the exclusive right of\n electing their own public teachers, and of contracting with them for their\n support and maintenance.

Every subject hath a right to be secure from all unreasonable search-\n es and seizures of his person, his houses, his papers, and all his possessions.\n Therefore all warrants to search suspected places, or arrest a person for ex-\n amination or trial, in prosecutions for criminal matters, are contrary to this\n right, if the cause or foundation of them be not previously supported by\n oath or affirmation, and if the order in a warrant to a civil officer to make\n search in suspected places, or to arrest one or more suspected persons, or to\n seize their property, be not accompanied with a special designation of the\n persons or objects of search, arrest, or seizure ; and no warrant ought to be\n issued but in cases and with the formalities prescribed by law.\n</p>\n<p>\n 20. In all controversies concerning property, and in all suits between\n two or more persons, except in cases in which it has been heretofore other-\n wise used and practised, the parties have a right to a trial by jury ; and\n this method of procedure shall be held sacred, unless in cases arising on the\n high seas, and such as relate to mariners\u2019 wages, the legislature shall think\n it necessary hereafter to alter it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 21.

The liberty of the press is essential to the security of freedom\n in a state ; it ought, therefore, to be inviolably preserved.\n</p>\n<p>\n 23. Retrospective laws are highly injurious, oppressive, and unjust. No\n such laws, therefore, should be made, either for the decision of civil causes\n or the punishment of offences.\n</p>\n<p>\n 24. A well-regulated militia is the proper, natural, and sure defence of a\n state.\n</p>\n<p>\n 25.
