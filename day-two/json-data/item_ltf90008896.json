Another consideration, illustrating the\n importance of the inquiry before us, is the na\u00ac\n ture of the Christian religion. Christianity\n challenges the attention of every reasonable\n being ; and the most senseles\u00ab creature in the\n universe is the person who refuses to consid\u00ac\n er its claims. Were there any reasonable\n doubt of its truth, which there is not, such is\n its nature, that it imperiously demands atten\u00ac\n tion. If true (and it is so,) it contains the\n most momentous truths we can possibly be\u00ac\n lieve. All those truths, in discovering which\n the wisest of mankind have consumed their\n days, when weighed with it are lighter than\n vanity. For if it is true, and should a care\u00ac\n less unbeliever peruse this page, let him in\u00ac\n dulge the reflection, the God whom it dis\u00ac\n covers is that awful Being whom we must\n meet; the Savior it proclaims is the Judge\n before whom we must appear ; the judgment\n it foretells, is that at which our doom for\n eternity will be past ; the solemn scenes of\n the future world which it discloses, are scenes\n we shall behold ; the endless life it has\n brought to light, is the life which we must\n live ; and either the heaven or the hell which\n it discovers, must be our portion through all\n the joyful or dreadful periods of a boundless\n eternity.

However, some time\n afterwards he made a visit at my house, and\n stayed with me a few days. During this in\u00ac\n terval, one evening he put the question to me\n again ; and at the same time added, that he\n should be really obliged if I would give him\n my thoughts in general upon the subject. Up\u00ac\n on this 1 turned towards him, and after a\n short pause told him, that my opinion lay in\n a small compass ; and he should have it in as\n compendious a manner as the subject would\n permit. Religion, I said, is either true or\n false. This is the alternative: there is no\n medium.

If Christianity prove true, their\n wickedness must hereafter appear unuttera\u00ac\n bly great, in rejecting a Saviour so glorious,\n so benevolent, possessed of so many claims\n upon their hearts, and exhibiting to view\n such divine compassion. Hence, on the\n supposition of its truth, they resemble sub\u00ac\n jects engaged in rebellion against a lawful\n and benevolent sovereign, who invites sub\u00ac\n mission, with promises of mercy and favor;\n but who declares, that if rebellion be continu\u00ac\n ed, to all that are taken in arms, no quarter can\n possibly be given, or mercy shown. In such\n a case, those who would still be rebels would\n rush into determined hostility. If Christian\u00ac\n ity is divine, in such a hopeless situation does\n every one stand, to whose view its claims are\n presented, but who rejects or slights those\n claims.\n</p>\n<p>\n Hence, too, will spring an anxiety for\n making proselytes. When a person sets\n himself to oppose a subject of general belief\n among the wisest and the greatest, fear that\n he may be mistaken will, though unacknowl\u00ac\n edged, at times steal into the breast; and to\n an infidel the least possibility, much more\n probability, of the truth of Christianity, must\n be dreadful. But every convert to infidel\u00ac\n ity tends to prop up his hopes that Christi\u00ac\n anity may prove a fable, and that the dread\u00ac\n ful judgment it announces is delusion. Mr.\n Cecil was once an infidel. He remarks, \u201c I\n was a professed infidel, but then I liked to be\n an infidel in company rather than alone.

Under these circumstances, a powerful\n proof in confirmation of the truth of the\n statements of the miracles of our Lord and\n his disciples, arises from the constrained si\u00ac\n lence of their enemies. The most effectual\n blow which they could have given to Chris\u00ac\n tianity, would have been to prove, that the\n accounts respecting these miracles were false,\n and that they were never wrought. Modern\n infidels perceive this, and therefore try now\n to disprove what their predecessors in unbe\u00ac\n lief did not dare deny. V \" et if these miracles\n had not been true, our Lord\u2019s enemies had\n every advantage of proving them false. They\n were not huddled up in the dark, like the\n tricks of popery, but were wrought in the\n most public manner, in the principal towns\n and cities of various countries, before ene\u00ac\n mies, and sometimes even in the midst of an\u00ac\n gry enemies ; were performed in various in\u00ac\n stances on objects well known to have been\n disordered, and were exposed to the most\n rigid scrutiny of those whose interest it was\n to prove them false. Had all these miracles\n been confined to one obscure town or vil\u00ac\n lage, there might have been cause to su-spect\n imposture. But the Lord\u2019s miracles were\n wrought in Jerusalem, in Capernaum, and\n in other places which are expressly specifi\u00ac\n ed ; and those of the apostles in places hun\u00ac\n dreds of miles apart.

In a court of justice how\n much is attributed to design ! is a man ar\u00ac\n raigned as a murderer, for slaying his fellow\n man, if it he proved that he had no design to\n kill, what jury would convict him? Has an\u00ac\n other set fire to a house., and the flames\n spread and burnt down a town? if it he\n proved that he did it accidentally, and with\u00ac\n out design, he is esteemed an innocent man.\n On the other hand, has a man assaulted his\n neighbor, and really done him little injury,\n but designed to kill him? this man, if an in\u00ac\n tention to kill is fully proved at tlie bar of\n justice, is in the eye of the law a murderer,\n and as a murderer he must suffer. The same\n principle acts with all its force in a thousand\n other instances. Has a friend greatly injur\u00ac\n ed me, yet am I convinced he truly designed\n as much good as he has done harm? I should\n think of his design, and not love him less\n than before. Has another bestowed some\n great benefit on me, yet am I convinced he\n meant me no kindness? In that case I should\n feel no gratitude, for I should think of his\n design. Now let us bring Christianity to\n trial upon this principle.

Is his dark picture too darkly\n colored? Let a brief statement of facts re\u00ac\n ply.* Excepting the Jewish nation, men\n appear universally to have renounced the God\n of heaven . The Egyptians supposed the sun\n and moon to be the \u201c eternal gods\u201d that gov\u00ac\n ern the whole world. The Phoenicians ac\u00ac\n counted the sun \u201c the only Lord of Heaven.\u201d\n Plato says, that the ancient Greeks appear to\n have esteemed the sun, moon, earth, stars,\n and heaven, to be the only gods. When the\n Greeks grew polite and learned, they still\n worshipped the heavenly bodies. Anaxago\u00ac\n ras was accused at Athens of impiety for af\u00ac\n firming the stars to be inanimate,and the sun\n a body of fire, as he thus denied their divin\u00ac\n ity. Even the much-extolled Socrates cen\u00ac\n sured him for presumption and arrogance.\u2014\n Plato frequently prescribes the worship of\n the stars, which seem the principle divinities\n he recommends to the people. Plutarch\n speaks of the sun and moon as animate,\n</p>\n<p>\n * Tho statements contained in this chapter are chiefly\n collected from Leland\u2019s invaluable work on the necessity of\n Revelation.

Some of these were so horridly\n impure, that it might have been supposed\n none but demons could invent, and none but\n persons possessed by demons practise them.\n Yet they were practiced by men, by women,\n and not merely under the cover of darkness,\n but in the face of day.
