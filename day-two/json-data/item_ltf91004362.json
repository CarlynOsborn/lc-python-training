Go where you will in Ireland, the story-teller\n is there, and on slight provocation will repeat his narrative ;\n amplifying, explaining, embellishing, till from a single fact\n a connected -history is evolved, giving motives, particulars,\n action, and result, the whole surrounded by a rosy wealth\n of rustic imagery and told with dramatic force an actor\n might envy. The following chapters comprise an effort to\n present this phase of unwritten Celtic literature, the mate-\n rial having been collected during a recent lengthy visit, in\n the course of which every county in the island was traversed\n from end to end, and constant association had with the peas-\n ant tenantry. As, however, in perusing a drama each reader\n for himself supplies stage-action, so, in the following pages,\n he is requested to imagine the charms of gesticulation and\n intonation, for no pen can do justice to a story told by Irish\n lips amid Irish surroundings.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":

Attempts have been made to remove some of these raths,\n but the unwillingness of the peasants to engage in the work,\n no matter what inducements may be offered in compensa-\n tion, has generally resulted in the abandonment of the un-\n dertaking.

The phe-\n nomenon was perhaps genuine, for the mirage is by no means\n an uncommon appearance in some parts of Ireland, but work\n on the rath was at once indefinitely postponed.

In parts of Done-\n gal and Galway they are believed to receive the souls of the\n dying and escort them to the gates of heaven, not, however,\n being allowed to enter with them. On this account, fairies\n love graves and graveyards, having often been seen walking\n to and fro among the grassy mounds. There are, indeed,\n some accounts of faction fights among the fairy bands at or\n shortly after a funeral, the question in dispute being whether\n the soul of the departed belonged to one or the

Although their musical instruments are few, the\n fairies use these few with wonderful skill. Near Colooney, in\n Sligo, there is a \u201c knowlageable woman,\u201d whose grandmother\u2019s\n aunt once witnessed a fairy ball, the music for which was fur-\n nished by an orchestra which the management had no doubt\n been at great pains and expense to secure and instruct.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c It was the cutest sight alive. There was a place for thim\n to shtand on, an\u2019 a wondherful big fiddle av the size ye cud\n slape in it, that was played be a monsthrous frog, an\u2019 two lit-\n tle fiddles, that two kittens fiddled on, an\u2019 two big drums,\n baten be cats, an\u2019 two trumpets, played be fat pigs.

Even now a belated peasant, who has been at a\n wake, or is coming home from a fair, in passing a rath will\n sometimes hear the soft strains of their voices in the distance,\n and will hurry away lest they discover his presence and be\n angry at the intrusion on their privacy. When in unusually\n good spirits they will sometimes admit a mortal to their revels,\n but if he speaks, the scene at once vanishes, he becomes in-\n sensible, and generally finds himself by the roadside the next\n morning, \u201c wid that degray av pains in his arrums an\u2019 legs an\u2019\n back, that if sixteen thousand divils were afther him, he cud\n n\u2019t stir a toe to save the sowl ay him, that \u2019s phat the fairies\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ir:is:hw:on:de:rs:gh:os:00:mc:an:_0:irishwondersghos00mcan_0:irishwondersghos00mcan_0_0122/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 333, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 487}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ir:is:hw:on:de:rs:gh:os:00:mc:an:_0:irishwondersghos00mcan_0:irishwondersghos00mcan_0_0122/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 667, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 974}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ir:is:hw:on:de:rs:gh:os:00:mc:an:_0:irishwondersghos00mcan_0:irishwondersghos00mcan_0_0122/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1335, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1948}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ir:is:hw:on:de:rs:gh:os:00:mc:an:_0:irishwondersghos00mcan_0:irishwondersghos00mcan_0_0122/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2670, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3897}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ir:is:hw:on:de:rs:gh:os:00:mc:an:_0:irishwondersghos00mcan_0:irishwondersghos00mcan_0_0122/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ir/is/hw/on/de/rs/gh/os/00/mc/an/_0/irishwondersghos00mcan_0/irishwondersghos00mcan_0_0122.jp2", "height": 3897, "width": 2670, "levels": 6, "size": 554365}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"122\">\n<p>\n 100\n</p>\n<p>\n IRISH WONDERS.\n</p>\n<p>\n do be pinchin\u2019 an\u2019 punchin\u2019 him for cornin\u2019 on them an\u2019\n shpakin\u2019 out loud.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Kindly disposed fairies often take great pleasure in assisting\n those who treat them with proper respect, and as the favors al-\n ways take a practical form, there is sometimes a business value\n in the show of reverence for them.

One of the O\u2019Flahertys, of Galway,\n marched out of his castle with his men on a foray, and, as his\n troops filed through the gateway, the Banshee was heard high\n above the towers of the fortress. The next night she sang\n again, and was heard no more for a month, when his wife\n heard the wail under her window, and on the following day\n his followers brought back his corpse.

In\n the year 1850, while the country was still suffering from the\n effects of the \u201c starving time,\u201d she lived with her husband,\n Michael O\u2019Malley, and four sons, on a little farm near Lake\n Derry clare. Year after year had the crops failed, but the little\n family held together, faring, or rather starving, alike. In the\n year mentioned, although the country in general was beginning\n to recover from the famine, this part of Connemara was still\n stricken, and the crop seemed likely again to fail. Starvation\n stared the hapless family in the face. The boys were well\n grown lads, accustomed to the hard life of peasants, and will-\n ing to work if any could be found. All four left home, the\n eldest going to Galway, the other three to the sea-shore, where\n they found temporary employment in the fisheries. While so\n engaged, they learned the secrets of the illicit distiller, and\n having, in course of time, managed to procure a small still,\n they returned home with it, and as the cabin was in a se-\n cluded quarter of a little frequented district, they persuaded\n the old man to engage in the enterprise with them. The risk\n of detection appeared so small, especially when compared with\n the profits, that against the prayers and entreaties of the\n woman, the still was set up in a retired spot near by and the\n manufacture of the poteen begun in as large quantities as\n their limited resources would allow.
