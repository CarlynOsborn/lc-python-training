This organization claims\n to be the true church of Christ; denies to all other eccle\u00ac\n siastical associations the right to be regarded as any part\n of the Christian Church; and excludes from the hope of\n salvation all who are without its pale. One of the main\n pillars on which this system of such lofty pretensions rests,\n is the assumption that the Apostle Peter was by our Lord\n invested with peculiar authority, and was constituted the\n Prince of the Apostles, and the Head of the Church on\n earth. Intimately connected with this position, and equally\n essential to the support of this system, is the assumption\n that this Apostle was constituted the Bishop of the Church\n of Rome. And from these premises the conclusion is\n drawn, that the existing Bishop of Rome is the successor\n of the Prince of the Apostles; and consequently that he\n inherits the peculiar prerogatives of the great Apostle, and\n is the Vicar of Christ on earth.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is proposed, on the present occasion, to inquire into\n the nature of the foundation on which Romanism has erec\u00ac\n ted her towering superstructure. It is reasonable to sup\u00ac\n pose that principles of fundamental importance in a system\n professedly Christian must be clearly taught in the Oracles\n of Truth.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:pr:es:_0:addressdelivered00pres_0:addressdelivered00pres_0_0006/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 269}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:pr:es:_0:addressdelivered00pres_0:addressdelivered00pres_0_0006/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 322, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 539}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:pr:es:_0:addressdelivered00pres_0:addressdelivered00pres_0_0006/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 644, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1079}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:pr:es:_0:addressdelivered00pres_0:addressdelivered00pres_0_0006/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1289, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2159}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:pr:es:_0:addressdelivered00pres_0:addressdelivered00pres_0_0006/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2579, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4318}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:pr:es:_0:addressdelivered00pres_0:addressdelivered00pres_0_0006/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ad/dr/es/sd/el/iv/er/ed/00/pr/es/_0/addressdelivered00pres_0/addressdelivered00pres_0_0006.jp2", "height": 4318, "width": 2579, "levels": 6, "size": 633581}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"6\">\n<p>\n [ 4 ]\n</p>\n<p>\n I. Oar first inquiry, then, is, Do the Scriptures furnish\n satisfactory evidence , that the Apostle Peter was invested with\n any peculiar authority or dignity among the Apostles ' !\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. In the first place I remark, that in the call to the office\n of the Apostleship, and in the commission which was given\n to the twelve disciples, there is no intimation of any distinc\u00ac\n tion among them in point of authority. In the early part of\n his ministry, our Lord selected from among his followers\n twelve whom he named Apostles. These twelve he or\u00ac\n dained that they should be with him, and that he might\n send them forth to preach the gospel, and have power to\n heal sicknesses, and to cast out devils. While he was with\n them, our Lord sent out the Twelve by two and two, and\n gave them power over unclean spirits. And they went\n out and preached that men should repent. And they cast\n out many devils, and anointed with oil many that were\n sick, and healed them.\u2014Mark vi. 7. In this first appoint\u00ac\n ment which was given to the Twelve, there is not the\n slightest intimation of any peculiar authority being confer\u00ac\n red on any one of them. Peter is called and ordained by\n his Lord and Master, just in the same manner as the other\n Apostles; he is sent forth accompanied by a companion, in\n the same way as the rest of his brethren; and between him\n and them, there is no distinction made in the bestowment\n of miraculous gifts.\n</p>\n<p>\n And after the resurrection, when having finished the\n work of redemption, our Lord was about to ascend to the\n right hand of the Majesty on high, he invested his Apostles\n with full authority as his ambassadors to go forth and\n preach the gospel to the nations, no distinction whatever is\n made among them.

The Scrip\u00ac\n tures teach in the most clear and unequivocal manner, that\n Jesus Christ is the only foundation of the church, and that\n upon this rock, and not upon any imperfect creature, is\n the church built. \u201cThussaith the Lord God, Behold I lay\n in Zion for a foundation, a stone, a tried stone, a precious\n cornerstone, a sure foundation.\u201d\u2014Isa. xxviii, 16. And an\n Apostle declares, \u201cother foundation can no man lay than\n that is laid, which is Jesus Christ.\u201d\u20141 Cor. iii. 11. Jesus\n Christ then, is the living stone which God hath laid in Zion,\n he is the only foundation of the church; and the Apostle Pe\u00ac\n ter and all true believers are lively stones built up a spir\u00ac\n itual house, which rests upon him as the foundation. That\n interpretation, therefore, which would make Peter the rock\n on which the church is founded, is manifested to be erro\u00ac\n neous, because it conflicts with what the Scriptures else\u00ac\n where plainly teach, and arrogates to a creature, the honor\n which belongs to the Lord Jesus Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n Among those who unite in rejecting that interpretation\n of this text, which makes Peter the rock on which the\n church is built, there is some diversity of opinion, in rela\u00ac\n tion to its precise import. All that is necessary to my\n present purpose, is to show, that it is a forced and erro\u00ac\n neous construction which would make it support the doc\u00ac\n trine that Peter is the foundation on which our Lord de\u00ac\n clares his purpose to build his church. Perhaps the most\n simple interpretation is that which represents the great\n truth, that Jesus Christ is the Son of the living God, which\n Peter in the name of the Apostles confessed, as the rock\n which supports his church, and is essential to its existence.\n The idea then would be, that Jesus Christ, in his true char\u00ac\n acter, as the Son of the living God, is the rock on which\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:pr:es:_0:addressdelivered00pres_0:addressdelivered00pres_0_0011/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 269}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:pr:es:_0:addressdelivered00pres_0:addressdelivered00pres_0_0011/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 322, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 539}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:pr:es:_0:addressdelivered00pres_0:addressdelivered00pres_0_0011/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 644, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1079}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:pr:es:_0:addressdelivered00pres_0:addressdelivered00pres_0_0011/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1289, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2159}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:pr:es:_0:addressdelivered00pres_0:addressdelivered00pres_0_0011/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2579, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4318}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:pr:es:_0:addressdelivered00pres_0:addressdelivered00pres_0_0011/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ad/dr/es/sd/el/iv/er/ed/00/pr/es/_0/addressdelivered00pres_0/addressdelivered00pres_0_0011.jp2", "height": 4318, "width": 2579, "levels": 6, "size": 616631}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"11\">\n<p>\n [ 9 )\n</p>\n<p>\n the church is founded, and on which she shall stand securely\n amidst the opposition of earth and hell.\n</p>\n<p>\n In connection with the declaration we have been con\u00ac\n sidering, our Lord says to Peter \u201cI will give unto thee, the\n keys of the kingdom of heaven, and whatsoever thou shalt\n bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever\n thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.\u201d And\n these words have been adduced to prove that some peculiar\n authority was conferred on Peter.

After having discharged the duties of his office\n for four years, this excellent man was removed by death. After the\n death of Dr. Kerr, such of the students as found it convenient to repair\n to his residence, pursued their theological studies under the care of\n Rev. Mungo Dick, for the two following years. At the meeting of\n Synod, in Pittsburgh, 19th October, 1831, the present Senior Professor\n was chosen.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the year 1843, Synod established three Professorships in the\n Institution:\n</p>\n<p>\n A Professorship of Theology\u2014Didactic, Polemic, and Pastoral;\n</p>\n<p>\n A Professorship of Biblical Literature and Criticism;\n</p>\n<p>\n A Professorship of Ecclesiastical History and Church Government.\n</p>\n<p>\n At the same time, the Rev. James L. Dinwiddie, D. D. was appointed\n Professor of Biblical Literature and Criticism; and the Professorship\n of Theology was assigned to the Senior Professor. It being at that\n time, inconvenient for Synod, to fill the chair of Ecclesiastical History\n and Church Government, the duties connected with that department\n were dischargad by the Senior Professor.\n</p>\n<p>\n About the middle of the third Session after Dr. Dinwiddie was\n elected, it pleased God in his mysterious providence, to lay his afflicting\n hand upon him, so that he was disqualified for rendering any further\n service to the Church. By this dispensation, the Senior Professor, was\n once more left alone in the charge of the Seminary; and on him devolved\n the duties connected with the three Professorships in the Institution.\n In this situation, he remained until the meeting of Synod in 1847; at\n which time the Rev. Alexander D. Clarke, President of Franklin\n College, in New Athens, Ohio, was elected Professor of Ecclesiastical\n History and Church Government.

And in\n consequence of various bequests left by friends of the Institution, the\n means are now in possession of Synod, which will enable us to enlarge\n the Library to an extent which will meet all necessary demands.\n</p>\n<p>\n The term of study in the Seminary at present is four years; there\n being one session of five months in each year, commencing on the first\n Monday in November. During the whole course, the Bible is our\n text-book. The grand design of every exercise in the Seminary is to\n lead the student to a correct understanding of the lively Oracles, and\n to enable him to acquire the faculty of unfolding the truths of the Bible\n plainly and intelligibly to others. It is not the object of the Instruc\u00ac\n tors to communicate a large amount of knowledge, but to aid the\n student in the investigation of truth for himself; that thus knowledge\n may be acquired as the fruit of his own labor.\n</p>\n<p>\n The following outline of the course of study and the laws for the\n government of the Institution, adopted by the Synod, will give a gen\u00ac\n eral view of the manner in which the course of instruction is conducted\n in the Seminary:\n</p>\n<p>\n COURSE OF STUDY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. The reading and critical investigation of the Sacred Scriptures,\n in the Hebrew and Greek languages, shall occupy a prominent place\n in the whole course. Every thing included under the head of Biblical\n Antiquities, Natural History, Chronology and Sacred Geography, shall\n here be introduced. The great design of this branch of theological\n study shall be to qualify the Student for the correct and perspicuous\n interpretation of the Sacred Text.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The study of the doctrines of the Bible in systematic order. In\n this department the attention of the Student shall be occupied with\n every thing included under the heads of Didactic and Polemic The\u00ac\n ology. Here the first subject of inquiry shall be, what are the doc\u00ac\n trines of the Holy Scriptures as exhibited in our ecclesiastical stan\u00ac\n dards, and what their connection and dependence? The great object\n in this branch of study shall be, to qualify the Student for holding forth\n the Faithful Word, and to enable him by sound doctrine both to exhort\n and to convince the gainsayers.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The careful examination of the history of the Church of Christ\n from its first establishment till the present time. Here the attention of\n the Student shall be directed to the origin and progress of the Church;\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:pr:es:_0:addressdelivered00pres_0:addressdelivered00pres_0_0023/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 269}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:pr:es:_0:addressdelivered00pres_0:addressdelivered00pres_0_0023/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 322, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 539}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:pr:es:_0:addressdelivered00pres_0:addressdelivered00pres_0_0023/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 644, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1079}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:pr:es:_0:addressdelivered00pres_0:addressdelivered00pres_0_0023/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1289, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2159}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:pr:es:_0:addressdelivered00pres_0:addressdelivered00pres_0_0023/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2579, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4318}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:pr:es:_0:addressdelivered00pres_0:addressdelivered00pres_0_0023/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ad/dr/es/sd/el/iv/er/ed/00/pr/es/_0/addressdelivered00pres_0/addressdelivered00pres_0_0023.jp2", "height": 4318, "width": 2579, "levels": 6, "size": 397160}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"23\">\n<p>\n [ 21 ]\n</p>\n<p>\n the ordinances of religious worship; and the corruptions, whether of\n doctrine, worship, or government, which have been at different times\n introduced into the Church.
