The Em\u00ac\n manuel Movement, so-\n called, is not new in\n theory, hut has received\n such practical and stir\u00ac\n ring expression for the past twelve\u00ac\n month in sedate old Boston that it is\n now branching out iu every direction\n from \" The Hub.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Tile Euimauuel Movement was start\u00ac\n ed in November, lflOG. in a series of\n Sunday night talks in Emmanuel Epis\u00ac\n copal Church, Boston. Emmanuel j\n Church is in Newbury street, neari\n the Public Garden. It has never been j\n known as a high church, like the j\n Church of the Advent, nor as a j\n low church, like famous old Trinity; {\n but it inis taken a position between j\n these two and is known as \u201cbroad.\u201d\n It probably has the largest Episcopal\n parish in Boston. The rector is Dr. El-\n wood Worcester, the originator of the\n new movement. His tlrst assistant is j\n Dr. Samuel McComb. Dr. Worcester be-[\n fore goiug to Emmanuel Church avus\n a rector for eight years in St.\n Stephen ' s Church, Philadelphia. Be-:\n fore entering the pastorate he was I\n professor of psychology and the his- j\n tory of philosophy id Lehigh Universi-j\n tv. He Avas graduated from Colum\u00ac\n bia and the General Theological Semi\u00ac\n nary. aud has degrees from the Univers\u00ac\n ity of Leipsic. the University of Penn- j\n sylvania and Hobart College Dr. Me-.\n Comb Avas graduated from Oxford j\n University, and has taken courses at\n Trinity College. Dublin and Glasgow\n University. Dr. Worcester and Dr.\n McComb Avere theological counsel for |\n Dr. Crapse.v in his trial at Batavia.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Emmanuel Movement is iu sub-1\n stauce this:\n</p>\n<p>\n The power of mind over matter; tbej\n control of physical disabilities where\n such disabilities are influenced or j\n caused by the mind; the easement of j\n the mind itself, all superinduced by j\n an abundance of faith. No new dog- j\n</p>\n<p>\n mas are imposed upon the believers\n in Emmanuel; their prayers and their\n faith are combined with the efforts\n of sound scientific help. Its basic\n principles are founded on three\n agencies;\n</p>\n<p>\n First\u2014Moral Re-education.\n</p>\n<p>\n Second\u2014Waking Suggestion.\n</p>\n<p>\n Third\u2014Spiritual Hypnosis.\n</p>\n<p>\n The last named method is employed\n only in the treatment of certain\n</p>\n<p>\n Photo by Chickering.)\n</p>\n<p>\n The Rev. Samuel McComb of Boston.\n</p>\n<p>\n groups of disorders, such as alcohol\u00ac\n ism, fixed ideas, etc., aud then only\n under the direction of an expert ueu-\n roiogist.\n</p>\n<p>\n The scientific and philosophic basis\n for this neAv school of religion and\n healing has been given from Boston,\n its birthplace, in an analysis of Jas-\n troAv ' s \u2018\u2018Subconsciousness.\u2019 ' The sub\u00ac\n conscious mind is stored Avitb subtle\n poAvei ' S. which, when highly excited\n sometimes bloom iuto genius aud\n sometimes fade into visions, leaving\n the wreckage of disease in their wake.\n Cesare Lombroso says:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" The resemblance betAveeu insanity\n and genius, although it does not sIioav\n that these tAvo should be confounded,\n proves at all eveuts that one does not\n</p>\n<p>\n exclude the other in the same subject.\n In fact, without speaking of the nu\u00ac\n merous men of genius avIio at some\n period of their lives were subject to\n hallucinations or insanity, or of those\n who, like Vico, terminated a great\n career in dementia, how many great\n thinkers have shown themselves all\n their li\\-es subject to monomania or\n hallucinations?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The mental healing theory of the\n Emmanuel movement is simply releas\u00ac\n ing the stored-up powers of the mind\n by way of suggestion, for, it is held,\n the subconscious is iu such close re\u00ac\n lation with the religious life that the\n uprusli from it works so marvelously\n upon physical life that we look upon\n its performances in common affairs as\n miracles. It is maintained by the\n originators of the Emmanuel Move\u00ac\n ment that man is a very sugges\u00ac\n tible animal, and from the subcon\u00ac\n scious region a wealth of dynamic en\u00ac\n ergy may be obtained. They say it is\n useless to deny the reality of the phys\u00ac\n ical body and its pains through de-\n rauged functions, but, they add. the\n uetv psychology if? saying that the\n mind has almost limitless power over\n the body. It is as difficult at times to\n pierce the sick man with this idea as\n it is to penetrate the moral despair of\n the sinner with the thought that there '\n is salvation for his soul.\n</p>\n<p>\n While in some respects the Em\u00ac\n manuel Movement resembles the gen\u00ac\n eral theory of Christian Science\u2014that\n is, in regard to faith\u2014in the methods\n i of cure Hie lines of demarcation are\n i closely drawn. Emmanuelism has no\n ! hostility to the medical profession, but\n ! Avorks hand in hand with it. The basis\n j of the Avhole system of Emmanuelism\n is diagnosis. Before coming tinder the\n treatment of Emmanuelism the patient\n must be examined by a regular prac\u00ac\n ticing physician, and, if his trouble is\n organic, it is a case for medicine and\n surgery. It may be that the miud\n also has its influence in creating or\n augmenting his disorder, and in that\n event, the Emmanuel treatment is\n brought into co-operation with the\n medical.

The foundation of all these\n diseases may be expressed in this one\n Idea: \u201cDeadly poison lies in evil\n thoughts which the most searching\n drugs are powerless to reach.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The theory of the Emmanuel Move\u00ac\n ment is to co-operate with science, but\n this is an incident rather than the\n primordial object. This union of re\u00ac\n ligion and science in church work is\n astonishing, but the dramatic feature\n of the movement is the conference\n with the pastor\u2014what the Catholic\n Church designates as the confessional.\n It is at this conference that the pa\u00ac\n tient bares his mind, and it is here\n the true relief comes to him. This\n conference, it is maintained, has noth\u00ac\n ing in it partaking of the character of\n the confessional, but is simply a con\u00ac\n fidence established between pastor and\n patient. The little things that prey\n upon one\u2019s mind are freely revealed;\n the petty jealousies, the little annoy\u00ac\n ances of life are discussed and with\n the discussion pass away, and thus ap\u00ac\n pear data and causes that the regular\n practitioner could never discover. On\n this point Dr. Worcester said:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI heard drunkards and others cured\n by us say that they were conscious of\n two things: of something that had\n died within them and of something\n that had been born within them. What\n had died was the old evil tendency:\n what had been born was the sense of\n power and of oneness with Christ and\n God, which they had never had be\u00ac\n fore.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n To the new movement ail -weeds are\n welcome, and to the new movement\n all creeds have come Not only is the\n union of religion and science advocat\u00ac\n ed. but also there is advocated the\n tin ion of all faiths In the work of\n healing.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Robert MacDonald of Brooklyn,\n a number of whose sermons follow iD\n this book, is tbe chief exponent of\n this movemeut in New York.\n</p>\n<p>\n Within the last few weeks the at\u00ac\n tention of the people of B ' esoidyn has\n been brought to tbe Emmanne! Move\u00ac\n ment by the work of the Rev Dr.\n Robert MacDonald of the Washington\n Avenue Baptist Church. In his ser\u00ac\n mons he has explained the object of\n tbe movement, and iD his talks and\n personal interviews he has brought\n the matter borne to, not only his own\n congregation, but to the great\n throngs of people who have attended\n his meetings. Dr. MacDonald is thor\u00ac\n oughly imbued ' with the importance\n of his new work, and he has the abil\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n ity and the temperament to carry it\n forward to success. Highly magnetic\n and sympathetic, he at once gets in\n touch with his listeners, and having\n gotten in touch with them, his fine\n oratorical powers and somewhat dra\u00ac\n matic\u2014but by no means sensational\u2014\n methods win them to his arguments.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. MacDonald defines the Em\u00ac\n manuel movement as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt is a movement to extend the\n church\u2019s usefulness unto the saving of\n the whole man. The older appeal was to\n the soul and the man\u2019s preparation\n for eternity. This movement takes\n hold of his mental and bodily life,\n and fits him for daily living right here\n and now. It claims that if he is\n prepared to live, he will be prepared\n to die. It is here where he has to\n fight his battles, bear his burdens and\n work out bis destiny. As I said in\n one of my sermons, it is not best\n called a movement for the healing of\n the body, for there are many diseases,\n namely those of organic nature, that\n it does not attempt to cure. It is\n really for the uplifting of the soul,\n the individuality, the man unto his\n divine and infinite possibilities of\n power to live in a clean, newly fur\u00ac\n nished house with all modern improve\u00ac\n ments. Yes, and ancient improve\u00ac\n ments, too, and where he can enjoy\n all the comforts of home. It is a\n movement to help the church em\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n brace a hitheyto neglected field of use\u00ac\n fulness, by assuring men that God\n is with us for tbe cure of the body\n</p>\n<p>\n as well as for tbe cure of the soul:\n</p>\n<p>\n to tell men that however hard their\n circumstances and evil their habits\n</p>\n<p>\n they can become absolute masters of\n their fate.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe complaint is going up from\n everywhere thatthe church is losing its\n hold on practical, substantial men and\n women. Tbe reason is not that tbe\n ehurcb is not faithful to its duty, but\n that the world has increased its fa\u00ac\n cilities to satisfy man. Books, maga\u00ac\n zines and papers were never so plen\u00ac\n tiful. cheap and informing on all pos\u00ac\n sible subjects. Lectures, musicals,\n libraries, clubs, entertainments, thea\u00ac\n ters. organizations and orders of all\n conceivable kind, and adjusted to\n every phase of his social, mental and\n moral life, make tremendous appeal\n and occupy his attention. The church\n must have a compelling motive to\n awaken his interest. A purely spirit\u00ac\n ual appeal does not arouse him. Many\n conservative, substantial churches are\n not friendly to the ealliug in of an\n evangelist to arouse interest iD spirit\u00ac\n ual things. But here is a new oppor\u00ac\n tunity to get at the man of the world.\n His modern way of living with all its\n hurry and seurrrv has gotten on to\n his nerves. lie sleeps poorly, is\n depressed or melancholy, has nerv\u00ac\n ous breakdown, is dyspeptic and\n sluggish and miserable. The same\n man who will not listen to a\n purely spiritual appeal wants help\n</p>\n<p>\n and wants it badly. Tbe church that\n can promise him health to do his\n work with, wins him. Ilis bodily pain\n is very real to him, for it Is so much\n nearer to him than a cramped and\n dormant spirit of which he is not\n conscious. He does not want to be a\n Christian Scientist. Yet he will if\n the church of his bringing up can\u2019t\n give the needed help. This new move\u00ac\n ment then offers present bodily help\n that wins his allegiance. Forever\n after the church stands in a new light\n to him, has a new and more positive\n content.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cPsychology with its experimen\u00ac\n tation, its theories and principles\n has heretofore been a consideration of\n college classroom and laboratory.\n Now, for tbe first time, it is set to work\n for practical ends. It reveals an im\u00ac\n mense subconscious realm in which\n are lodged all possibilities of good as\n well as the vantage of all evil habits.\n Of course these features of all our life\n and activity are automatic. We\n do this and that instinctively, we\n say. Did we pause to think how\n we should place our feet, we\n should walk slowly aud painfully.\n Did we stop to thiuk before we speak\n we should converse haltingly. Con\u00ac\n scious action Is weak action. It Is\n the reserve element in life that we\n constantly draw on when we do things\n by liabit, by instinct. Such also spells\n character, good or bad.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cNow this subconscious realm In\n every life is susceptible to impression\n and suggestion and influence. Con\u00ac\n sciousness under power of active will\n and reason is the stubborn element in\n life. We all know what a deterrent\n force is self-consciousness to all free\n activity. Knowledge of psychology\n enables as to put curative elements\n into tbe diseased life, that make for\n health and victory. This is the secret of\n spiritual hypnosis, or the influence of\n a strong mind over a weak one. Only\n in rarest, most difficult cases, is It nec-\n</p>\n<p>\n out of every ten the person co-operates\n with the one doing him good by relax\u00ac\n ing consciousness, unbending will and\n mind and body to the extent of allow\u00ac\n ing the physician of mind and soul to\n get at tbe subconscious parts. Sleep\n serves this purpose. \"\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cTbe best time to correct the child\n of evils is when asleep. Then, sitting\n at its bedside, you can put into the\n unconscious child and into the sub\u00ac\n conscious depths tbe strong thought\n that is ueeded. Is your child afraid\n of the dark, as so many little ones\n are? Talk to him this way: \u2018Thera\n is no need of fearing the darkness,\n my son. There is nothing in it to\n harm you It is your friend, not your\n enemy. It is giveD you to rest tn and\n sleep in. It will not harm you.

He has had many callers, most\n of them looking for cures. But Dr.\n MacDonald refrains from attending\n to the iudivudual case, saying that he\n has not the time nor the facilities\n to practice the cult. In two or three\n cases, however, where the distress has\n been very marked, they have been\n helped. One case of a young lady\n suffering melancholia aud hysteria is\n told by Dr. MacDonald thus:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cA young lady, thirty years of\n age, pulled my bell. She no sooner\n began to tell me of her ills\n than she broke down in uucontrol-\n labie hysteria. All attempt to console\n her was in vain. She could not talk.\n She could only sob. For two long\n hours this pitiful condition continued.\n I had another caller, and wondered\n what I could do with this young lady\n in such abject distress. To send her\n into the street was not Christian. Yet\n might she not be an impostor playing\n a part? It was evident that such un\u00ac\n accountable anguish could not be as\u00ac\n sumed for a purpose. Stranger though\n she was, I sent her to a room in my\n home, where she could be alone and\n rest. She needed above all else quiet.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cTwo hours or more after this I\n went to her and with difficulty learned\n her sad story. She had come from\n Pennsylvania to New York ten days\n before to look for stenography. Being\n an orphan, her uncle, with whom she\n lived, was unsympathetic, as many\n strong men are with nervous people.\n He taunted her with her condition\n</p>\n<p>\n and thought she could work if she\n would. This went on while she was\n teaching school and for seven years.\n At last desperate, she got together\n enough funds to reach New York and\n take a room, hoping for a situation,\n but looking each day in vain. Her\n funds ran out. She planned suicide.\n Friendless, moneyless, a nervous\n wreck, she sought me out. She did\n not want to be cured. She had tried\n mental healing and faith cure and\n medical help years before, but in vain.\n She wanted me to send her home\n again. I said, \u2018What for?\u2019 Her an\u00ac\n swer Avas \u2018To die, I suppose\u2019: but she\n continued, it would be among friends.\n I refused her request. I said, \u2018It would\n be wiser to make you well.\u2019 \u2018Ah, sir,\u2019\n she replied, \u2018if you could, but there is\n no cure for me.\u2019 I said, \u2018Will you\n take what I have to offer?\u2019 After\n much urging she yielded herself to\n my entreaties, but only after the prom\u00ac\n ise that I would place her in a sana\u00ac\n torium where she could rest.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI applied the principles of this\n method aud prayed with her, leaving\n her quiet and calm. Some hours after\n I called her down to the evening meal,\n urged her to spend the night, rather\n than go back to her unattractive\n room. This invitation was at the\n request of a physician who want\u00ac\n ed to watch the case and test\n the cure. She, to my surprise, pre\u00ac\n ferred to go to her own room, prom\u00ac\n ising to return to Brooklyn at 9 the\n next morning.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBefore going to New York I told\n her the doctor would try to secure a\n sanatorium for her to rest in. We se\u00ac\n cured a room in the King\u2019s Daughters\n Home, and she knew I was to be re\u00ac\n sponsible for a fortnight\u2019s board. The\n next morning my suspicions were\n aroused as 9, 10. 11, 12 o ' clock came\n around, but no young lady appeared.\n At 1 o\u2019clock she came, and if ever I\n looked into a changed face and a calm,\n strong life it was then. She said, \u2018I\n slept soundly from 11 until G, my first\n night\u2019s sleep for weeks. I rested until\n 9. I then felt so strong I went in\n search of a situation.\u2019 Thanking us\n for our help and hospitality, she re\u00ac\n turned to New York to bring her\n trunk to the new rest home. But,\n picking up a paper, she saw an \u2018ad,\n asking for a mother\u2019s helper in a city\n in Massachusetts. She sought out the\n lady in one of the New York hotels,\n secured the situation and went with\n the lady to Massachusetts.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI have received a most appreciative\n letter within a day or two, telling me\n that with the new hope aud courage\n and strength received she could not\n bear to think of sitting around in a\n rest home for two weeks. She also\n said, \u2018I have, when tired and inclined\n to become nervous, gone into the\n silence of my room, laid on my bed\n and applied the principles you gave\n me and found immediate relief and\n calm.\u2019 \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n One of the first pastors to preach\n about and believe in the Emmanuel\n Movement was the Rev. Dr. L. Ward\n Brigham of All Souls Uuiversalist\n Church of Flatbush.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Brigham w r as formerly a med\u00ac\n ical practitioner in Illinois, and he feels\n qualified to say that this new union\n of medicine and religion will be of the\n greatest of benefit to all suffering\n from functional disorders.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI believed in the movement aud\n talked about it before it had any\n definite name;\u2019\u2019 said Dr. Brigham, the\n other day. \u201cOne cannot well believe in\n the Christian faith and not believe in\n the power of that faith to aid him.\n The theory of faith cure dates back\n to the advent of man upon earth. The\n savage has it, the civilized man has it.\n You can trace it back to the Indian\n medicine man; you can trace it to the\n nomads on the desert, and you can\n find it in the jungle tribes of Africa.\n There is something in you and in me\n that appeals to our souls: something\n that tells us if w T e call upon God for\n help that help will be given to us. It\n is this free unburdening of one\u2019s\n trouble to another that gives the great\n power to the confessional of the Cath\u00ac\n olic Church. It brings the great ma\u00ac\n chinery of the religion of the church\n in close touch with the ego. You are\n one with God. It is the new theology\n and yet it was, after all, the great\n basis of all ancient religions, aud was\n founded on the same theory.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt is like this: You have some\n trouble on your mind. This trouble\n is wearing on your general health;\n you cannot sleep: you cannot eat; it\n is breaking you down. You alone\n know the trouble. At length you can\u00ac\n not bear it longer. You go to a friend.\n You tell him the whole story; he is\n sympathetic and he listens. He may\n not give one word of advice to you,\n but you feel as if a great load had\n been lifted from you. You are a new\n man, aud your trouble that seemed so\n stupendous before, now is nothing.\n This is the theory of the Emmanuel\n Movement put in its simplest form-\n only that iu the religious help you are\n brought face to face with God, and he\n is your close friend. So, you can see,\n this movement draws men closer to\n religion. It will surely help the\n church as it will help mankind, for\n it makes one feel that religion is some\u00ac\n thing more to him than a mere name\u2014\n that is a helper, a counselor, a com\u00ac\n forter and a friend that never for\u00ac\n sakes him.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe division between functional\n and organic disease, while most of us\n believe it is there, is so faint that it\n is difficult to discover where it begins\n and where it ends. Medicine in the\n last twenty years or more has made\n few practical advances in compari\u00ac\n son with other sciences. We have the\n theories, but we produce with the aid\n of drugs practically no better x*esulta\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0008/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 188, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 278}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0008/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 376, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 557}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0008/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 752, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1115}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0008/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1504, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2230}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0008/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3008, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4460}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0008/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/em/ma/nu/el/mo/ve/me/nt/00/un/se/emmanuelmovement00unse/emmanuelmovement00unse_0008.jp2", "height": 4460, "width": 3008, "levels": 6, "size": 906069}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"8\">\n<p>\n 6\n</p>\n<p>\n THE EMMANUEL MOVEMENT.\n</p>\n<p>\n than we produced some years ago.\n Surgery has made rapid strides; the\n germ theory is opening the way for\n the treatment of many diseases, but '\n we are only beginning to understand\n It. Now so many diseases are based i\n on a disordered condition of the mind\n that this Emmanuel Movement comes\n as a blessing to humanity; not that\n it is anything new, but it brings the\n idea to a tangible and popular expo\u00ac\n sition.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cSome care, however, should be\n taken not to carry the idea too far\u2014\n not to go beyond its real powers. For\n instance, I think that the auto-sug\u00ac\n gestion method of the Emmanuel\n Movement is apt to be carried too far.\n One is told to relax and to look at a\n certain object till his mind is centered !\n there, and thus bj r concentration\u2014\n he can control himself. There is the\n danger that one may become addicted\n to this habit of concentration\u2014this\n one centralized idea of looking at\n some certain thing, and getting into\n this one state of mind. In such an\n event, instead of strengthening one s\n mind, one weakens it. Now, hyp\u00ac\n notism is all right Avlien conducted\n scientifically, but when employed in j\n the hands of a charlatan it becomes I\n a dangerous thing. Hypnotism sim\u00ac\n ply means the control of one mind\n over another. Thus, a good father,\n with a good mind, can talk to his\n child and influence it in the right di\u00ac\n rection. So, by suggestion, good men\n and good women can influence others\n to be good, and influence their minds,\n so that, to a certain extent, their psy\u00ac\n cho-physiological system may be benefit\u00ac\n ed, but in the case of a broken leg\u2014\n why, to expect to mend that by\n psychic power, is simply defying the\n natural laws of the Supreme Being.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n While Boston and Brooklyn are\n daily learning of this remarkable re-\n ligio-scieutitic movement, the sub\u00ac\n stance of the same belief is being ex\u00ac\n pounded in Chicago by the conservative\n Bishop Samuel Fallows of the Re\u00ac\n formed Episcopal Church of that city.\n He designates his new cult as Chris\u00ac\n tian Psychology, and his Cures are\n based on the simplicity of faith, with\n the aid of science, in organic diseases,\n precisely the same manner that the\n cures of the Emmanuel Movement are\n made.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThis is no new nor sudden fancy\n of mine,\u201d said Bishop Fallows. \u201cFor\n twelve years I have been lecturing on\n physiological psychology at th? Bennet\n Epileptic College, and for the last\n three years I have been making a\n special study of the relations between\n mentality and disease. I have arrived\n at the conclusion that mentality, when\n based upon a trust in religion, is a\n powerful aid toward the cure of all |\n</p>\n<p>\n functional nervous disorders. I do not\n go so far as to say that all diseases\n may be cured by tneutal suggestion.\n Organic diseases, like cancer and\n typhoid fever, demand the services of\n a skillfui physician, but in every dis\u00ac\n ease the mental attitude of the patient\n has much to d^ with his condition,\n and in all those ttffoctions of the mind\n which might be classed as functional\n nervous disorders the mental attitude\n of the patient is the greatest single\n influence.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Perhaps this thought of Sir Oliver\n Lodge, principal of the University of\n Birmingham. England, may be well\n applied in conclusion;\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe idea of Redemption or Regen\u00ac\n eration, in its highest and most Chris\u00ac\n tian form, is applicable to both soul\n and body. The life of Christ shows\n us that the whole man can be regen\u00ac\n erated as he stands; that we have not\n to wait for a future state, that the\n Kingdom of Heaven is in our midst and\n may be assimilated by us here and\n now.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n On March IS. 1908. Dr. Frederic van\n Eeden of Holland gave an intensely\n interesting lecture under the auspices\n of tlie League for Political Education,\n at the Hudson Theater, Manhattan,\n on the theme. \u201cThe Cure of Disease by\n Psychic Methods.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. van Eeden studied under Drs.\n Lteboau of Nancy, and Bernheim of\n Paris, who wei\u2018e the first to import\n hypnotism into orthodox medicine. As\n this is so closely related to the subject\n under discussion it deserves some\n space.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI have treated hundreds of pa\u00ac\n tients,\u201d said the doctor, \u201cand I believe\n that something real goes from my\n hands to the body of the patient. 1\n believe this because I have seen en\u00ac\n tirely untrained persons accomplish\n more thau I by the application of the\n hands.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. van Eeden applied the psychic\n method by putting the patient to sleep\n and making suggestions by audible\n words in that state, after which he\n tried to lead the patient to do the\n same for himself. Faith on the part\n of the patient he did not find essential.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cDo not confide your body,\u201d he said,\n \u201cto any but a scientific and trust\u00ac\n worthy person. This power should be\n exercised only by reputable physicians.\n J* has dangers which cannot bo ig\u00ac\n nored and of which I know only too\n much.\u201d He severely criticised Chris\u00ac\n tian Scientists and faith healers.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBut a mother can use suggestion\n with her children with perfect safety.\n If a child is restless or in pain much\n good may be done by suggestion when\n it is asleep or partly asleep. She\n should put her hand on its head and\n say: \u2018Now you don\u2019t feel any pain.\n Be quiet and sleep.\u2019 On the other [\n</p>\n<p>\n hand, if she says to the child two or\n three times a day. \u2018I ' m afraid you\n don ' t feel well/ it will in many cases\n begin to feel ill. Most children\u2014from\n 80 to 90 per cent\u2014are open to sug\u00ac\n gestion. You can make them any\u00ac\n thing you like by suggestion.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. van Eeden gave numerous in\u00ac\n stances of disease cured as if by\n miracle. One was that of Edward Ir\u00ac\n ving. the Scotch clergyman, who, go\u00ac\n ing into a cholera stricken town, was\n apparently stricken at the door of the\n church with cholera. He felt and\n showed all the symptoms, but, being\n determined to preach, he entered the\n church and did so. and came out\n cured. Of the Lourdes miracles Dr.\n van Eeden said:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI believe them. Not only nervous\n diseases, but real physical ones, have\n been cured there, eveu to open wounds,\n which healed over in a few hours.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHow this is brought about 1 do\n not know, but we can be absolutely\n sure that the body consists of many\n things that are not perceived by the\n senses. The body is not the only\n thing that forms the human entity.\n The things we call mind and soul far\n exceed the things we call body, and\n these things ha^e influence cm the\n body. \"\n</p>\n<p>\n How ' his influence is brought to\n bear in ilie cure of disease Dr. van\n Eeden does not know Mesmer be\u00ac\n lieved that there was a fluid stream\u00ac\n ing from his hands. This view has\n been given up by most scientific men,\n but not by Dr. van Eeden.

We are all of us children still,\n swayed by the nearest motive rather than\n by one more remote. And the body looks\n so much bigger and more important to\n the majority of mortals, than does the\n spirit that spiritual appeal falls on deaf\n ears. The church must present a motive\n as strong and interesting as does the\n world, with its appeals of pleasure, of\n wealth, of sense gratification. Its oppor \u00ac\n tunity is in the assurance of health, pres\u00ac\n ent. temporal, bodily health. That\n strikes hard. It awakens his interest and\n his response. Yes. but he must become\n whole in spirit before he can become\n whole in body. That matters not. He\n will pay the price, and submit to the\n spiritualizing treatment if it bear- practi\u00ac\n cal, tangible fruitage in the abolishing\n of pain and achieve his bodily health.\n Cannot the church, then, meet the need\n of the hour and possess a more substan\u00ac\n tial content and meaning for the man of\n the world?\n</p>\n<p>\n Then possibly the inaugurators of this\n precious movement observed that Chris\u00ac\n tian Science had drawn its constituency\n by tens of thousands largely from the\n very people the already established\n churches with their prescriptions for\n death and the life beyond it could not\n reach, and also from these churches\u2019\n very membership, and that, too. on a\n single issue, and a temporal issue at\n that\u2014the cure of the body. They must\n have notficed. as have we all. that people\n who for years thundered zealously\n against evil and its judgments, step com\u00ac\n placently over into a. communion that\n claims there is no evil nor judgment,\n that they are errors of mortal mind.\n And why this going back on all former\n convictions, all traditional teaching con\u00ac\n cerning the faith once delivered the\n saints? Because they or their friends\n have been; healed of bodily infirmity. The\n question, therefore, must, have arisen,\n cannot the churches of established repu\u00ac\n tation and high standing in public\n esteem, of Christian integrity and mis\u00ac\n sionary aggressiveness, and acknowledged\n spiritual power incorporate this feature\n of applying the Gospel of the Son of God\n to the restoration of physical health?\n</p>\n<p>\n Whether consciously actuated by these\n motives or not they made the announce\u00ac\n ment that they would be at the service\n of any in the parish on Wednesday even\u00ac\n ings to talk over the possibility of mak\u00ac\n ing the whole man whole. They ex\u00ac\n pected thirty or forty to rt ,nd. To\n their surprise two hundred and forty at\u00ac\n tended the first conference. They were\n soon crowded out of their vestry into the\n auditorium of the church and now from\n five hundred to a thousand people from\n everywhere gather to hear the simple\n story of the Gospel that can make over\n the entire man. In these conferences\n the causes of disease are expounded,\n arousement of the dormant psychic\n nature of the sick person , is emphasized,\n the remedial forces of God\u2019s good universe\n are announced. Christ\u2019s cures of num\u00ac\n berless bodily ills are proclaimed, His\n healing power for our present maladies\n invoked, a spiritual atmosphere created.\n The troubled, nervous listener experi\u00ac\n ences the rest and peace to which he was\n</p>\n<p>\n before a stranger, and which he never\n dreamed of finding.\n</p>\n<p>\n But such is only the outline of the\n movement in the large. It is in the in\u00ac\n dividual work that the real test is made.\n These noble men give themselves untir\u00ac\n ingly to the individually demanding their\n help. The morning hours of each day.\n and the evening hours, too, are given up.\n a half hour to each person who would be\n made whole. Organic diseases are not\n treated: these are handed over to the\n skilled physician as \u2022 lying outside of\n their field. The scientific methods of\n medical and surgical practitioner are re\u00ac\n spected. Only those having functional\n disorders of the nervous system are re\u00ac\n ceived. Only those whose maladies have\n sprung primarily from deranged mental,\n moral and spiritual conditions are\n treated. Only those, I say. and yet their\n name is indeed legion. Dr. McComb\n quotes a prominent nerve specialist as\n stating that a generation ago there were\n 50,000 cases of nervous weakness of one\n form or another in the United States,\n and then asserts that now the number\n has increased to 250,000, due to such pre\u00ac\n vailing causes as the breakdown of re\u00ac\n ligious faith, the growing artificiality of\n our social system. the mad rush for\n wealth, mental idleness and frivolity,\n use of stimulants and narcotics, lack of\n self-control from overwork or culpable\n self-indulgenc e, all of which produce a\n neurotic and disordered system. Hence\n the formidable list of psychic ailments,\n Dr. McComb continues, to which our\n American humanity is prone. There is\n hysteria, which manifests itself in exag\u00ac\n gerated emotional displays, such as in\u00ac\n tense craving for sympathy or admiration\n or in unconscious simulation of various\n diseases, the fruit, of an ill-balanced\n though by no means organically diseased\n brain; hypochondria, or the fixed but\n groundless belief that a person is suf\u00ac\n fering from some particular disease;\n neurasthenia, which covers a vast va\u00ac\n riety of nerve weaknesses from mild de\u00ac\n pression to extreme prostration; psychas-\n thenia, in which the patient has a sense\n of incompleteness, or of the strangeness\n of things in general, and is the subject\n of abnormal fears and all kinds of im-\n practicalities; alcoholism, morphinism,\n cocainism, and drug addictions which\n end in intellectual and moral degenera\u00ac\n tion; insomnia, one of the terrible curses\n of modern life, and an aggravating factor\n in many diseases; religious melancholy,\n in which the sufferer imagines himself\n to have committed the unpardonable.sin\n and that God has abandoned him; fits\n of anger, of hate, of groundless suspi\u00ac\n cion which the subject is powerless to\n conquer, and finally suicidal impulses\n springing sometimes from deep depres\u00ac\n sion, sometimes from utter disgust of\n life, sometimes from a sense of shame\n and despair.\n</p>\n<p>\n The question is if the church shall\n stand by dumb, disinterested and help\u00ac\n less in the midst of suffering as real\n and Intense as that produced by physi\u00ac\n cal causes while men and women are\n crying out for release from bondage.\n</p>\n<p>\n How shall the church proceed? It\n first of all calls in a physician and thus\n establishes for the first time a sympa\u00ac\n thetic and working unity between sci\u00ac\n ence and religion. Only such cases are\n taken in hand as the physician diagnoses\n</p>\n<p>\n have a mental and moral cause and can\n be cured by mental and spiritual meth\u00ac\n ods. The first method of cure is \u201ccon\u00ac\n fession,\u201d wherein the patient unburdens\n himself of his worries, confesses his fol\u00ac\n lies and indulgences that go back for\n years, perhaps, holding him in chains,\n and binding him to his present diseased\n condition. Dr. Worcester claims there\n is large benefit to the sufferer in thi3\n opportunity to free his miud to a sym\u00ac\n pathetic listener. It also opens avenues\n for insight into the nature of the per\u00ac\n son\u2019s malady. ' so that, curative sugges\u00ac\n tion can be the easier applied. We all\n know the- value of a heart to heart talk\n with some one who can enter into our\n grief sympathetically. It relaxes and\n rests us. The old restrictions become\n unloosed. We experience a sense of free\u00ac\n dom and ease. And if the person to\n whom we confide the secret of our dis\u00ac\n content has the ability to help us out\n of our misery, our very confidence in\n him has curative force.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Worcester also seas in this feat\u00ac\n ure an improvement upon the former\n plan of . pastoral visitation and parish\n wrnrk. Instead of the minister going the\n rounds of perfunctory visitation, often\n finding the parishioner not in. or en\u00ac\n gaged in otner things, and if visible\n in no frame of mind to talk upon the\n deep things of life, the parishioner now\n calls on him. if there be a crying need\n to be satisfied. All ministers know how\n vast the difference between seeking a\n person and striving for an opening to\n get at his difficulty to apply a remedy,\n and the being sought for by that person\n that religious aid be had.\n</p>\n<p>\n What may be termed a second method\n of remedy is the imparting of religious\n faith. To all persons whose personali\u00ac\n ties are submerged in immorality, unbe\u00ac\n lief or the cold empty realizations of\n the senses, and are therefore depressed\n and inert, comes the message of hope\n and faith in God. He is proclaimed as\n a present, nearby strength, ready to\n put his infinite power under that life if\n the person will ask His help. Christ\n is represented as the giver of rest and\n peace. The afflicted soul receives the\n hopefulnesa offered and for the first\n time is able to rest and sleep In the new\n assurance that all is well.\n</p>\n<p>\n Perhaps a third method of remedy Is\n in remoralizing the life. The emotions\n have very apparent and violent influ\u00ac\n ence upon the nervous system and the\n digestive organs, and the action of the\n heart. If the emotions of fear and wor\u00ac\n ry fill the life, physical derangement\n results inevitably. If love and joy and\n peace pervade the soul the entire body\n responds to these health restorers and\n a normal state of our functional life\n results.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then .there is \" suggestion\u201d as another\n remedial agency. The patient is put\n into a quiescent state. The will relaxes\n its striving, mind and body sink down\n into rest. Complete surrender of the\n individual to the universal life is real\u00ac\n ized. The depths of the subconscious\n self are laid bare and into these depths\n where evil habit is rooted are put sug\u00ac\n gestions of health and strength and vic\u00ac\n tory. The patient is made to feel this\n impartation of the stronger, purer self\n of the healer, even of the incoming of\n the Great Physician\u2019s help, and grad\u00ac\n ually the old evil habits are replaced\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0011/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 184, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0011/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 368, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 559}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0011/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 736, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1119}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0011/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2238}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0011/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2944, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4476}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0011/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/em/ma/nu/el/mo/ve/me/nt/00/un/se/emmanuelmovement00unse/emmanuelmovement00unse_0011.jp2", "height": 4476, "width": 2944, "levels": 6, "size": 933151}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"11\">\n<p>\n THE EMMANUEL MOVEMENT,\n</p>\n<p>\n 9\n</p>\n<p>\n as consciousness draws upon these\n strong, true suggestions implanted in the\n depths below.

And these signs shall\n follow them that believe. In my name they\n shall cast out devils; they shall speak with\n new tongues; they shall lay hands on the sick\n and they shall recover.\u2014Matthew 1:23.\n</p>\n<p>\n How strangely this latter Scripturo\n falls upon our ears! Obsolete sentences\n indeed to ring out from the modern pul\u00ac\n pit! The mention of them is a long\n swing back into the past that we were\n content to leave burled beyond recall. In\n our culture, our science, our rationaliz\u00ac\n ing of Scripture we thought of these\n signs, if we thought of them at all, as\n dim and distant signposts that could\n serve no nobler purpose than to indi\u00ac\n cate how far we have progressed in\n the march of truth. Since the days\n of the apostles they have had no repre\u00ac\n sentation except in some insignificant\n aenemic Christian sect or other which,\n to be apostolic, has sacrificed forever the\n possibility of becoming popular. They\n are, however, the words of the world\u2019s\n Redeemer. And thrice blessed any\n movement that calls them from the tomb\n of*human neglect to enthrone them once\n more midway, if not in the forefront, of\n our faith.\n</p>\n<p>\n The new Christian movement under\n whose impulse we are congregated to\u00ac\n night dares strike hands with the Mas\u00ac\n ter of men, as St. Matthew and St. Mark\n represent Him, and believe that because\n God is with us we can cast out devils,\n epeak with new tongues, heal the sick.\n</p>\n<p>\n I regard it providential that this move\u00ac\n ment that is to restore to the church\n the curative powers Jesus assured His\n followers they should possess was born\n in a church called Emmanuel. It is\n strikingly significant, inasmuch as \u201cGod\n with us\u201d is the inspiration of the under\u00ac\n taking. \u201cWilt thou be made whole?\u201d as\n we said last Sabbath, is its inspiration\n upon its manward side; its incentive,\n its purpose, its field of expression and\n usefulness. \u201cGod with us\u201d is its inspi\u00ac\n ration on its Godward side, its dynamic,\n its all-necessary encouragement. Friend\u00ac\n ly to such Christian ideals, it dares use\n all health restoring aids, the contribu\u00ac\n tions of psychology, medicine, mental\n</p>\n<p>\n suggestion, Christian Science, faith cure,\n new thought and old, appropriating their\n strength, discarding their weakness.\n They all have large modicums of truth\n as well as considerable mixtures of er\u00ac\n ror. The Emmanuel Movement will ex\u00ac\n tract the grain, discard the chaff, and un\u00ac\n der the leadership of Christ be strong\n enough to empower the church for the\n complete subjugation of the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n This remarkable movement has no ir\u00ac\n rationality about it that has yet been\n detected, though scrutinized and tested\n by the keenest minds of the day. Such\n a famed psychologist as Professor James\n of Harvard gives his approval, stating it\n is time psychology did something. Dr.\n Barker, the eminent neurologist of Johns\n Hopkins University, journeyed to Boston\n to investigate and returned to Balti\u00ac\n more convinced of its worth, because in\n harmony with his methods. Dr. Put\u00ac\n nam, than whom there is, perhaps, no\n more skilled specialist on nervous dis\u00ac\n orders, has sent numbers of patients to\n the Emmanuel clinic. Dr. Richard C.\n Cabot of the Massachusetts General\n Hospital goes on record as saying: \u201cI\n have examined the complete records of\n every case handled by Dr. Worcester and\n his associates and can say they have ac\u00ac\n complished a great deal of good and no\n harm whatever.\u201d I sajd to Dr. McComb,\n I came as a sympathetic investigator and\n not to criticise. His humble reply was,\n \u2018We welcome criticism. We invite every\n possible scientific and religous test. We\n have no desire to carry on this work\n an hour longer than its legitimacy and\n worth will warrant.\u201d Both patients and\n critics have probed to the depths of the\n movement to find rational or moral or\n religious inconsistencies and failed to\n detect a single flaw. They have recog\u00ac\n nized the bronze head and iron loins of\n the giant, but thought that, like many\n another health Colossus, his feet might\n be of clay, but found his feet no weaker\n than loins and brow.\n</p>\n<p>\n Their manuals of reference are the vo\u00ac\n luminous writings of all the great authors\n in psychology. I asked Dr. Worcester\n what medical writers he followed for au\u00ac\n thority and sanction. He put iu my\n hand Dr. Paul Dubois\u2019 \u201cPsychic Treat\u00ac\n ment of Nervous Disorders,\u201d professor of\n neuropathology in the University of\n Berne, and Dr. Schofield\u2019s illuminating\n work of the British Medical Society on\n \u201cThe Mental Factor in Medicine.\u201d These\n and the New Testament, without a key\n to the Scriptures on science and health,\n are some of their handbooks. No won\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n der their work is distinctively scientific\n and assuredly Christian. It could be\n called \u201cscientific Christianity\u201d\u2014and well\n named \u2014 were not Dr. Worcester more\n humble than presumptuous. With all its\n scholarly backing and scientific precision\n and religious consistency, it steps forth\n open-handed and loving-hearted to bless\n humanity, without charge or sensational\n craving for recognition, under the modest\n caption, \u201cThe Emmanuel Movement\u201d *\u2014\n the \u201cGod-with-us\u201d cure for human ills.\n And the reason it has made so strong an\n appeal upon Episcopalian and Baptist,\n Roman Catholic and Jew. is because\n there is nothing in it that antagonizes\n their denominational and religious con\u00ac\n victions, or ravages their intellectual in\u00ac\n tegrity. The simple, precious doctrine of\n God with us is a platform on which all\n men can unite, and it suggests a powep\n that all men crave.\n</p>\n<p>\n You remember the despairing sentence\n the dying infidel wrote with his emaci\u00ac\n ated hand upon the wall over his bed,\n \u201cGod is nowhere.\u201d And he fixed his\n glazed eyes upon it as if to sanction his\n hopelessness. But his little daughter, just\n back from Sunday school, ran in to kiss\n her dying father on that gloomy after\u00ac\n noon, and read aloud the poor, scrawled,\n run-together words, exclaiming as she\n read, \u201cGod is now here!\u201d \u201cO papa, God\n is now here!\u201d It startled him, and his\n own hand had written it. \u201cIf you say\n so, Nellie, it may be true.\u201d That child\u00ac\n ish heart, filled with the consciousness\n of God\u2019s presence, could not read it\n otherwise.\n</p>\n<p>\n Therein is the power of the Emmanuel\n Movement through which men arc made\n whole. With all its correctness of defini\u00ac\n tion, its scientific conception and expres\u00ac\n sion, its splendid psychology, its consis\u00ac\n tent rationality, it is in both its first and\n last analysis Emmanuel, the name of Je\u00ac\n sus, God with us, God now hero.\n</p>\n<p>\n Better still, it claims that God has been\n here all the while, for a few hundred\n centuries or more, and has always been a\n positive health-giving power, ready to\n impart His curative Almightiness to\n every poor depressed, abnormal mortal\n that would let the divine sunshine in to\n flood the chambers of the soul and to\n cleanse every sin-cursed, demon-ridden\n body into a temple pure and beautiful\n enough for Himself to dwell in.\n</p>\n<p>\n Yes, it means back to Christ. But it\n also means to bring Christ forward into\n our feverish, fretful modern life.

Compel\n your Christianity to walk on two feet;\n clip its wings. It came down to earth\n quite a long time ago; keep it down.\n Make it tread through the dirt and dust\n of your streets, and all the restricted,\n unattractive abodes of men, irradiating\n their experiences and leaving a trail of\n sunshine everywhere.\n</p>\n<p>\n Tolstoi hit it right when he said the\n eause of all our ills is that men have lost\n their sense of God. That is why we rush\n at our brother\u2019s throat; that is why we\n struggle, and compete, and claw, and\n cheat, and lose our life more and more\n with every futile attempt to save it. Yes,\n and that is the cause of our sorrows, our\n sicknesses and our despair; we have\n refused to believe that God was with us\n and that we were spirits as infinite as is\n He; and that because spirit with spirit\n may meet, the very joy of heaven was at\n our door waiting to be brought up into\n our consciousness and made the working\n principle of existence. As Jesus said,\n \u201cThe kingdom of heaven is within you.\u201d\n The declaration is not weakened through\n the more accurate translation. \u201cThe king\u00ac\n dom of heaven is in your midst.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This movement is strikingly in accord\n with present-day scientific discovery and\n realization. Into what deep realms of\n subconsciousness have discoverer and in\u00ac\n ventor dug to bring up into their con\u00ac\n sciousness and ours electricity\u2019s wonder\u00ac\n ful displays. If their reliance upon mate\u00ac\n rial and mechanical agencies to send\n thoughts and words through telegraph\n and telephone were startling, the sending\n of thoughts and words through the wire\u00ac\n less air are more so a hundredfold. Mar\u00ac\n coni will yet circle the globe with his\n thought propulsions. Edison assures us\n that a lone man will in the great Sahara\n or in the jungles soon be able to take a\n little instrument from his pocket and\n talk with his fellows everywhere. Why?\n Because God is with us. The world of\n spirit is more accurately and powerfully\n communicative than all the mechanical\n contrivances of earth.\n</p>\n<p>\n So is this Emmanuel Movement vastly\n more significant than the patient, plodd\u00ac\n ing, remedial work of two earnest church\u00ac\n men in staid old Boston. Already it has\n more than the stamp of their genius\n upon it. The subconsciousness of the hu\u00ac\n man realm is of much more infinite sig\u00ac\n nificance than they have probed. God\n is with us, and the movement may well\n be said to be in its infancy. No human\n eye is sufficiently prophetic to see the\n glorious end.\n</p>\n<p>\n See, however, what it has* done already.\n It bridges the gulf between the finite and\n the Infinite, between eternity and time.\n Yes, I know, Christ did it centuries ago,\n but we haven\u2019t lived as though we\n thought so. Our churches have been\n builded upon that bridge. But more to\n carry us over and up than to bring God\n over and down. That is why our faith\n is three parts theory and one part fact.\n That is why the w ' orld, the flesh and the\n devil have had more allurement for men\n than the truth of God. I have forty let\u00ac\n ters upon my desk, more than half of\n which offer as introduction to my\n sympathies the statement that the waiter\n was brought up a Christian, but alas, not\n such now; that the applicant for cure of\n ills was once a church attendant, but\n alas, not that now. Neither church nor\n</p>\n<p>\n ministry is blamed. They got all that\n was to be had; Christian ideals, splendid\n doctrines, the location of Jerusalem and\n the Dead Sea. abstractions on the\n \u201cblessed Trinity, \" well worked over the\u00ac\n ology. old or new. what matter w ' hich,\n and some help doubtless more than they\n realize. They didn ' t expect much, and\n their expectations were met. But the\n pity of it, the world was stronger than\n the church, and there they are, battered,\n diseased hulks, knocking piteously at the\n doors of the church for help. In God\u2019s\n name give. For Christ\u2019s sake help. You\n are my last resort. Save me or I die.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thank God the cry is not in vain. Had\n we not a positive present remedy to\n offer, the agony of that cry would break\n our hearts. Here is one:\n</p>\n<p>\n I have an almost uncontrollable\n desire to commit suicide, and\n would have done so last Saturday\n night, only I had no means at\n hand of doing it. To-day I am\n feeling better, but do not know\n when the desire may return. I\n am a widower, 39 years old. One\n reason I write you is because I\n am supposed to be a Baptist but\n do not attend any church now. I\n am a Southerner. Please keep this\n letter confidential; it is intended\n for no other eye but yours.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here is another:\n</p>\n<p>\n Several years ago I had a\n severe sunstroke which so shat\u00ac\n tered my nervous system that I\n have never recovered my former\n health, though I have spent a for\u00ac\n tune endeavoring to do so. I am\n in business, but unable to meet\n my expenses, and with creditors\n pressing me. With bankruptcy\n staring me in the face and a de\u00ac\n plorable mental condition I have\n grave fears that I will lose my\n reason and do some desperate act.\n</p>\n<p>\n It appears to me that I haven\u2019t a\n friend on earth. O sir, help me\n to escape from this terrible bond\u00ac\n age of melancholia and thus con\u00ac\n fer an everlasting favor upon me\n and God will surely bless you for\n doing so. Earnestly praying you\n will consider my unfortunate cir\u00ac\n cumstances and heed my appeal,\n etc.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here is a third, every word of which\n you must bear with me while I read:\n</p>\n<p>\n Seeing an article \u2022 describing\n your desire to treat certain dis\u00ac\n eases, alcoholism being one of\n them, with mental suggestion and\n by surrounding the patient with\n uplifting thoughts, \u2022 I have taken\n the liberty of writing you re\u00ac\n garding the drug habit, asking\n your help for myself and friend\n as a last resort. We are both\n young men, twenty-two years old,\n and are addicted to the use of\n morphine. If you could help us\n you would earn our everlasting\n gratitude and affection. It may\n seem forward and bold to have a\n total stranger write to you, but\n if you could only know the tor\u00ac\n ture and suffering that one ad\u00ac\n dicted to this debasing habit goes\n through you would not wonder at\n my boldness in writing you. It\n</p>\n<p>\n is as a drowning man grasping at\n a straw. If you could see your\n way clear to help us we would\n never be able to repay the obliga\u00ac\n tion, etc.\n</p>\n<p>\n And what of him who writes his wife\n is in a sanitarium with religious de\u00ac\n mentia. brought on through the loss of\n \u201cour little home through a building and\n loan association. And, oh sir. our little\n girl of three years cries so bitterly, and\n calls so loudly for her mother. Take pity\n on a sorrowing husband and father.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n We call this a movement for the heal\u00ac\n ing of the body. It could be more ap\u00ac\n propriately called a movement for the\n uplifting of the soul unto its divine and\n infinite possibilities of power to live in\n a clean, newly furnished house, with all\n modern improvements; yes, and ancient\n improvements, too. and where the man\n can enjoy all the comforts of home It\n is simply a movement to help the\n church embrace a hitherto neglected field\n of usefulness: a divine call for the\n church to assure men that God is with us\n for the cure of the body, as well as for\n the cure of the soul. To tell men that,\n however hard their circumstances with\u00ac\n out and their evil habits within, they can\n become absolute masters of their fate.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then how splendidly it makes for that\n Christian unity the Master had in mind\n when He said: \" That they may all be\n one. Father, as I am in thee and thou in\n me.\u201d God with us, always makes for\n unity. No movement or church called\n Emmanuel has a right to be altogether\n and forever sectarian. Its field is in the\n open. Its sphere of usefulness i3 every\u00ac\n where this side the stars. Ask the dear\n man who feels called to safeguard his\n creed and the precious dogmas of the\n denomination to yield a point upon a sin\u00ac\n gle doctrinal question, though that tradi\u00ac\n tional statement for vital righteousness\n is straw and stubble, and he imagines\n himself a Luther, exclaiming: \u201cI cannot;\n truly I cannot. Here I stand, God helping\n me, I can do no other.\u201d But put a new\n love into his heart for humanity, impart\n an enthusiasm for a great righteous\n cause, and in spite of himself he be\u00ac\n comes. in sympathy at least, a member\n of the church universal, and God\u2019s an\u00a7els\n pass in and out. perhaps for the first\n time, across the threshold of his life.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then how needed is some such awaken\u00ac\n ing to revitalize the church. It is be\u00ac\n coming the popular thing to give up the\n midweek devotional meeting for testi\u00ac\n mony praise and prayer. Presbyterian,\n Congregationalist, Baptist are following\n each year more and more this popular\n trend. If the meeting be continued it\n is quite a formal thing. A few hymns\n sung, often at a poor, dying rate, a\n chapter of Scripture, a prayer or two and\n a ministerial address. Such is not uni\u00ac\n versal. There are multitudinous excep\u00ac\n tions to this Dead March in Saul pro\u00ac\n cedure. But it is prevalent. But I\n notice the church in Boston where this\n movement was inaugurated has a\n devotional service for the first time in\n its history, and for a year or more each\n week ministers devotionally to between\n 500 and S00 souls. Then I have ob\u00ac\n served both in Boston and New York that\n the Christian Science churches congregate\n in a single church larger numbers still\n each Wednesday night to praise God and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0013/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 184, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0013/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 368, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 559}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0013/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 736, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1119}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0013/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2238}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0013/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2944, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4476}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0013/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/em/ma/nu/el/mo/ve/me/nt/00/un/se/emmanuelmovement00unse/emmanuelmovement00unse_0013.jp2", "height": 4476, "width": 2944, "levels": 6, "size": 883151}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"13\">\n<p>\n THE EMMANUEL ' MOVEMENT,\n</p>\n<p>\n If 1\n</p>\n<p>\n Vi,\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2014\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mother Eddy for their deliverance from\n the errors of mortal mind.\n</p>\n<p>\n Saying all this is not meant to imply\n that the churches of our faith are not do\u00ac\n ing much splendid work for God and man.\n They are. Without them the kingdom\n could not have become the realistic fact\n it is. Only eternity will be opportunity\n enough to reveal the far-reaching extent\n of their faith and good works. They are\n the lights set on a hill, that have illum\u00ac\n ined the dark places of the earth, dis\u00ac\n sipated death\u2019s gloom, and guided count\u00ac\n less multitudes into a joyful eternity.\n They are the salt that hath by no means\n lost its savor to make life pure, trans\u00ac\n form character, reorganize society. All\n we require further is that they send their\n illuminating, preserving power into the\n whole man to make him whole. All we\n demand is that they incorporate the \u201cGod\n with us\u2019\u2019 doctrine unto the casting out of |\n</p>\n<p>\n demons; the demons of deranged per\u00ac\n sonality, of neurotic and disordered tem\u00ac\n perament, of miserable foreboding that\n drives out sleep and peace, tying up the\n man in a body with innumerable diseases\n and through which no health producing\n spirit flows.\n</p>\n<p>\n And how shall these diseases be cured?\n By laying hands on the sick is the scrip\u00ac\n tural advice, hands of faith, of prayer, of\n health-producing thought, of spiritual\n power. Physical contact is but one of the\n many mediums of approach and helpless\n if there be no spiritual power behind.\n The world was a very small, contracted,\n hand to hand place in those old apos\u00ac\n tolic days. The enlargements of God\n have come in. Expansions incredible un\u00ac\n til they appeared have arrived. Neither\n remedial thought nor healing spirit\n need fleshly touch to conduct them\n to their desired end. God is with us in\n</p>\n<p>\n greater power than fn the Galilean days.\n Mechanicalism, naturalism recede as the\n flood tides of spirit rise, as did John the\n Baptist in the presence of the Christ.\n Repentance is good; but grace and timth\n are better. Wires and hands useful, at\n certain stages of development indispensa\u00ac\n ble; but the wireless atmosphere and the\n spirit\u2019s touch are more intelligent and\n more universal means of communication.\n</p>\n<p>\n To say all this is to affirm that crea\u00ac\n tion waits upon recreation; the first\n birth upon the second; sense perception\n upon faith, sight upon insight, nature\n upon spirit.

They shall run and not he\n weary. They shall walk and not faint.\u2014Isaiah\n xi :2\n</p>\n<p>\n In this discussion of Christian Science\n in contrast with the Emmanuel Move\u00ac\n ment. I will impose upon myself two\n limitations. First, I will not speak upon\n its metaphysical, its theoretical side. I\n presume the reason critics give it such\n Inhospitable treatment is because its\n metaphysics seems preposterously wrong\n according to all rational, psychological\n and theological standards, as to the na\u00ac\n ture of God, man, nature, and the world.\n It is its practical side that interests me\n most, altogether, in fact, so far as our\n meditation to-night is concerned.\n</p>\n<p>\n The second limitation is that I ap\u00ac\n proach Christian Science as an investiga\u00ac\n tor. I cannot be as sympathetic, there\u00ac\n fore, as the disciples of Christian Sci\u00ac\n ence present to-night would desire, for\n mine is an outside view, rather than an\n inside revelation. Were I on the inside\n of the supposed charmed sphere, my ap\u00ac\n proach would not be a questioning one.\n But being an outsider, you must expect\n this questioning attitude, and be pre\u00ac\n pared for all it implies. You may be dis\u00ac\n appointed then, but you will not be\n grieved, for you have no right to ex\u00ac\n pect compliance with your teachings, or\n support of your organization.\n</p>\n<p>\n The other class of persons present will\n also be disappointed because I am not\n more critical in scrutiny, and do not\n</p>\n<p>\n make sweeping denunciation. It i$ a na\u00ac\n tive trait to be intolerant. Tolerance is\n an acquired virtue, fruitage of a bal\u00ac\n anced mind, a just disposition, a loving\n heart, or a genial spirit. Sometimes the\n more tenaciously we hold a doctrine the\n more distinctively critical are we of all\n outside of it. Such persons cannot bear\n to hear a seemingly contrary truth men\u00ac\n tioned except to denounce it. All such\n need to learn a fundamental fact, name\u00ac\n ly, that there are more things in heaven\n and earth than those dreamed of in their\n philosophy. Truth is such a big thing,\n while all approaches to it are such little\n introductory avenues. I, for one, cannot\n approach so serious a question in the\n spirit of destructive criticism. It is al\u00ac\n ways easier to destroy than to create.\n More damage can be done in an hour by\n a tearer-down than can be repaired in\n a year by one who would build up. Then,\n again, you are disarmed in getting at\n facts. I cannot wield such a sledge ham\u00ac\n mer weapon. I am too anxious to get\n at the other fellow\u2019s viewpoint. Believe\n me, therefore, to be an impartial inves\u00ac\n tigator. and though you do not agree with\n my conclusions, you will respect my fair\u00ac\n ness.\n</p>\n<p>\n A body of people who pick up a truth\n the Christian church drops, and push it\n fearlessly and helpfully, have a right to\n receive both fairness and tolerance of\n treatment. That truth is that there is\n divine power in the universe that can be\n applied to diseased bodies with remedial\n and curative effect. I thank Christian\n Science for that truth. And I thank all\n others who have in less prominent ways\n wielded it. It is not original with Chris-\n ! tian Science, except in the form under\n I which it is presented. Both Roman\n i Catholics and Protestant churches have\n</p>\n<p>\n applied that remedial truth through th\u00ae\n centuries. And there was once a Galilean\n who was quite an adept, at that sor\u00a3 of\n thing. But it had not before been made\n a separate issue, and raised to supreme\n place, and builded into an institution.\n</p>\n<p>\n But you exclaim, how can God bless\n with curative power lives whose stand\u00ac\n ards are irrational, definitions incorrect,\n methods unscientific and absurd? Why\n not, pray? Out of the heart are the\n issues of life. It. is not what sloughs off\n from the top of a man\u2019s head that counts.\n With God the primary thing is human\n need, not what the needy one thinks cos-\n mologically, astronomically or theo\u00ac\n logically. It is not that God blesses\n erroneous mentality, but in spite of it.\n I suspect that by and by we will be\n quite shaken up to find out how little\n God cares aboiit viewpoints and intel\u00ac\n lectual attitudes and scientific ap\u00ac\n proaches. and theological treatises, and\n catechisms, and creeds. The truth of the\n matter is that God is so much more in\u00ac\n terested in us than we are in Him. even\n than we are in ourselves;-and that He\n is so exceedingly anxious to put His\n abundant eternal life into us that He is\n quick to take advantage of any little\n opening to send into the human spirit\n His exceeding largeness and uplift. I\n think Christ\u2019s comparison of faith to a\n grain of mustard seed has some such\n significance. Seeing all this is to realize\n that men are blessed of God, not because\n of what they know, but of -what they need.\n And that does not mean that the Om\u00ac\n niscient One puts a premium on ignorance\n either. Nor is it to affirm that Christian\n Science is right or wrong upon its in\u00ac\n tellectual side. It ' s a question whether\n rightness or wrongness applies to intel\u00ac\n lectuality anyway.

It has always\n Seemed to me that Christian Science was\n trying to play a symphony on one string,\n And succeeding. It\u2019s amazing how much\n music you can get out of one string. But\n I prefer at least four to my violin. And\n as for symphonies, an entire orchestra\n doesn\u2019t come in amiss. They get a good\n deal of melody out of the unique situa\u00ac\n tion, however\u2014beautiful, soul-soothing\n melody\u2014in which never a discord. But\n to me continuous melody gets monoto\u00ac\n nous after a while. I must say I \u2022 prefer\n harmony, with its varied tones, its mul\u00ac\n tiple chord formations, in which many a\n discord is but all blended, both evenly\n and symmetrically, with the many com\u00ac\n pounded parts. That comes nearer im\u00ac\n itating the music of the spheres.\n</p>\n<p>\n But there is this one point in common\n between Christian Science and the Em\u00ac\n manuel movement, that both desire to\n remedy bodily ills. But they no sooner\n join issue, than they disagree, and like\n some uncongenial husband and wife, sep\u00ac\n arate. The point of separation is the\n nature of curable and incurable malady.\n The Emmanuel Movement exclaims only\n \u201cfunctional disorders of the nervous sys\u00ac\n tem\u201d can enter our clinic. Christian\n Science exclaims \u201cfunctional and organic\n diseases, too,\u201d can have our cure. Here\n is where Christian Science shows splen\u00ac\n did, though not commendable daring.\n No disease under heaven feases it. Its\n daring is admirable. Its consciousness of\n power superb. Its presumption almost\n contagious, if not quite. I should say\n its consciousness of limitless power was\n its weak point. But wouldn\u2019t its con\u00ac\n sciousness of weakness be a weaker? It\n seems so, surely, even to its undoing.\n Therefore it pushes ahead with all as\u00ac\n surance, even though it, at times, fails\n to make good. It, however, works suc\u00ac\n cessfully enough times\u2014and they claim in\n the most hopeless kinds of organic dis\u00ac\n eases\u2014to justify existence. This only\n point of similarity then becomes the first\n point of difference.\n</p>\n<p>\n A second point of contrast is in their\n</p>\n<p>\n attitudes toward the powers that be.\n The Emmanuel Movement claims that\n the powers that be are ordained of God,\n with especial reference to medical and\n surgical powers. Christian Science\n claims that the powers that be are no\n powers at all. I admit to being old-\n fashioned enough to claim that physi\u00ac\n cians are among the greatest benefac\u00ac\n tors of humanity. President Eliot of\n Harvard goes me one better, exclaiming,\n \u201cthe very greatest.\u201d Christian Science\n would not even be polite enough to ,\n call them necessary nuisances in its firm j\n belief, against the intelligence of the\n ages, that they are both nuisances and\n unnecessary. But of what account is the\n intelligence of the ages, save to empha\u00ac\n size admirably the existence of the er\u00ac\n rors of mortal mind?\n</p>\n<p>\n Then Christian Science denies nature.\n The Emmanuel Movement doesn\u2019tneed to.\n Christian Science possibly is afraid that\n if it admits nature\u2019s existence, it may\n fall under its charm. The Emmanuel\n Movement does not have to deny nature\n either to get away from its charm or to\n dominate it. I presume, however, the\n Christian Scientist, like many other ideal\u00ac\n ists, enjoys idealization. I plead guilty\n to being something of an idealist myself.\n</p>\n<p>\n I have said more than once that time\n was nothing, tl ' t eternity was all; that\n time was only the one little segment\n of the infinite circle, revealed and adapted\n to us, while the other ninety-nine parts\n were hidden. Therefore an adaptation\n of eternity had no reality as other than\n eternal. But, alas, to us little-time mor\u00ac\n tals unto whom and for whom It has\n been adapted, it has reality! The changing\n seasons, the flying years emphasize it;\n while from an eternal standpoint it has\n none.\n</p>\n<p>\n You see it is the old philosophic con\u00ac\n ception that started way back in the\n Vedas and Upanishads of India; then\n passed over into Plato, then forward to\n Kant\u2014namely that the nominal world is\n all and the phenomenal world nothing\n But the phenomenal world has to be\n reckoned with. It does not evaporate\n readily enough to suit the practical man.\n So the practical man grapples with it in\u00ac\n stead of denying its existence. The Chris\u00ac\n tian Scientist constructs for himself\n rather a narrow world, and ethereal at\n that, where ascetic tendencies prevail.\n The Emmanuel Movement has not yet\n found the world too big to enlist its sym\u00ac\n pathies and be benefited by its power. A\n big, rich world all alive with possibilities\n for enlisting our human interest, and\n packed full of opportunties for human\n achievement and worth.\n</p>\n<p>\n Just another contrast: Christian Science\n claims the Scriptures to be a sealed book.\n</p>\n<p>\n a locked treasure house until it applies\n the key. The Emmanuel Movement claims\n the Scriptures are so open and simple\n and illuminating for all devotional pur\u00ac\n poses that human keys are more likely\n to turn the wrong way, and lock instead\n of open. Then there is that precious\n Lord\u2019s Prayer, We thought it sufficiently\n self-revealing as it fell from Jesus\u2019 lips.\n But it seems its language needs to bo\n improved; its clear, crisp, simple thought\n interpreted in other style and speech.\n</p>\n<p>\n And yet this text from Isaiah, one of\n the most beautiful, is very appropriate to\n the Christian Science faith. It waits\n upon the Lord and renews its strength,\n mounts as on wings of eagles. Its as-\n pirational side is to me delightful to con\u00ac\n template. It soars clear up into the sun\u00ac\n lit realm of the Divine Mind, as does the\n eagle into the eye of the sun. It basks\n in the light of God\u2019s face. No small\n achievement. Would that the staid old\n conservative churches of Christendom had\n such superb aspirational powers.\n</p>\n<p>\n Christian Science also runs and is not\n weary, walks and is not faint. It is in\n constant touch with its source of strength.\n But while the Emmanuel Movement is\n also aspirational, it may be said to be\n strongest upon its extensional side. This\n illustration may serve to show what I\n mean. A few months ago the founder of\n Christian Science was heralded as giving\n a million dollars to the poor. \" Splendid!\u201d\n cried the world. \u201cIt is at last making a\n disinterested contribution to humanity.\n Mrs. Eddy is at last going to yield up a\n million of her psychic gains to found a\n charity for the poor. Mrs. Eddy ' s name\n will become linked with such public bene\u00ac\n factors as Rockefeller, Carnegie and Mrs.\n Sage.\u201d But alas! for the poor indeed, but\n only of such of them as would study Chris\u00ac\n tian Science. That is what I mean by saying\n it is more aspirational than extensional?\n It runs out into the world to bend the\n world to itself. On the other hand, the\n Emmanuel Movement. which is the\n church at work, runs forth into the world\n to cure its ills with higher incentive than\n to bend it to itself, whatever denomina\u00ac\n tional name that self be known by.\n</p>\n<p>\n Christian Science may b e likened to a\n tree\u2014a tall, graceful palm. If you choose\n springing up out of the arid, sandy\n Plain of our social and commercial life.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is strikingly branchless, but has lux-\n urant foliage at the top, and under its\n kindly shade the wearied and sick find\n refreshment and rest. The Emmanuel\n Movement, on the other hand, has no in\u00ac\n dependence to boast of. It is simply a\n new shoot, carefully grafted into the\n grand old fruit-bearing denominational\n trees, to help them bear fruit so luscious\n and tempting that the world is eager to\n Pluck and eat for Its daily nourishment\n and life.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0015/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 184, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0015/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 368, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 559}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0015/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 736, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1119}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0015/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2238}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0015/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2944, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4476}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0015/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/em/ma/nu/el/mo/ve/me/nt/00/un/se/emmanuelmovement00unse/emmanuelmovement00unse_0015.jp2", "height": 4476, "width": 2944, "levels": 6, "size": 905028}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"15\">\n<p>\n THE EMMANUEL MOVEMENT.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13\n</p>\n<p>\n t \u00ab \u2022\u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n f cr,\n</p>\n<p>\n Emmanuel Movement an A J esus Christ\n</p>\n<p>\n Fourth of a series of sermons by\n Rev. Dr. Robert MacDonald, on\n the subject, \u201cHus the Church a\n Mission for the Cure of the Body,\u201d\n preached March S, in the Wash\u00ac\n ington Avenue Baptist Church,\n Brooklyn,\n</p>\n<p>\n TEXT\u2014The prayer of faith shall save the\n sick, and the Lord shall raise him up, and, if\n he have committed sins, they shall be forgiven.\n Confess your faults one to another, and pray\n one for another that ye may be healed. The\n efficient, fervent prayer of a righteous man\n avalletb much.\u2014James v:15 and 16.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is astonishing how much the Scrip\u00ac\n tures say of the cure of the body, all of\n which is hidden to the reader until he\n looks for it, else has his attention called\n thereto. These cures are like nuggets of\n gold and silver lying upon the surface,\n but unobserved to all passing that way\n with gaze fixed upon the sky. The syn\u00ac\n optic Gospels contain a revelation along\n this line, marvelous to behold. I ran\n through one of these, the Gospel of St.\n Matthew, and found hundreds of cases,\n all flashing intelligence into the mind in\n behalf of Christ ' s eagerness to make sick\n people well, like diamond points scintil\u00ac\n lating light.\n</p>\n<p>\n The features of this revelation were\n more astonishing than the revelation it\u00ac\n self. In few cases is the cure of the soul\n included by any statement made, existing\n therefore only in inference, the cure of\n the body being the primary and often the\n sole concern. Many are healed on an\u00ac\n other\u2019s faith, as in the case of the Cen\u00ac\n turion\u2019s servant the daughter of the\n Canaanitish woman, the man whose son\n was a lunatic and the man sick of the\n palsy. In only one case of these hun\u00ac\n dreds does the Master forgive sins first.\n When he sends out his twelve disciples\n His charge to them reads thus: He gave\n them power over unclean spirits to cast\n them out, to heal all manner of sick\u00ac\n nesses and all manner of diseases. And\n when He bids them preach that the king\u00ac\n dom of heaven is at hand He continues:\n Meal the sick, cleanse the lepers, cast\n out devils. When JnhD sends his mes\u00ac\n sengers from the prison to determine if\n he were the Messiah. He exclaims: Tell\n John what ye see and hear; the blind\n receive their sight, the lame walk, lepers\n are cleansed, the deaf hear, the poor have\n the Gospol preached to them. He thus\n puts the healing of the body in the very\n forefront of His ministry, and He bids\n His disciples put it in the very forefront\n of theirs, making it their first concern.\n He. moreover, shows such anxiety to ban\u00ac\n ish disease that He does not pause to\n require faith on the sufferer ' s part. Nor\n does He seem to transmit His healing\n power through a healthy mind and a\n cleansed soul. In many cases there is no\n</p>\n<p>\n way of telling how many He heals invol\u00ac\n untarily. In the case of the diseased\n woman the hem of His garment is\n touched. On another occasion we read,\n they brought all that were diseased that\n they might touch the hem of His gar\u00ac\n ment, and as many as touched were made\n whole.\n</p>\n<p>\n What Is the summing up of it all, if not\n that the tides of spiritual power were\n always coursing through Jesus, charging\n with healing force even His garments.\n</p>\n<p>\n After Christ\u2019s departure from the earth\n the cure of the body becomes incidental\n to the cure of souls. The disciples are\n so intent upon spreading the kingdom\n that they have more important things to\n atend to, in proclaiming Him the Son of\n God, His resurrection from the dead, the\n forgiveness of sins in His name, the es\u00ac\n tablishing of the Christian church. But\n the divine power for the cure of disease\n is still present. Peter heals the lame\n man at the gate of the temple. Later\n they bring their sick and lay them by\n the roadside that His shadow fall upon\n them. Then comes James into promi\u00ac\n nence, with his gospel of works. Of all\n men the practical one, simple, concise,\n epigrammatic, broad, humanitarian. \" Be\n ye a doer of the word,\u201d \u201cFaith without\n works is dead\u201d; \" Guard your tongue, it is\n a fire, a world of iniquity\u201d; \" Pure and\n undefiled religion is this, to visit the\n widows and the fatherless in their afflic\u00ac\n tion and to keep himself unspotted from\n the world.\u201d And yet he cannot close his\n epistle without exclaiming: \" Is there any\n sick among you, .call in the elders of the\n church, the prayer of faith shall save the\n sick, confess your faults, pray one for\n another, that ye may be healed. It looks\n as though this advice were given at the\n close of his epistle just because he is so\n broad and humanitarian.\n</p>\n<p>\n There can be no question but that our\n Lord intended the ministry of healing to\n continue and that it was ' a matter of\n grave importance to Him that it should.\n</p>\n<p>\n Why. then, has this ministry become\n a lost art? Because we are still ham\u00ac\n pered by medieval thought regarding the\n body. That thought is that the body *s\n the chief hindrance to the soul\u2019s progress.\n We know what the dark ages meant to\n th church. They came near killing it\n out. The corruptions of the age came in.\n The world and the sensuous realizations\n of the body overthrew spiritual zeal. The\n church\u2019s ideals fell Her standards trailed\n in the dust.. Her priesthood became\n licentious. Her bishops and archbishops,\n debauched. A righteous remnant came\n out and founded monastic orders. The\n monastery saved the church from disso\u00ac\n lution, and kept religion pure from\n worldly and sensuous taint. But at great\n cost. Asceticism ruled. Their concern\n</p>\n<p>\n was to save the \u2018 soul. The body is the\n great curse. In it all evil dwells. It pos\u00ac\n sesses no good. Therefore, crucify it..\n Beat it with stripes. Deny its demands.\n Starve out its strength. Fast and pray.\n Through poverty, starvation, scourging\n and all conceivable denial it must be\n kept under. It and the world were wholly\n bad. Get away from both and save the\n soul. It was a strenuous attempt to live\n the simple life.\n</p>\n<p>\n Their inspiration was taken, possibly,\n from Christ\u2019s words: \u201cIf thy hand offend\n thee, cut it off; if thine eye offend thee,\n pluck it out.\u201d For, said Jesus, it were\n better to enter into the eternal life\n maimed physically than to retain your\n physical completion and lose it. True.\n \u201cFor what is a man profited to gain the\n world and lose himself.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Then we know how perilous is reliance\n upon the gratification of the senses. Of\n course, life is restricted sadly when even\n one of these avenues of expression is\n blocked. The blind man, the deaf man\n are pitiful to behold. We thank God we\n have five unimpeded ways of approaching\n the world, five precious ways of receiving\n the beauty, the melody, the fragrance, the\n sweetness and the substance of nature.\n But poor, indeed, is he who has no soul\n faculty for seeing the sights on the other\n side the horizon. To be pitied, he who\n hears no music of the spheres. Of all\n men, miserable, if he has no suscepti\u00ac\n bility for God.\n</p>\n<p>\n So thought those medievals who through\n asceticism led aenemie lives in monastic\n cells. Therefore, it was a choice between\n bodily vigor and spirituality.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then there was another line\u2014a phil\u00ac\n osophic, along which the necessity for\n asceticism came in. Epicureanism is as\n prevalent to-day as it was 200 years ' be\u00ac\n fore Christ. Nothing is worth while but\n pleasure is its cry. \u201cLet us eat, drink\n and be merry: for to-day we live and to\u00ac\n morrow we die,\u201d is its inspiration. We,\n like all the followers of Epicurus have\n degenerated into desire for quantity and\n intensity of pleasure. Let life run riot.\n Let luxury, extravagance, sensuous en\u00ac\n joyment dissipation fill out the day. That\n is and was Epicureanism at its worst.\n Then sprang up Stoicism, and Zeno Sen\u00ac\n eca and Marcus Aurelius became the\n saviours of their day. Man must have\n no passions at all,\u201d \" Emotion is a di\u00ac\n sease and not to be tolerated for a mo\u00ac\n ment.\u201d Health of soul recognizes neither\n passsion nor emotion. Pleasure is transi\u00ac\n tory, tiresome, sickly; it hardly outlives\n the tasting of it. Seneca exclaims: \u201cI\n am seeking -what is good for man, ,not\n for his body.\u201d Rigor, austerity, a stolid\n smile i iSt light, up the face. No sor\u00ac\n row must thrust, its gloom into the\n heart. Perpetual calm became its feast./\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0016/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 188, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 278}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0016/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 376, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 557}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0016/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 752, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1115}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0016/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1504, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2230}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0016/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3008, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4460}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0016/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/em/ma/nu/el/mo/ve/me/nt/00/un/se/emmanuelmovement00unse/emmanuelmovement00unse_0016.jp2", "height": 4460, "width": 3008, "levels": 6, "size": 884480}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"16\">\n<p>\n THE EMMANUEL!

Morality. cold, com\u00ac\n manding and unyielding must not bend\n humanity wholly to itself. Rather must\n it bend itself to humanity. Life is bigger\n than all else. Value is the only reality\n that shall dominate it. And value takes\n in duty, morality, pleasure and happiness,\n and all else that it can use to demon\u00ac\n strate its worth.\n</p>\n<p>\n And where do we find ourselves stand\u00ac\n ing to-day? If epicureanism be not al\u00ac\n lowed to give uk the cue to living, neither\n shall stoicism. If Hedonism, the call of\n pleasure must not enslave us. neither\n shall intuitionism, the call of conscience\n and duty. It worldliniess and sensuous\u00ac\n ness be not permitted to claim the throne,\n neither shall the asceticism of medieval\n or modern times. Man, because he is\n God\u2019s best creation, must be a child of\n freedom. He shall know the truth and\n the truth shall make him free. So the\n place of emphasis has shifted. It is not\n to live as though there were no world\n to enlist your sympathy. But to be in the\n world molding it, purifying it, using it\n for your good. Nor is it to live as though\n you were a disembodied soul. But to\n make the body fit habitation for the soul.\n It is not that either world or body are so\n bad that you, to be spiritual, ignore them.\n But it is that both exist that you may\n master them. Use them freely, honor\u00ac\n ably: but don\u2019t let them use you. Go\n down into the world hourly, if you choose,\n but down because you live above the\n world. Live in the body joyously, because\n you live in the spirit and cannot, there\u00ac\n fore, inhabit the body on other terms.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Emmanuel Movement is a very time-\n \u2022 ly help to this desired end. It recognizes\n life in the body and the world, as did\n Jesus of Nazareth centuries ago, and\n grapples with the situation to make the\n man master of his fate. It sees the world\n to be a beautiful rather than a dreadful\n place to dwell in. It views the body as\n comely and plastic, with possibilities to\n become a veritable temple beautiful when\n that skilled artist, the spirit, hath\n eM3led all its graces into it; even made\n</p>\n<p>\n it a temple fitted to be the abiding place\n of the Holy Ghost.\n</p>\n<p>\n Do I seem to be introducing Into life\n a new and unfamiliar force? Rather an\n old accredited power, a power as old as\n Nazareth. That stood the test of Calvary.\n That rose triumphant from the tomb.\n And ours, by virtue of our faith and the\n Son of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n I asked one of my church officials what\n he thought of this new movement. His\n answer rebuked me, as he exclaimed\n \u201cWhat is there new about it.\u201d \u201cNothing\n new,\u201d said I. \u201cOnly the old Gospel under a\n new name, stepping forth to inhabit a\n new sphere of usefulness. and to make\n conquests there.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Just a further question: Does the Urn-\n manuel Movement restrict or enlarge the\n purpose of the church? Well, that de\u00ac\n pends upon what the purpose of your\n church may be. If the church exists only\n to prepare men for eternity, it restricts\n its purpose: for it turns the church\u2019s at\u00ac\n tention to the earth and the concerns of\n time. It does not help men to be carried\n to the skies on flowery beds of ease, but\n it does help them to fight their battles I\n here upon the earth and live nobly, and\n win out even before the end of the strife, j\n It has no interest in enabling a man to\n read his title clear to mansions there, but\n it does show him how his title can be\n searched and found valid here in the\n homes of men, the haunts of vice, the\n dust-filled avenues of earth.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then again, if your church exists to I\n perpetuate ecclesiastical formality, de\u00ac\n nominational regularity, creedal and doc\u00ac\n trinal substantiality. the Emmanuel\n Movement calls a sorry halt upon your\n dry-as-dust endeavors; for it has no high\u00ac\n er ambition than to make some poor\n human creature whole.\n</p>\n<p>\n You remember the story of the two\n boys who. upon a sultry summer Sunday\n afternoon, were learning their catechism.\n One said to the other, \u201cHow far have you j\n got?\u2019\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m beyond redemption,\u201d was the\n facetious answer. \u201cYou are?\u201d exclaimed\n the questioner, \u201cMy! I\u2019m in the middle of\n original sin.\u201d The Emmanuel Movement\n knows nothing about and cares less for\n either original sin or any such theoretical\n redemption. It does, however, occupy it- j\n self with the ravages of sin. It does carry\n to the lowliest, most outcast, most de- 1\n spairing soul upon the earth a full, rich, j\n every-day .redemption.\n</p>\n<p>\n So it depends upon what the purpose cf\n the church may be. To the church that\n regards itself a light set to shine in the j\n darkness, the Emmanuel Movement is a j\n messenger to carry that light into all the\n ! gloomy corners of existence, that men ,\n j may see the truth. To the church that |\n ! regards itself as salt that hath not lost\n J its savor, it reveals vast, human tracts j\n</p>\n<p>\n that are to be kept from spoiling. To the\n church that has a Christ inspired mis\u00ac\n sionary zeal it brings the despondent, the\n despairing, the sick, to its doors for heal\u00ac\n ing and helps the church pour in the oil\n of gladness and bind up their wounds.\n Such is surely enlarging the purpose of\n the church.\n</p>\n<p>\n And, O the need of such ministry as\n that! Hear Drr Jefferson of the Broad\u00ac\n way Tabernacle exclaim: \u201cWhile the\n church has been filled with doubts and\n fears, there has been an ever-deepening\n estrangment between the church and\n large classes of our population. It is a\n world-wide phenomenon.\u201d And hear Dr.\n Parkhurst of the Madison Square Pres\u00ac\n byterian Church exclaim, \u201cIt is undoubt\u00ac\n edly the fact that there is misunder\u00ac\n standing between the church and the rank\n and file of the working classes. The\n church in times past has been excessive\u00ac\n ly addicted to the work of preparing peo\u00ac\n ple to live in heaven, instead of fitting\n them to be comfortable, decent and\n righteous citizens of the world that now\n is. The step that is obligatory upon the\n church is to enter more appreciatively\n and sympathetically into the material,\n intellectual and spiritual necessities of\n the people in this present life. We can\n depend upon it that people will love the\n church as much as the church loves the\n people. The solution of the present prob\u00ac\n lem is one which involves a more thor\u00ac\n ough forgetfulness of our own spiritual\n perquisites and a holy ambition to re\u00ac\n produce in ourselves the mind which\n Christ cherished all the interests of all\n people.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Emmanuel Movement would go far\n to bridge Dr. Jefferson\u2019s ever-deepening\n estrangement between the church and\n the people at large. It would, as no\n other adaptation of the Gospel ever has.\n help achieve Dr. Parkhurst\u2019s desire that\n the church make men comfortable, de\u00ac\n cent, righteous citizens of the world that\n now is.\n</p>\n<p>\n Saying all this is not to affirm for an\n instant that the church should change\n front upon the religious problem. It is\n not to cease its indeavors to save the\n so - . Rather to increase them, the body\n being a very temporary concern in com\u00ac\n parison, It is not to replace its vision\n of the delectable hills with one of an\n earth full of human woe. It is simply\n called upon to consider extension, as well\n as altitude, that all down along the\n shining line connecting the highest point\n of altitude with the farthest point of\n base petitions for help, health and life\n may ascend, and the angels of peace and\n joy and all heavenly ministration may\n come down to bless the earth. In short,\n it is to realize that the field is the world:\n the place, the only place, where Our\n Lord gave us any authority to scatter\n the good seed of His word.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0017/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 184, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0017/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 368, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 559}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0017/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 736, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1119}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0017/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1472, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2238}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0017/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2944, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4476}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0017/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/em/ma/nu/el/mo/ve/me/nt/00/un/se/emmanuelmovement00unse/emmanuelmovement00unse_0017.jp2", "height": 4476, "width": 2944, "levels": 6, "size": 1010482}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"17\">\n<p>\n THE EMMANUEL 1 MOVEMENT.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15\n</p>\n<p>\n Substitute Thought\n</p>\n<p>\n Sermon by Rev. A. W. Hotlder in his\n series on \u201cPresent Fads and\n Fancies of Mortal Mind,\u201d preached\n March 1 < > , in the Baptist Church\n of tlic Redeemer, Cortelyou road\n and Fast Fig ' hteentli street.\n</p>\n<p>\n TEXT\u2014Let this mind be in you. which was\n aiso irj Christ Jesus.\u2014 Philippians Ii:5.\n</p>\n<p>\n The imitation of the Lord Jesus Christ\n should be the one rule of every life, both\n in the outward or material world and\n in the inner life of thought and feeling.\n In the outward world Jesus pleased not\n Himself; sought no high place and did\n not choose the life of pleasure, comfort\n or ease. His errand to this world was,\n as declared in His own words, as fol\u00ac\n lows; \" The spirit of the Lord is upon\n me, because He hath appointed me to\n preach the gospel to the poor; He hath\n sent me to heal the broken-hearted, to\n preach deliverance to the captives, and\n recovering of sight to the blind, to set\n at liberty them that are bruised, to\n preach the acceptable year of the Lord.\u201d\n By others it was declared \" He went about\n doing good\u201d added to three manifold ob\u00ac\n jects, He gave a cure for sin-sick souls,\n in the invitation, \" Come unto Me, all\n ye that labor and are heavy laden and\n I will give you rest.\u201d His message to\n the inner life was to bring all of our\n faculties into harmony with the law and\n will of God, and by obedience to these\n we should know of the doctrine.\n</p>\n<p>\n The standard is high, and by some it\n is said to be out of our reach, beyond\n our possibilities, above us, impractical.\n Others are contending that we are only\n in the infancy of our possibilities, that\n we may attain to divine thought, which\n controls both the outward world and in\u00ac\n ner life, and we. possessing the thought\n which was in Jesus Christ, Our Lord, may\n control all things in all realms. In these\n days there have come to us schools of\n varied thought of many shades and col\u00ac\n oring. These lay claim to the discovery\n of a \" new thought\u201d as a remedy to the\n ills to which we fall. This may be pos\u00ac\n sible in so far as all thought is new\n thought, no matter how old it may be,\n until it becomes a part of personal ex\u00ac\n perience; but it can never be new thought\n as long as it emanates from God, for new\n thought is God thought, and God thought\n is \" the same yesterday, to-day and for\u00ac\n ever.\u201d \" He changes not.\u201d Rather would\n we call it \u201csubstitute thought\u201d; that is\n to say, the substitution of the divine for\n the human, the immortal for the mortal.\n Accepting this fact, we must go back to\n Jesus Christ, our Lord and Master, \u00a3fs\n the exemplifler, both in the outward and\n inward life, of divine thought. It is back\n to Christ we should lead men for the\n healing of all manner of diseases. j\n</p>\n<p>\n This cannot be accomplished by a de\u00ac\n nial of facts.- and the calling of things\n illusions of mortal mind. Our Lord did\n not establish a religion of denial, but\n recognized facts, as recorded in multi\u00ac\n plied instances, and the great act of sal\u00ac\n vation is the act of Jesus Christ in ap\u00ac\n proaching the facts of sin, sickness and\n death, and by divine power controlling\n those facts. Because if there be no fact,\n there can be no reason for action, and\n we make him a liar who dealt with facts\n only.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thought is the foundation for all ac\u00ac\n tion, though it may be without a proper\n</p>\n<p>\n The Rev. A. W. Hodder\n</p>\n<p>\n Of the Baptist Church of the Redeemer.\n</p>\n<p>\n Flatbush.\n</p>\n<p>\n aim or a positive ideal. Jt may be\n unstable in all its ways and make our\n lives of an indefinite character. It may\n reach out to the broad horizon which\n was in the mind of Jesus when he said:\n \u201cWhosoever.\u201d It may be limited to a\n Pharisaical narrowness in denomination\u00ac\n al or political or social lines. Whatever\n the direction of our action, it must be\n preceded by thought. The question now\n arises, from what source shall our\n thought spring? Shall it be from within\n with all the limitations of human selfish\u00ac\n ness, or shall it be from above, as it\n was in Jesus Christ, with unlimited\n boundary and power? The text is \" Let\n this mind be in you, which was also in\n Christ Jesus.\u201d Human will must give\n consent to accepting or rejecting the\n text. Let us consider a few essentials.\n First essential:\n</p>\n<p>\n A knowledge of the life of Jesus Christ\n in all its phases, The relationship of\n Almighty God to Jesus Christ and the\n relationship of Jesus Christ to Al\u00ac\n mighty God. The relationship of Jesus\n to Himself and His mission on earth and\n in heaven. The relationship of Jesus\n to every individual man the world over.\n It is to be said with regret that few\n people have given the biography of\n Jesus a careful study, from either the\n divine or human side. We read much\n about, which is always an indefinite\n term, rather than come to a direct,\n definite answer by personal study and\n investigation, and the giving of a person\u00ac\n al positive statement to the question\n of Jesus, \" What think ye of the Christ?\u201d\n Not what men say, but \u201cwhat think ye?\u201d\n Men have taken the opinions of books\n read, and statements from pulpits un\u00ac\n der which they regularly sit for their\n sole rule and practice. We read the\n key to the door rather than enter the\n door for ourselves. We read and hear\n about experiences instead of entering in\u00ac\n to those experiences which make an im\u00ac\n pregnable wall when we are able to say\n \u201cI know.\u201d We make our, dogmas from a\n hearsay, rather than a vital issue of our\n lives. We incline to accept suggested\n thought, rather than go to the fountain\n head and substitute divine thought and\n will for the human thought and will. We\n say ito is to be regretted because it robs\n one of the direct touch with the life\n and mission of Jesus; for no one can\n come into the full thought and will and\n truth as it is in Jesus, without enter\u00ac\n ing into a study of all those relation\u00ac\n ships which Jesus sustains both to God\n and man. Furthermore, we should cease\n the isolation of divine statements from\n their surroundings and use them to cre\u00ac\n ate our own working hypothesis for,the\n building of false foundations. When there\n is no other foundation than that which\n is already laid. Putting things in their\n right places and right relationships and\n following them as our rule and practice,\n w e shall not only have authority, but\n shall be able to more readily distinguish\n between facts and illusions. We will not\n deny sin. and call it an illusion of mor\u00ac\n al mind, but recognize it as a fact man\u00ac\n ifested in its manifold holcf on human\n life. This study will bring us into\n touch with Jesus, His methods and\n teachings. We shall not only see the\n effect of His life on the outer world,\n but realize it for ourselves upon our in\u00ac\n ner life. Men dp not need suggested\n thought half so much as substitute\n thought and that divine. This can be\n obtained only by going backward to\n the truth as it is in Jesus, who said of\n Himself, \u201cI am the truth, the life and\n the way.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Acquaint thyself with Him by every\n possible means.

We must be honest, open-\n minded and open-hearted, free from every\n prejudice of tradition, of denominational-\n ism and ecclesiastical authority. Eve-y\n phase of the life of Jesus is an open book\n for every man. The very mind of Christ\n is laid bare, so that he who runs may\n read.\n</p>\n<p>\n Second essential: It has been well said\n by Frederick W. Robertson, \" Obedience\n is the organ of spiritual knowledge.\u201d In\n considering the life of Jesus, we find this\n the source of His power. Obedience is\n the best preparation for service. \u201cWe\n cannot rule until we obey,\u201d are the words\n of Napoleon. Certainly a fine philosoph\u00ac\n ical expression in a brief term. Obedi\u00ac\n ence prepares the mind for revelation,\n and opens the human soul to receive\n wider and larger demonstrations of the\n sovereignty and grace of God. The sub\u00ac\n mission of our thought and will may be\n overpowered and become a slave by the\n surrender to and the gratification of ani\u00ac\n mal appetites, and so become a minor\n Quantity. This yielding may become self-\n Batisfying, and place itself at enmity\n against our own best interests. We must\n go back to Jesus and learn from His life\n of obedience how to bring our lives into\n harmony w r ith God\u2019s law and thought. No\n man need-ever go away from Jesus hop\u00ac\n ing to find some better example of a sur\u00ac\n rendered heart to the will of God. Jesus\n states plainly, \" My meat is to do the will\n of Him that sent me.\u201d This is the pivot\n around which His whole life revolves. It\n is the power which draws all things to its\n center and holds them in the perfect har\u00ac\n mony of God. It is the Jesus heart out\n of which are the issues of life.\n</p>\n<p>\n Paul not only tells us to focus the mind\n on Jesus, but also to renew our mind, to\n make it vital in eternal things; to have\n it in the knowledge of Jesus Christ; to\n place it in harmony with God\u2019s law and\n love; to teach it to discern what is the\n will of God. For illustration, we must\n return to the oldest and best and only\n reasonable argument to be produced for\n perfect correspondence to either spiritual\n or natural life. \" All life is ruled by law.\u201d\n In heaven above and earth beneath, in\n the material and moral realms, in the\n spiritual and human life. Herbert Spen\u00ac\n cer has weH said, \" Perfect correspondence\n would be perfect life.\u201d In our weakness\n we fail in this correspondence. \" Lord, to\n whom shall we go? Thou hast the words\n of eternal life.\u201d Everything is governed\n fcy law; by submission we make them our\n</p>\n<p>\n own. If we desire perfect physical condi\u00ac\n tions we must rigidly follow in the path\n of that law which produces only of its\n kind. Jf violation of that law produces of\n its kind, as it certainly will, we shall only\n find a false comfort in our endeavor to\n prove it non-existent by calling it an illu\u00ac\n sion of mortal mind, but shall also call\n that law a lie. \" By their fruits ye shall\n know them.\u201d This argument has no end\n in its application, for it governs eveiy\n rule and practice in the whole realm of\n all life, spiritual and material. We must\n then come back to Jesus; substitute His\n eternal law for human will; possess His\n mind for human actions; be controlled\n by divine plans and purposes; be In har\u00ac\n mony with Him. For \u201cperfect correspon\u00ac\n dence brings perfect life.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Third essential: The guide to this de\u00ac\n sire. No greater folly can be perpetrated\n than to eliminate the working of the\n Holy Spirit in the affairs of human life\n in this present day. Jesus distinctly\n tells us that \" When He is come. He will\n reprove the world of sin and of righteous\u00ac\n ness and of judgment.\u201d \" How be it when\n He, the spirit of truth, is come He will\n guide you into all truth.\u201d When Jesus\n was present on earth, He planted the\n seed of truth. Others also of His disciples\n scattered that same seed broadcast, but\n only God gives the increase, only the\n Holy Spirit unfolds the flower. God\u2019s rev\u00ac\n elation is a continuous revelation through\n the Holy Spirit. We find it written in the\n gospels and epistles, on the pages of his\u00ac\n tory and nature and science and truth\n and personal experience, and the Spirit of\n God will continue to reveal the truth to\n whomsoever will. This revelation is meas\u00ac\n ured and given according to our relation\u00ac\n ship to Jesus Christ and according to\n capacities and ability both in the moral\n and spiritual life as the first simple prop\u00ac\n osition in algebra is given the young stu\u00ac\n dent, to lead to the second proposition\n and then the third, and so on to the end.\n As just one ray of light is let into the eye\n of a patient recovering from a disease of\n the vision, until it can bear more and\n more, unto the fullness of light; as the\n cord carries the first strand of the wire,\n to bear the weight of the second, and so\n on until the cable is finished and stretches\n from pier to pier across dangerous water\n flowing beneath\u2014so, God\u2019s holy spiriz\n leads and reveals line on line, precept on\n precept, truth on truth. And \u201cto him\n that hath shall be given even more than\n he hath and to him that hat* ' , not shall be\n taken away even that which he hath.\u201d\n We go from the gospels and the teachings\n of Jesus, to their practical workings in\n the epistles. We go from the epistles to\n</p>\n<p>\n the history of the church of our blessed\n Lord. Added to these are the personal ex\u00ac\n periences of every believer brought out\n by the workings and the leadings and\n teachings of the Holy Spirit upon the\n human heart. Thus we come to personal\n and final authority; for we are able to\n speak that which we do know and \u201cIf we\n receive the witness of men, the witness\n of God is greater.\u201d He, the Holy Spirit,\n will guide you into all truth. He will\n reveal the thought and mind of Jesus\n unto your soul. And if you will let Him,\n the Holy Spirit will substitute the mind\n of Jesus for any suggested or new\n thought, and in that mind your soul will\n rest in God. Finally, the need of prayer.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is no life so surrounded, so high,\n so holy, so full of habitual communion\n with God, so full of pure, and holy\n thought, that it can afford to do without\n the hour of prayer, the secret place, the\n uttered word. If in our substituted\n thought for new thought, or suggested\n thought, we include \u201cpray without ceas\u00ac\n ing,\u201d by constant communion with God,\n by the constant conversion of work in\n worship, we shall have, we shall desire\n and crave for special moments when the\n daily sacrifice for divine thought will pass\n into uttered prayer of both heart and lips.\n For whatever the mind of Jesus may be\n to us, in its influence and inspiration\n and power, It must be first concentrated\n and evolved in our prayer time and place.\n The life of Jesus that was one long\n prayer needed secret place on the moun\u00ac\n tain top, and the nightly converse with\n God. Jesus ccruld say, \" The Father hath\n not left me alone, for I do always the\n things that please Him,\u201d yet He felt He\n must have the communion of spoken\n prayer. What Christ needed we cannot\n afford to neglect. It is our Lord and\n Master who blends thought and will and\n contemplation and service, the life of in\u00ac\n ward communion and the life of. prac\u00ac\n tical obedience. In this day of activity,\n there is great danger, not of doing too\n much, but of praying too little, for our\n desires. We must not oniy pray, \u201cLord,\n teach us to think; Lord, teach us to\n work,\u201d but also, \" Lord, teach us to pray.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus may we enter into possession of\n our text, \u201cLet this mind be in you, which\n was also in Christ Jesus. \" By a ciear and\n comprehensive knowledge of the life and\n mission of Jesus Christ; by a humble and\n submissive spirit of loyal obedience to\n God\u2019s law and supreme will; but a clear\n vision of the leading of God\u2019s Holy Spirit,\n and by earnest, sincere devotion in pray\u00ac\n er, that the mind which was in Christ\n Jesus may be in us, for His own name\u2019s\n sake.

V.)\n</p>\n<p>\n Never, since the Christian Church was\n organized, has it been entirely free from\n criticism. For nearly nineteen hundred\n years it has been running the gauntlet\n of criticism, of which some has been\n for doctrinal and some for practical\n reasons: some for what it has done and\n some for what it has not. done. That\n it has not only survived, but grown\n steadily stronger, is an evidence of its\n divine origin and a prophecy of its final\n victory over all opposing forces.\n</p>\n<p>\n Just at present it is being criticised\n not so much for what it is doing as for\n what it is not. doing; and the assump\u00ac\n tion of a majority of its critics seems\n to be that it should do not merely more\n work of the kind which it is now doing,\n but a great deal of certain other kinds\n in which they are especially interested.\n Some of them criticise it because it\n does not enter the political field and\n champion the cause of socialism, or free\n trade, or the single tax. or of political\n reform in one wav or another, and so\n produce a condition of political righteous\u00ac\n ness throughout the length and breadth\n of the civilized world. Some criticise it\n for not reforming industrial conditions,\n preventing collisions between capital\n and labor, and removing the various\n causes of poverty; while others find fault\n wiih it for not purging society of the\n numerous vices which infest certain parts\n of it, drunkenness, the prostitution, the\n licentiousness, the extravagance, the\n riotous living. They would have the\n church openly enter such fields as the\n aggressive antagonist, of whatever is\n evil, and take direct measures of a hand-\n to-hand nature, political, legal, industrial\n or otherwise, to overcome and do away\n with it.\n</p>\n<p>\n And now, latest of all the criticisms\n to which the church has been subjected,\n is the assertion that it does riot heal\n the sick and cure diseases as Christ\n Himself did. We are told that it. ought\n to do so, and that, because it. does not.\n many people are leaving it, or refusing\n to come to it, and are going in crowds\n to other organizations which make a\n specialty of curing bodily ailments\u2014the\n Faith (Jurists, the Divine Healers, the\n Esoteric Vibrationists, the advocates of\n the so-called New Thought, and, notably,\n</p>\n<p>\n the Christian Scientists. We are told\n that the rapid growth of such organiza\u00ac\n tions and cults and societies shows that\n they meet a great need of our commou\n humanity which the church is not meet\u00ac\n ing, hut which it certainly ought to\n meet, and that it should therefore be\u00ac\n stir itself in regard to that matter and\n begin to save people from their physical\n diseases as well as from the things that\n imperil their souls.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some would have the church establish\n regular medical clinics for the treat\u00ac\n ment of certain kinds of sickness and\n train its ministers to be physiciaus as\n well as preachers of the gospel. In\n short, they would have it undertake\n what the Christian Scientists are un\u00ac\n dertaking without accepting the peculiar\n doctrines of that organization. They\n would have it combine the methods of\n regular physicians with those of the\n mental healers, whatever their name,\n utilizing not only the best medical sci\u00ac\n ence, but also the best psychological\n methods which recent studies have re\u00ac\n vealed.\n</p>\n<p>\n I have nothing to say at present, either\n for or against such a method of heal\u00ac\n ing. excepting that, so far as I can see,\n it is an excellent method for some one\n to use. and that, unless I have been mis\u00ac\n informed, it is already being used to a\n considerable extent by many of the best\n physicians, especially for the cure of\n nervous diseases. The question which I\n am now considering is not whether such\n a method of healing is a good one. but\n whether the Christian Church should\n make regular U3e of it, or of any other\n method which directly aims at the same\n result. Ought the church itself, as an or\u00ac\n ganization, to go directly into the busi\u00ac\n ness of healing bodily ailments, and is\n lit to blame for not doing so? That is\n the question r.ow before us.\n</p>\n<p>\n And with reference to that matter, let\n me say, in the first place, that the ar\u00ac\n gument which I have mentioned, based I\n on the growth of the Christian Scientists 1\n and the multiplication of similar cults\n and societies, is altogether fallacious.\n The fact that, such organizations have\n sprung into existence and have gained\n many followers no more proves that the\n church is derelict and ought to cure dis\u00ac\n eases, than does the fact that a still\n greater number of people are constantly\n buying patent medicines, and that some\n of (ho patentees and manufacturers of\n those medicines are doing an enormous\n business and have become very wealthy.\n The one fact proves exactly what is\n proved by the other\u2014that many people\n are seeking for physical health, and that,\n</p>\n<p>\n ' in their anxiety to obtain it, not a few\n j of them are very easily persuaded to try\n j anything which promises ro give It to\n j them, whether or not they lenow the na\u00ac\n ture of it. and whether or not its claims\n are reasonable. One buys a bottle of\n patent medicine, and another, for the\n same reason, buys a copyrighted book\n which professes to contain the key to\n the science of health. And perhaps each\n of them is cured, for It seems to be true\n that a great many people have really been\n cured by patent medicine, od the one\n hand, and by what is called Christian Sci\u00ac\n ence on the other. But that is no suf\u00ac\n ficient reason why the church should\n make medicines or go into tho business\n of healing bodily diseases by metaphys\u00ac\n ical moans. The argument is no better\n and no worse for the one thing than for\n the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n And as for the rapidity with which\n some of the mental healing organizations\n have grown, that also proves nothing in\n regard to the church. Rapidity of growth\n is no evidence of truth. Some bad things\n grow rapidly as well as some good things.\n Weeds grow as rapidly as wheat, oats, or\n corn. If the rapid growth of the Christian\n Scientists proves the correctness of their\n methods and theories, what shall we say\n of the Salvation Army, which has had a\n vastly larger and more rapid growth,\n with directly contrary methods and con\u00ac\n trary theories? Can both be true? Let\n us not be misled ny a show of success,\n nor jump at any false conclusions. Growth\n proves nothing, numbers prove nothing,\n so far as truen is concerned. Simon\n Magus had a great following, greater than\n that of Simon Peter, out Peter din no:\n imitate him nor tnange his methods in\n any respect, in order to capture that class\n of people. Any person can very easily\n get great numbers to follow bim if he\n is able to provide them temporal benefits,\n or to make them believe that he will do\n so. That is what the majority of man\u00ac\n kind chiefly seek after, as Jesus told His\n disciples; but He also told them that that\n is what they should not chiefly seek after.\n Multitudes followed Him as long as He\n cured their bodily ailments and provided\n loaves and fishes for them, but when He\n plainly told them that their motive was\n not in accord with His mission, and tried\n to get them to follow His spiritual lead\u00ac\n ership, the most of them quickly fell\n away. He could easily have made Him\u00ac\n self a king, and have brought the nations\n io his feet, without suffering -he agony of\n Gelhsemane and Golgotha, if He would\n have used to the full extent His mirac\u00ac\n ulous power of healing diseases and pro*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0020/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 188, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 278}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0020/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 376, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 557}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0020/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 752, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1115}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0020/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1504, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2230}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0020/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3008, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4460}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0020/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/em/ma/nu/el/mo/ve/me/nt/00/un/se/emmanuelmovement00unse/emmanuelmovement00unse_0020.jp2", "height": 4460, "width": 3008, "levels": 6, "size": 1038472}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"20\">\n<p>\n 18\n</p>\n<p>\n THE EMMANUEL MOVEMENT,\n</p>\n<p>\n \u25bciding for the temporal wants of man\u00ac\n kind. But He did not desire such a fol\u00ac\n lowing. He had come to establish a dif\u00ac\n ferent sort of a kingdom, a spiritual\n kingdom of righteousness and peace and\n joy in the Holy Ghost, and He wished His\n followers to seek for that kingdom su\u00ac\n premely, subordinating all of their tem\u00ac\n poral interests to the acquisition of spir\u00ac\n itual and permanent things.\n</p>\n<p>\n If it be asked, Why, then, did He cure\n so many diseases and why did He instruct\n His disciples to cure them? the answer\n is that His principal reason was to at\u00ac\n tract public attention to Himself and his\n ministry, so as to prepare the way for\n the preaching of the gospel, and for its\n reception by those who listened to it. It\n was necessary for Him to get a hearing\n for His message, and, if possible, a sym\u00ac\n pathetic hearing, as it is necessary for\n one who would raise a harvest to have\n the ground duly prepared for the seed.\n The sdfl must be loosened by the plow\u00ac\n share before the seed can strike root and\n grow. The miracles of Jesus and His\n early disciples broke up the soil in the\n minds and hearts of many people for the\n planting of the gospel seed. They led a\n great many to believe, with Nicodemus,\n that God must be with Him and to accept\n His Messiahship. We are told that on a\n certain occasion many of the people said:\n \u201cWhen the Christ cometh will He do more\n miracles (or signs) than these ' which this\n man doeth?\u201d That is what His miracles\n were chiefly intended for\u2014to cause just\n such a frame of mind, and so to predis\u00ac\n pose mankind to hear and accept the pre\u00ac\n cious truths of the gospel. His healing\n of diseases was not the principal feature\n of His work among men; it was merely\n incidental to the success of His great\n mission in saving people from their sins.\n</p>\n<p>\n That is one of the differences between\n Him and the leaders of the Christian Sci\u00ac\n ence propaganda. With them, the healing\n of diseases is the principal thing. Theo\u00ac\n retically denying the existence of sick\u00ac\n ness, they direct the greater part of their\n teaching and their energy to the destruc\u00ac\n tion of sickness. That is the one thing\n which they especially emphasize. Their\n metaphysics and their religion are en\u00ac\n tirely subordinated to their treatment of\n diseases. They exist for the sake of it,\n and -would never have been adopted ex\u00ac\n cept as a means to that end. Their great\n text-book, which they put upon a par\n with the Bible, is in reality a metaphysi\u00ac\n cal medical treatise, the main object of\n which is to teach people how to have\n physical health. The spiritual is dis\u00ac\n tinctly subordinated to the physical, at\n the same time that the physical is theo\u00ac\n retically denied. But with Jesus the mat\u00ac\n ter was exactly reversed. He never de\u00ac\n nied the reality of sickness, nor did He\n ever make its cure the principal thing.\n Acknowledging its reality, He cured it in\n many instances for the sake of a higher\n end to be gained thereby. His principal\n concern w r as for the souls of mankind,\n and His principal occupation was preach\u00ac\n ing the gospel.\n</p>\n<p>\n So it was with the apostles. He sent\n them forth, we are told, soon after the\n beginning of His ministry, to preach the\n kingdom of God, and to heal the sick.\n The preaching was mentioned first, and\n was of primary importance. The healing\n pt*s a secondary and subordinate matter.\n</p>\n<p>\n The final commandment to them, just be\u00ac\n fore His ascension, was simply to go into\n all the world and preach the gospel to\n every creature. That was thenceforth the\n great business to which they devoted their\n lives; and while they continued, to some\n extent, to heal bodily ailments, they seem\n to have done but little of it in compari\u00ac\n son with what Christ himself had done.\n What they did in that respect served the\n same purpose which His miracles had\n served. It called attention to them and\n their preaching, and made it easier for\n them to make converts to Christianity.\n But gradually, as Christianity became\n firmly established and was able to make\n its way without the assistance of such\n healings, they ceased, as the miracles of\n Moses ceased when the Israelites were\n able to take care of themselves; and there\n is no more reason for supposing that\n God intended the Christian Church to\n continue to heal the physical diseases of\n men. than that He intended the Jewish\n Church always to live upon manna, and\n drink water that was miraculously drawn\n from a rock.\n</p>\n<p>\n The argument of those who say that\n because Jesus and the apostles cured\n physical diseases, the church as a whole\n ought to continue to heal them, will hard\u00ac\n ly bear examination. If it proves any\u00ac\n thing at all, it proves a good deal more\n than they are prepared to admit; for it\n proves not only that the church should\n cure bodily diseases, but it should cure\n all manner of diseases, and even raise the\n dead to life, since nothing less than\n that is what Jesus himself did, and what\n He commanded the apostles to do. He\n gave them power, the Bible says, \u201cto\n heal all manner of sickness and all man\u00ac\n ner of disease,\u201d and when He sent them\n forth on their first missionary journey.\n He told them to \u201cheal the sick, cleanse\n the lepers, raise the dead, and cast out\n devils.\u201d How can the church, or the\n Christian Scientists, or any one else, ful\u00ac\n fill that command, by simply curing some\n diseases, chiefly of a nervous character.\n Let us be consistent, and either acknowl\u00ac\n edge that the commandment was not in\u00ac\n tended to be perpetual, or that the whole\n of it was meant to be so. and that the\n church is now derelict for not healing\n every sort of ailment, and even raising\n the dead, by miraculous means.\n</p>\n<p>\n And if we insist that the early church\n was in all respects a model for the church\n of to-day, let us admit the claim of a\n handful of people who are called the Holy\n Ghost Society, who say they have the gift\n of tongues which was exercised on the\n day of Pentecost, and to which the apos\u00ac\n tle Paul refers in one of his letters to\n the Corinthian Christians. The Holy\n Ghost Society claims that the gift of\n tongues was intended to be perpetual in\n the church, and that Christians ought to\n have it now no less than those of ancient\n times. Their position in that respect\n seems to be as well taken as that of\n those who contend that the church of\n to-day should imitate the early church\n in regard to the cure of physical ail\u00ac\n ments. Neither of the two positions can\n be successfully defended.\n</p>\n<p>\n Do I. then, mean to say that the Chris\u00ac\n tian religion has nothing to do with our\n physical welfare, and that the church\n should do nothing either to hinder or to\n cure the diseases of mankind? Oh, no;\n not at all. Such an assumption would\n be as far from the truth as that which I\n</p>\n<p>\n have controverted. I have only main\u00ac\n tained that there is no sufficient reason,\n either Biblical or otherwise, why the\n church or the Christian ministry should\n directly devote itself to the business of\n curing men\u2019s physical ailments, any more\n than to that of satisfying their physical\n hunger, or providing them with clothing,\n and houses to live in, and clean streets,\n and good sewerage, and good laws, and\n good government. The Christian religion\n is promotive of all of those things, and of\n everything else which contributes to the\n general good of mankind. They are\n among the fruits which it bears in the\n lives of mankind, and of which Jesus said\n that they shall be added unto us if we\n seek first for the Kingdom of God and\n His righteousness. But they are not\n themselves a part of the Christian reli\u00ac\n gion and it is not the business of the\n church to give them to us excepting in\u00ac\n directly, by giving us first, last, and all\n the time, the religion out of which they\n grow, or whose natural product and ad\u00ac\n juncts they are. Godliness is profitable\n unto all things, having promise of the life\n which now is as well as of the life to\n come; and the special business of the\n Christian Church is to cultivate godli\u00ac\n ness, leaving it, when cultivated, to pro\u00ac\n duce its own beneficent results in the\n physical, political and social domains.\n</p>\n<p>\n As a matter of fact, it is producing\n them more and more as time goes on. No\n other people in all the world are so well,\n or so well off, as a general rule, as those\n who accept and practice the religion of\n Christ. Generally speaking. Christian\n people live longer and have better health\n than the rest of mankind, together with\n more worldly goods and material com\u00ac\n forts of every description, owing to the\n fact that the Christian religion produces\n the sort of character\u2014the intellectual and\n moral qualities, the alertness of mind,\n the readiness to welcome truth and the\n disposition to seek for it, the progres\u00ac\n siveness, the self-control, the practical\n wisdom and the philanthropy\u2014of which\n health and long life and the highest civ\u00ac\n ilization are the natural outcome and\n concomitants. Our modern civilization,\n with its multitudinous methods of pro\u00ac\n moting the physical welfare of men\u2014its\n scientific institutions, its medical schools,\n its sanitary regulations, its hospitals and\n its charitable organizations\u2014is due to the\n influence of the Christian religion, of\n which the Christian Church, since the\n time of its Founder, has been the teacher\n and promulgator. So that, while it is not\n directly engaged in the business of heal\u00ac\n ing the physical diseases of men, or of\n providing for any of their temporal\n wants, the church is doing indirectly a\n wonderful work in that respect, the\n greatest by far that has ever been done,\n and is thereby fulfilling the Saviour\u2019s\n prophecy, \u201cHe that belfeveth on me the\n works that I do shall he do also; and\n greater works than these shall he do. be\u00ac\n cause I go unto my Father.\u201d The church\n is now doing those greater works, of\n which- His own works were suggestive\n and typical. It is doing them not directly,\n but indirectly, by obeying His injunction\n to seek first for the Kingdom of God and\n His righteousness, believing that tempo\u00ac\n ral benefits will be added thereto.

John\n C. Ager,\n</p>\n<p>\n TEXT\u2014\u201cAnd he called unto him his twelve\n disciples and gave them authority over un\u00ac\n clean spirits to cast them out.\u2014Matthew x:7.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Lord\u2019s twelve disciples were ex\u00ac\n ceptional disciple only in the sense\n that they were types or representatives\n of discipleship. That is, the outward du\u00ac\n ties and powers and privileges which the\n Lord conferred upon these twelve men\n were divine types or symbols of the spir\u00ac\n itual duties and powers and privileges\n that are conferred upon all true disci\u00ac\n ples of the Lord. So this power or au\u00ac\n thority over unclean spirits to cast them\n out every true disciple of the Lord pos\u00ac\n sesses in the measure of his dicipleship,\n that is, in the measure in which he has\n come into the true order of his life.\n</p>\n<p>\n This great truth lies at the foundation\n of certain lines of thought that are at\u00ac\n tracting much attention at the present\n time. These concern themselves mainly\n with man\u2019s deliverance from physical\n evils, or diseases, with only an obscure\n recognition of the fact that physical evils\n are mainly the effects or results of spirit\u00ac\n ual evils. But the next step, that the\n spiritual evils that beset us are caused\n by our affiliation with evil spirits as these\n words plainly imply, is regarded as an\n absurd superstition.\n</p>\n<p>\n For modern Christian thought gives the\n least possible space and consideration to\n the supernatural. It has never found any\n place in its thinking for an actual spirit\u00ac\n ual world, which is the endless abode\n of all who have passed out of this world\n through the gate of death. It has even\n less respect for the idea that those who\n have passed out of this world, wherever\n they may be, have any vital connection\n with our experiences here.\n</p>\n<p>\n This attitude of mind is most plainly\n out of harmony with the apparent teach\u00ac\n ing of the gospels, which everywhere take\n for granted the existence of spiritual be\u00ac\n ings, good and evil, who hold most in\u00ac\n timate relations to men on the earth. So\n this aspect of the Gospel teaching is\n something that needs to be explained\n away, and the attempts to do this are\n numerous and various.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the new church, on the other hand,\n this is a vital truth, both as a funda-\n</p>\n<p>\n Out Evil\n</p>\n<p>\n mental philosophical principle and as a\n practial doctrine.\n</p>\n<p>\n A century and a half ago Swedenborg\n set forth with great fullness a truth that\n recent philosophy has been making a\n good deal of, the truth of the solidiarity\n of the human race. Protestant theology\n rested on pure individualism. But the\n truth that humanity as a whole is a one,\n a vital and organic entity, has now come\n to be clearly seen, and its significance\n recognized. Most thinkers, however, con\u00ac\n fine this truth to the present population\n of this earth, while Swedenborg makes it\n include all humanity, the population of\n all worlds, including the spiritual world.\n He teaches, furthermore, that this uni\u00ac\n versal organism is in the human form,\n that is, is a human organism, as all its\n parts and constituents are. In this or\u00ac\n ganism each individual soul has its place\n and function, like the cells and fibers of\n the human body, each one vitally related\n to every other. But while it is true that\n no individual soul or spirit could exist\n if cut off from every other soul or spirit,\n yet every human soul is a separate in\u00ac\n dividual, with complete capability of de\u00ac\n termining the character of its own life\n for itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another doctrine to which Swedenborg\n gives a unique importance is the doctrine\n of influx.\n</p>\n<p>\n Every individual soul in its true order\n is a finite image of the infinite, and is\n therefore made up of numberless func\u00ac\n tions and powers and parts, from highest\n to lowest. Into this complex organism\n the divine life flows in an unceasing\n stream. Modern psychology teaches that\n our consciousness covers only a part of\n this mental organism, the part that lies\n next to our bodily sensations, and, there\u00ac\n fore the lowest or outermost part. And\n as consciousness is an essential element\n of all choices and determinations, and it\n is by choices and determinations that\n character is determined, so it is only this\n lower or outer conscious region of our\n life into which spiritual disorder or evil\n can enter.\n</p>\n<p>\n All these regions of the human soul,\n from highest to lowest, are merely or\u00ac\n ganic vessels or receptivities, and are\n living only by virtue of the unceasing\n inflow of life into them. Into the high\u00ac\n est or inmost region of the soul the di\u00ac\n vine life flows directly from the Lord.\n This region lies above or within all hu\u00ac\n man and angelic consciousness, and forms\n</p>\n<p>\n Spirits\n</p>\n<p>\n the eternal connection between the In\u00ac\n finite and eternal life and the finite life,\n insuring to the human soul its endless ex\u00ac\n istence. Into all the regions of the soul\n below this highest or inmost, two streams\n of life flow, one inwardly, from the Lord,\n one outwardly from other finite souls.\n And it is this latter interflow of life\n from soul to soul that binds all finite\n souls into a single organism, the uni\u00ac\n versal man.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus the life of man is in no sense and\n in no respect self-derived. The human\n soul is nothing but an organic vessel, and\n it is made alive solely by what flows into\n it. And this inflowing life enters the soul\n in two ways, one directly from the Lord,\n the other mediately, through other\n souls. And this is true of all the activi\u00ac\n ties of life, and especially of its two chief\n activities, thought and feeling.\n</p>\n<p>\n The capacities of tl o human soul may\n be grouped under two heads, namely, in\u00ac\n tellectual and emotional. Life flowing\n into the intellectual capacities produces\n thought; flowing into the emotional ca\u00ac\n pacities it produces feeling and willing,\n and all thought and feeling and willing\n in man are so produced. Thus our\n th ,ught and feeling are not, as they\n appear to be, self-derived. They are the\n product of these two streams of life that\n flow into us unceasingly, one directly\n from the Lord, the other mediately\n through other souls. We know how\n thought and feeling are communicated to\n us by means of what enters the mind\n through the senses\u2014that is, by means of\n language and visible and tangible objects,\n and we acknowledge that such thought\n and feeling are communicated, and not\n self-derived. So there is no movement of\n the human mind that is not a product of\n an inflow of thought or feeling from other\n minds. This impartation and reception of\n thought and feeling we are wholly uncon\u00ac\n scious of; but it is the only explanation\n of many mental phenomena.\n</p>\n<p>\n All this may sound like mere specula\u00ac\n tion; but it is, in fact only a somewhat\n elaborated way of saying that everything\n good and true in human life is from the\n Lord, and everything evil and false is of\n the devil and from the devil. This truth\n the Christian Church has always recog\u00ac\n nized as a matter of doctrine. But to\n hold it merely as a doctrine is not suffi\u00ac\n cient. It is a primary and fundamental\n principle of right living, and we can\n never make much progress in right living\n until the mind has gained so clear and\n firm a recognition of this truth as will\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0022/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 188, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 278}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0022/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 376, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 557}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0022/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 752, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1115}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0022/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1504, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2230}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0022/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3008, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4460}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0022/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/em/ma/nu/el/mo/ve/me/nt/00/un/se/emmanuelmovement00unse/emmanuelmovement00unse_0022.jp2", "height": 4460, "width": 3008, "levels": 6, "size": 930345}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"22\">\n<p>\n 20\n</p>\n<p>\n THE EMMANUEL MOVEMENT.\n</p>\n<p>\n enable it to shape and determine all our\n thinking and feeling about all our ex\u00ac\n periences with evil and falsity and with\n good and truth. For so long as we regard\n</p>\n<p>\n learn from the Lord. A wish to learn\n from the Lord is a wish to know what the\n actual truth is in respect to all matters\n of life, for this is what the Lord is un\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n the right thoughts and feelings that are j ceasingly trying to teach us. It is a con-\n</p>\n<p>\n stirred in us as our own, as purely self-\n derived, we simply make of them valued\n possessions of our self-life and so long\n as we regard the wrong thoughts and\n feelings that are stirred in us as our own,\n we can never rid ourselves of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Therefore, what we need above all\n things and first of all is to see clearly\n that everything good and true that we\n discover in our feeling and thinking flows\n into us from the Lord, brought down ..nd\n adopted to our capacities by flowing\n through the thought and feeling of other\n minds: also that everything false or evil\n either their good and truth as it becomes\n our good and truth by flowing into ' our\n minds; also that everything folse or evil\n that we discover in our thinkine and feel\u00ac\n ing is a product of the inflow into us of\n perverted thoughts and feelings from\n other perverted human lives.\n</p>\n<p>\n When we have come to recognize this\n truth as clearly as we ought we shall be\n able on the one hand to repudiate any\n feeling of ownership in any goodness or\n truth we may find active in our life, and\n to confess immediately and instinctively\n that it is from the Lord, and is the pres\u00ac\n ence and activity of His life flowing into\n us, which is the life we desire above all\n things to live, and is not therefore a\n product of our own life or self life. We\n shall also be able to repudiate quickly\n and easily any evil or falsity we may find\n active in our life, for we shall know that\n it is a product of the inflow into us of\n wrong thinking and feeling from some\n evil soul or spirit. Thus the issue before\n us will not be, how we shall get rid of\n something evil that is inherent in our\n life as a vital part of it, but whether\n we will receive and adopt as our own this\n evil spirit that is flowing into us from\n other lives or shall utterly repudiate it as\n infernal.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus what we find ourselves dealing\n with in all our experience with wrong\n thoughts and feelings is other personali\u00ac\n ties. Whether they are living in this\n world or the spiritual world we do not\n know, and it makes no difference. They\n are unclean spirits, incarnate or discar-\n nate, trying to impose their life upon us.\n So far as we permit them to work their\n will in us they will go on stirring up in\n us all sorts of false thinking and evil\n feeling. But so. far as we are striving to\n become disciples of the Lord He gives us\n authority over them to cast them out.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let us note the exact meaning of these\n words, \u201cHe called unto Him His twelve\n disciples and gave them authority over\n unclean spirits to cast them out.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n From these words we may be assured\n in the first place that this authority over\n unclean spirits to cast them out is be\u00ac\n stowed by the Lord only upon His dis\u00ac\n ciples. Therefore, if we wish to possess\n this power over the infernal influences\n that are stirring up wrong thoughts and\n feelings in us we must be disciples of the\n Lord. A disciple is a learner, and a dis\u00ac\n ciple of the Lord is one who wishes to\n</p>\n<p>\n trolling desire to think always and about\n everything just as the Lord would have\n us think, and to feel just as He would\n have us feel, and to speak and act just as\n He would have us speak and act. This\n attitude of mind is true discipleship, and\n only so far as this is our ruling purpose\n and endeavor can power over unclean\n spirits be conferred upon us.\n</p>\n<p>\n Calling His disciples unto Him, the\n Lord gave them this power. The Lord\n calls to us in every truth about right\n living that we give heed to; and we lis\u00ac\n ten to His call whenever we accept any\n truth as His truth, and therefore as the\n true wisdom of life. This desire for the\n true wisdom of life and willingness to ac\u00ac\n cept it in place of our own wisdom is\n what opens the mind for the true wisdom\n of life to flow in; and in this wisdom is\n all power or authority over evil spirits.\n For no evil or falsity can exist in the\n presence of Divine wisdom. Just as ef\u00ac\n fectually as light dissipates darkness\n does truth dissipate falsity, the falsity is\n evil\u2019s sole defense. The hold that any\u00ac\n thing has upon our life is determined\n solely by the way we think about it and\n feel about it. The truths we profess to\n believe are so ineffective in ridding us\n of our evils simply because of our ob\u00ac\n scure and indefinite conception of them\n and our loose and feeble hold upon them.\n Our prime need, therefore, is clearer\n conceptions of the truth: that is. clear\u00ac\n er conceptions of the right way of look\u00ac\n ing at all the issues and experiences of\n life and of the right way to feel about\n them. The power or authority over\n unclean spirits that the Lord bestows up\u00ac\n on us in the authority of law over dis\u00ac\n order. of right over wrong, of truth over\n falsity, of light over darkness. All this\n is the power of right thought, and right\n purpose. This authority no evil spirit\n or evil influence can withstand. With it\n we can effectually cast out even the most\n insidious invasions of evil upon our life.\n</p>\n<p>\n Such, is the authority over unclean\n spirits that the Lord bestows upon all\n disciples. The only condition necessary\n to receiving it is to be a disciple of the\n Lord. The twelve disciples did not ask\n for this authority. It was a token, and\n the chief token of discipleship. So if\n w T e do not possess this power it is be\u00ac\n cause we are not disciples and the only\n way to get i r is to become a djsciple.\n And becoming a disciple is simply learn\u00ac\n ing now to think in the right way and\n to feel in the right way about all the\n experiences of life, even the most triv\u00ac\n ial, and compelling ourselves to think\n and to feel always in that way and to\n bring all our words and all our acts in\u00ac\n to harmony with that thinking and feel\u00ac\n ing. This is the disciple state of mind\n and w ' ay of life. All that is necessary\n to gain it is to see that this is the chief\n business of our life in this world and\n to give to it the daily study and thought,\n and effort it deserves. And, doing this,\n</p>\n<p>\n authority over unclean spirits to cast\n them out is a pure gift from the Lcrrd\n and that His yoke is indeed easy and His\n burden light.\n</p>\n<p>\n T- < \u25a0\u00bb- T\u2014 \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n REFERENCE BOOKS\n</p>\n<p>\n ON EMMANUEL MOVEMENT\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cPhysiological Psychology\u201d\u2014G.

The great service to human\n comfort and progress of such a vital fact\n lies chiefly, however, in the prolific in\u00ac\n ductions and possibilities of evolution\n that at once confront the inquirer. The\n phenomena are vastly significant to\n personality, and they give an availability\n to the locked treasures of selfhood. We\n must not be deterred from entrance be\u00ac\n cause of our comparative ignorance of\n them, nor because of the evils invoked\n by designing charlatans nor because of the\n injury done by mystery-loving, credulous\n persons. Co-operation spells life. Its\n severance means death. Its interference\n causes disease. Its guidance in true lines\n results in the education of man in God\u00ac\n like living. Whatever be the ultimate\n relations of the two, we may not fear to\n disregard while in the realm of action.\n Here they are concomitant. The physical\n conditions, the mental, and the mental\n enervates and inhibits the physical. With\n this interaction we are vitally concerned.\n</p>\n<p>\n The line of evolutionary approach will\n bring us to the fact of the ultimate su\u00ac\n perior value of the mind. For the mind,\n the organism has been steadily refined\n and specialized. Physiology reveals the\n gap where attention and consciousness\n reside. Common consciousness declares\n for its responsibility. In the breadth\n and depth of our mentality we are aware\n of an incalculable resource of strength\n and harmony. We see this governance\n in :he gross, in the voluntary movements.\n This power of the mind in its more sub\u00ac\n tle phases science traces, but we seldom\n utilize it in life. Its power of redemption\n is the basis of the new psycho-therapeu-\n tics. Health, salvation, perfection are\n from within. The liver may cast its blue\n spell upon ministerial Monday. The las\u00ac\n situde of brain from a too active market\n through the week, may paralyze good in\u00ac\n tentions of the pews on Sunday morn\u00ac\n ing; but science now assures us that the\n mind which stays itself upon ethical and\n spiritual ideas may fear no satanic per\u00ac\n sonification of its nervous system, but\n may go on confident in its vi ctorious and\n happy idealism.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mow with this mental action goes an !\n emotional state, antecedent or succedent. i\n This reinforces the impression of pain or \\\n pleasure, and so prepares a persuasion for 1\n tutur\u00ab action, whether by repetition, in- [\n</p>\n<p>\n Photo by Gardner.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE REV, L, WARD BRIGHAM, FLATBUSH\n</p>\n<p>\n hibition or alternative. In practice it\n will be found that these conditions of\n health-forwarding ideas and feelings have,\n in every age and may be in the present\n age also, been most favorably presented\n in religion. Religion is the thought and\n feeling of man concerning God and man.\n Whether through sympathetic magic, or\n mysticism, or mind power, in every time\n religion has held the greatest curative\n help for the man of that time.

This employment of\n self accords also with our consciousness\n \u2022of personal power.\n</p>\n<p>\n We command the intangible ego within\n and get response proportionate to our\n insistence. We place our ideal before\n the mind\u2019s sight and obtain character of\n the quality we determine. The ability to\n direct thought makes us the arbiters of\n our destiny. There is no fate. All her\n web. intricate though it appear, may be\n unraveled by the determined spirit and\n point by point rewoven to the pattern\n we seek. Whether the stream of con\u00ac\n sciousness be the flow of automatic re\u00ac\n sponse to the impressions received, the\n power to retain and emphasize ideas and\n emotions gives what cadence we select\n to the murmuring current. ' Whether con\u00ac\n sciousness be by some association of\n states, the choice of diverging sequences\n leads us to the north or south, to the\n west or east, as the self shall judge.\n Do we turn to inspect the earth? Or take\n flight to cosmic orbs? Or silently enter\n the land of creative imagination? Our\n course moves forward ever sensitive to\n the pulse beat of our intent. And of\n course action follows, though limping in\n the footsteps of thought. \u201cFor as he\n thinketh in his heart so he is,\u201d is both\n the wisest of proverbs and the most ur\u00ac\n gent of admonitions. In its realization\n man becomes ethical in his career.\n</p>\n<p>\n We need not hesitate before this vision\n of the possible. No chilling voice of ex\u00ac\n perience or deduction calls a halt. No\n boundary lines have as yet been found\n to warn us back from endeavor. Enter\u00ac\n ing into the unknown but seemingly\n boundless realm of personal power we\n need to advance with the utmost caution,\n it is true, lest desire outrun our knowl\u00ac\n edge. Each step must be inspected and\n each effort find a preparation sufficient\n to give it stability and effectiveness.\n But with this caution in mind we may\n turn to the self within, confident that\n resource will prove equal to demand.\n Within those limits set by the great\n Creator we feel we have power of ful\u00ac\n fillment. To awaken a desire that is\n incapable of satisfaction is to upset\n nature. To create an ability impossible\n to develop dethrones reason. The secret\n of recuperation lies solely in the train\u00ac\n ing of the power. In the endowment of\n the ego is to be found the dynamics of\n regeneration\n</p>\n<p>\n It is true that no such principle of\n regeneration could have been possible\n to faith in those former days, \u201cwhen man\n was altogether evil and incapable of\n any good.\u201d But now that science and\n religion unitedly proclaim man\u2019s di\u00ac\n vine endowment we are set at liberty.\n So we turn unabashed by all present\n weaknesses and failures and depravities\n of character and call to the dormant\n manhood within to come forth into light\n and joy and love. It shall henceforth\n live as becometh a child of God. How\n true it is that the first, thought .of child\u00ac\n hood is of its weakness, of its inexperi\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n ence, of its mistakes. Only of our own\n do we whisper loving words of the un\u00ac\n seen possibilities of the future that lie\n in the tottering steps and lisping voice.\n These are but the incidental in a di\u00ac\n vine career. We are children ourselves,\n born with divine breath in our nostril\n and the throb of divine energy in the\n spirit. Call again into the deeps of\n humanity, the resource of the eternal\n shall answer.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this principle of Christian religion\n that \u201cMan is Child of God.\u201d we see\n the background of Psychic Cure.\n</p>\n<p>\n A second principle of healing may be\n stated, \u201cInspiration comes from Social\n Service.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n I presume words need not be multi\u00ac\n plied to carry conviction of this fact.\n Present day activities seem to revolve\n very largely about this fact. The very\n existence of our highly organized society\n is evidence of the cohesive and helpful\n influence of social obligation. Born with\n an instinct for fellowship, ' man finds the\n presence of men to act like some entire\u00ac\n ly beneficent stimulant to his latent or\n indolent pow ' ers. In their company he\n arouses himself and would make re\u00ac\n sponse. It would seem as if the com\u00ac\n petitive system so long wrought into\n mind and brain would have overwhelmed\n altruism. But these need not be ene\u00ac\n mies. The one may be the method of\n application, while the other is the ani\u00ac\n mus of the working spirit. Together they\n may reach a higher good than either\n could separately. Of this I am confident\n that altruism is the normal passion of\n the soul. It calls out the noble and the\n heroic in us.\n</p>\n<p>\n We may take our lesson from peda\u00ac\n gogy. We are told therein that truth\n can best be acquired by teaching. In\n helping another into the light we find\n our own way more bright. Was there\n not an ulterior purpose in the preach\u00ac\n ing tour of the disciples? They did at\n least return full of joy and enthusiasm.\n They received His unique words in a\n plowed soil, and perceived His true\n spirit with quickened sight. Is it not\n ordained that the mind that keeps its\n strength and service for self ends,\n though these ends be in themselves\n right, is blighting at the top? How much\n of social and individual beatification de\u00ac\n pends upon the exercise of humanita\u00ac\n rian qualities, I cannot say. But he who\n is willing to lose self shall find himself\n made strong.\n</p>\n<p>\n In any event we shall claim that such\n altruistic action is most in sympathy with\n the best that we know in ourselves. Sym\u00ac\n pathy, justice, kindness, love\u2014all are im\u00ac\n possible except through a certain quality\n of relation with others. And these are\n the qualities we cherish in the loved ones\n of the home. These are the virtues w r e\n sc in the c. owns of our saints. These\n are the elements of that personal char\u00ac\n acter we long for as an attainment. The\n new attack against our foes is made by\n exercising these functions. Linked to\n other lives by the lines of love and ac\u00ac\n tive service, the buoyant spirit will not\n be overwhelmed by the waves of hysteria.\n So armed and equipped. One need fear\n no \u201cbrain storms\u201d that assail the evil-\n minded and the selfish. Soul in the serv\u00ac\n ice of mankind finds a safe outlet for\n nerve energy and feels the approbation\n of its own idealism. Jesu^ pronounced no\n</p>\n<p>\n esoteric doctrine in the words, \u201cLove thy\n neighbor as thyself.\u201d It had sounded as\n precept through the centuries, and had\n failed to remove man\u2019s hardness of heart\n and habit of mind. Jesus made it a liv\u00ac\n ing reality and it has become the clarion\n call to action for every generation. Upon\n it every enduring society must be built.\n Upon it every healthy and happy life must\n resti\n</p>\n<p>\n Now we must go one step farther. This\n attitude of spirit is a consequent of the\n religious thought of to-day that mankind\n is a solidarity. Social service is bereft\n of its large authority if it depends alone\n upon utility. For somew ' hat within us\n cries out to be noble. So when religion\n proclaims a brotherhood and psychology\n reveals a solidarity of organization and\n nature, brotherly love becomes the ban\u00ac\n ner of a reorganization of all things hu\u00ac\n man. In this endeavor, if we be fully\n enlisted, the old complaints disappear\n and bodily rejuvenation following upon\n spiritual inspiration, leads to accurate\n fulfillment of the text, \" Put off the old\n man, put on the new man.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In this principle of the Christian re\u00ac\n ligion that all men are brothers we find\n a second element in the background of\n psychic cure.\n</p>\n<p>\n A third principle of cv.re w\u2019e state as\n \u201cGod is a final and efficient help.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n However strong an individual may feel\n he awakens some time to a consciousness\n of the need of an outward help. An ex\u00ac\n ternal standard gives him stability, and\n this stability is the source of confidence\n and joy. The craving for such discovery\n and appropriation of deity attends the\n steps of advancing man. Tt is every\n whit as earnest, though perhaps spi. du\u00ac\n alized and clarified, in our present en\u00ac\n lightenment. as ever it has been. This is\n true, because civilization has not les\u00ac\n sened the strain on the individual. The\n stress has increased. So that God is more\n necessary and communion corresponding\u00ac\n ly more helpful in maintenance of our\n poise and conduct.\n</p>\n<p>\n There may be difficulty in conceiving\n how this God reality is to have effective\n presentation in consciousness. I pre\u00ac\n sume it can come no other w r ay than have\n the other elements of our knowledge. It\n will be through such a training in spir\u00ac\n itual thinking and feeling that our ego\n shall thrill responsively with divine be\u00ac\n ing. This is possible because one spir\u00ac\n itual substance is in both God and man.\n When man shall have brought his divine\n nature into divine character, communion\n will be perfect, and not till then. Till\n that time our knowledge must be relative\n and imperfect. Slowly through the eons\n of time our bodies have been differen\u00ac\n tiating until man was possible. Through\n the continuance of this process, perhaps\n in other directions or with other ma\u00ac\n terial, we will come to the final happy\n result. By increasing our activities in\n Godward direction can alone lie possi\u00ac\n bility of beholding Him at last face to\n face. And this Godw ' ard direction is not\n so difficult to discover in practice as it\n might seem. No finite can know the in\u00ac\n finite. Yet the finite is a part of that in\u00ac\n finite, and knows that particular part of\n the infinite; and in so far as that part\n qualitatively reveals the nature of the\n whole, it knows the whole.

One with God is\n majority. But one with a heavenly Father\n is unanimity. And this is what divine\n love means. No other sort of affection\n means anything for us. As fatherhood is\n the biggest of our human ideals so it\n becomes the final name we give to the\n Eternal. It is time that the birch-rod\n idea of God\u2019s discipline should pass, and\n we understand that unalloyed love may\n be as exacting and compelling through\n persuasion, as fear can ever be. Fear\n paralyzes into docile obedience, but love\n quickens into a like expression. The ap\u00ac\n peal of the stricken in body to this love\n is not in vain. It may not be in every\n case the cessation of the pain or the dis\u00ac\n ease, hut it does mean transfiguration\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n the empowering of the human with the\n divine. Here is a regenerating force\n which is little availed of now. But as we\n thus pray and struggle to \u201chave the mind\n of Jesus in us\u201d we shall be aware that\n the divine is not quiescent. There is lack\u00ac\n ing on his part no expenditure of himself,\n except such as might lessen the glory,\n and joy of the achievement in our minds.\n The cross was its revelation and told of\n love\u2019s willingness even to its own immo\u00ac\n lation. To recall then in the midst of\n sorrow and suffering that, \u201cour Redeemer\n liveth\u201d and that with Him there is plen-\n tious redemption is to face in the right\n direction. To trust His strength and\n promises is to have won already. To\n know the magnitude and tenderness of\n God\u2019s love is to feel the pulse of the\n Eternal in helpful sympathy with us.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this strictly modern interpretation\n of Christian religion \u201cThe Fatherhood of\n God,\u201d lies the final element in the back\u00ac\n ground of psychic-cure.\n</p>\n<p>\n In conclusion, multitudes are being\n</p>\n<p>\n deeply stirred by the Emmanuel Church\n Movements and are wondering if it is real\n gain to Christian life.

But it represent j to me a\n sane, logical and practical application of\n spiritual power.

When we see that its\n pOwer really lies in a fresh and com\u00ac\n pleter realization of Christianity, we\n shall advance with confidence, albeit with\n caution, because we see how it is con\u00ac\n nected vitally with the past experience\n and life of man. The divine nature of\n man, the brotherhood of man, the uni\u00ac\n versal Fatherhood of God, constitute the\n religious background through which the\n grace of God and the spirit of man shall\n co-operate unto the bringing in of peace,\n health, righteousness, joy.\n</p>\n<p>\n Confession, Restitution\n</p>\n<p>\n Sermon preaelied by Rev. A. W. H,\n Hodiler, on March 29, in the Bap\u00ac\n tist Church of the Redeemer,\n Flatbnsh, Brooklyn.\n</p>\n<p>\n ' TEXT\u2014Bear ye one another ' s burdens and\n so fulfill the law of Christ; every man shall\n bear his own burden \u2014Galatians vi:2 and 5.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is with timidity we enter into the\n teaching of holy Scripture in connection\n with the modern movement of that which\n is called the \u201cEmmanuel School\u201d of Bos\u00ac\n ton, taken up by Bishop Fellows of Chi\u00ac\n cago and Dr. MacDonald of Brooklyn with\n followers in many cities. We have\n spoken on \u201cChrist\u2019s approach to sin and\n his recognition of it. rather than a de\u00ac\n nial of the fact.\u201d We have called your\n attention to \u201cthe possessing of the mind\n which was in Christ, Jesus.\u201d To-day we\n shall endeavor to seek more light on the\n question by consideration of confession\n and restitution as a means to improve\n physical and mental conditions. ^Ve\n make bold to say part of the teaching\n is too superficial, and that it does not\n penetrate to the core, and that some of\n it is too philosophical to reach the com\u00ac\n mon people, who heard Jesus gladly. We\n also make bold to say divine things are\n looked for from moral sources and not\n divine laws. There are some things\n which are absolutely essential before we\n can make any progress whatever. They\n are in the teaching of Jesus and in the\n eternal law of how to make things right.\n It is not our desire to raise any ecclesi\u00ac\n astical controversy or to defend any\n sacramental institution of a few. We\n shall merely look into the face of an ac\u00ac\n cepted essential fact and leave men to\n decide the issue of the. question. \u201cIs\n confession necessary to relief of body?\u2019\n If so, to whom? Has the law of resti\u00ac\n tution. or making good, anything to do\n with my health of spirit, soul and body?\n W T e give no verdict, as it is too sacred\n</p>\n<p>\n a thing for any man to decide. W T e only\n try to get at facts and bv God\u2019s help to\n assist another man to carry his burden\n and advise how he shall be able to rid\n himself of his burden. We admit the\n superficial treatment in so short a time,\n but leave the thought for the quiet hour\n of deeper thinking and working.\n</p>\n<p>\n The sum of human happiness in this\n world is indebted to the feeling of sym\u00ac\n pathy. The power to make glad the\n heart of others, to extend effectual re\u00ac\n lief, to give vigor, gladness, inspiration\n and endurance, is in the possibility of\n every man. A warm hand which has\n touched yours in the hour of your defeat,\n or desolation or bereavement, has given\n a thrill of living response to your emo\u00ac\n tion. This is the voice of common ex\u00ac\n perience. Sympathy is a key word for\n the proper treatment of weak natures\n and distressed souls. It partakes of\n the spirit of Cnrist and fulfills the law.\n The apostle urges us to place our shoul\u00ac\n ders under another man ' s loacl and help\n him carry it, to put our heart against his\n heart and feel another\u2019s woe.\n</p>\n<p>\n Before we go any further it is neces\u00ac\n sary for us to recognize the emphasis be\u00ac\n ing placed upon physical healing by\n mental and spiritual processes. Of the\n making of many books there is no end,\n and cults are becoming almost as nu\u00ac\n merous as denominations. However, it is\n here, and valid testimony proves its\n worth. It is enlisting the best thought\n of science and combining the teaching\n of Jesus. It is in harmony with spir\u00ac\n itual moral and physical law. We should\n not be afraid of it or attack it, or call\n it names. We should be honest, open-\n hearted, sincere and earnest in the\n search |or truth: for it is the truth\n which sets us free. Mention has been\n made of obstructions which lie in the\n way. These obstacles have been classi\u00ac\n fied as mental, physical, environment,\n</p>\n<p>\n ignorance and lack of faith. The en\u00ac\n deavor is to remove these by a knowl\u00ac\n edge of law, bringing the soul Into har\u00ac\n mony with the laws of nature and God.\n But in the treatment of all cases which\n properly come under the control of phy\u00ac\n sical, mental or spiritual laws there must\n be a willingness on the part of the pa\u00ac\n tient to lay bare the secret of their\n heart to either God or man, before an\u00ac\n other can get under the burden and as\u00ac\n sist in its carying or destruction. This\n may seem a radical measure, but it is\n an axiom as clear as two and two make\n four. The lack of confession to Al\u00ac\n mighty God; the lack of restitution to\n wronged men; and the lack of confidence\n in Christian brotherhood have caused\n and are causing spiritual poverty, mental\n distress and physical suffering more than\n we at first give thought to. Absolute\n surrender of secret sin, full restitution\n and sincere Confidence are essentials in\n burden bearing, for full relief to soul,\n mind and body.\n</p>\n<p>\n We are to be understood as treating\n the subject of confession to God, sincere\n confidence in men and restitution to the\n wronged man, in their relation to mental\n and physical conditions, and not in any\n ecclesiastical teaching whatever. Just\n downright practical common sense. Can\n our steps be made lighter? Can w\u00ab\n sunshine into our countenance? Can we\n enjoy better health in every way by the\n means of an open, clean-breasted confes\u00ac\n sion? In the thought of to-day we place\n to one side all the various suggestions of\n the many named schools, and come di\u00ac\n rectly face to face with God and maa.\n Although at times we act very much as5\n Naaman, the leper, who spurned the\n prophet\u2019s instruction and was told by his\n servant: \u201cIf the prophet h ad bid thee do\n some great, thing, wouldst thou not have\n done it?\u201d Why seek some mysterious\n r.

Why carry a burden\n when relief can be had by throwing off\n the albatross which hangs about our\n necks?\n</p>\n<p>\n We wish to raise no controversy as to\n the establishment of a confessional in\n this modern movement for improved\n health. However, aside from the sincere\n confession to Almighty God. there must\n exist a confidence between spiritual lead\u00ac\n ers and their people\u2014the same trust as\n between the physician and patient; also\n as between lawyer and client. Men must\n not only make themselves right with God.\n but they must also make themselves right\n with men. especially when they have\n wronged not only God, but men; and more\n strictly is this true when there exists the\n possibility of restitution. One of the\n fundamental secrets to both a contented\n mind\u2014and thus an improved physical\n state\u2014is the unburdening of the heart,\n and thus have the aid of a burden bearer.\n</p>\n<p>\n We acknowledge the ease with w- ' nich\n we can come to God and the eternal si\u00ac\n lence which covers our transgression. Wo\n know the search of our sin is never\n opened to the world. We have often\n heard the Spirit whis, er. \u201cThy sins are\n forgiven thee,\u201d \u201cGo and sin no more\u201d;\n yet, somehow, w r e come away still carry\u00ac\n ing our burden. Oh. if there could only\n be some blotting out from memory; if\n wo could only put an eternal blank in\n some places of our lives! Oh, if we could\n only whisper in some ear, confide in some\n heart, have someone help and not be\u00ac\n tray us. then would our burden be lighter\n and our spirit and nature transformed!\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1857 Lady Georgiana Fullerton of\n England published her book called \u201cEllen\n Middleton.\u201d At the time of writing she\n was a member of the Tractarian party of\n the Anglican Church, led by Newman.\n Manning and Pusey. In her story she en\u00ac\n deavors to show the absolute necessity\n of the establishment of the confessional,\n for the unburdening of the soul. Ellen\n Middleton believed she was partly the\n cause of the death of her cousin Julia.\n In endeavoring to restrain the foolish\n child Julia from climbing an old moss-\n covered, slippery staircase of Elmsley\n Priory, she became angry and struck\n her cousin a blow which caused the loss\n of her foothold, and falling down the\n staircase, she rolled into the river and\n was drowned. Ellen Middleton, believ\u00ac\n ing there was no eye witness to the\n tragic ending of the life of her cousin\n Julia, and knowing in her heart there\n never was the slightest intent to destroy\n life, took up the duties of life, but was\n never free from the crushing burden of\n that awful hour. After some years Ellen\n Middleton was wooed and won in mar\u00ac\n riage, and apparently lived in peace and\n happiness, but nevs-r the natural woman\n sha should have been, owing to the car\u00ac\n rying of her secret alone. A few more\n</p>\n<p>\n years pass by, and an old acquaintance\n returns,demands her desertion of her hus\u00ac\n band; if not, he w r ould disclose the secret\n of her life, for he - as eye-witness to the\n tragedy. Her husband discovers her on\n her knees pleading for mercy and to be\n let alone. This act is misinterpreted, in\n ignorance of the facts, and separation fol\u00ac\n lows. her life destroyed by the carrying\n of her secret alone.\n</p>\n<p>\n Shortly after publication \u201cGladstone\u201d\n reviewed the book, and, while not indors\u00ac\n ing the claim for a confessional, he advo\u00ac\n cated the need of an establishment of\n confidence between spiritual leaders and\n advisers for mutual btirden bearing. Are\n we not safe in declaring the very root of\n much physical and mental trouble and\n sorrow lies in the fact of a secret, which\n our pride or shame will not disclose? We\n are willing to make our confession to\n Almighty God. for we know of His eter\u00ac\n nal silence; but we fear men lest there\n be a disclosure and we come into living\n disgrace. Human hearts are ready to leave\n their sin with God and forget its past\n and press toward the mark of its high\n calling. But are human hearts ready to\n forget the past of others? Are we eager\n to stand at the jail door and put our arms\n about the jail bird, not necessarily a\n prison with iron bars but to deliver them\n out of an eternal dungeon and help them\n in a fresh start of life and keep eternal\n silence? How shall we relieve the con\u00ac\n science in its troubles with some weighty\n matter? The heaviness of guilt and deep\n anguish is on its soul. Perhaps that soul\n has been more sinned against than sin\u00ac\n ning. It suffers alone, fear is in its eye,\n dread of man in its countenance. Its\n step is slow and it moves with bowed\n head. Is there any possible way by\n which we can bear one another\u2019s burdens,\n by a mutual confidence?\n</p>\n<p>\n Our text is more than a counsel to \u201csup\u00ac\n port the weak,\u201d \u201cto be patient toward all\n men.\u201d Our personal gratification is not\n to be the rule for the exercise of our\n Christian liberty. We must thoroughly\n fulfill the law of Christ, \u201cThat ye love\n one another.\u201d There could be no burden\u00ac\n bearing except from a principle of love,\n</p>\n<p>\n | and the fulfillment of duty implies a ful\u00ac\n fillment of Christ\u2019s law. We must re\u00ac\n move our hard and unsympathetic sense\n that we may know the need of others, for\n w ' ho can tell the hour when we may be\n overtaken in a fault and shall need all a\n brother\u2019s sympathy?\n</p>\n<p>\n But the apostle tells us every man\n shall bear his own burden and the teach\u00ac\n ing of Jesus tells us we may lift this, too.\n Every man must have a personal initia\u00ac\n tive; his own will must be first aid to re\u00ac\n lief. Hundreds of cases of melancholia,\n nervous breakdown, self-reproach, etc.,\n have baffled every sane remedy suggested\n by competent counsel. They are chronic,\n ter they will not will to be cured. And\n</p>\n<p>\n as long as we remain free will agents we\n must not only consent, but aid willingly\n and open freely every channel which will\n bring us relief. However, many are ready\n to follow this line of treatment providing\n it costs nothing, that it will not demand\n some surrender of pride; that it will not\n cause any humiliation, that it will not\n compel me to sacrifice social position or\n ill-gotten gain, that it will not cause me\n to drive the skeleton out of the closet of\n my life. And we must be understood in\n the question of restitution or making\n good, not in a financial sense only, but to\n make good in everything we have made\n wrong. You say, this is too revolutionary.\n This may be to some, but a sharp knife is\n necessary to dig deep for the cutting of\n the roots of cancer. How in God\u2019s name\n can new thought, or substituted thought,\n or faith cure, or knowledge of any law. or\n suggestion of any principle bring desired\n relief, when w r e will not pay the price?\n It\u2019s not always unbelief or lack of faith\n that is the hindering rock; it\u2019s because\n it\u2019s going to cost something. You say it\u2019s\n too radical, it\u2019s against common sense, it\n will upset society. Why, men will be re\u00ac\n vealed in their true character; some will\n be found to be thieves who always posed\n as honest; uome will be revealed as hypo\u00ac\n crites who wore halos; some will be dis\u00ac\n covered to have used any means for the\n end, so the end was all right. The price\n of virtue, of honor, of blood has been paid\n for my ends. What! Shall I make it\n known, to have heart\u2019s ease and a new\n health? We admit some physical condi\u00ac\n tions are caused by mental and moral\n diseases. We admit some physical con\u00ac\n ditions are not caused by mental or moral\n diseases, and are willing to submit in\n the most heroic way to any measure of\n suffering if we can only be saved to this\n life. What is the reason of our positive\n refusal to submit to the same principle\n as applied to mental and moral diseases?\n</p>\n<p>\n It is at this point the question of con\u00ac\n fession comes in. We feel we are safe\n with God. His eternal quiet holds the se\u00ac\n cret of our hearts, but his eternal com\u00ac\n mand is also to make good. What shall\n be our attitude toward those whom we\n have wronged? Many instances have\n passed where restitution is impossible,\n but we may not have passed the point of\n confession for forgiveness. God grant\n that in these fearfully serious times we\n may be led by the eternal light of His\n holy spirit t- do that which is right both\n to God and man.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWherefore if thy hand or thy foot of\u00ac\n fend thee, cut them off and cast them from\n thee: it is better for thee to enter into\n life halt or maimed rather than having\n two hands or two feet to be cast into\n everlasting fire. And if thine eye offend\n thee, pluck it out and cast it from thee:\n it is better for thee to enter into life\n with one eye rather than having two eye3\n to be cast into hell fire \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 1\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0027/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 185, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0027/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 371, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 559}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0027/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 742, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1119}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0027/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1484, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2238}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0027/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2968, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4476}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0027/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/em/ma/nu/el/mo/ve/me/nt/00/un/se/emmanuelmovement00unse/emmanuelmovement00unse_0027.jp2", "height": 4476, "width": 2968, "levels": 6, "size": 950795}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"27\">\n<p>\n THE EMMANUEL MOVEMENT,\n</p>\n<p>\n 25\n</p>\n<p>\n Suggestive Therapeutics\n</p>\n<p>\n Sermon preached by Rev.

And his servant was healed in\n the selfsame hour.\u2014Matthew viii:13.\n</p>\n<p>\n In continuing this theme of the Theory\n and Practice of Suggestive Therapeutics,\n it. is not my purpose to expound novel\u00ac\n ties or to satisfy curiosity, but to assist\n all of you who worship here to lay hold\n of some of the great principles within\n this movement by which it will be pos\u00ac\n sible for you to live confidently and joy\u00ac\n fully. I should be glad to make all of\n you practitioners of the art of suggestive\n therapeutics. There are a few great\n principles which it is essential you\n should honor and obey. First\u2014the power\n of suggestion. In previous discourses I\n have spoken to you of the theory of the\n subcon sciousness; and therefore I need\n not expound it here again. But no con\u00ac\n sideration of the moral life of man can\n ever afford to ignore for a moment the\n determinative character of those actions\n that take place in the subconsciousness\n under the influence of suggestion. We\n have been wont to be optimistic about\n everything that takes place in our lives,\n provided nothing evil appears at once on\n the surface. We have proceeded on the\n faith that the psychical system could\n take up and dispose successfully of every\n suggestion made to it. Evil thoughts,\n envy, anger, greed, concupiscence, glut\u00ac\n tony\u2014all the vices abhorred by St. Paxil\n might present their vile pictures to the\n mind, and as long as we did not act on\n their suggestion, we still preserved our\n character. We deluded ourselves with a\n hope that we were what we appeared to\n be. And now we have had to learn\n af esh the truth of that scripture: \u201cAs a\n man thinketh in his heart, so is he.\u201d T\n know of no process in man\u2019s life more\n calculated to give him serious thought\n than this function of the subconscious\u00ac\n ness of storing up and storing up the\n suggestions that the outer life brings.\n Day by day as we touch the world, and\n get our own reactions of courage or\n cowardice, of self-control or self-defeat,\n of purity or selfishness, of love or hate,\n we are continually dropping, dropping\n these suggestions into the reservoir of\n this subconscious self, to come forth\n some day to bless or curse. Abraham\n Lincoln lives day by day the sacrificial\n life of the burden-bearer of this people.\n Day by day, hour by hour, he gives him\u00ac\n self the suggestions of devotion, sacrifice\n and faith; and then, when the hour for\n utterance has come, takes up his pen\n and writes on a few scattered sheets the\n supreme English masterpiece of half a\n</p>\n<p>\n century. Benedict Arnold was always\n passionate and revengeful. Day after\n day, year after year, the reaction of life\n on him resulted in suggesting to his\n deeper self hate, envy, pride, and self-\n will. When his hour for expression\n came, he took up his pen to sign his\n name to the betrayal of his trust. There\n is nothing in the process of the soul that\n needs to cause us more of joy and more\n of fear than this amenability of the soul\n to suggestion.\n</p>\n<p>\n Secondly, you must come to a new\n realization of the supreme place of the\n will. Heredity must have some place\n in the formation of character, although\n that place is not yet very clearly deter\u00ac\n mined\u2014but the most weighty discovery\n of the present day seems to me this re\u00ac\n discovery of the regal power of the will\n to do right! These psychologists, and\n hypnotists, in their investigations into\n the unexplored tracts of personality\n have come across not only a God-like\n aspiration after virtue in every soul, but\n also an unlimited power for the attain\u00ac\n ment of that aspiration. Just as the\n Master of Life stooped over the\n cripple, saying, \" Arise and walk \" : and\n knew that within that stricken form there\n was the ability to rise and walk; so mod\u00ac\n ern psychology stoops over every sinful\n soul and repeats the Scripture command,\n \" Be ye therefore perfect,\u201d for ye are in\n the image of your Father in heaven, who\n is perfect. This is a tremendous doctrine\n of individual responsibility It is an old\n scriptural doctrine, but it gains a new\n force when, by the modern hypnotists\u2019\n appeal to the soul of goodness in a man,\n yoxi see the drunkard go forth a new man,\n the spendthrift reformed and the Invalid\n made well. If there are In us these pos\u00ac\n sibilities of virtue, there is no escape for\n us from the responsibility of attaining\n that for which we were created. There\n has come to us the conviction that in\u00ac\n spired Jeremiah: \" In those days they\n shall say no more. The fathers have\n eaten sour grapes, and the children\u2019s\n teeth are set on edge. But every one shall\n die for his own iniquity; every man that\n eateth the sour grapes his teeth shall be\n set on edge.\u201d There is no more proper\n incentive to earnest living than the real\u00ac\n ization of the fact that God has intended\n life to be perfect, for every creature; and\n that if it is otherwise, the fault is in our\u00ac\n selves.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cDark is the world to thee: thyself art\n the reason why.\u201d Whoever would possess\n the reality of the Christian life must\n achieve the victory over his moods: and\n the most heartening message of this or\n any age is that by our God-given endow\u00ac\n ment of the will it is possible for us to\n give to the deeper life of the soul the\n suggestions of courage and faith and pa\u00ac\n tience and strength, which altogether\n mean eternal life.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the third place, you will have to\n form for yourself very likely a new, arid\n very stern, doctrine of sin and virtue.\n The old doctrine of a forensic justifica\u00ac\n tion before God was an admirable thing\n to look at, but it did not work very well\n either for the justified or for his family.\n Those who deemed themselves \u201csaved\u201d\n very often failed to possess the homely\n virtues of cheerfulness, kindness, courage\n and forgiveness: while many who were\n obviously \u201cgood\u201d were not conscious of\n salvation. The religion of to-day gives\n the genuinely \u201cgood\u201d man his due. and\n placards in their proper place these hate\u00ac\n ful sins of unkindness, intolerance, mood\u00ac\n iness, worry and hardness of heart. It is\n a great service that any sect bestows\n when that body of people stands forth to\n proclaim that the ills of the flesh have\n an origin in the ills of the mind, and\n that the thoughts that issue in these\n bodily ills are sins against the High and\n Holy One. From whatever source de\u00ac\n rived, the conviction of the necessity of\n controlling the outbreaks of our evil\n moods would be the greatest conceivable\n blessing in so-called Christian homes.\n</p>\n<p>\n | This is surely no new gospel. All this\n teaching is from both Christ and the\n apostles; but it is undeniable that the\n recent presentation of it has amounted\n almost to a discovery.\n</p>\n<p>\n I would not do injustice to the idealfc\n of any former age, or of any other school\n of thought; hut I believe that we do have\n here a somewhat different ideal of char\u00ac\n acter from that to which we have previ\u00ac\n ously looked. The \" merely good\u201d man\n who has been the target for many homi\u00ac\n lies becomes worthy of imitation. He is\n seen to be the one, who, obedient to the\n Master ' s injunction cherishes pure and\n true thoughts, suggests virtue and self-\n control to himself, avoids the sins of\n omission and commission, and reaps the\n reward in this world and the next. Many\n Christian people. I believe, will find\n themselves not a little relieved to be\n able to entertain frankly, and in a regu\u00ac\n lar way. these convictions which, in the\n form of secret suspicion, they have\n always held.\n</p>\n<p>\n The fourth principle which must govern\n your thought is that of the very great in\u00ac\n fluence that we exercise over one another.\n If you believe in the telepathic communi\u00ac\n cation of one subconscious mind with\n another, you will believe that the condi\u00ac\n tion of your subliminal consciousness\u2014c >\n irritation, or quiet, of hope or fear\u2014even\n though you speak no word, will affect\n those associated with you. In no hazy\n way. but very definitely, then, we are our\n brother ' s keepers, responsible for the\n world\u2019s stock of cheer and faith. The\n home is the peculiar field for the opera\u00ac\n tion of this subconscious power. There\n the quickest of sympathy exists, there in*\n fluence is felt most readily and moat\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0028/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 188, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 278}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0028/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 376, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 557}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0028/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 752, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1115}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0028/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1504, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2230}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0028/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3008, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4460}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0028/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/em/ma/nu/el/mo/ve/me/nt/00/un/se/emmanuelmovement00unse/emmanuelmovement00unse_0028.jp2", "height": 4460, "width": 3008, "levels": 6, "size": 1063244}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"28\">\n<p>\n (5\n</p>\n<p>\n THE EMMANUEL MOVEMENT.\n</p>\n<p>\n deeply. The atmosphere of a htune,\n although a hackeneyed term, expresses a\n clearly defined reality. The atmosphere\n is the spirit of the house, emanating from\n the deep well of the subconscious mind of\n the homekeeper. God has created no more\n gracious figure in his great world than\n that of the wife and mother, who gives to\n the very place of her abode her own\n quiet, buoyant, soothing spirit. What\n she is in the unsounded deeps of her being\n will appear in time in the house where\n she dwells and in the faces of the little\n children that look up to her. On the\n other hand, the home of the card-club\n woman and the home of the gadabout!\n Who does not know them and shudder at\n the thought? Their atmosphere is that of\n restlessness and spiritual poverty. Woe\n betide her children and her husband; for\n she cannot give them, after their day of\n temptations and vexation, that by which\n they are renewed, the spirit of peace and\n quiet confidence in good.\n</p>\n<p>\n II. Now. it wdll sometimes happen that,\n despite our best endeavors, we shall be\n overborne in the press. Illness comes on,\n whatever the cause, and the causes are\n often complex. What are we to do?\n Every physician would join with me. I\n believe, in saying: make the spiritual\n attitude correct. To use the terminology\n of the books, give yourself the auto-sug\u00ac\n gestions of courage, confidence in God,\n faith in His willingness and pow ' er to\n care for and restore you. Make it the\n genuine conviction of your spirit that\n God does provide for all his creatures.\n Rest in the promises of divine health\n with which the scriptures abound. If\n there is any cause of irritation, remove\n it, if it be possible, by the right action on\n your part. Nothing is more irritating\n than harboring a vigorous grudge. I need\n not remind you how strictly scriptural\n is all this method of creating a correct\n mental attitude; and I believe that your\n own careful observation would come to\n my support in the statement that the\n great majority of the diseases from which\n our households suffer can be finally traced\n to the. fret and ambition of our present\n life. As the pastor, then, of your souls\n and the minister of the Lord Jesus Christ,\n who, through faith, restored the body, I\n would exhort you to cultivate to the\n utmost the virtues that Christ always in\u00ac\n sisted upon\u2014trust in God. humility, self-\n forgetfulness. forgiveness, sincerity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Still, in many cases, the conditions of\n ill health will continue. What is to be\n done then? Manifestly, if the trouble be\n serious, it is the time to employ the\n physician, who can diagnose the case and\n prescribe the regulations under which re\u00ac\n covery can be most rapid. I earnestly\n hope that in the excitement of this new\n discovery of the therapeutic power that\n is in the mind no one here will believe\n that he is privileged to sin against either\n himself or his brother. All laws of action\n are laws of God. The best results ensue\n when we learn how to use all of God\u2019s\n laws in harmony with each other. Quin\u00ac\n ine is just as much a creation of the\n divine spirit as is the mind of man, and\n we may as well acknowledge that in\u00ac\n fection is a process likely to take place\n under prevailing conditions, unless guard\u00ac\n ed against.\n</p>\n<p>\n The employment of mental healing in\n cases of physical disorder is the employ\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n ment of a therapeutic agency. You may\n use medicines if you see fit and they\n sproduce the results, although as a mat\u00ac\n ter of fact medical practice of the pres\u00ac\n ent day makes less and less of the treat\u00ac\n ment by drugs and more and more of the\n treatment by the natural agencies of rest,\n air and water. On the other hand, you\n may employ the mental healer, provided\n your own spirit is so attuned to the\n spiritual life that you are able to receive\n its benefits. My own belief is that those\n who are wonted to the spiritual life\u2014by\n which I mean the life of communion with\n God through prayer, the life of faith in\n a controlling power, and of interest in\n the life of the spirit in its higher mani\u00ac\n festations\u2014are best prepared for the re\u00ac\n ception of these benefits. No one can be\n benefited who sets himself even secretly\n against his healer, who prefers his own\n will and way to the will and way of\n God. or who cherishes a false self pride\n in his own condition. The only way of\n restoration is the sincere and humble com\u00ac\n mittal of oneself into the hands of God\n that he may work his restoring will. One\n must learn the very heart of the meaning\n of the sixth chapter of Matthew, the\n core of which is insistence upon the neces\u00ac\n sity of the genuine union of the life of\n man with God. If there is one place in\n which no deception is possible it is in\n this relation of life to God. Whoever the\n healer may be. the pre-requisite to suc\u00ac\n cess is the sincere desiro of the patient\n to be helped. Greater than the desire of\n having one\u2019s own way. and of cherish\u00ac\n ing one\u2019s own foible, must be the desire\n to receive that more abundant life that\n Christ came to bring.\n</p>\n<p>\n Therefore, while, on the one hand, this\n is only a system of therapeutics, on jthe\n other it is a system the success of which\n is so intimately related to the attitude of\n a man\u2019s spirit toward the infinite that it\n becomes a matter of religion.\n</p>\n<p>\n OPINIONS FROM FAR AND NEAR.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the Editor of the Eagle Library:\n</p>\n<p>\n I am in thorough sympathy with the\n Emmanuel Movement.It\u2019s a return to first\n principles. Christianity means God-with-\n humanity. The whole gospel makes peo\u00ac\n ple whole in body, mind and soul. What\n the world needs is God: and that is what\n the world has in Christ. We become\n partakers of the divine nature when we\n surrender to God in Christ. This sur\u00ac\n render should be complete, body, mind\n and soul. This surrender involves the\n use of all the means and powers that God\n has put at our disposal. God helps those\n who help themselves by giving them the\n power to do this. We assimilate God by\n faith and He becomes ourselves and we\n become God-like. God is the one cure for\n the w ' hole man. ROBERT E. PEELE.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ebenezer. S. C.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the Editor of the Brooklyn Eagle:\n</p>\n<p>\n The Emmanuel Movement has come to\n stay. In it we have an \u201capplied Chris\u00ac\n tianity,\u201d to make use of Dr. Washington\n Gladden\u2019s phrase.

The Christian world has\n not expected enough of Christianity; in\n a real sense, Jesus Christ\u2019s religion has\n never been fully tried. If our leaders\n in this new thought do not become ex\u00ac\n tremists, it bids fair to spread as a\n</p>\n<p>\n green bay tree. Thus far sane and seri\u00ac\n ous men have concerned themselves in\n the Emmanuel Movement and may it\n ever be so! \u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n ROBERT C. GRANBERRY,\n Minister. Tuskegee (Ala.) Baptist Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the Editor of the Brooklyn Eagle:\n</p>\n<p>\n For a great many years I have been\n looking for just what this Emmanuel\n Movement is giving us\u2014a clear, rational,\n scientific basis for the presentation of\n what I believe to be a sadly neglected\n truth.\n</p>\n<p>\n Years ago I heard John Alexander\n Dowie, when he first came to this coun\u00ac\n try. 1 have watched his work with great\n interest. Then I saw the work of Mrs.\n Eddy and her school, and some of the\n many other \u201cfaith healers.\u201d I could not\n swallow the great amount of chaff that\n they gave with the grain of truth that\n undoubtedly was there.\n</p>\n<p>\n Their success in cures demonstrated\n that they had hold of a truth, their suc\u00ac\n cess in getting the ear of the people in\u00ac\n dicated that they had something for\n which the world was seeking; and their\n many failures\u2014and tragic failures they\n were, too. sometimes\u2014caused me to look\n deeper for the underlying truth that I\n was sure they were after.\n</p>\n<p>\n I am glad that the Emmanuel Move\u00ac\n ment has been launched, and I want to\n thank you for giving it publicity. I am\n sure that it will be of great value to\n the church, the clergy and mankind in\n general. W. E. J. GRATZ.\n</p>\n<p>\n Elizabeth, N. J., April 3, 1908.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the Editor of the Brooklyn Eagle:\n</p>\n<p>\n I find much in the Emmanuel Move\u00ac\n ment, as interpreted and exploited by Dr.\n Robert MacDonald, to cordially commend,\n and very little that I am prepared to\n criticise. Whatever else it is, it is a\n serious effort to do again for men the\n work the Divine Master wrought on their\n behalf whele He was on the earth. The\n movement must find its vindication in\n the results achieved. In this, as in every\n other thing, the fruit must declare the\n quality of the tree. If disturbed spirits\n are pacified, if sick bodies are healed,\n if discouraged souls are reassured, if\n wrecked lives are rehabilitated\u2014the work\n cannot be of the devil, for these are\n none of his concerns, but is assuredly\n of God. Whether the result come by\n the use of scientific process, or in im\u00ac\n mediate response to believing prayer, it\n is equally of God in either instance. Not\n by any means more so in the latter than\n in the former instance.\n</p>\n<p>\n I read with lively interest Dr. Mac\u00ac\n Donald\u2019s able exposition of the princi\u00ac\n ples of the movement, and wait with\n something like confident expectancy their\n practical application.\n</p>\n<p>\n T. B. THAMES.\n</p>\n<p>\n Pastor First Baptist Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n Elizabeth. N. J., April 3, 1908.\n</p>\n<p>\n What do I thinl: of the Emmanuel\n Movement?\n</p>\n<p>\n The church is here to save souls, not\n bodies. It should work for eternity, not\n time. To philanthropy, which is-an ad\u00ac\n junct of, but not Christianity, is rele\u00ac\n gated hospital, educational and charitable\n \u25a0work. These always follow in the wake\n of Christian civilization, unlike any other\n religion.\n</p>\n<p>\n For the church to spend its time and\n effort on these lower and less important\n matters would be as if firemen, sufn-\n moned to a fire, should save the stuff and\n not the humans, or should ' sit down to\n feasting while the flames gained peril\u00ac\n ous headway. \u201cThe King\u2019s business\u201d re\u00ac\n quires haste. Besides, all this talk of\n \u201chypnotic touch,\u201d \u201csub-consciousness,\u201d\n \u201cthought producing disease as readily as\n germs,\u201d etc., smacks of too much of\n Christian Science and Spiritualism and\n their ilk, and it\u2019s a poor rule that doesn\u2019t\n work both ways, for evil as well as good,\n when the Divine is ignored.\n</p>\n<p>\n I.

Consider\u00ac\n able impatience was shown by my au\u00ac\n dience at my spending time to elaborate\n</p>\n<p>\n Never before in the history of the\n world have the physician of the body and\n the physician of the soul been more in\u00ac\n telligently at one. This has been brought\n about by the conviction that each has to\n do with the other\u2019s sphere of usefulness.\n The church no longer ministers to the\n soul and ignores the man. The medical\n practitioner no longer treats the body and\n ignores the man. Both are heeding the\n divine call as never before to attend to\n the necessities of the entire man. From\n the religious side this has been going on\n some time. The so-called institutional\n church with gymnasium, employment bu\u00ac\n reau. reading room, citizenship league and\n industrial department to teach poor girls\n cooking, sewing, millinery and general\n .housekeeping, and poor boys competency\n in the trades and arts is a recognition\n of the call. And the Emmanuel Move\u00ac\n ment, which is a rational establishing on\n scriptural grounds of the many hereto\u00ac\n fore sporadic attempts within the church\n and without to banish disease, carries this\n desire to remedy the whole man Into the\n physical realm with amazingly beneficial\n results.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the other hand, the medical profes\u00ac\n sion is awakening to a new responsibility. ,\n though some of the best physicians took 1\n it up long ago, namely, to use all psychic\n and natural forces as curative power for\n diseases beyond the reach of drugs and\n surgery. Dr. Schofield, of the British\n Medical Association, whose illuminating\n work \u201cThe Mental Factor in Medicine \"\n should be in every home, claims that phil\u00ac\n osophy. theology and medicine touch each\n other, and that there is a transition\n ground that is common to all. On this\n ground, he continues, the physician should\n stand with as much authority as the\n priest and philosopher. The church, he |\n exclaims, no longer treats the soul and [\n ignores the man. but the case of the hu- \u25a0\n man being as a whole, soul and body, is\n increasingly coming to the front. And in\n the same way the wise physician must\n grasp the underlying unity of the spirit\u00ac\n ual and the material, and recognize that\n if the body may and does influence dis\u00ac\n eases of the soul, so does the mind influ\u00ac\n ence states and diseases of the body.\u201d I\n utterly refuse, he continues, to regard\n the mental factor in medicine as a retro\u00ac\n gression. It is on the contrary a step,\n and a great step, in advance, for the day\n is past when the physician can limit his\n</p>\n<p>\n a point \" Which to them seemed so obvious,\n and afterwards they told me the day was\n past when the conception of Christianity\n was limited to the soul.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Laycock, an eminent English\n physician, claims that the most eminent\n and successful physicians have all been\n psychologists, for the knowledge of a\n practical science of mind is fundament\u00ac\n ally necessary to the practice of medi\u00ac\n cine. Professor Gardiner, president of the\n British Medical Society, says we must ac\u00ac\n knowledge the spiritual element in man\n is brought necessarily into the sphere of\n the physician\u2019s daily work. De Fleury\n says tlje modern doctor must understand\n the pathology and hygiene of the intellect.\n But the fields of psycho-physiology,\n and psycho-therapeutics are as yet al\u00ac\n most untouched. ' Professor Ladd, in an\n article in the Medical Times, says: \u201cThe\n effects capable of being produced by mind\n on body are very clear, real and consid\u00ac\n erable, and while in all ages they have\n been the chief therapeutic agents on which\n the charlatan and quack have relied, they\n have probably been less trusted and util\u00ac\n ized by the scientific physician than ex- :\n perience warrants or psychology sug\u00ac\n gests.\u201d Professor Clouston says: \u201cWe talk\n and laugh and weep and blush and shiver\n j and hunger and sweat and digest all\n through the brain cortex, and there is not\n one of the physiological acts but can be\n instantly arrested by a mental act.\u201d Dr.\n Schofield closes this array of author\u00ac\n ities with the statement that when we\n once grasp the interaction of mind and\n (body and health we are better prepared\n [ to understand the part they play in dis\u00ac\n ease and cure, and continues, \u201cby con\u00ac\n scious action the heart\u2019s action can be\n slowed, and even arrested. In contin\u00ac\n uance of this idea is the s;atement of Dr. j\n Reinne of London that the sudden emo- j\n tion of fear or pleasure upon the heart j\n may produce palpitation, actual contrac-I\n tion. and even death. And Dr. Morton\n Prince of Boston contributes a humorous\n statement of a lady who always had a\n violent attack of hay fever when a rose\n was in the room. One day he brought in\n an artificial rose and the usual symptoms\n followed. He then showed her it was\n made of paper and had no pollen, and ever\n after all symptoms disappeared. And j\n may 1 quote Dr. Schofield once again, who j\n tells of a man who came to him for cure I\n from dyspepsia and general debility, but I\n</p>\n<p>\n finding he had defrauded his brother, ho\n advised him to repay, and immediately\n the case was cured.\n</p>\n<p>\n I have on my desk twenty medical au\u00ac\n thorities other than those referred to\n showing that many organic as well as\n functional diseases are caused by mental\n and emotional conditions. The list in\u00ac\n cludes diabetes, angina pectoris, apoplexy,\n asthma, dyspepsia, liver trouble, epilepsy,\n tumors and cancers. Sir B. W. Richard\u00ac\n son claims that diabetes is undoubtedly\n caused by mental strain. Sir George\n Paget claims that in many cases cancer\n has its origin in prolonged anxiety. Dr.\n Snow. Dr. Murchison and Sir W. H. Ben\u00ac\n nett of St. George\u2019s Hospital, London, all\n agree that cancer of the liver, the\n breast, the uterus are due to mental\n anxiety.\n</p>\n<p>\n Such being true it behoves us to realize\n that \u201cas a man thinketh in his heart, so\n is he,\u201d which text, by the way, was given\n me by a Brooklyn physician of highest\n standing. Such being true, it were well\n to have the mind in us that was also in\n Christ Jesus. For remember that it is\n an established principle in medical\n science that diseases caused by deranged\n mental and moral conditions can be\n remedied and even cured by healthful\n mental and moral force. Dr. Schofield\n exclaims that force of mind is a health-\n producing agent in every disease. Dr.\n Dubois of Germany exclaims that nerv\u00ac\n ousness is a disease pre-eminently\n psychic and a psychic disease needs\n psychic treatment. Then ho asks this\n : question: \u201cCan we by means of the mind,\n by our moral deportment, escape illness,\n prevent functional troubles, diminish or\n suppress those which already exist?\u201d I\n boldly answer yes. And hear this start\u00ac\n ling statement from Dr. Schofield: \u201cThe\n power of mind over the body has limits,\n but they have never yet been ascertain\u00ac\n ed. All he can do to cure himself, the\n forces he can set in action, are as yet\n unknown. but they are far greater than\n most people imagine.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n But why multiply authorities? Do we\n not all realize intuitively that the mind\n and the self are identical. And that the\n body is only the tenement in which we\n are dwelling for a while until God calls\n us home? Do we not all know that pos\u00ac\n sessing it in its purity and at it* Dost\n we possess everything? While if we have\n neglected its culture and allowed it to\n become weakened and diseased that all\n that concerns us becomes sickly and im\u00ac\n poverished in consequence. O. brother,\n do not underestimate the value of the\n mind, but keep it so strong and rich and\n healthful that no diseased fancies can\n lodge there, no sickly thoughts steal in,\n no harmful vicious intruders trespass,\n and with ttnir base insinuations soil and\n debase its sanctity. All you possess,\n that wealth and possession you strove to\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0030/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 188, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 278}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0030/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 376, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 557}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0030/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 752, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1115}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0030/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1504, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2230}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0030/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3008, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4460}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0030/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/em/ma/nu/el/mo/ve/me/nt/00/un/se/emmanuelmovement00unse/emmanuelmovement00unse_0030.jp2", "height": 4460, "width": 3008, "levels": 6, "size": 1058760}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"30\">\n<p>\n 28\n</p>\n<p>\n THE EMMANUEL MOVEMENT,\n</p>\n<p>\n accumulate has value only as you have\n a mind to appreciate it, else it is so\n much useless waste. Be warned to guard\n your mind even more tenderly than you\n would the apple of your eye. Shaks-\n peare said in the \u201cTaming of the Shrew,\u201d\n \u201c \u2019Tis the mind that makes the body\n rich.\u201d The great Pascal said: \u201cMan is\n greater than the universe because he\n can pass in thought from star to star,\n from moon to sun and yet no star nor\n moon nor sun can follow him.\u201d Isaac\n Watts, who was deformed, said: \u201cWere\n I so tall to reach the pole, or grasp the\n ocean with a span, I must be measured\n by my soul. The mind\u2019s the standard\n of the man.\u201d Yes, yes. it is true, I must\n be measured by my soul. God\u2019s universe\n is to every mr exactly what his mind\n sees it to be. If the mind be free, and\n light and joyous the world is ablaze with\n sunlight joy and happiness, even though\n in appearance it be the darkest day of\n all the year. But if sorrow and despair\n have found lodgment there the world\u2019s\n delights and grand activities are huge\n mountains of dreariness in which is no\n fascination at all, but intensest weari\u00ac\n ness instead. Develop the mind by edu\u00ac\n cational processes and the universe is no\n longer the shallow thing it was before,\n but a profound aggregate of cause and\n effect, of mysterious laws and forces, of\n deepest, grandest purposes and design.\n Instill lustful thoughts ' into it, and a\n world of animalism results. Y/hile if spir\u00ac\n itual thoughts hold possession, and the\n mind endures as seeing Him who is in\u00ac\n visible, the world\u2019s barren waste becomes\n a paradise again.\n</p>\n<p>\n O, the \u2018 power of the mind to ' control\n the life. I had a friend once who played\n false deliberately and desperately with\n this magnificent trust of life. the wise\n Creator has entrusted to us all, and\n wearied with the strife he plunged him\u00ac\n self into a suicide\u2019s grave. Was the\n world the disagreeable place he thought\n it? No. Was public opinion against\n him as he imagined? No. Were his em\u00ac\n ployers dissatisfied and plotting to take\n from him his occupation and his bread?\n No. His employers loved him as a son.\n His townsmen were his friends. Every\u00ac\n body spoke well of him .and no one ill.\n And as for the world, there never was a\n sunnier day than that on which the foul\n deed was done. It was the mind that\n controlled the life. The day was dark\n to him for he saw it to be dark. His\n employers were against him because he\n thought them so. Public opinion point\u00ac\n ed at him in scorn, because the mind\n inhere sweet contentment should have\n signed, and love of wife and child, and\n the respect of the community and the\n fair light of God\u2019s face was morbid and\n diseased. Distorted images stalked\n there. Strange hallucinations held the\n mind in check, and at their heels stalked\n the demons of despair and seized the\n citadel. Friends talked with him and\n tried to explain away his wrong ideas,\n but it is as Froude, the historian, said:\n \u201cWhen a man is possessed of a strong\n idea and a wrong idea he cannot be\n reasoned with.\u201d The poet Shelley\u2019s de\u00ac\n spairing man comes to our thought:\n \u201cCome near and help me. I weave a\n chain I cannot break. I am possessed\n with thoughts too swift and strong for\n one lone human breast.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The mind must be fortified against\n</p>\n<p>\n despondency. High thoughts, rich\n thoughts must be instilled. It must be\n filled so full and with so many that all\n lower thoughts be crowded out, else kept\n in the minority, the hopeless minority,\n so far as influencing the life is con\u00ac\n cerned.\n</p>\n<p>\n The apostle takes radical ground just\n here. \u201cLet this mind be in you which\n was also in Christ Jesus.\u201d A mind thor\u00ac\n oughly identified with the world\u2019s sor\u00ac\n rows. but never made despondent by\n grief and bitterness, and no weariness\n of life entered at their heels. Be sure\n it depends upon the kind of a mind you\n have, what your life shall be, and how\n the world shall look. A material mind,\n which is that of the majority of men,\n loves material things above all else, and\n if he fails to gain these he becomes of\n all men most miserable. An intellect\u00ac\n ual mind, that of a Darwin, a Spencer\n a Huxley, a Carlyle loves intellectual ac\u00ac\n quisition above all, and nothing can, he\n thinks, compensate for the loss of that.\n A spiritual mind, that of a Luther, a Sa\u00ac\n vonarola ' a Wesley, a Moody, a Philips\n Brooks cares little whether business is\n good or bad, whether stocks are up or\n down, whether the banks are paying 3\n per cent, or 10\u2018\n</p>\n<p>\n O, the uplift to the mind of Christ for\n it fills ' us with the consciousness of God\u2019s\n ' presence. Therein is the preventive and\n curative power for disease. Man\u2019s great\u00ac\n est curse is self-consciousness when it is\n allowed to be a barrier to God. All sin\n springs from that limitation. Sensitive\u00ac\n ness, enviousness, hatred, nervousness,\n worry, melancholy, hysteria all have\n their rootage there. It is s\u00a7lf-con-\n sciousness that makes what Dr. Weir\n Mitchell calls the whole man ill.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our best have owned the rare dramatic power.\n Which gives to sympathy its lifting power.\n</p>\n<p>\n Go learn of them, the masters of our art.\n</p>\n<p>\n To trust that wise consultant called the heart.\n There are among us those who haply please\n To think our business is to treat disease\n And all .unknowing, \u25a0 lack this lesson still\n ' Tis not the body, but the man that\u2019s ill.\n</p>\n<p>\n Self consciousness makes the whole\n man ill. God consciousness makes the\n whole man well. The one is being tied\n up to the world with its friction, its\n worry, its stultification, its disease and\n death. The other opens us up to the\n universal, the eternal, filling us with a\n sense of its largeness and buoyancy,\n wherein is all good cheer and health.\n The one shuts us up in the cellar of our\n discontent, where the outlook is dark,\n the air foul, the surroundings depress\u00ac\n ing. The other allows us to inhabit the\n highest, sunniest chamber of the soul,\n into which the inspirations of God flash\n vitality that can be carried down through\n every nerve, muscle and tissue of our\n physical frame.\n</p>\n<p>\n Again the mind of Christ places and\n keeps us on the heights, lifting our con\u00ac\n sciousness from the seen to the unseen,\n and opening all our little restricted na\u00ac\n ture to the joyous rhythm ot the univer\u00ac\n sal life. What cowards we are when\n dominated by the seen. We dare not\n affirm anything beyond the reach of the\n eye, the sound of the ear, the touch of\n the fingertips. But the beauties we see\n are only the reflection of the beauties\n that are, like Plato\u2019s artisans in the\n cave, catching only the reflected light\n from the realm above, the music we hear,\n the merest jingle of the melodies divine.\n</p>\n<p>\n the things we touch, the superficial, me\u00ac\n chanical. material side of reality. Why\n can\u2019t we believe that the unseen things\n which can be detected from the heights\n are those that are worth while, because\n the abiding, the eternal? Only from the\n heights can we dominate bodily condi\u00ac\n tions. For there we dare affirm spiritual\n freedom, and sever the chains of appe\u00ac\n tite and passion, and deny the slavery of\n sense, and repudiate the bondage of mat\u00ac\n ter and bury negation and weakness and\n fear. In the depths, even upon the plane,\n bodily conditions dominate us, and like\n demons seeking to be housed, the imps\n of worry, melancholy and despair rush\n in where angels fear to tread. Sorry\n sphere that, to affirm that you are strong\n in the Lord. Deplorable place to develop\n energy, vitality and power. Hopeless\n realm for the culture of love, light, har\u00ac\n mony and truth. O living soul, grope not\n thy way longer midst fog and night mist,\n with the whole horizon full of cloud and\n storm. Rise to the privilege of a child\n of God. Breathe in the sunshine of the\n Father\u2019s face. Embody the infinite sup\u00ac\n plies of health from those high sources\n whence the full tides of the Spirit have\n their rise.\n</p>\n<p>\n Once more, the mind of Christ will\n help you build a new world order in\n which to live. What profit to gain the\n world and lose yourself? The soul is,\n indeed, a pilgrim and a stranger on the\n earth. Let it tent there for a night. But\n woe art thou if there thou seek per\u00ac\n manence and if thy holiest aspirations\n become dissipated therein. On what things\n do you fasten your attention as you pass\n along? What pictures do you hang up\n in the mind\u2019s corridors? What delinea\u00ac\n tions do you draw upon memory\u2019s walls?\n Each drawing executed by your thought\n and emotion is a life contribution to\n cheer or haunt you in the city of your\n hopes. You cannot escape them, for they\n have character, substance, strength, and\n the more you gaze upon them the more\n like them you become. The old world\n disorder is poor resting place for an im\u00ac\n mortal soul. The Kingdom that cornea\n down from Heaven is the only safe place\n for God\u2019s children to dwell. That is the\n new world order that endures. There\n all the soul needs for its completion is\n found. It is filled with light and inspi\u00ac\n ration, grace and truth. Then, what pic\u00ac\n tures your thinking can paint, what\n sculptures your thought can chisel, what\n dreams of health and beauty you can\n weave, for you are giving expression to\n the God within you. Ruskin caught the\n idea when he said: \u201cEvery right action\n and true thought sets the seal of its\n beauty on person and face. Even Con\u00ac\n fucius mirrored it when he said: \u201cEx\u00ac\n ercise the mind with high contemplation\n and the body with gracious action, and\n so preserve the health of both.\u201d Epic-\n titus saw it, though as through a dark\u00ac\n ened glass, when he said: \u201cSeek to con\u00ac\n verse in purity with your own pure mind\n and God. Purity of soul is best.\u201d John\n Milton affirmed it when he said: \" The\n mind is its own palace, king of its own\n realm, and in itself can make a heaven\n of hell, a hell of heaven.\u201d All are com\u00ac\n mentary on the Scriptures which is man\u2019s\n guide from the plains to the heights,\n from the now to the by and by, from\n the old world disorder to the unity and\n harmony divine, and which said, cen\u00ac\n turies ago, \u201cAs a man thinketh in his\n heart so is he.\u201d \u201cLet this mind be in\n you which was also in Christ Jesus.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0031/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 185, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0031/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 371, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 559}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0031/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 742, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1119}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0031/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1484, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2238}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0031/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2968, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4476}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0031/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/em/ma/nu/el/mo/ve/me/nt/00/un/se/emmanuelmovement00unse/emmanuelmovement00unse_0031.jp2", "height": 4476, "width": 2968, "levels": 6, "size": 904264}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"31\">\n<p>\n THE EMMANUEL MOVEMENT.\n</p>\n<p>\n Power of Subconsciousness\n</p>\n<p>\n Second of a series of constructive\n sermons by Rev.

It has literal value in every\n possible and in all unforeseen ways.\n It is the most substantial thing with\n which our life has anything to do. There\n is no such thing as an idle thought.\n Every thought is an active, positive, influ\u00ac\n ential something that creates commotion\n within the mind, and good or ill, bless\u00ac\n ing or curse without. Few know of the\n tremendous power exerted by their\n thoughts If we did, we would think them\n more carefully, express them more pre\u00ac\n cisely, cultivate them more diligently and\n use them more remedially. The within is\n always superior to the without. The one\n is the formative, the other the incidental.\n The external is always what the internal\n decrees. The circumstantial\u2014what the\n personal ordains. It is a sad perversion\n of the divine order when environment\n dominates the man. All education, cul\u00ac\n ture. religion, are that the person, the\n living soul, become strong enough to\n dominate his fate. Viewpoint is every\u00ac\n thing. A gloomy mind means a gloomy\n world, however brightly the sun shines.\n A cheery mind fashions a cheery uni\u00ac\n verse, though the day be dark and dreary.\n A weak and troubled mind postulates an\n impossible resting place. A strong mind\n demands a helpful rather than a hinder\u00ac\n ing environment and empowers both hand\n and foot to sweep obstacles out of the\n way.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Matthews\u2019 helpful little book on\n \u2018 ' How To Keep Well\u201d exclaims: \u201cThere\n are mental as well as physical causes of\n disease to be considered. Your thoughts\n are of vast importance. A large propor\u00ac\n tion of all diseases are due directly or\n indirectly to thoughts. You think, then\n you act. An effect follows your act, which\n is good or bad. Thoughts are always\n first. Acts are always second. Effects are\n always third. Thoughts can produce dis\u00ac\n ease as readily as germs. A man thinks\n he must, have certain things to drink. I-Ie\n acts by taking them. He gets conges\u00ac\n tion of the membrane which lines the\n kidneys as an effect. In time the conges\u00ac\n tion reaches a state of inflammation, and\n then the kidney tissue breaks down and\n waste away. This is kidney disease pro\u00ac\n duced from thoughts. This illustration\n applies to a long list of diseases, as real\n and fatal as those produced by physical\n</p>\n<p>\n causes. Wrong thinking produces wrong\n acting and wrong acting produces dis\u00bb\n ease in a multitude of ways.\u201d Why not\n say then that the mental attitude we take\n toward everything determines its effects\n upon us.\n</p>\n<p>\n But what is the self that is well or ill.\n Who can say? It is as mysterious as is\n God. The Bible exclaims: \u201cGreat is the\n mystery of Godliness.\u201d But it also de\u00ac\n clares that we are fearfully and won\u00ac\n derfully made. The majority of men make\n the self synonymous with the body. When\n we go home we will say to our friend: I\n was at church to-night. Perhaps we\n were. Then again we may have been thou\u00ac\n sands of miles away, though a body\n called by our name, and that resembled\n us, sat in one of these pews. I thought\n I saw you here. But I only saw an intel\u00ac\n ligent looking body. I must see your mo\u00ac\n tives. your disposition, your loves and\n hates, your aspirations and longings and\n hopes before I can say I see you. How\n tall are you? How much do you weigh?\n Six feet you say, and weigh a hundred and\n fifty pounds? Both of us are wrong. You\n can\u2019t measure the self by a foot rule,\n nor w r eigh it in iron scales. Every time\n you aspire and hope aDd love you escape\n the body and live in the heights and dis\u00ac\n tances. To estimate you aright I must\n gather up all your hopes and aspirations\n and faiths and loves: and if you have\n been wise enough to reach up and lay\n hold of the Eternal I must weigh and\n measure the Eternal in order to estimate\n you. Others identify the self with the\n soul, but the problem is not simplified.\n The psychologist brings in mind to esti\u00ac\n mate aright. But how deepens the mys\u00ac\n tery, for the mind is no longer the man\u2019s\n consciousness. Its seat is no longer in\n the brain. It inhabits the entire body\n and has other residence beside. All\n psychologic discovery includes in the term\n mind, all possible mental states. Its do\u00ac\n main is extended into all psychic action.\n It includes the conscious, and because j\n consciousness is an infinitesimal part of\n its content it stretches forth unto all\n subconscious depths beside.\n</p>\n<p>\n All vital experience is lodged in sub\u00ac\n consciousness. The conscious experience\n is limited to the present. The sum total\n of experience stretching over the ranges\n of the years is safely stored away in\n subconsciousness, but not beyond recall.\n In fact, it is this reserve force on which\n we draw for guidance that constitutes\n the worth of life. The real of our ex\u00ac\n istence is never what we experience\n daily, hourly, it is rather the residue\n constantly filtering through conscious\u00ac\n ness into the depths of being, making us\n the men and women that we are. All\n the little and great events of life are\n stored away in subconsciousness beyond\n the reach of will, beyond the play of the\n</p>\n<p>\n desires, beyond the incidents and acci\u00ac\n dents of time. They are not influenced\n by consciousness and will and desire,\n but they constantly guide us, correct us.\n dominate us, lead us joyously in the\n paths of righteousness, else sorrowfully\n in the ways of sin.\n</p>\n<p>\n How discouraging that we cannot re\u00ac\n tain the whole of the book we read yes\u00ac\n terday. By to-morrow nine-tenths of it\n escapes us, only one-tenth remains. But\n we are sadly astray in our reckoning.\n The nine-tenths only passed down into\n the subconscious part as influence to\n strengthen instinct, to prompt intuition,\n to form habit, to determine character.\n So of our contact with the world or\n with truth. The passing conscious mo\u00ac\n ment is trivial compared to what has\n passed through and down into reserve\n force to make strong for good or ill, to\n incite, prompt, decree, control, inspire\n or impede.\n</p>\n<p>\n We congratulate ourselves upon being\n reasonable beings, upon thinking before\n we speak, reflecting before we act, in\u00ac\n vestigating before we affirm. But that\u2019s\n exactly what we do not do. The wisest\n part of life is lived by instinct. We\n reach conclusions by intuition, we are\n ruled by habit. Character holds the\n helm and steers the ship. To say all\n this is to affirm that in the subconscious\n self resides the power, else we would\n have no power at all. Had a man only\n the cash he is conscious of in his\n pockets, he is weak indeed. It is his\n stored-away investments and the amount\n in the banks he can draw on in emer\u00ac\n gency by check that determines how ricb\n he is.\n</p>\n<p>\n Herein is the power of habit,. Some\u00ac\n times it carries us our way; sometimes\n its way. Much of the excuse we offer\n for evil doing is that habit led us there.\n We have no power of inhibition. The\n horse ran away, and we sat in the ..car\u00ac\n riage helpless and let him run.- When\n j the horse is funning our way, let. him\n go. The faster the better. But we should\n always hold the reins, and so firmly that\n he never is allowed to take tite bit in\n his teeth. Habit\u2019s way should be our\n way; else it should be pulled up with a\n round turn. That sounds like the re\u00ac\n commending of sudden volitional action,\n an experiment that will not always work,\n especially when we want it to.

The walking that\n spells advancement and carries you along\n mpst be unconscious to be strong. sur\u00a3\n and swift. Your unconscious life must\n direct you. Your instincts rather than\n your reason must force your steps. The\n same with you, ladies, at the piano. Con\u00ac\n sciousness of notes and fingers kills the\n harmonies and prevents all freedom of\n action. Unconscious acting is the soul\n speaking through keys and notes and\n fingers guided by intuition and regulated\n by habit. We ministers know what a\n troublesome handicap consciousness is.\n One of the very simplest acts of his Sab\u00ac\n bath ministrations is a witness. It is the\n repeating of that most .simple, most beau\u00ac\n tiful, most familiar of all prayers, the\n Lord\u2019s Prayer. Many a minister will not\n repeat it. He is afraid to. He fears he\n will not say it right. Some have been\n known to write it out and read it. lest to\n shut out the world with the closed eyes\n Is to shut out the precious words as well.\n Clergymen have been known to repeat\n certain clauses of it, to leave out others,\n to get twisted generally, and end in con\u00ac\n fusion, to the dismay or their worshipful\n congregations, who can\u2019t imagine what\u2019s\n up. What is up? His sermon runs along\n smoothly enough. His own prayer is con\u00ac\n sistent. accurate, logical, helpful. In the\n other exercises he gives no evidence of\n paresis Only this is up. Through fear\n of saying the Lord ' s Prayer wrongly he\n intrudes his consciousness. He won\u2019t let\n it say itself. He won\u2019t let subconscious\u00ac\n ness caper. He is so anxious to say it\n right that he says it wrong.\n</p>\n<p>\n But alas! In the subconsciousness is\n the power of evil as well as the power of\n good. The Apostle gives us some start\u00ac\n ling autobiography just here. He would\n do the good, but evil creeps up into con\u00ac\n sciousness and holds him back. Instinct\u00ac\n ively his old dead nature that he thought\n himself rid of, that his Christianized rea\u00ac\n son abhors, obtrudes itself, and he finds\n conscious mind and volition, hands and\n feet, doing the very thing his reason con\u00ac\n demns. Are we not all influenced as was\n he? Often it is the very height of our\n ideals and in contrast to consciousness\n of a nature dominated by sense impres\u00ac\n sions and the lusts of the flesh that in\u00ac\n spires the sad confession. You never\n catch the Divine Master speaking thus.\n He is never conscious of unrealized\n ideals, of struggling from the depths to\n the heights, of striving to attain and of\n being thwarted in the pursuit. His con\u00ac\n sciousness and subconsciousness were al\u00ac\n ways at one. There was no trail of the\n serpent in His life. Thus could He safely\n challenge His enemies to accuse Him if\n they dare of sin. \u201cWho shall deliver me?\u201d\n cries Paul. \u201cWho accuseth Me?\u201d cries\n Jesus. Christ\u2019s consciousness of God was\n so complete that it was perfect. Well\n may Ho be called the Perfect Man Paul\n Is with us on the plains. Jesus was with\n God on the heights. You may question\n the Virgin birth. You may ask the how\n and the where of the incarnation. But\n there He was, imperial, supreme. Account\n for Him who can. The consciousness of\n Jesus is the satisfactory solution of the\n problem that our dogmatism failed to\n reach.\n</p>\n<p>\n Herein is the secret of his all power\u00ac\n ful influence that there seems to have\n been no break between His consciousness\n and His subconsciousness. That is why\n</p>\n<p>\n i His influence has come down through all\n | these centuries of time, under the name\n of Christianity. We think of Christian\u00ac\n ity as a teaching of the Bible, as a moral\n code, as a bundle of heavenly precepts.or\n as a high and happy state of civilization.\n WV / not call it what it is. Christ\u2019s in\u00ac\n fluence coming down through the years.\n That unique unity between what He was\n conscious of possessing, and what He\n actually had stored away in the trans-\n Uminal depth of his life was the at-one-\n ment behind whatever atonement He\n afterward achieved There was no break\n between His conscious and His un-\n cpnscious life Paul felt the contrast.\n We are martyrs to the contradiction.\n Upon this matter of influence, as upon\n that of evil and good, we can exclaim:\n \u201cThe good I would I do not. the evil I\n would not that I do. \" We recognize the\n obligation to influence a person for good.\n It may be in the home among the chil\u00ac\n dren Tt may be in our industrial or\n social life. So we begin a repression of\n ourselves all along the liDe. We weigh\n our words, count our acts, are careful\n of our thoughts. We pose, and are\n stilted and quite unnatural in that per\u00ac\n son\u2019s presence. And we wonder why He\n is not influenced when we\u2019ve tried so\n hard. That\u2019s the trouble, we have tried\n so hard, and the harder we tried the\n weaker the influence. Conscious action\n is necessarily limited and weak. Self-\n consciousness is about the nearest thing\n to spiritual death that anywhere exists.\n Another reason for our failure is, doubt\u00ac\n less, that the full force of our subcon\u00ac\n scious life was influencing the other way.\n Not only was our artificial self defeating\n our purpose, but our real self was de\u00ac\n feating that purpose too. When will we\n see that from the subconscious self all\n influence radiates, because there it is\n stored. Thus it is that in spite of us it\n is our unconscious Influence that counts\u2014\n the thing we do off guard. Our nature\n is always expressing itself. Influences\n steal out from it as do light beams from\n the sun.\n</p>\n<p>\n All such reflection is merely illustra\u00ac\n tive of the power of the subconscious.\n It dominates situations. It corrects ills.\n It goes far as a remedial agency in pre\u00ac\n venting and curing disease. Dr. Scho\u00ac\n field startles us by the statement that\n every doctor in the presence of an\u00ac\n other and greater physician, \u201cDr. V. M.\n N,\u2019\u2019 a doctor trained in no human school\n but divinely gifted to heal all varieties\n of disease and to repair every species\n of injury\u2014the vis medicatrix naturae\u2014\n in other words, the unconscious mind\n \u201cEvery thoughtful practitioner,\u201d states\n Dr. Wilkinson, \u201cwill acknowledge that\n when his therapeutic reserves are ex\u00ac\n hausted, by far the most reliable con\u00ac\n sultant is the vis medicatrix naturae. To\n ignore the fact that he has been in\n charge of the case for days, when we\n first approach with our mixtures and tab\u00ac\n loids, is at least a mistake in medical\n ethics.\u201d In another place. Dr. Schofield\n exclaims: \u201cThe truth is that nervous\n diseases require far more careful, well\n devised, and elaborately carried out treat\u00ac\n ment than any other ailment, because\n here Dr. V. M. N\u201e himself, i3 ill, and\n cannot co-operate as in other diseases\n with the physician.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n But the curative power of the subcon\u00ac\n scious is enhanced mightily by Chris- '\n</p>\n<p>\n tianity. Hear Dr. Matthews again state,\n in his recommendation of right thinking\n as necessary to right acts and results:\n \u201cChristianity is the greatest teacher of\n right thinking, and its wonderful power\n to prevent disease is just beginning to\n be realized. That it is the greatest\n power in the world to prevent disease\n no doctor who has had practice and ex\u00ac\n perience enough to know, doubts. No\n one better than a doctor can realize what\n an amazingly large percentage of dis\u00ac\n eases result from immorality, dissipa\u00ac\n tion and weak will power, from igno\u00ac\n rance, from unclean thinking and unclean\n living\u2014in short, from leading lives the\n Bible condemns on every page. Perhaps\n 50 per cent, of all diseases is due directly\n or indirectly to these causes. Can Chris\u00ac\n tianity prevent 50 per cent, of the sick\u00ac\n ness that now prevails? I believe it\n can. But it must be directed to that\n end. Electricity is a great power. Ap\u00ac\n plied one way it produces heat; in an\u00ac\n other way light: in another it moves\n machinery; in another it transmits mes\u00ac\n sages. So Christianity applied in one\n way civilizes and lifts up. in another\n way it purifies the heart; in another it\n prevents disease. There will be a great\n awakening throughout the world when\n people realize that Christianity prevents\n disease and adds years to human life.\n It pays to be a Christian right here in\n this world, without any reference to a\n future world.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Now we are prepared to catch the\n strong, rich word of Christ: \u201cI am come\n that ye might have life and have it mo-e\n abundantly.\u201d Back of all Christ\u2019s sav ng\n power is His unique ability as a revealor.\n I T was the light of the world. He illu\u00ac\n mined all the dark problems and cleared\n up all the strange mysteries relating to\n God. eternity, man and man\u2019s destiny. Ho\n pre-eminently showed our accessibility to\n the Infinite Power, the eternal life of God.\n He revealed as forcibly eternal iife\u20193\n adaptability to us as a buoyant, uplifting,\n divine force. Even materialists recognize\n the presence of omnipotent power. Her\u00ac\n bert Spencer asserts that we are in the\n presence of an Infinite Power which forms\n all things. Everything, even every .-\u25a0tom\n of force in the universe represents\n God\u2019s power. The stars shine by it. The\n flowers bloom by it. The tiny grass blade\n grows by it. In nature it is a natural\n power, but no less divine. Id mind it i3\n a mental power, but no less divine. In\n the soul it is spiritual, but no less divine.\n It takes the name of the sphere and life\n we apply it to. Our finite life is a part\n of the Infinite. It is ever correcting, ex\u00ac\n panding and lifting us above our limita\u00ac\n tions. As the author of Festus says:\n</p>\n<p>\n We live in deeds, not words.\n</p>\n<p>\n In thoughts, not breaths.\n</p>\n<p>\n In feelings, not in figures on a dial.\n</p>\n<p>\n We shaul ' d count time by heart throbs,\n</p>\n<p>\n He most lives who thinks most, feeis the\n noblest, acts the best.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ralph Waldo Trine exclaims: \u201cIn the\n degree that you realize your oneness with\n this Infinite Spirit of Life and thus ac\u00ac\n tualize your latent possibilities and pow\u00ac\n ers you will exchange disease for ease,\n inharmony for harmony, suffering and\n pain for abounding health and strength.\n And in the degree you realize this whole\u00ac\n ness, this abounding health and strength\n in yourself will you be able to carry it\n to all with whom you come in contact,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0033/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 185, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0033/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 371, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 559}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0033/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 742, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1119}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0033/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1484, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2238}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0033/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2968, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4476}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0033/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/em/ma/nu/el/mo/ve/me/nt/00/un/se/emmanuelmovement00unse/emmanuelmovement00unse_0033.jp2", "height": 4476, "width": 2968, "levels": 6, "size": 878741}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"33\">\n<p>\n THE EMMANUEL MOVEMENT.\n</p>\n<p>\n 31\n</p>\n<p>\n for health is contagious as well as\n disease.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Eternal is the divine power in\n which time and all time\u2019s interests are\n set, as is the island in the sea; and if\n there be any little creeks and bays and\n inlets threre, however far up into the in\u00ac\n terior of the land they reach, the cleans 1\n ing, health producing flow of the ocean\n runs up into those indentures, giving them\n beauty and usefulness.

The old\n world disorder has wrought havoc with\n us. It caught us on its own plane and\n holds us prisoner, pounding us with blows.\n</p>\n<p>\n vexing us with friction, depressing us\n with gloom, beguiling us with deceits\n and binding us with entanglements. We\n had no right to be there tampering with\n fnrhidden things. But we wanted experi\u00ac\n ence and we got it\u2014got it bad. We craved\n the fruit of all the trees save the tree of\n life and they turned to apples of Sodom\n in our clutch. We touched and tasted\n and handled the pleasing things along all\n the avenues of sense gratification and\n received sorrow for our pains and dissat\u00ac\n isfaction for our reward.\n</p>\n<p>\n What shall be the remedy for the\n abounding evil and the spreading sick\u00ac\n ness there? Thank God there is a remedy\n at our hand, so simple, so strong, so rich\n that its curative force is difficult to real\u00ac\n ize and incredible to believe. It is the\n power of suggestion. How vague and un\u00ac\n substantial the term sounds. But it is\n one of the most potent forces, so ex\u00ac\n claims the psychologist, in existence. It\n will pull down evil and build up good\n</p>\n<p>\n ower of Suggestion\n</p>\n<p>\n within the soul more speediiy and surely\n than all the remedial punishments of\n earth. It will transform character more\n effectively than could the thundering of\n Sinai It will change the ' course of fate\n more suddenly and violently than could\n all the shocks ' of doom. Yes. it ' .s-mys-\n terious and subtle, but very powerful\n withal, even though it is only ' a hint to\n the soul as a stimulant, an incentive to\n action. Poor soul, cramped, crowded,\n suppressed, impoverished, sick. It needs\n al) the encouragement it can get. Besides\n the evil instincts, wrong habits, sickening\n realizations that have sprouted there and\n drawn their nourishment from its prec\u00ac\n ious soil are now implanted rich, strong,\n pure thoughts, righteous tendencies, in\u00ac\n ducements to health, encouragements to\n victory. And the mysterious thing about\n it ail is that these will take root there\n when patiently aud persistently intro\u00ac\n duced. and will spring up and choke out\n the weeds.\n</p>\n<p>\n Whether or not the remedial sugges\u00ac\n tions are successful depends upon whether\n we can get them into the life. Reason\n is always there on guard. It is given us\n by God to guard the life from outside in\u00ac\n terference. It both keeps our emotions\n from running away with us and holds out\u00ac\n side inducements in check. An external\n force must show itself reasonable to be\n admitted. All new ideas, all strange sug\u00ac\n gestions, must, be in keeping with reasons,\n preconceived beliefs of right and good.\n In short, reason must be respected. The\n only alternative is to ignore it and de\u00ac\n mand that its hold upon the citadel be\n weakened. This is achieved if the person\n needing the help trusts the one offering\n the suggestion. If not, reason must be\n beguiled and self-consciousness side\u00ac\n tracked. Such is achieved through hyp\u00ac\n nosis. There, we have uttered the word\n that awakens criticisms, because so poor\u00ac\n ly understood. Its remedy is purely nega\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n tive. it simply prepares the conditions\n for what follows. It cures not. It only\n removes restrictions. It makes the man\n irrational and unconscious, and relaxed\n and receptive enough for the putting into\n the deep-reaching inward parts the\n needed suggestion. But of the few diffi\u00ac\n cult cases I have been instrumental in\n helping through the introduction of these\n remedial principles, I have not seen one\n where hypnosis were needed, had I the\n ability or desire to wield so powerful a\n force. Distressed souls are only too glad\n to will reason to step aside, that the\n curative suggestion may come in. They\n relax cheerfully. Self-consciousness is\n laid by for the time being. The subcon\u00ac\n scious depths are presumably laid bare\n to receive the invigorating thoughts. Nat\u00ac\n ural sleep, however, is one of the most\n promising conditions for the introduction\n of suggestion.\n</p>\n<p>\n So far we have spoken as though sug\u00ac\n gestion svere a rare force, and employed\n always remedially. and by the trained\n dispenser of health and good-cheer. But\n the fact of the matter is that it is the\n most present, commonplace truth in ex\u00ac\n istence. Everything that exists of any\n influence generates suggestion. Look at\n the my-terious by which we are sur\u00ac\n rounded. Whatever the mind cannot com\u00ac\n prehend and attribute intelligible cause\n to exerts more suggestive force than the\n understood. The incomprehensible is a\n potent suggestive force over the average\n mind. We are all more or le~s sensi\u00ac\n tive to the mysterious. Imagination is\n aroused, fancy stirred, credulity stimu\u00ac\n lated.

Familiarity breeds contempt. Con\u00ac\n ceal your limitations to the vulgar throng\n if you would hold their respect. Reveal\n them only to those who love you. They\n only can be trusted not to throw you\n down. It is because the world\u2019s plumb\n lines are not long enough to sound your\n depths that you have any influence over\n the world. So. too, has the world\u2019s mys\u00ac\n tery influence over its curious, question\u00ac\n ing children. The so-called worldly man\n is he whom the world has filled to the\n brim with suggestions. Its mystery\n awakens his curiosity and fascinates his\n soul as do painted circus clowns make\n children laugh.\n</p>\n<p>\n Think of the superstitions the power\n of mystery awakens. In ^gypt. flies by\n the scores and hundreds feast on the\n children\u2019s faces, that are never washed,\n as do the dogs upon the refuse in the\n streets of Constantinople, which are\n never cleaned. These flies are allowed to\n eat out the children\u2019s eyes, inducing sores\n and blindness, because of superstition\n that if they were brushed away the child\n would die. Why single out Egypt? Every\n country has many superstitions for its\n stock in trade. Every civilization as well\n as every religion holds its devotees\n through manifold customs and sanctions\n and traditions that are grounded in mys\u00ac\n tery, and through which the light of rea\u00ac\n son never shines. Lessing says we are\n swayed by our superstitions even after\n w T e understand them. Now. it is this su\u00ac\n perstition that an age-long suggestion\n produces, that accounts for innumerable\n cures at certain world centers, such as\n Lourdes, with its shrines and altars and\n charms and numerous bones of saints,\n where ailing pilgrims leave a million and\n a half dollars every year. And what of\n cures by relics and idols in India. China.\n Africa, and in the cases of multitudes\n who touch the holy coat of Treves? And\n there are you, carrying a chestnut in\n your pocket or wearing a metal ring on\n a certain finger to ward off rheumatism.\n Have they virtue? Yes, just as much as\n your belief endows them with.\n</p>\n<p>\n And there are the devotees at the nu\u00ac\n merous continental spas, with their in\u00ac\n vigorating mineral waters and sulphur,\n soda, iron and mud baths. Do ihe\n physicians in attendance at these fash\u00ac\n ionable centers really believe in the\n efficacy of these material agencies, or is\n the thereuputic power largely one of sug\u00ac\n gestion to the latent resourcefulness of\n the subconscious mind? All these mys\u00ac\n terious symbols exert a tremendous sug-\n ger-tive power, which the soul, crying\n numbly for relief from its thraldom, ac\u00ac\n cepts. And the moment the mind sees\n health in the ideal, that the priest, or\n the charlatan assures the confiding soul\n is guaranteed by the charm, that\n moment the mind begins to create health\n in the real. To mentally picture health\n is to mentally create health. And w r hat\n the mind create* will be surely and im\u00ac\n mediately expressed throughout the body.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then there is the suggestive force of\n heredity. We all carry much of that\n with us. W ' e can trace back certain\n tendencies to father or mother, certain\n characteristics back further still for gen\u00ac\n erations into the dim past. Many make\n this force of heredity responsible for the\n possession of bad habits, which con\u00ac\n sciousness of possession seems to\n paralyze all endeavors for reform. There\n is much erroneous thinking about this\n</p>\n<p>\n thing. Evil habits are not transmitted.\n No heredity has as much power actually\n as have we . potentially. No man need\n remain for two consecutive hours in the\n clutch of heredity. Only a weakened\n nerve condition is handed down, which\n condition can readily be overcome by\n strong suggestions and self control.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then what about the constant stream\n of suggestions from environment, ever\n flowing into and leaving their impressions\n upon the conscious and subconscious\n states? Everything surrounding us\n exerts influence here. We constantly\n take on the influences of the situation\n we find ourselves surrounded by. Is the\n sea voyage stormy, how upset we also are.\n Is the ocean calm, how rested arc we in\n consequence. Is the weather continu\u00ac\n ously disagreeable, we find it hard to\n keep our equilibrium; while sunny skies\n and balmy south breezes make serene\n the soul\n</p>\n<p>\n A few years ago in a certain part ot\n England the weather was so continuous\u00ac\n ly beastly\u2014that\u2019s the term they used\u2014\n that at last wearying of looking at the\n barometers day after day, week in and\n week out. the entire inhabitants of a cer\u00ac\n tain sea port town, in sheer disgust, gath\u00ac\n ered up their weather glasses and dumped\n them into the old junk shops. Both the\n weather and the barometers flooded them\n with disagreeable suggestions. They could\n not do away with the weather, but they\n could with their barometers that seemed\n to serve no better purpose than to ac\u00ac\n centuate their discontent.\n</p>\n<p>\n Just here is felt the force of adver\u00ac\n tisement. Any patent medicine, however\n worthless, will make its advocate rich if\n he will only persist in advertising it.\n The dear public succumb in the long\n run. They cannot stand up under the con\u00ac\n tinuous force of his big lettered sugges\u00ac\n tions. They rather enjoy being hum\u00ac\n bugged. What splendid advantage the\n big stores take of this weakness on our\n part! All they need do is to keep offer\u00ac\n ing suggestions of cheapness or of the\n supposed worth and imagined usefulness\n of their wares, and multitudinous inno\u00ac\n cent ones, whose sole interests the adver\u00ac\n tiser seems to have at heart, take hold\n of the tempting bait.\n</p>\n<p>\n Political and social leaders take ad\u00ac\n vantage of their constituencies with large\n success just here. It is a relentless\n power of suggestion that they wield over\n their thoughtless followers. The term\n \u201cboss\u201d for the political leader is well\n coined. He plies his vocation relentless\u00ac\n ly. He works his clientage to the limit.\n</p>\n<p>\n The important consideration is, will we\n take worthy advantage of this natural\n tendency by supplying the highest,\n truest, mental, moral, spiritual sugges\u00ac\n tion to supply the need? Tt Is no small\n responsibility that the guardians of your\n life assume. The physician, whether of\n the body or the soul; the father and\n mother in the home; the teacher in the\n school; the nurse in the hospital; all\n who influence weaker souls; all whose\n position it is to minister either pre\u00ac\n ventively or remedially to the afflicted.\n</p>\n<p>\n We said awhile ago that the state of\n natural sleep was the most receptive time\n for sending suggestions into the child\u2019s\n life, or into the depths of an adult life,\n for that matter, whom you would help.\n Is your little one afraid of the dark, as\n so mt ones are? Sit by bis bed\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n side for a few nit\u2019- ' -ts, and say to him with\n low, strong, hopeful, assuring word: Do\n not fear the dark my boy. There is noth\u00ac\n ing there to harm you. God I.\u2014. given\n it to you to rest in, so that you will be\n strong and fresh for your vork and play\n on the morrow. The darkness is your\n friend, not your enemy. Be a brave and\n heroic little man in the darkness ao well\n as in the light. Is your boy or girl form\u00ac\n ing bad habits? Threat and punishment\n often awaken resentment and strengthen\n the very self consciousness you should try\n to dethrone and get under and back of How\n much easier, during sleep, to calmly, lov\u00ac\n ingly talk and think heroic remelies into\n the precious life Is the tendency of the\n life toward intemperance, immorality or\n some bad habit that will degrade his man\u00ac\n hood and ruin all your Lopes? Give\n strong hints to the wide-awake self be\u00ac\n hind the sleeping self\u2014the self that is\n never more alert and interested and\n receptive than now that the check of\n self-consciousness is lifted. There you\n have a condition of natural hypnosis that\n invites your healthy ideals, your moral\n convictions, your optimistic thought in\n that life\u2019s behalf. In your thought and\n speech identify him with his latent man\u00ac\n hood, his strongest self; remind him that\n the self he manifests each day is only\n his diseased and superficial self, and that\n your sympathetic help and all infinite\n power is helping him to victory.^ Remem\u00ac\n ber the mind begins to create in the\n actual what it sees in the ideal, and what\n it sees in the ideal is what you impart to\n it. You are invigorating the soul for\n action, and the sphere of that activity\n wifi be the body in which that soul re\u00ac\n sides! The soul is a good housekeeper.\n Its desire is always to keep the little\n tenement of its residence well furnished\n and in order. But. the servant problem\n presses here as in other spheres. It\n needs to be given reliable information,\n the best courage, the strongest faith, the\n truest ideals, and assurances of \u25a0victory.\n With such loyal waiting maids as these\n the soul will press forward unto all splen\u00ac\n did achievement and righteousness.\n</p>\n<p>\n But what about the type of motherhood\n and fatherhood needed for the task? The\n flippant, dissipated, superficial rearer and\n governor of children will not suffice. It\n is not. the words spoken into the listen\u00ac\n ing stillness of the child\u2019s life that solves\n the problem. It is the affectionate heart\n throb and soul potency that counts. It is\n the pure, true thought that is effective.\n It is the deepest mother-love that is the\n suggested force.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then, perhaps, more important still is\n that pre-natal power of influence that\n makes for good or ill, mental and moral\n strength or weakness, in proportion as\n the invisible mother-world holds not only\n a developing little life, but the most im\u00ac\n portant Godgiven opportunity to mold\n that precious angel charge as she may.\n Here is the most fruitful and satisfac\u00ac\n tory source of mental, moral and re\u00ac\n ligious suggestion she will ever be able to\n embrace. Now it is that she needs a\n near-by world of high, rich, true thoughts\n and emotions to draw on. She has it in\n her power to make that little life, while\n yet distinctly in her own sweet keeping,\n just the kind of a boy or girl in tempera\u00ac\n ment, in mental endowment, in moral sig\u00ac\n nificance, in religious worth, that she may\n choose.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0035/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 185, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0035/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 371, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 559}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0035/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 742, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1119}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0035/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1484, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2238}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0035/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2968, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4476}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0035/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/em/ma/nu/el/mo/ve/me/nt/00/un/se/emmanuelmovement00unse/emmanuelmovement00unse_0035.jp2", "height": 4476, "width": 2968, "levels": 6, "size": 647711}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"35\">\n<p>\n We spoke incidentally of the trained\n nurse, so-called and her helpful hospital\n work.

'\n</p>\n<p>\n in the terms of our thinking to-night.\n There they are, the entire world possi\u00ac\n bilities of evil on the one side, and the\n entire world possibilities of good on the\n other. And they fight back -and forth un\u00ac\n til one or the other is vanquished. Talk\n of battlefields! Waterloo when Welling\u00ac\n ton was victorious and Napoleon bit the\n dust was momentous. And so were Aus-\n terlitz and Gettysburg; but insignificant\n compared to the wilderness of Judea. That\n was tho world\u2019s most famous battlefield,\n for there the world ' s most significant bat\u00ac\n tle was fought. And weapons more\n subtle and powerful than rifles, bayonets\n and gatling guns held sway. They\n were the weapons of suggestion, weapons\n of Intense thought and spiritual power.\n From the world forces of evil comes the\n thrust of suggestion \u201cIf thou bo the Son\n of God command that these stones be\n made bread.\u201d And then from that di\u00ac\n vine embodiment of the world\u2019s good\n comes that counter suggestion that par\u00ac\n ries the thrust. \u201cIt is written man shall\n not live by bread alone, but by every\n word that proceedeth out of the mouth\n of God.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Baffled but still alert the challenge\n rings out from the pinnacle of the tem\u00ac\n ple- \u201cCast thyself down.

REV. SAMUEL FALLOWS, D.D., LL.D, OF CHICAGO.\n</p>\n<p>\n In answer to nomerona questions j out.\n which are being; asked regarding\n the difference between Religions\n Therapeutics and Christian\n Science, this article has\n particularly prepared.\n</p>\n<p>\n Religious therapeutics is applied Chris\u00ac\n tianity. It is differentiated from Christian\n Science in several particulars, while it in\u00ac\n cludes the law under which the cures\n claimed to have been wrought by Chris\u00ac\n tian Science are affected.\n</p>\n<p>\n First\u2014It clearly recognizes the reality\n of the mind and the body, and the insep\u00ac\n arable relation existing between them\n</p>\n<p>\n They have saved millions of lives !\n and increased their comfort and ef- !\n ficiency by teaching the laws of sanita- !\n been tion and hygiene and have assuaged hu-\n j man and animal suffering by the discov- j\n ery of anesthetics.\n</p>\n<p>\n In former ages the priests of the Creek j\n and Anglican and Latin churches united j\n in themselves the function of the physi\u00ac\n cian. The differentiation of work In later\n years has separated them. The alarming\n prevalence of nervous diseases in this age\n has brought them more closely together,\n they are beginning to co-operate heartily\n</p>\n<p>\n while connected with the human organ- j w ' th one another, as it Is seen how great\n</p>\n<p>\n ism.\n</p>\n<p>\n Second\u2014It affirms most emphatically j\n the value of anatomy, physiology, bac- i\n teriology, histology and the like, in the j\n progress of the race, as well as that of j\n psychology. The practical bearing of psy- j\n chology in the treatment of disease has j\n come from the increasing light which j\n psychology throws upon the human frame. |\n</p>\n<p>\n Third\u2014It maintains that there is a fun- j\n damental distinction between functional j\n and organic diseases. The former in- !\n elude the multiplied forms of mental and ;\n nervous disorders which are directly |\n amenable to psychical and religious influ- |\n ences.\n</p>\n<p>\n Among the functional diseases which I\n can say with positive authority can be\n cured are the following: Want of confi\u00ac\n dence, sleeplessness, nervous dyspepsia,\n melancholia, fear, mental depression,\n hysteria, neurasthenia, drug habit, irri\u00ac\n tability, worry, anger and weak will.\n</p>\n<p>\n The organic include those in which im\u00ac\n portant changes have taken place in the\n bodily structure. Among these maladies\n may be named cancer, malignant tumors,\n tuberculosis, diphtheria, scarlet fever,\n smallpox and the like. These troubles\n may require surgical aid and the applica\u00ac\n tion of material remedies. But religious\n therapeutics gives all the ameliorating,\n strengthening and uplifting aid that can\n possibly be afforded to the mind or soul\n in such cases.\n</p>\n<p>\n No psychical action, for example, can\n take the place of food to build up the\n physical system. But its influence is pro\u00ac\n found in aiding all the forces of digestion.\n</p>\n<p>\n Religious therapeutics does not limit the\n power of God in healing diseases by ap\u00ac\n plying material remedies for material ills.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2022 It is the way He has chosen to accom\u00ac\n plish His ends.\n</p>\n<p>\n Fourth\u2014Religious therapeutics differs\n from Christian Science in asserting the\n absolute necessity for the work of the\n physician.

It simply aims to\n form societies for health and happiness\n in the churches and communities that\n may desire them. A clew to the founda\u00ac\n tion ideas of this movement is that there\n is not the slightest need to deplete or\n dispute existing church organizations or\n the family in order to get everything\n that can be obtained in psychical and\n divine healing. It haids that the pas\u00ac\n tor of a church, a man so frequently of\n college and university training, one who\n is conversant with the deepest things of\n</p>\n<p>\n the soul, is well qualified to work hand\n in hand with the physician in applying\n the great principles of healing to his\n flock.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sixth\u2014It further differs from Chris\u00ac\n tian science so far as it is a, church\n movement, in that it offers to the poor\n and the needy its help in this direction,\n as in others, without the taini of com\u00ac\n mercialism. I make no charge whatever\n for personal treatment. The many ex\u00ac\n penses of the work are met by voluntary\n contribution and thank offerings. Relig\u00ac\n ious therapeutics comprehend in its\n principles all that is distinctly known as\n faith healing, divine healing, mental\n healing, or any form of unacknowledged\n psychotherapy. It recognizes the great\n fact that there are diversities of oper\u00ac\n ations but. the same spirit. It believes\n in the power of personal and interces\u00ac\n sory prayer and in this power of prayer\n is comprehended all that is contained\n in so-called \" absent treatment.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It plants itself cn the Bible as contain\u00ac\n ing ail the ethical, psychical and spiritual\n forces for a man\u2019s welfare. It holds, in\n accordance with the wonderful works of\n Christ, that the Great Physician will\n meet every man with healing on the plane\n of that man\u2019s being. The principles of\n the movement, which in this phase are\n conveniently expressed by the term re\u00ac\n ligious therapeutics, began to be put\n into practice about sixteen months ago\n in Emmanuel Church. Boston, by its well\n known rectors, the Rev. Dr. Elwood\n Worcester and the Rev. Dr. McComb. Dr.\n Worcester was for many years professor\n of psychology In Lehigh University, and\n frequently consulted with Dr. Weir\n Mitchell, who was a member of his\n church in Philadelphia. Dr. McComb la\n a graduate of Oxford University. Eng\u00ac\n land, and has been a close student of\n philosophy in German universities. Dur\u00ac\n ing this period the needs of many cases\n have been relieved. From a \" ' ery small\n beginning, the work has grown to such\n proportions that they have sent out an\n appeal to other clergymen, in different\n parts of the country, to carry on the\n movement and meet the requests for help\n which they themselves could not consid\u00ac\n er. In several of the Eastern towns\n and cities ministers of different denom\u00ac\n inations have begun the same work. The\n weekly meetings for health conferences\n in this church number nearly a thousand.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some of the ablest neurologists of\n Boston and New England are aiding in\n this movement. The work which has\n been begun here in Chicago is conducted\n along the same sensible scientific and\n scriptural lines.

Roblin of the Columbus\n Avenue Universalist Church, Boston,\n Mass., has been credited by some with\n being the pioneer of the Emmanuel Move\u00ac\n ment in its practical workings, In the\n Universalist Leader of March 21, Dr.\n Roblin makes brief mention of the work\n as carried on in his church. The article\n follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. Our work in psychology began some\n eighteen months ago. The beginning was\n at the request of several thoughtful\n students in my class of Religious Phi\u00ac\n losophy. Four young people\u2014one a Har\u00ac\n vard man, another from the Institute of\n Technology, a Teachers Normal School\n graduate and a Radcliffe graduate\u2014re\u00ac\n quested me to open a class in Experi\u00ac\n mental Psychology. At first the thought\n of psycho-therapeutical work was not\n considered. The class gradually grew\n into this phase of study and effort.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The \u201cEmmanuel Movement \" did not\n inspire the formation of our class, but\n no doubt influenced our work ir. psycho\u00ac\n therapeutics. though the work of Dr.\n Bishop, the noted mental healer, was\n well known in the parish; and my ex\u00ac\n perience in the Metaphysical Club of\n Boston, and work with Dr. Bishop and\n others, naturally led me toward psy\u00ac\n chopathy.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Our work Is different from the Em\u00ac\n manuel and other movements of this\n</p>\n<p>\n sort in some decided particulars. So\n far as I know, we have the only class\n of trained psychologists working together\n for curative results. At the Emmanuel\n Church popular addresses are given; at\n Columbus Avenue careful scientific train\u00ac\n ing is had.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. .At Emmanuel the ministers and\n M. D. ' s do their work individually. At\n Columbus Avenue this practice prevails,\n but is strongly supplemented by the\n united class work. The class is largely\n composed of those who are grounded in\n physiological psychology and understand\n the way to work best on the patients who\n come for treatment. The class itself is\n \" expert.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. At Emmanuel a corps of nerve\n specialists make diagnoses for the clinic.\n At Columbus Avenue a diagnosis of any\n physician in good standing is received.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. The first year of our work was de\u00ac\n voted wholly to scientific psychology, I.\n with assistants, doing the work of in\u00ac\n struction. The second year a Harvard\n man, Fred Wilmot, is the instructor in\n psychology, while I have conducted the\n psveho-therapeutical work.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7. Many cases have come to us for help\n and seemingly marvelous results have\n been accomplished. Rheumatics, cases of\n Influenza, of headache, sufferers from\n melancholia and paranoia, etc., etc.\n Positive cures, some almost instantane\u00ac\n ous, have been made, and every case\n helped almost at once; not one but\n</p>\n<p>\n seems curable, and that in the near\n future.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. At a given time in the class instruc\u00ac\n tion, I prepare the way to help some who\n are present, and at times absent ones,\n who know the movement of our endeavor,\n by holding up the sacredness of the\n service about to be rendered in the\n name and spirit of the Great Healer. It\n is always a vital, devout, holy, inspiring\n moment, and at times one can feel the\n vibrating thrill and uplift with great\n power.\n</p>\n<p>\n 9. We show how necessary it is to\n work for the destruction of all physical,\n intellectual, moral and spiritual crook\u00ac\n edness. The balanced, harmonious, co\u00ac\n ordinated, blended life of the whole man\n we strive for mightily. We are urging\n constantly that peace of the body, mind\n and sou! can only be found in rounded\n completeness in tfie life of the indi\u00ac\n vidual; and so our work is profoundly\n religious.\n</p>\n<p>\n 10. New life and power are in evi\u00ac\n dence in our church since this work be\u00ac\n gan People heretofore unknown to us\n are showing profound interest in our\n work. Jews Greeks, Armenians, Catho\u00ac\n lics, Protestants are sympathetic and\n helpful. A new incentive to work, an\n added emphasis placed upon Christian\n service, increased devotion toward Christ\n our Leader, more real and vital contact\n with God\u2014these are some of the great\n gains we have secured.\n</p>\n<p>\n Expressions\n</p>\n<p>\n of\n</p>\n<p>\n Omni\n</p>\n<p>\n pinions rrom rar an\n</p>\n<p>\n a n\n</p>\n<p>\n ear\n</p>\n<p>\n To the ' EaUor\u2019Of i-tbe^Eagle Library:\n</p>\n<p>\n I approve most heartily the work done\n by the Emmanuel Movement, first be\u00ac\n cause it Ms movement *a(as against\n none), and, second, oevause it stands for\n God with us\u2014and that\u2019s where we want\n Him. That is, a realization that He is\n with us and in us.\n</p>\n<p>\n I know of cures being made from ef\u00ac\n forts in the above activity, some of them\n cases sent by physicians who recognized\n them as psychic and beyond, not only\n drugs, but their own particular function\n as medical doctors. The physician near\u00ac\n ly always has first chance at a man It\n is only after his failure with medicine\n on his judgment that they are not the\n Rgent needed, that one gets into the at\u00ac\n mosphere of actual treatment under thi9\n movement.\n</p>\n<p>\n Personally. I would gladly see this\n work supplemented by the truth jis con\u00ac\n tained in the works of Emanuel Sweden\u00ac\n borg; and have myself made effort to\n introduce the idea to the Church of the\n New Jerusalem This body \" should log\u00ac\n ically take up the work \" as the R.ev El\u00ac\n ton Worcester himself said to me in\n conversation. As a matter of fact, there\n is growing interest in it (among new\n churchmen) and at the annua! conven\u00ac\n tion soon to be heid the question will\n come before that Ministers Council for\n discussion. Swedenborg\u2019s teachings add\n the element of the concrete and the spe\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n cific that serve most usefully to some\n practical minds prone to lock upon\n religion as an abstract thing. My ap\u00ac\n proval of the movement is based on Its\n fruits. CLIFTON S. WADY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 320 Classen avenue, Brooklyn. March\n 24. 1908.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the Editor of the Eagle Library;\n</p>\n<p>\n I believe the Emmanuel Movement is of\n God. and promises a new era of useful\u00ac\n ness for the church. I look upon It as\n a restoration to faith and prayer of their\n New Testament values. This means for\n the church a return to more of its New\n Testament power and works When Emil\n Metchnlkoff. of the Pasteur Institute,\n Paris, says concerning prayer for the\n sick, in his work upon \u201cThe Nature of\n Man\u2019\u2019: \" Every one has now come to re\u00ac\n gard such events as mere relics of old\n customs without intrinsic importance \" It\n is refreshing to hear prayer, with its\n accompanying faith in God vindicated by\n such men as Dubois Schofield, Professor\n James, Sir Oliver Lodge and other men\n of authoritative dictum in the realm of\n scientific studies Ir. a way. the Emma\u00ac\n nuel Movement bears witness afresh to\n the efficacy of prayer to heal the sick\n that Luther, Spurgeon, Moody and other\n great men of God saw from time to time\n in their ministries To my mind, this\n movement promises to take its place\n among the big movements of the twen\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n tieth century, and that, along with civic\n righteousness, Industrial reform, temper\u00ac\n ance. missions and evangelism fills us\n with optimism for the coming of the\n Kingdom of God, that \u201cone far-off divine\n event toward which the whole creation\n moves. \"\n</p>\n<p>\n HENRY F.

But what man with faith and com\u00ac\n mon sense can fail to see that the church\n has been leaving too much to charlatans\n the therapeutio use of some of the sim\u00ac\n plest scientific, facts and plainest teach\u00ac\n ings of the gospel? We have been doing\n this foolishness for orthodoxy\u2019s sake. In\n the meantime, think of the suffering and\n agony undergone by thousands of God\u2019s\n people who were orthodox enough God\n knows, but who have never been taught\n the full gospel. We admit and welcome\n the results of modern physics in the use\n of electricity. Why not also use the best\n methods of modern psychology if they\n bring relief from suffering, mental and\n physical: suffering that is real, and suf\u00ac\n fering that is to the discredit of the\n church and to the dishonor of our Heav\u00ac\n enly Father?\n</p>\n<p>\n THOMAS W. SMITH.\n</p>\n<p>\n St. Nicholas Av. Pres. Church. Manhattan\n</p>\n<p>\n To the Editor of the Eagle Library:\n</p>\n<p>\n The overflowing audiences that have\n greeted the Rev. Dr. MacDonald on his\n scholarly presentation of the principles\n of the Emmanuel Movement would seem\n to prove conclusively that thinking peo\u00ac\n ple are not averse to, but on the con\u00ac\n trary welcome, any new mode of thought\n that is logical, that does not violate rea\u00ac\n son and is susceptible of proof.\n</p>\n<p>\n In so far as the churches are concerned,\n they may possibly gain considerable by\n identifying themselves with this move\u00ac\n ment, thereby proving to the world that\n their chief aim is not the perpetuation\n of theological dogmas, but that practical\n Christianity concerns itself in dealing\n \u2022with man\u2019s present as well as his future\n needs, and that there is nothing incom\u00ac\n patible in a man being almost a saint\n while possessing a vigorously healthy\n body.\n</p>\n<p>\n I think this movement will also have\n a tendency to more and more broaden the\n mind of tie physician, for he will appre\u00ac\n ciate the absolute truth of what has for\n some time past been admitted by lead\u00ac\n ing members of his profession, that an ap\u00ac\n peal to the psychic forces inherent in\n man is, at least in functional disorders,\n of decidedly greater efficacy than medica\u00ac\n tion. The ultimate success of the move\u00ac\n ment would seem to depend largely upon\n the personnel of those who identify them\u00ac\n selves with its ministrations. On the\n part of both minister and physician it is\n of paramount importance that there be a\n large experience with the world, infinite\n patience and an unbounded love and sym\u00ac\n pathy for mankind. J. B. B.\n</p>\n<p>\n Brooklyn.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the Editor of the Eagle Library:\n</p>\n<p>\n I was recently nurse, during days of\n delirium, to a man who has for many\n years been fighting against periodical\n attacks of severe alcoholism. So-called\n ' \u2018.cures,\u201d sanitariums and doctors were\n unsuccessful. In despair we applied to\n Dr. MacDonald for possible help through\n the Emmanuel Movement, and the doctor\n consented to take him. There were five\n conferences, extending over nine days,\n and he has not touched a drop since the\n first.\n</p>\n<p>\n That day I left him alone for several\n hours, when he triumphantly showed\n me a full bottle of whisky accidentally\n</p>\n<p>\n discovered where I had secreted it. and\n which he had abstained from drinking,\n although sorely tempted.\n</p>\n<p>\n After the second conference, on seeing\n a big whisky sigu, telling a certain brand\n is \" best,\u201d he responded mentally, \" That\u2019s\n a lie: there is no good in it,\u201d reiterating\n it whenever the haunting thought re\u00ac\n curred to him. After the third confer\u00ac\n ence he went and paid his saloon bills,\n informing them they would never see\n him again and refusing to touch a drop\n in spite of laughter and ridicule.\n</p>\n<p>\n He is following the Emmanuel teach\u00ac\n ings, full of hope for the. future. The\n removal of this curse, which has almost\n wrecked his life, is the greatest possible\n blessing that could have come to him.\n</p>\n<p>\n P. M. D.\n</p>\n<p>\n Brooklyu, March 27. 190S.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the Editor of the Eagle Library:\n</p>\n<p>\n My candid opinion is that the Emmanuel\n Movement has come to stay. It fills a\n long felt need. It reminds the minister\n of Christ from whence he is fallen and\n points to some reasons why he. as a\n candlestick, is losing his place. It re\u00ac\n veals the present, day possibilities that\n accompany the divine annointing and\n commission, induces repentance for hav\u00ac\n ing been weak when we might have been\n strong, for the wrong we have done to\n ourselves and others, and thereby leads\n us to wait upon God for the renewal of\n strength until w ' e go forth conscious of\n the iudw ' elling power which enabled Peter\n and John to say to the cripple at the\n temple gate: \u201cSuch as we have give we\n unto thee.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It reveals the fact that our influence\n does not depend upon what we know or\n say or do. But it is what we are that\n counts in our contact wdth tbe sinful, the\n sorrowful and the sick.\n</p>\n<p>\n Rev. THOMAS BILLING.\n</p>\n<p>\n Cannon Falls, Minn., March 25. 1908.\n</p>\n<p>\n What do I think of the Emmanuel\n Movement?\n</p>\n<p>\n So far as it purports to give sympathy\n to distressed and sick persons it is\n praiseworthy. So far as it claims to heal\n the sick by mental treatment or \u201cspirit\u00ac\n ual hypnosis.\u201d it is mistaken. Its basis\n is not yet established scientifically nor\n its ministers trained to such service. Nor\n is such work, the highest mission of the\n church, which should save souls and not\n bodies. Christ\u2019s healing was only inci\u00ac\n dental to his teaching, and his commis\u00ac\n sion to his disciples was to \u201cgo preach.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The movement takes no account of the\n \" ministry of suffering,\u201d and assumes that\n God\u2019s will is perfect health for all his\n creatures, and assumes that by an effort\n of the will, healing can be had for ill\u00ac\n ness following breaking of nature\u2019s laws.\n It assumes that the laws of functional\n health are not the same as those of or\u00ac\n ganic health, and can be cured by a men\u00ac\n tal resolve or state of mind.\n</p>\n<p>\n LEWIS C. GROVER.\n</p>\n<p>\n Brooklyn.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the Editor of the Eagle Library:\n</p>\n<p>\n One hundred and fifty words can give\n but slight expression on the comprehen\u00ac\n sive in hand.

In the beginning of the\n twentieth century we\u2018are truly in the\n dawn of \u201ca new heaven and a new earth.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n A few words cannot express the bear\u00ac\n ing it shall have on the religions of the\n world, especially that of the Christian.\n In the great past mentality and idolatry\n have dealt almost exclusively in exoteri-\n cism. The present and hereafter eso-\n tericism. analysis of the interior spiritual\n power, will be the burden of man\u2019s\n thought and research.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Emmanuel Movement I sense to be\n an approachment to the true conception\n of the spiritual relationship of man to\n man and of man to the Infinite.\n</p>\n<p>\n Only an unbiggoted and devoted student\n of the occult or spiritual forces in nature\n of whom I recognize the Rev. Dr. Mac-i\n</p>\n<p>\n Donald as being one, can be cognizant of\n the power of mind in the human and its\n possible co-ordination with the Universal\n Mind, or, if you prefer, God.\n</p>\n<p>\n Without wishing to be harsh in criti\u00ac\n cism of past pagan and theologic phrase\u00ac\n ologies, this new concept of the old Christ\n thought puts man above \u201ca worm of the\n dust\u201d and forbids the imploration, \u201cbe\n merciful to me a miserable sinner,\u201d and\n instead thereof, say, \" I am a part of\n Thee; my soul given is of Thy soul; my\n mind is a spark of Thy mind, and per\u00ac\n chance my will is a blessed product of\n co-operated spiritual forces in heredity\n and environment. Then must I feel and\n say I am true to myself, true and merci\u00ac\n ful to my kin, and thus approximate one\u00ac\n ness with the perfect God life and love.\n Thence praying on Sunday and praying on\n Monday shall cease.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let a new spiritual dispensation awaken\n the slumbers of the church, which the\n Emmanuel Movement is possible to effect.\n</p>\n<p>\n W. WINES SARGENT.\n</p>\n<p>\n 577 Greene avenue, April 2, 1908.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the Editor of the Eagle Library:\n</p>\n<p>\n The Emmanuel Movement appears to\n me as a new and mighty power for God\n in the modern church. It takes the\n grain of truth in Christian Science, dis\u00ac\n pensing with the fantastic, and makes\n that tiny grain grow into a harvest.\n</p>\n<p>\n While the theory of the double con\u00ac\n sciousness of man is not by any means\n new, never before have so many sane\n and sound Christian people laid such em\u00ac\n phasis upon it as a legitimate adjunct\n of Christianity. The new study of mat\u00ac\n ter separates it into its constituent elec\u00ac\n trons which flash and flare with life.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nearer are we getting to the truth\n that in its ultimate analysis the ma\u00ac\n terial is spiritual. If matter shall be\n found to be spiritual, who can reckon\n the powerful influences the immaterial\n mind may have over the body? May it\n not be a contest between similar forces,\n the one immaterial and superior, the\n \u2022 ' ffher seemingly material but inferior?\n</p>\n<p>\n I believe that we are sailing only\n along the shore of psychic truth w\u2019hich\n w ' e have not yet begun to explore. With\n the example of Jesus with its urgent ap\u00ac\n peal to the permanency of the spiritual.\n I earnestly believe that a new day has\n been inaugurated in our churches by the\n Emmanuel Movement. Let us not claim\n too much, but at least be ready to sub\u00ac\n sidize all methods that will co-operate\n with the helpful and healing forces of\n the gracious and good God.\n</p>\n<p>\n FRANK S. SQUYER,\n</p>\n<p>\n Pastor First Baptist Church, Friend\u00ac\n ship, N. Y.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the Editor of the Eagle Library:\n</p>\n<p>\n On the subject of mental healing there\n are two opinions. One well known phys\u00ac\n ician writes that books on mind cure are\n calculated to make serious evil, and that\n some minds delight altogether too much\n in the fogs of mystery. Other physicians\n there are who believe that mental heal\u00ac\n ing has a sound scientific basis, and has\n come to stay. This at least would seem\n to be the conclusion of a Boston doctor\n talking before a class of students tho\n other day.\n</p>\n<p>\n The layman must be guided in his judg\u00ac\n ment by the simple rule that \u201cby their\n fruit ye shall know them.\u201d Personally. I\n do not believe that the power to heal cer\u00ac\n tain diseases by the power of a living\n faith in God became a lost secret with\n the death of the early apostles.\n</p>\n<p>\n In reading Dr. MacDonald\u2019s sermons I\n am impressed by his calm, reasonable arc;\n thorough presentation of the subject Tha\n Christian minister and the skilled Chris\u00ac\n tian physician can and ought to be po\u00ac\n tent factors in exorcising these demons\n of nervous diseases which are saddening\n so many precious lives in our land.\n</p>\n<p>\n RICHARD OWEN.\n</p>\n<p>\n Congregational Church, Hyannis, Mas3,\n March 28, 1908.\n</p>\n<p>\n i\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0039/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 185, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0039/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 371, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 559}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0039/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 742, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1119}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0039/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1484, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2238}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0039/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2968, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4476}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:em:ma:nu:el:mo:ve:me:nt:00:un:se:emmanuelmovement00unse:emmanuelmovement00unse_0039/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/em/ma/nu/el/mo/ve/me/nt/00/un/se/emmanuelmovement00unse/emmanuelmovement00unse_0039.jp2", "height": 4476, "width": 2968, "levels": 6, "size": 915656}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"39\">\n<p>\n THE EAGLE LIBRARY\n</p>\n<p>\n A Series of Publications\n</p>\n<p>\n (Numbers Out of Print are marked thus *.\n</p>\n<p>\n on Topics of Contemporaneous Interest\n</p>\n<p>\n Copies may be seen on application at the Eagle Information Bureau.)\n</p>\n<p>\n No. 1\u2014 \u2022The Constitution of N.
