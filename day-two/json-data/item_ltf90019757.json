No life, indeed, is\n without its bright spot, \u2014 hidden away, perchance, among\n sad memories, yet reverently cherished. As on bleak\n hill-sides of splintered rock green things nestle, and a\n flower here and there springs up, so in human experi\u00ac\n ence there is something still bright where exist poverty\n and corroding care. None have been without their\n dream of a good to come. Some fair hope has glided\n into the heart. Some true and tender feeling once had\n place, and is not wholly forgotten, even if the man has\n wandered far in sin. There is yet the odor of a past\n</p>\n<p>\n H\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hy:ea:rt:ho:ug:00:po:we:throughyearthoug00powe:throughyearthoug00powe_0128/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 261, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 415}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hy:ea:rt:ho:ug:00:po:we:throughyearthoug00powe:throughyearthoug00powe_0128/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 523, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 831}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hy:ea:rt:ho:ug:00:po:we:throughyearthoug00powe:throughyearthoug00powe_0128/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1046, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1663}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hy:ea:rt:ho:ug:00:po:we:throughyearthoug00powe:throughyearthoug00powe_0128/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2093, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3327}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hy:ea:rt:ho:ug:00:po:we:throughyearthoug00powe:throughyearthoug00powe_0128/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/th/ro/ug/hy/ea/rt/ho/ug/00/po/we/throughyearthoug00powe/throughyearthoug00powe_0128.jp2", "height": 3327, "width": 2093, "levels": 6, "size": 384906}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"128\">\n<p>\n EASTER AND EASTER-TIDE.\n</p>\n<p>\n 114\n</p>\n<p>\n delight in days that have gone under the cloud.

The\n classics abound in evidences of the wide-spread faith\n in their spiritual nature. Grave philosophers have w r rit-\n ten treatises on their interpretation, as they did on\n astrology. A common way of consulting the Greek and\n Roman oracles was for the inquirer to sleep a night in\n the temple, after the due performance of religious rites,\n when his questions were supposed to be answered in\n dreams. That dreams should have a peculiar signifi\u00ac\n cance attached to them by the ignorant and unlettered\n is not to be wondered at, when we consider some of\n their extraordinary phenomena, and the proneness of\n the mind to be affected by what is marvellous. They\n often come without any logical connection with what is\n remembered. They produce impressions frequently\n deeper than any written or spoken thought. They\n are sometimes characterized by a clearness of vision\n and a definiteness of aim that give them a peculiar\n emphasis and influence.

De Quincey declares that he\n sometimes seemed to live seventy or one hundred years\n in a single night. \u201c A person who was suddenly aroused\n from sleep by a few drops of water sprinkled in his face\n dreamed of the events of an entire life, in which happi\u00ac\n ness and sorrow were mingled, and which terminated\n finally in an altercation upon the border of a lake, into\n which his exasperated companion, after a considerable\n struggle, succeeded in plunging him.\u201d The whole\n dream could have lasted but a few seconds. Dr. Aber\u00ac\n crombie tells of a case, which is often quoted, of a man\n who dreamed that he had enlisted as a soldier, joined\n his regiment, was apprehended, carried back, tried, con\u00ac\n demned to be shot, and at last was led out to execution.\n After the usual preparations a gun was fired, and he\n awoke with the report to find out that the cause of his\n disturbance was a noise in an adjoining room. In a\n brief space, less than it takes to describe it, this long\n series of events had passed through the mind.

But I feel a deep disappointment\n at seeing so much of life and precious opportunity pass\n away unemployed.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n To a great soul like his, spurred by a high ambition\n for usefulness, to feel crippled in the very blossom and\n noon of life, forced, like a caged eagle, to the seclusion\n of the invalid, while eager to serve the high interests of\n his fellow-men, was a bitter trial I should fail to note\n an amiable feature of his character if I did not relate\n that through the darkest period of his sufferings, and the\n years that followed, no unbecoming word of complaint\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hy:ea:rt:ho:ug:00:po:we:throughyearthoug00powe:throughyearthoug00powe_0285/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 261, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 415}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hy:ea:rt:ho:ug:00:po:we:throughyearthoug00powe:throughyearthoug00powe_0285/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 523, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 831}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hy:ea:rt:ho:ug:00:po:we:throughyearthoug00powe:throughyearthoug00powe_0285/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1046, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1663}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hy:ea:rt:ho:ug:00:po:we:throughyearthoug00powe:throughyearthoug00powe_0285/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2093, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3327}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hy:ea:rt:ho:ug:00:po:we:throughyearthoug00powe:throughyearthoug00powe_0285/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/th/ro/ug/hy/ea/rt/ho/ug/00/po/we/throughyearthoug00powe/throughyearthoug00powe_0285.jp2", "height": 3327, "width": 2093, "levels": 6, "size": 376607}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"285\">\n<p>\n SUMNER.\n</p>\n<p>\n 271\n</p>\n<p>\n passed his lips.

To impart a greater interest to the poetry, he has accom\u00ac\n panied the selections with brief biographical sketches, giving a few leading dates\n or facts connected with the history of the authors, and the prominent features of\n their career.

Price #1.25.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Mr. Hale has here accomplished the difficult task of writing a temperance\n story that is graceful, enthusiastic, practical, and devoid of fanaticism and extrava\u00ac\n gance. Too many of the stories written in the interests of temperance are so\n defective as works of literary art, and are so crude, ill-natured, unwise, and intem\u00ac\n perate as to create a general impression unfavorable to them as a class. . . . We\n particularly like the volume and its suggestions because they are so little Utopian,\n so entirely feasible and practicable ; and, also, because the methods pictured in its\n pleasant pages seek not only to drive out an intolerable evil, but, while doing so,\n to perfect and beautify and utilize measures for the general welfare, contentment,\n and happiness of all classes of our people.

The singular and almost weird character of Blake\u2019s\n genius caused it to be but little understood even among his contemporaries, save\n by a few of the greatest of his fellow-artists. And his literary work passed rap\u00ac\n idly into comparative obscurity, from which it has now been for the first time\n worthily brought into public view, though there have been several previous at\u00ac\n tempts to call attention to it. The biography is an admirable one, lending a\n singular interest to the weird, quaint rhymes and occasional wild bits of power that\n follow in the body of the volume. It is a good thing to have again some memo\u00ac\n rial of the man of whose work Flaxman said, \u2018 The time will come when the finest\n of Blake\u2019s designs will be as much sought for and treasured up as those of Michel\n Angelo.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Appletotls Journal.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hy:ea:rt:ho:ug:00:po:we:throughyearthoug00powe:throughyearthoug00powe_0310/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 261, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 415}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hy:ea:rt:ho:ug:00:po:we:throughyearthoug00powe:throughyearthoug00powe_0310/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 523, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 831}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hy:ea:rt:ho:ug:00:po:we:throughyearthoug00powe:throughyearthoug00powe_0310/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1046, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1663}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hy:ea:rt:ho:ug:00:po:we:throughyearthoug00powe:throughyearthoug00powe_0310/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2093, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3327}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:ro:ug:hy:ea:rt:ho:ug:00:po:we:throughyearthoug00powe:throughyearthoug00powe_0310/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/th/ro/ug/hy/ea/rt/ho/ug/00/po/we/throughyearthoug00powe/throughyearthoug00powe_0310.jp2", "height": 3327, "width": 2093, "levels": 6, "size": 487968}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"310\">\n<p>\n ROBERTS BROTHERS \u2019 NEW BOOKS.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n Vlll\n</p>\n<p>\n MORE BED-TIME STORIES.
