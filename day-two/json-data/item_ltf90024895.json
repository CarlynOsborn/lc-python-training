Hence the Nicene Creed. These two, constitute the\n Christian faith. The Church of Christ has adopted no other\n Creed. Any other Creed may be the property, or foundation\n of a sect, but it can have no relation to Christ\u2019s Church. It is\n as a part of that divinely instituted body, the Universal Church\n of Christ, holding this One Faith of the One Church, whole\n and entire, maintaining inviolate the Apostolic ministry ap\u00ac\n pointed by our Saviour, Christ, and celebrating continually\n the very sacraments which He ordained, that we come here\n to-day, to lay the Corner-stone of a Christian house of prayer.\n The purpose for which we have assembled, furnishes an ap\u00ac\n propriate occasion for looking back upon some of the promi\u00ac\n nent incidents in the past history of the Church, which serve\n to illustrate the existing condition of things, and will enable\n us to appreciate our own position, anc^our duties as members\n of the Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n Historical Sketch of the Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n One principle of the providential government of the\n Church, will be made conspicuous by this review. That prin\u00ac\n ciple is, that, for wise purposes, God has appointed His Church\n on earth to be ever militant \u2014 ever struggling against malign\n and adverse influences. Wherever the truth of Christ is\n preached, there Anti-Christ has been permitted to unfurl his\n standard, in some form of determined and successful opposi\u00ac\n tion. The prophetic delineation of the Church, corresponding\n so perfectly in this particular, with her past history under\n every dispensation, furnishes abundant reason to suppose, that\n she w r ill be always and contemporaneously distressed, but\n joyful; overborne, but victorious; torn and convulsed by the\n powers of evil, but triumphing successively over them all.\n Her oppressions and distractions, are the just punishment of\n her sins\u2014the needful discipline for her correction.

The sect principle was, indeed, subsequently\n introduced into England, from the continent, in all its forms\u2014\n Romish and L Calvanistic, and produced there its accus\u00ac\n tomed evil fruits. But in the struggle which ensued, the\n Church finally prevailed. The civil and religious distractions\n of this period, left the Church, not only in alliance with the\n State, but in bondage to it. While the fanaticism of that centu\u00ac\n ry of rage and madness, by a natural re-action, weakened the\n feeling, and impaired the influence of religion, in and over the\n minds of the people. Such was the state of things, during\n the progress of the settlement of this country. Although\n religion continued to be regarded as of primary importance,\n a thing never to be left out in the Constitution of a State,\n and in the formation of society, yet it was a religion modi\u00ac\n fied, and lowered, and shorn of much of its power by these\n unhappy circumstances.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Church, with her faith, her sacraments, and a part of\n her ministry, was sent across the waters, and every where\n substantial edifices, for public worship, were erected, and\n competent provision made for the maintenance of all the\n decencies, and proprieties of religion. And, doubtless, the\n influence of these institutions, defective as they were, was\n most benign and salutary, and gave to the age of the revo\u00ac\n lution its noble character, and its deep seated principles; the\n force and momentum of which, have come down with grad-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:pr:es:en:tp:os:it:00:cr:ai:pastpresentposit00crai:pastpresentposit00crai_0017/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 156, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 264}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:pr:es:en:tp:os:it:00:cr:ai:pastpresentposit00crai:pastpresentposit00crai_0017/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 312, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 528}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:pr:es:en:tp:os:it:00:cr:ai:pastpresentposit00crai:pastpresentposit00crai_0017/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 625, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1056}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:pr:es:en:tp:os:it:00:cr:ai:pastpresentposit00crai:pastpresentposit00crai_0017/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1250, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2113}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:pr:es:en:tp:os:it:00:cr:ai:pastpresentposit00crai:pastpresentposit00crai_0017/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2501, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4227}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pa:st:pr:es:en:tp:os:it:00:cr:ai:pastpresentposit00crai:pastpresentposit00crai_0017/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/pa/st/pr/es/en/tp/os/it/00/cr/ai/pastpresentposit00crai/pastpresentposit00crai_0017.jp2", "height": 4227, "width": 2501, "levels": 6, "size": 513893}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"17\">\n<p>\n [ 15 ]\n</p>\n<p>\n ually decreasing power to our own day.

That ministry, in its original\n constitution, was an entirety, a unit, a single whole, com\u00ac\n posed of many individuals. The Church of Christ in Eng\u00ac\n land, retained this divine institution in its integrity. But the\n rulers of the State, did not see the use of compliance with\n this appointment of God, in the new planting of the Church\n in America. They undertook to dispense with a part, and\n the most essential part of that divine institution, because it\n seemed to them, and to their philosophy, that what they re\u00ac\n tained was sufficient for the purpose! It is true, that the\n Episcopate, was nominally and in contemplation of law, con\u00ac\n tinued as a part of the constitution of the Church in this\n country, by making the whole of the North American Colo\u00ac\n nies a part of the diocess of London.

From out of such materials, the min\u00ac\n istry for this country was to be provided, and, as a matter of\n course, that ministry consisted, for the most part, of the re\u00ac\n fuse of the English Clergy; of those who, unable to obtain a\n living at home, consented to go into banishment in the Colo\u00ac\n nies. To this rule there were, however, many high and hon\u00ac\n orable exceptions. What could have been expected from\n such a Clergy, under such circumstances, without Episcopal\n supervision, without any sort of control, but that public opin\u00ac\n ion which they were to form, and which could only receive\n its tone and character from themselves?

The principle that every man\n who has a novel opinion, must found a Church, to be the\n representative of that opinion, has worked itself out to a\n reductio ad absurdum. It is dying at the root. The stur\u00ac\n dier branches which sprung from that root, may stand a long\n time, but the life is passing out of them. There is a general\n consciousness of this. Men professing to be Christians, to\n belong to a universal brotherhood, cannot remain in the\n isolation, to which the sect principle has reduced them. The\n instincts of a Christian nature, cause them to yearn for com\u00ac\n munion, with the whole family of the redeemed. Hence, al\u00ac\n though men do not think of dissolving the associations, which\n have sprung out of this sect principle, yet they are trying, in\n every way, by sinking their differences, and by factitious\n unions of all sorts, to nullify the principle itself, and to neu\u00ac\n tralize its practical operation. It is in this aspect, that the\n celebrated meeting in London, last Fall, called \u201cthe Evangel\u00ac\n ical Alliance,\u201d becomes a prominent symptom of the times in\n which we live. The suggestion, and the formation of that\n alliance, is a proof, that its members have seen that the sect\n principle, in which once they believed and trusted, is a mis\u00ac\n take : and yet that they do not, or will not see, how the mis\u00ac\n take should be corrected.
