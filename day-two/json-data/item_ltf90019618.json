To suppose that\n the Divine Being is bound by any principle of jus\u00ac\n tice to exercise mercy upon a race of rebels against\n his government, is to suppose an absurdity,* for this\n would resol\\e all his kindness to his creatures into\n acts of justice, which necessarily destroys the idea of\n mercy; and this involves another absurdity, that to\n exercise justice in any case would be an act of in\u00ac\n justice. To suppose that because God is pleased to\n exercise mercy towards any of the rebels in his do\u00ac\n minions, it would be injustice to the rest if he did\n not exercise mercy towards them, is not only limit\u00ac\n ing the Almighty by denying to him the prerogative\n exercised by every supreme governor in the world,\n which is that of displaying his sovereignty in the\n discrimination of the objects, and the ends of mercy,\n and of suffering justice to take its course as to oth\u00ac\n ers; but it is to suppose that the act of mercy to\u00ac\n wards the first individual that was pardoned, ren\u00ac\n dered it necessary, in order to preserve the honor\n of the divine character that all the rest should he\n pardoned; which converts what was an act of mercy\n in the first instance into an act of justice in every\n subsequent case; this also shows that some reason-\n ers have very mistaken conceptions of the divine\n justice. The supposition that this doctrine is a re\u00ac\n flection on the justice of God probably arises from\n two causes; first, from the want of a deep and proper\n sense of the evil and demerit of sin, and next from\n the unwillingness of the human heart to submit to the\n absolute and unlimited sovereignty of the Divine\n Being; which is a principle so deep in human na\u00ac\n ture as not to be fully discovered, and so extensive\n in its operation as not only to arraign the truths of\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:me:mo:ir:so:fc:ap:ta:in:00:gr:if:memoirsofcaptain00grif:memoirsofcaptain00grif_0083/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 234, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 417}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:me:mo:ir:so:fc:ap:ta:in:00:gr:if:memoirsofcaptain00grif:memoirsofcaptain00grif_0083/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 469, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 834}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:me:mo:ir:so:fc:ap:ta:in:00:gr:if:memoirsofcaptain00grif:memoirsofcaptain00grif_0083/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 938, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1668}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:me:mo:ir:so:fc:ap:ta:in:00:gr:if:memoirsofcaptain00grif:memoirsofcaptain00grif_0083/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1876, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3337}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:me:mo:ir:so:fc:ap:ta:in:00:gr:if:memoirsofcaptain00grif:memoirsofcaptain00grif_0083/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/me/mo/ir/so/fc/ap/ta/in/00/gr/if/memoirsofcaptain00grif/memoirsofcaptain00grif_0083.jp2", "height": 3337, "width": 1876, "levels": 6, "size": 451269}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"83\">\n<p>\n IIIS CONVERSION TO CHRISTIANITY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 79\n</p>\n<p>\n revelation at its bar, but also the ways of Provi\u00ac\n dence and to \u201cjudge the justice of our God.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. As an explanation of this subject was princi\u00ac\n pally intended by introducing it here, it is unneces\u00ac\n sary to say more by way of proof, than simply to\n state that the truth of the doctrine was argued from\n its being reasonable, that the Divine Being should\n propose to himself some ultimate end of all bis works,\n that bis glory should be that end, and that every\n thing and every event should be made conducive to\n it. An ultimate end to be accomplished supposes a\n design, a design supposes an arrangement of parts\n and operations, an arrangement supposes a deter\u00ac\n mination, and the work is the result of the whole,\n this is what is intended by predestination. This\n argument is not only collected from the operations\n of the human mind in its progress to the accomplish\u00ac\n ment of some design, but is evident from the works\n of creation and providence.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Jt was argued from the admission of the di\u00ac\n vine prescience or foreknowledge. To deny bis fore\u00ac\n knowledge, is to deny one of the perfections of his\n nature, and w hat, in (be scriptures be claims as bis\n distinguishing prerogative, but as it is observed by\n a great writer on this subject, \u201cThere can be no\n prescience of future contingencies, for it involves a\n contradiction to say, things which are not certainly\n to be, should be certainly foreseen. If they are\n certainly foreseen, they must certainly be, and can\n therefore be no longer contingent. An uncertain\n foresight is also an imperfect act, as it may be a\n mistake, and is therefore inconsistent with divine\n perfection. On the other side the difficulty is easily\n explained. When God decrees that an event shall\n take place, its existence becomes thenceforth certain,\n and as such, is certainly foreseen.

I marked in the first place a deep and\n anxious investigation into the state of his soul. He\n debated the matter of his personal religion, as in the\n light and under the immediate eye of God. Con\u00ac\n sidering the ease witli which a man may deceive him\u00ac\n self, and impose upon others by an empty and un\u00ac\n profitable form of godliness, he was desirous of\n availing himself of every assistance in ascertaining\n the truth of his condition. He felt perplexed on the\n ground of indwelling sin , and for the sake of ob\u00ac\n taining clear views and refreshing his recollections\n on this important point, he read Dr. Owen\u2019s master\u00ac\n ly treatise on the subject. On one occasion he told\n me, he had been seriously engaged in examining the\n grounds and evidences of his own conversion , fearing\n Jest he should take too much for granted, or regard\n a change of sentiment and a reformation of manners\n as conversion, without the inbeing of that spiritual\n life and those concomitant fruits of the Spirit, which\n the scriptures represent as indispensably necessary.\n He dwelt much on this.thcme, and we concluded with\n prayer for light, sincerity and satisfaction. Having\n attained to some good degree of certainty on this\n momentous point, he enjoyed a stable peace , by faith\n in the atonement and righteousness of Jesus Christ,\n and never afterwarde betrayed even a momentary\n disquietude or alarm, at the prospect or consequen\u00ac\n ces of his approaching dissolution.

Jehovah shakes the earth to its\n centre with his thunders when he appears for\n the salvation of his people. A great part of\n the hook of the Revelation of St. John might he\n quoted to prove and illustate this remark\u2014but I\n must forbear.

The best proof of the same spirit and princi\u00ac\n ple in our English Reformers is to be found in the\n devotional formulae of the church service. Many\n parts of the liturgy, the communion service, and espe\u00ac\n cially the Collects , arc deeply imbued with this unc\u00ac\n tion from on high; several of the Articles of religion\n express, or imply, the same truth: hut nothing can\n be more full and explicit on this subject than are the\n Homilies of the established Church, especially that\n for Whitsunday, wherein, (part 2.) it is said \u201cNeither\n must we think that this Comforter w r as either prom\u00ac\n ised, or else given, only to the Apostles; hut also to\n the universal church of Christ, dispersed through the\n world.
