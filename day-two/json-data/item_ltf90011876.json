The prime dog-\n ma of the Catholics, that all which their church\n teaches is infallible, unchangeable ; that what she\n has onde taught as truth must now and forever be\n truth, lays open to our examination a wide field.\n All and each of the precepts, laws, and acts of\n Popery, from the earliest ages to the present day,\n may be legitimately quoted to show the political\n character of that sect. Innovation, repeal, reform,\n or progress can find no admittance into the Papal\n system, without destroying the fundamental princi-\n ple on which the whole system rests. \u201c The whole\n of our faith,\u201d says Cardinal Pallavicini, an infallible\n authority , \u201crests upon one indivisible article, name-\n ly the infallible authority of the church. The mo-\n ment , therefore ) we give up any part whatever , the\n whole falls i for what admits not of being divided,\n must evidently stand entire , or fall entire.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Protestantism, on the contrary, is founded on\n the Bible ; the Bible is the rallying point of all Pro-\n testant religious sects. They all believe that God\n is its author.

The kindness and bene-\n volence thus shown to the poor beget in this class of\n our citizens, industry and mental effort.
