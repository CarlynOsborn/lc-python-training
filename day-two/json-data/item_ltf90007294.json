And yet nothing more is necessary to\n conversion. Let any sinner, as a rational, ac-\n countable agent, bring his understanding to bear\n on the nature, necessity, and means of conver-\n sion ; let him, in the appointed means of grace,\n seek a change of heart ; the Holy Spirit is in\n every effort he makes, and in all the means he\n uses, and will certainly convert and save him if\n he persevere. It is not necessary that his un-\n derstanding should be fully opened of a sudden,\n that his mind should be agitated with fear and\n despair in order to obtain pardon, and be assured\n of an interest in the divine regards. But he\n may say, that his mind is dark, stupid, and bar-\n ren of every thing good. It is well that he has\n a sense of these things. But he means to say,\n that he has no adequate sense of them.

John\n saw that he could not administer the same bap-\n tism to Christ which he administered to guilty\n sinners ; and therefore, when he saw the Son\n of God come to him, he objected, saying, \u201c I\n have need to be baptized of thee, and comest\n thou to me ?\u201d Jesus replied, \u201c Suffer it to be so\n now, for thus it becometh us to fulfil all right-\n eousness.\u201d That is, it became him to honour\n John\u2019s mission and ministry; and more espe-\n cially as he was the \u201c High Priest of our pro-\n fession,\u201d (see Heb. iii, 1,) it became him, as\n 6\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:ts:gu:id:ep:re:00:me:rr:convertsguidepre00merr:convertsguidepre00merr_0086/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 190, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 315}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:ts:gu:id:ep:re:00:me:rr:convertsguidepre00merr:convertsguidepre00merr_0086/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 381, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 630}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:ts:gu:id:ep:re:00:me:rr:convertsguidepre00merr:convertsguidepre00merr_0086/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 763, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1261}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:ts:gu:id:ep:re:00:me:rr:convertsguidepre00merr:convertsguidepre00merr_0086/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1527, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2522}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:ts:gu:id:ep:re:00:me:rr:convertsguidepre00merr:convertsguidepre00merr_0086/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nv/er/ts/gu/id/ep/re/00/me/rr/convertsguidepre00merr/convertsguidepre00merr_0086.jp2", "height": 2522, "width": 1527, "levels": 6, "size": 317996}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"86\">\n<p>\n 82 THE CONVERT\u2019S GUIDE.\n</p>\n<p>\n he was about to enter on the duties of his office,\n to be consecrated by washing the body in wa-\n ter, as the priests were consecrated under the\n law, (see Leviticus viii, 5, 6 ;) and as John was\n an extraordinary messenger sent from God, and\n the only prophet of his day, he was a suitable\n person to do it.

It will follow from hence, if the remark\n be supported, that we have nothing to do in the\n way of practising John\u2019s baptism. As far as\n appears from the New Testament, John did not\n baptize in the name of the Trinity; but Chris-\n tian baptism is always administered in the name\n of the F ather, of the Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\n There is one remark to be made here, which is\n of great importance, as it is sufficient of itself to\n settle this question for ever. It is this : Jesus\n had not manifested himself, when John entered\n on the work of the ministry.

Many of those who were baptized\n by John, were afterward baptized with Christian\n baptism ; which would not have been done if the\n baptism of John had been the same with that of\n Christ. You may recollect, that St. Paul found\n certain disciples at Ephesus, and said unto\n them, Have ye received the Holy Ghost since\n ye believed? And they said, We have not\n heard whether there be any Holy Ghost. And\n he said, Unto what then were ye baptized?\n And they said, Unto John\u2019s baptism. Then said\n Paul, John verily baptized with the baptism of\n repentance, saying unto the people, that they\n should believe on him which should come after\n him, that is, on Christ Jesus. When they heard\n this they were baptized in the name of the Lord\n Jesus,\u201d Acts xix, 1-7. Here we have twelve\n men who were baptized the second time. But\n none are to be baptized twice with the same\n baptism. The same may be said of the three\n thousand who were baptized on the day of pen-\n tecost.

(1.) You have already made a pro-\n fession of religion, and joined yourself to the\n people of God. You are therefore bound to live\n up to all that is implied in this most sacred or-\n dinance.\n</p>\n<p>\n (2.) You have given yourself up to God and\n his people ; the latter require your hearty and\n unremitted effort and example ; and God, though\n He needs not you, nor your services, yet de-\n mands the devotion of yoitr whole person, and\n every talent, to his most blessed service.\n</p>\n<p>\n (3.) It is an undoubted truth, that the greater\n your privileges, your obligations, and profes-\n sions, the greater will be your guilt if you apos-\n tatize. Those who live under, and profess the\n gospel, will, if they walk not in its light, have\n more to answer for than the heathen, who never\n heard the name of Christ. But should you\n therefore thrust the gospel from you, and be-\n come voluntary pagans, because you may apos-\n tatize ?

We must not think that be-\n cause God is to be loved above all, or because\n he is the most loving of all beings, that there-\n fore he is not to be feared. So far from this,\n we shall find that, because he is the greatest\n and best of all beings, he is to be feared above\n all others. ,\n</p>\n<p>\n The apostle John does indeed tell us that\n \u201c perfect love casteth out all fear that hath tor-\n ment.\u201d But perfect love is well consistent with\n that fear of God which we now urge as a Chris-\n tian duty. Many professed Christians form to\n themselves an imaginary God, whom they re-\n present as so flexible and easy a being, that he\n will not be angry with them for any misconduct\n they may fall into, however flagitious. These\n have no proper sense of the majesty, the holi-\n ness, the justice, or the goodness of God ; and\n therefore they are irreverent, carnal, presumptu-\n ous, and unthankful. The fear of God is, in a\n great measure, the same reverential affection\n which a dutiful and loving child feels for his\n parents ; such as will make him careful in his\n whole behaviour, and restrain him from the\n commission of sin.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:ts:gu:id:ep:re:00:me:rr:convertsguidepre00merr:convertsguidepre00merr_0131/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 190, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 315}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:ts:gu:id:ep:re:00:me:rr:convertsguidepre00merr:convertsguidepre00merr_0131/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 381, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 630}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:ts:gu:id:ep:re:00:me:rr:convertsguidepre00merr:convertsguidepre00merr_0131/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 763, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1261}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:ts:gu:id:ep:re:00:me:rr:convertsguidepre00merr:convertsguidepre00merr_0131/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1527, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2522}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:ts:gu:id:ep:re:00:me:rr:convertsguidepre00merr:convertsguidepre00merr_0131/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nv/er/ts/gu/id/ep/re/00/me/rr/convertsguidepre00merr/convertsguidepre00merr_0131.jp2", "height": 2522, "width": 1527, "levels": 6, "size": 296046}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"131\">\n<p>\n THE CONVERT\u2019S GUIDE.\n</p>\n<p>\n 127\n</p>\n<p>\n The same God who hath given us the pas*\n sion of fear as a guard against evil in general,\n has also given us notice that his displeasure is\n the greatest of all evils to us ; and, therefore, as\n we account it a point of wisdom to be watchful\n against other evils, so is it necessarily the high-\n est wisdom to be watchful that we do not dis-\n please him.\n</p>\n<p>\n Considering God as the only being of infinite\n perfection ; the Creator of all things ; the King\n of kings, and the Lord of lords ; and ourselves\n as sinful, erring, dependant, and accountable\n creatures, \u201c should not his excellency make us\n afraid, and his dread fall upon us?\u201d Job xiii, 11.\n And has not Jesus Christ said, and said to his\n own disciples, \u201c Fear not them that kill the body,\n and after that have no more that they can do ;\n but fear him who, after he hath killed, hath\n power to cast into hell : yea, I say unto you,\n fear him?\u201d Luke xii, 4, 5.

Unless we are impressed with a sense\n of the holiness, power, glory, and majesty of\n God, we cannot use, profitably, any branch of\n prayer. The prayer of confession derives its\n character as well from a view of the glorious\n perfections of the Deity, as from our own vile-\n ness and unworthiness. Even sinless beings,\n in view of the divine glory, prostrate themselves,\n cover their faces, and reiterate, \u201c Holy, holy,\n holy, is the Lord of hosts !\u201d How much more\n should sinful beings abase themselves in the dust\n in the presence of the glorious Jehovah, while\n they confess their sins before him ?

It is distinguished from love\n thus : The object of love is the creature sim-\n ply; the object of mercy is the creature in\n misery. We love our friends simply as they\n are our friends ; but if they fall into misery, love\n works in a way of pity and compassion, and\n love becomes mercy.

Section VI . \u2014 Of exhortation.\n</p>\n<p>\n Exhortation is the act of addressing such\n motives to the sensibilities of a person as may\n excite him to any duty. It differs from suasion,\n in that the latter principally endeavours to con-\n vince the understanding, and the former to\n work on the affections. It is equally the duty\n of the minister and the private member, and is\n suitable for the pulpit or any other place.\n</p>\n<p>\n But it is the Christian duty of exhortation, or\n the duty of all Christians to exhort one another\n that I would here consider.

I use the term education ,\n both for instructing and training up children in\n the way they should go \u2014 not only for setting\n the right path before them, but for causing them\n to walk therein while young.

Children must be brought,\n while young, to repress all angry and revenge-\n ful emotions, and to cultivate good will and\n kindly affections toward one another, and toward\n all people.

We see\n the nature of self-denial : it is the denying, or\n refusing to follow our own will, from a convic-\n tion that the will of God is the only rule of ac-\n tion to us. And we see the reason thereof ; be-\n cause we are creatures ; because \u201c it is he that\n hath made us, and not we ourselves.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:ts:gu:id:ep:re:00:me:rr:convertsguidepre00merr:convertsguidepre00merr_0255/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 190, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 315}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:ts:gu:id:ep:re:00:me:rr:convertsguidepre00merr:convertsguidepre00merr_0255/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 381, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 630}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:ts:gu:id:ep:re:00:me:rr:convertsguidepre00merr:convertsguidepre00merr_0255/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 763, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1261}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:ts:gu:id:ep:re:00:me:rr:convertsguidepre00merr:convertsguidepre00merr_0255/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1527, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2522}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nv:er:ts:gu:id:ep:re:00:me:rr:convertsguidepre00merr:convertsguidepre00merr_0255/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nv/er/ts/gu/id/ep/re/00/me/rr/convertsguidepre00merr/convertsguidepre00merr_0255.jp2", "height": 2522, "width": 1527, "levels": 6, "size": 286401}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"255\">\n<p>\n THE CONVERT\u2019S GUIDE. 251\n</p>\n<p>\n But a farther reason for it arises from the\n condition in which all men are since the fall.\n We are all now \u201c shapen in wickedness, and\n in sin did our mother conceive us.\u201d Our nature\n is now altogether corrupt, in every power and\n faculty.
