Scothowe signifies \u201cthe lot or\n portion on the hill,\u201d and this describes the little Norfolk vil-\n lage which, six or seven hundred years ago, gave its name to the\n family of de Scothowes, who were the lords of the manor there\n and the patrons of the living. ' At the beginning of the seven-\n teenth century we find the name in English records spelt\n Scottowe.* Thomasine Scottow, a widow, arrived in Boston\n soon after the settlement of the town, bringing with her two\n sons, Thomas and Joshua. She joined the First Churchy\n September 21, 1634, and her sons, May 19, 1639. Joshua is\n supposed to have been the younger of the two. He must have\n received a good education in England ; he became a mer-\n chant, and was very soon a man of influence in the town and\n colony. In 1639, he was one of the signers of a paper, strongly\n recommending the First Church to place the new meeting-\n house which it was then proposing to build, upon Governor\n Winthrop\u2019s property on Washington Street, the site chosen\n for the Third Church thirty years later.

According\n to Hutchinson, she had a bad temper, which made her turbu-\n lent and quarrelsome ; this had brought her under church\n censure, and at length rendered her so odious to her neigh-\n bors as to cause some of them to accuse her of witchcraft.\n She was tried and condemned by a jury, but the verdict was\n set aside by the magistrates, and the case came before the\n General Court.

She defended herself to the best of her\n ability, but the popular clamor was more than she could re-\n sist or the court withstand^ ; she was found guilty, and sentence\n of death was pronounced upon her by John Endicott, Gover-\n nor.

They had been opposed to the call\n of the Rev. John Davenport of New Haven, to the pastorate\n made vacant by the death of Mr. Wilson, and they had been\n dissatisfied, still more, with the methods employed to bring\n him to Boston. They determined, therefore, to organize a\n new church, for which, indeed, there was ample room in the\n growing town. They were thwarted in every possible way\n by the majority led by Governor Bellingham, and years passed\n before they were recognized by their brethren from whose\n fellowship they had felt it to be their duty to withdraw. We\n do not propose to go into the history of this old controversy\n on this occasion, further than to illustrate the force of charac-\n ter displayed by the men of the minority. They had to meet\n opposition and to suffer reproach for what they believed to\n be the truth. The question of the baptismal, or half-way\n covenant, lay at the root of the difficulty, but the issue came\n to involve the rights of the individual and the rights of a\n minority in the administration of church affairs. It required\n some courage to be a friend, and much more to be a member,\n of the South Church in those days. Failing, first, to prevent\n the formation and recognition of the church, and then, to\n create a panic among the ministers and churches outside\n Boston, the ultra conservative party carried the quarrel to the\n General Court. Here, a committee on the state of the colony\n was induced to prepare a report, which was adopted, charg-\n ing the South Church and the ministers and churches who\n stood by it, with being the occasion of all the calamities,\n temporal and spiritual, with which Massachusetts was threat-\n ened.

Mr. Gedney said he had known Alden many years,\n and had been at sea with him, and always looked upon him to be an\n honest man ; but now he saw cause to alter his judgment. Alden an-\n swered, he was sorry for that, but he hoped God would clear up his\n innocency, that he would recall that judgment again; and added,\n that he hoped that he should, with Job, maintain his integrity till he\n died. They bid Alden look upon the accusers, which he did, and then\n they fell down.

But the accusers were\n brought to Alden to touch them; and this touch, they said, made\n them well.

And yet, how\n much more have we in common with the New England fathers\n of the seventeenth century, than they had with the men who\n liv^ed at the beginning of the sixteenth. In their circumstan-\n ces and conditions externally, Scottow and Alden, Rawson\n and Oliver, were very different from ourselves ; but not so\n much so, in their inner experiences, and in the springs and\n forces of their spiritual life. Their trials were not just like\n ours ; we have no personal knowledge of Indian massacres\n and witchcraft terrors ; but we have troubles, temptations and\n forebodings of our own, and these are perhaps no less, certainly\n no more, hard to bear than were theirs.
