That many excel\u00ac\n lent books have been written, covering this department of\n literature, we gladly admit, and no doubt they have done good.\n And yet true as this is, the subject has not been exhausted, nor\n overdone.\n</p>\n<p>\n As far as our knowledge goes, there is no book that covers\n the ground that this does.

In like manner there are subjects pertaining to the\n church, the family, life, death and heaven, in reference to\n which we ought to have clear and definite information, so as\n to make the best possible use of the short time allotted to us\n in this world, that, when called to leave it, we may have a\n bright and cheering hope of a blessed immortality.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another peculiar feature of the Book is the very large\n number of its excellent contributors, containing as it does\n articles from the pens of over one hundred active and devoted\n ministers and Christian workers , old and young, a peculiarity\n which cannot fail to give it special interest, in view of the\n variety of topics, views, live thoughts and religious experi-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0014/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 164, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 259}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0014/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 329, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 519}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0014/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 659, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1039}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0014/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1318, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2079}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0014/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2636, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4159}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0014/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0014.jp2", "height": 4159, "width": 2636, "levels": 6, "size": 517987}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"14\">\n<p>\n PREFACE.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4\n</p>\n<p>\n ence which it contains.

The\n reason why it does this, arises most likely from\n the fact that there was no necessity of any\n formal proof as the mind recognizes, and admits\n the existence of God, as the absolute ground\n of all things as soon as he is made known to\n</p>\n<p>\n us, it being one of those self-evident truths,\n</p>\n<p>\n which need only to be stated in order that\n they may be believed.\n</p>\n<p>\n Constituted as we are, it is natural for all men to believe in\n God, who is very nigh each one of us, so that we need not go\n</p>\n<p>\n in search of him, as though he were hard to find. All that is\n</p>\n<p>\n necessary to awaken the idea of God in us is the natural, and\n normal development of our nature. This being done, belief\n in God, becomes as natural and inevitable, as that the plant\n will be evolved from the germ when the proper conditions are\n present. It has therefore beennvell said that u as soon as man\n becomes conscious of himself, as distinct from all other things\n and persons, he at the same time becomes conscious of a\n higher self, a power without which he feels that neither he,\n nor anything else would have any life or reality.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n No man is born an atheist, and if he becomes such it is by\n some artifice or sophistry by which his nature becomes so per\u00ac\n verted, that the light which is in him is so obscured that he is\n incapable of forming a right judgment in the case.

For we are all conscious of the fact that we neither\n exist, nor continue to exist by any power in and of ourselves,\n and that if we were left to ourselves we would instantly cease\n to be. We are also equally certain, that the power by which\n we are, and continue to be, does not lie in matter under any\n of its diversified forms, inasmuch as matter is impersonal, life\u00ac\n less and subject to constant change, and is itself dependent\n upon something else for its existence. How now are we to\n account for our origin, and continued existence from day to\n day? To say as the atheist does, that it is all the result of cer\u00ac\n tain laws that are fixed and, therefore, operate uniformly\n throughout the universe explains nothing, as laws do not origin\u00ac\n ate themselves, and always presuppose a law-giver. .Seeing*\n therefore, that everything in and around us is perishing, and is\n dependent upon something else for its being and continued\n existence, reason would suggest that there is, and must be a\n God such as the Bible reveals, self-existent and eternal, the\n Creator and Preserver of all things.\n</p>\n<p>\n The proofs of the existence of God are so many and varied,\n so strong and irresistible, that it would almost seem as unneces\u00ac\n sary to attempt to demonstrate it, as it would be to prove to a\n son that he had a father.

By the eroding and transporting action of\n the latter, the mineral substances were reduced, conveyed\n from one place to another, and deposited in layers. In these\n deposits we find occasionally a shell, the impression of a fern\n leaf, or the skeleton of an animal, which must once have been\n living beings, and dying, were buried with the earthy material.\n These buried objects tell a wondrous story. They tell us that\n at one time, in the remote past, only the lowest forms of life\n existed: probably only sea weeds and the lowest forms of\n marine life. The oldest stratified rocks are full of shells,\n coral and crinoids, and hence called the Age of Mollusks.\n</p>\n<p>\n After this we have the Age of Fishes. In addition to the\n mollusks and coral of the preceding period, we find a variety\n of vertebrated animals.

There were vast marshes. The air was moist and warm.\n The rich and abundant vegetation existed for a long time, and\n its accumulation, buried for ages, we now dig up as coal, and\n derive from it the heat so necessary for our comfort in winter.\n Thus was the heat of the sunbeam stored up for man\u2019s use in\n after years, when the earth and atmosphere would become\n cooler.\n</p>\n<p>\n After the Age of Plant Life, comes that of Keptiles.

Here the philosopher and peasant\n are both at their wits end. Some suppose that\n the matter out of which the world was made\n existed originally as star dust, or in the form of\n atoms, monads, molecules, & c., without defin\u00ac\n ing what they were. But granting that\n from which the world has\n sprung, they must have been, as all matter is in its simple\n state, lifeless, motionless, powerless, without feeling and con\u00ac\n sciousness. If left to themselves, admitting they had the\n power to move, either of themselves, or by an energy commu\u00ac\n nicated to them, the wonder is how these atoms happened to\n unite and coalesce in the orderly and beneficent way in which\n they have. If there was no intelligent power moving and\n directing them, there is no reason why they might not as\n readily have been formed into destructive engines and creatures\n that would have been so opposed to each other as to be at con\u00ac\n stant war. If chance, or blind force had been the only thing\n at work, the probability is, that every thing produced in this\n way would have been incongruous and out of joint. But look\u00ac\n ing at the world as it is, we see a grand and glorious unity, a\n harmonious whole, where everything has been so arranged\n and f ormed as to make it a fit habitation for man. Whence\n now this order, the life of plants, the instinct of animals, and the\n reason and conscience of man ?

When the Westminister divines met to\n compose their conf ession of Faith, we are told they\n had much difficulty to formulate an answer to the\n question, What is God. After repeated failures, Gilespie, one\n of the commissioners from Scotland, proposed that they should\n seek divine guidance, whereupon he was requested to lead the\n assembly in prayer, which he did in the following language, 0\n God , who art a spirit , infinite, eternal , and unchangeable in\n thy Being , Wisdom , Power , Holiness , Justice , Goodness and\n Truth , which was regarded by the commissioners as a fit\n answer to the question, and was thus formulated.\n</p>\n<p>\n Taking this as an answer to the question. What is God , we\n are struck with its comprehensiveness, including as it does the\n attributes of .spirituality, infinity, eternity, immutability,\n wisdom, power, holiness, justice, goodness and truth. A being\n possessed of such perfections must have all conceivable excel\u00ac\n lence, and be an object worthy of adoration and worship.\n</p>\n<p>\n As thus viewed how different, and how transcendently\n superior is the God of the Bible to the gods of the different\n nations, such as Baal, Moloch, Jupiter, Bachus, Brahma,\n Vishnu, & c. Any one acquainted with heathen mythology\n knows that their gods were material, having the form of men,\n animals, reptiles and inanimate things, thus changing the glory\n of the incorruptible God into images, and that they were\n guilty of the most shocking crimes and barbarities, making it\n impossible for men of intelligence and refinement to worship\n them. It is different, however, with the God whom we adore,\n who is revealed to us as a mercif ul and gracious Being, recon\u00ac\n ciling the world unto himself through Jesus Christ our Lord,\n and, at the same time, comforting and consoling all who put\n their trust in him, with the sympathy and affection of a loving\n Father.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0039/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 258}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0039/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 316, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 517}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0039/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 633, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1035}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0039/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1266, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2070}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0039/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2533, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4140}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0039/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0039.jp2", "height": 4140, "width": 2533, "levels": 6, "size": 513537}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"39\">\n<p>\n THE BEING OF GOD.\n</p>\n<p>\n 27\n</p>\n<p>\n As it is by revelation that we obtain a knowledge of God,\n we must go to the Bible if we would get an answer to the\n question who and what he is.

For man is one , and yet there is\n in him (1) Will, (2) Intellect, and (3) Sensibility.\n In a very deep sense these three are one, and yet\n they are also three, whether you call them powers, or faculties\n or departments. The reason why the Trinity in God is neces\u00ac\n sarily a great mystery, is not because the orthodox doctrine is\n contradictory , or unbiblical , or irrational ; but because God\n stands so high above us, as to his nature, that although we\n may be able to apprehend him, in part at least, yet it is vain\n to assert that we can comprehend or fathom him. On this\n ground it comes to pass that many persons make great mis\u00ac\n takes. They wish to try to comprehend him, as they do\n empirical facts, when manifestly this must in the very nature\n of the case be impossible, in the present stage of man\u2019s devel\u00ac\n opment. \u201cNow we know in part.\u201d It was Carlyle who made\n the cutting remark, \u201cthat Tyndal would not believe in God,\n because he could not put him in a bottle and examine him by\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0046/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0046/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0046/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0046/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0046/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0046/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0046.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 549638}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"46\">\n<p>\n 34\n</p>\n<p>\n THE BEING OF GOD.\n</p>\n<p>\n chemical tests.\u201d Men deny the Scriptural doctrine of the\n Trinity, because it cannot be set forth in terms satisfactory to\n experience.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Scriptural doctrine of the Trinity may be so held and\n set forth to involve Tritheism, i. e. that there are three Gods,\n or three individuals in the God-head. But this is not the\n orthodox doctrine. The theologians of all the ages have done\n their best to avoid this rock; and yet opponents are constantly\n falling into the error that this is the orthodox doctrine. But it\n is not, and never was the doctrine of the Church. Jesus\n was declared to be God, and yet he himself said \u201cI and the\n Father are one.\u201d This involves a unity , and hence the ortho\u00ac\n dox doctrine is, that there is but one God. Still there is a\n distinction between the Father, Son and Holy Ghost, for this\n among other reasons, that all are commanded to be baptized\n in this three-fold name. In order to denote this three-foldness,\n or Trinity, the Church makes use of the convenient term\n \u201cperson;\u201d The early Church f athers used the word \u201c hypos\u00ac\n tasis .\u201d A Latin word had to be selected and persona was\n chosen. But when we say there are three persons , we do not\n use the word person in the common or ordinary sense of the\n word. We use it as a technical word in a technical sense. It\n does not here denote an individual , as though there were\n three individuals in the God-head, for this would involve the\n error of Tritheism. But it denotes that indescribable, and to\n a great extent incomprehensible, three-foldness, that exists in\n the being of the one God. That there is, and must be such a\n three-f oldness in God, is amply proven both from Scripture\n and Philosophy. The doctrine of the Trinity sheds a wonder\u00ac\n ful light on the nature of God , his revelations , and his work\u00ac\n ing in the sphere of nature and of grace. Although the last\n of the doctrines to be fully revealed, in God\u2019s dispensation of\n revelation, it stands as a beacon of light to give us a glimpse\n of the nature of the Eternal God. He who has not yet come\n to see this is rather to be pitied, than to be blamed.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0047/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 258}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0047/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 316, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 517}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0047/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 633, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1035}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0047/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1266, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2070}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0047/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2533, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4140}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0047/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0047.jp2", "height": 4140, "width": 2533, "levels": 6, "size": 501530}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"47\">\n<p>\n THE RELATION OF GOD TO THE WORLD.\n</p>\n<p>\n \\ -\n</p>\n<p>\n PROF.

According to the revealed word, the coming\n and going of the seasons, the motion of the heavenly bodies,\n and the various productions of the earth are due to the prov\u00ac\n idential agency of God. Paul says that God even while suf\u00ac\n fering the nations \u201cto walk in their own ways,\u201d \u201cleft not\n himself without witness, in that he did good, and gave us rain\n from heaven, and fruitful seasons, filling our hearts with food\n and gladness.\u201d These things come not by chance, but by his\n gracious and omnipresent agency.

It is a neces\u00ac\n sary idea in the mind of every one who wishes to\n read Scripture intelligently, and desires to be edi\u00ac\n fied thereby, to admit that God is not only present\n in its history, but also in its present influence.\n</p>\n<p>\n After the accounts we have of the creation of all things in\n the first chapter of Genesis, we have not the least intimation\n that God withdrew from his relations with man, ceasing to be\n his preserver and guide. He was not only the architect, but the\n Father likewise, and continued to communicate with Noah >\n and Abraham, and Moses, as he had done with Adam.\n</p>\n<p>\n AVithout such a special interest in mankind we could have\n had neither prophecy, nor miracle, nor the divine law. But\n these the race has received, showing not only God\u2019s imma\u00ac\n nence, but his goodness, in providing for the necessity of his\n people. The destinies of all individuals as well as of all nations\n are under his control, and man is prosperous or adverse, by\n his permission and will. \u201c By me kings reign and princes\n decree justice.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n God being the great First Cause, all secondary causes are\n dependent upon him, and all effects are either by his will, or\n permission. He has not merely enacted natural laws, but\n continually directs and controls them. He has not made a\n vessel and put it under the care of another pilot, but he rides\n upon the wings of the wind, and guides it in the storm..\n When it is his will, he transcends natural laws, as in the case\n of miracles. Conscience accepts a Providence, and admits\n that \u201c in him, we live, and move, and have our being.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The fact of the existence of Providence will be more evi\u00ac\n dent when we consider its manifestations .

In the form of a Sermon , where the minister exerts\n himself, so to proclaim the \u201cWord of God\u201d in varied and\n instructive ways, from all points of view, as to make it effec\u00ac\n tive in the hearts and minds of the hearers.

When a choir sings an\n anthem, or an opening or closing piece, it takes the attitude of\n preaching the Word to the worshipers. Here the worship\n consists in a reverent listening to the same, not to the music\n alone, but to its words (or contents). This is just as much a\n duty as it is to listen to the sermon or the lesson. What a\n glorious sermon it is, when, on Easter morning, the choir pro\u00ac\n claims, in musical form, \u201cThe Lord is risen indeed!\u201d As a\n rule, therefore, choirs should be composed of devout and\n serious persons; and they should be trained to consider them\u00ac\n selves, not mere singers, giving a sort of concert, but as earnest\n persons, who \u201c proclaim the Word \u201d to the worshiping assem\u00ac\n bly, in order to inculcate truth, to heighten Christian emotions,\n and to spur up to a Christian life of duty.\n</p>\n<p>\n These three forms include all that there is, or ought to be,\n of preaching , in the ordinary services. But these should make\n up only about one-half of the worship of the occasion. The\n other half of the services are equally important , and are of a\n very different character. We designate them collectively as\n Prayer.\n</p>\n<p>\n II. But these exercises of Prayer are of different forms.\n</p>\n<p>\n (a.) There are usually two prayers , under the leadership\n of the minister. These include Adoration to God, Confession\n of Sin, Thanksgiving and Intercession. It is important to\n remember here that the minister does not pray instead of the\n worshipers, nor does he, as a Mediator, pray for them, or in\n behalf of them : but he prays simply as the leader of the\n people, voicing the thoughts of their hearts. The congregation\n must pray: every man, woman and child must pray, if there\n is to be a worship \u201cin spirit and in truth.\u201d This recpiires\n attention, a mental and spiritual following of the petitions of\n the leader. A double error is here very liable to arise, (1) the\n minister turns the prayer into a sermon, and in it preaches to,\n or at, the hearers; (2) the people listen to the ' prayer as to a\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0060/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0060/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0060/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0060/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0060/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0060/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0060.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 579520}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"60\">\n<p>\n 48\n</p>\n<p>\n THE BEING OF GOD.\n</p>\n<p>\n sermon, admire it, criticise it; but do not unite in it.

A Christian land can learn from a\n heathen people. Under the control of a national law of con\u00ac\n science the pagan idolater worships his gods of wood and\n stone, and uses every power known to him, in his ignorance of\n the truth, to remove his sense of guilt. Nor does he forget\n his former state of unrest, when converted to Christ.

Our relation\n to the divine government is the same. No one ever yet has\n obeyed the divine law and been disappointed or deceived. It\n has always been the case that such have been blessed and\n prospered beyond all expectation. The Scriptures are full of\n examples that show us how God prospered those who obeyed\n his word. No one ever mistakes when he obeys God. The\n law of God is so perfect that man cannot help but be blessed\n in obeying it. There is not a command in his book but that is\n intended for the good of man. If this be true, that God desires\n the welfare of man, and that he has given his word that he\n may be guided thereby, is it not the basest ingratitude, and\n does it not show the most depraved nature when men say,\n \u2018\u2018We will not obey God.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This obedience must be a willing obedience*. If it is forced,\n it is not what God desires. The slave may be compelled to obey\n the commands of his master, but that is not obedience. It must\n be free, the heart must be with it. It will not do to say, \u201cI\n obey, because thou art Lord,\u201d but, \u201c I obey willingly, because\n I love thee, because I delight in thy law, and because thou\n hast been so infinitely kind to me.\u201d God delights in such obe\u00ac\n dience. We know what a pleasure kindles in the heart of an\n earthly parent when a child freely obeys the parental\n authority. It is the same with God. His heart glows with\n pleasure as he sees his children amid the fierce heat of earth\u2019s\n trials endeavoring to do his will. We must not believe either\n that the obedience God delights in is such as is given in expec\u00ac\n tation of a reward. That is an obedience merely of the flesh,\n and not of the heart. What God wants is the obedience of a\n son, not of a hireling. You engage a man to labor for you, he\n performs the labor faithfully, but he does it not because he\n loves you, but because he expects a remuneration. You ask\n your son to perform the same labor, he obeys you not because\n he expects to be paid for it, but because he loves you.

Even the wicked who do not\n like to retain God in their thought, pray to him in times of\n danger and peril. The reason why all men pray to God is\n because they are all conscious of their need and dependence\n upon him for the supply of their wants.\n</p>\n<p>\n Prayer may be said to include confession, petition, suppli\u00ac\n cation and thanksgiving. The first includes the acknowledg\u00ac\n ment of sin both original and actual, with an earnest desire\n for its forgiveness; the second, the asking of God for such\n things as are necessary for soul and body; the third, entreaty\n that all evil may be averted from us. and all needful good\n bestowed upon others; while in thanksgiving there is an ex\u00ac\n pression of gratitude for the varied blessings and mercies of\n life.\n</p>\n<p>\n The conditions of acceptable prayer may be said to embrace\n the following specification: That it must be addressed to the\n one true God, and not an imaginary Deity; that it be the sin\u00ac\n cere expression of the heart, and not a mere lip service; that\n it be offered in the name of Christ, and not in dependence\n upon our own personal goodness; that the soul be filled with\n a sense of its own unworthiness and sinfulness; and that it be\n offered in the confident belief that God will, for the sake of\n Christ, grant all we need, and that will be for our good accord\u00ac\n ing to his own gracious promise.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nothing can be more natural and rational than that we\n should pray to God. If a child wants anything it goes directly\n to the parent and asks for it, and never feels humiliated by\n so doing. All parents, also, love to have their children come\n to them and ask for such things as they need, and often chide\n them when they do not do it. Why then should we regard it\n wrong to go to God, for such things as we need, when we\n know that he is more willing to hear our prayers, and ready\n to grant our desires than any. earthly parent is to do good to\n his children.\n</p>\n<p>\n In praying to God for such things as we need, we do not ask\n him to change his purposes and plans for our sake, but only\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0074/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0074/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0074/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0074/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0074/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0074/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0074.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 536601}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"74\">\n<p>\n THE BEING OF GOD.\n</p>\n<p>\n 62\n</p>\n<p>\n place ourselves in such a condition, by an acknowledgement of\n our dependence upon him, that he may in consistency with\n himself grant unto us the desires of our heart.

And a very\n important means of grace it is along with the\n sacraments, Sabbath, providence and word of\n God, whether read or preached. Neither men or\n devils can close its gates. AYhen every other\n avenue to God is closed, when bitter persecutions drive us from\n the house of God, when the voice of the preacher is silenced,\n when the church closes her doors upon us, or debars us from\n the privilege of communion, when the Bible is taken from us,\n as was done under Papal rule, we may still have access to God\n in prayer.\n</p>\n<p>\n Simple and explicit as the language of the Bible is upon this\n subject, we are often led to doubt the truth of its teaching,\n when it assures us that whatsoever we ask in the name of\n Christ shall be given us. If there is any error in the hearts of\n the people to-day, it is not that they have too much confidence\n in the efficacy of prayer, but rather that there is too little faith\n in the promise of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n When a week of prayer is appointed, or the church is pray\u00ac\n ing for a special manifestation of divine grace, how often do\n we hear expressions of doubt, rather than the assurances of\n the divine presence. It is to be feared the lips too often utter\n the language, while the heart forgets the injunction, \u201cask in\n faith, believing.\u201d How few go to the place of prayer as did\n the little girl, on a cloudless day, with cloak and umbrella, and\n when asked why she did this, replied, \u201cWe are going to pray\n for rain, and I will need it on my way home.\u201d Certain it is,\n that if we expected more, we would not only ask for, but get\n more.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is not for us to ask what prayer will do, but rather what\n has it not done.

GEO. W. WILLIARD, D. D., TIFFIN, 0.\n</p>\n<p>\n says,\n</p>\n<p>\n N ORDER that prayer may be heard and answered\n of God it must be offered in faith. This is one of\n the essential conditions of effectual prayer, as may\n be inferred from the emphatic language of Christ,\n who said to the disciples, \u201cAll things whatsoever\n ye shall ask in prayer believing ye shall receive,\u201d\n which is reaffirmed by the apostle James when he\n If any of you lack wisdom let him ask of God who\n</p>\n<p>\n giveth to all men liberally and upbraideth not; and it shall be\n given him. But let him ask in faith nothing wavering; for\n he that wavereth is like a wave of the sea, driven with the\n wind and tossed. For let not that man think that he shall re\u00ac\n ceive anything of the Lord. A doubleminded man is unstable\n in all his ways.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n With such clear and explicit instruction upon the subject it\n is strange that there should be any misunderstanding or error\n respecting it. And yet there can be no doubt that many\n prayers are not heard for the reason that those who offer them\n have no faith, and would, perhaps, in some instances, be sur\u00ac\n prised if they were to receive the things they ask of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n A prayer that is offered without faith, or the belief that it\n will be answered of God must, in the nature of the case, be\n heartless, and destitute of all earnestness and desire of receiv\u00ac\n ing what is prayed for. We need not wonder that such\n prayers are never heard. Great stress should, therefore, be\n put upon the importance of faith in prayer, or to put it in the\n language of the Savior believing that we shall receive what we\n ask of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n Whatever doubts may be entertained upon other points\n there should be none as to the willingness of God, our\n heavenly Father, to hear and answer prayer when we ask for\n such things as are in accordance with his will.

Surely, in spite of the alleged\n fixity of nature\u2019s laws, the mother can hear the cry of her\n babe, and supply in need and protect in danger, how much\n more must the great God over all be free to hear and bless the\n children of his love, the adopted heirs of the purchased inher\u00ac\n itance.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n And if it should ever so happen, that the Christian would\n be at a loss to answer satisfactorily all the objections raised\n against prayer, he may reply, as the unlearned peasant did to a\n sceptic under similar circumstances, u You may puzzle me\n with your reasonings, but I can baffle you with my facts\u201d\n knowing as he does that God has in numberless instances\n answered the prayers of his people.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0080/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0080/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0080/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0080/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0080/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0080/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0080.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 548171}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"80\">\n<p>\n *68 THE BEING OF GOD.\n</p>\n<p>\n And although.

Pure science cannot afford to shut\n its eyes even long enough to pray. * * * The universe is\n</p>\n<p>\n all there is.

How\n strange, therefore, to hear men, who would be regarded as\n oracles, say in the face of the current belief of all times, that\n God is the enemy of mankind, that religion is based on false\u00ac\n hood, that it is like noxious weeds, poisoning the atmosphere, we\n breathe, that the God* of the Bible must be banished from the\n world, and driven back into the darkness of barbarism so that\n atheism may have full sway and usher in the millenium of\n the world! In reading such strange statements, we are\n reminded of the juryman who regarded his eleven associates\n as imbeciles, because they decided differently from what he\n did.

In these days of\n enlightenment and wide-spread literature, it would\n be supposed that an institution like the churcli\n would be thoroughly understood, as in every city\n and town, in the civilized world, and even in\n heathen lands, is heard the sound of \u201c the church\n going bell.\u201d How familiar\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Her solemn vows,\n</p>\n<p>\n Her hymns of love and praise,\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n are to all from early childhood to old age. Not\n only is it a matter of memory, but a fact, that the church, with\n its great head, forms the centre around which all history\n revolves. It is the light of all civilized worlds, without which\n all civilization and culture would sink into the darkness of bar\u00ac\n barism and superstition. No student of history will deny the\n truth of this assertion.\n</p>\n<p>\n This being the case, there must be a power in the church\n that attaches to no other institution. The state is subordinate\n to it, for the state could not exist without the church, as it is\n the source of all true government, and is above all kingdoms,\n powers, and principalities.\n</p>\n<p>\n The day of Pentecost was the day of small things, humanly\n considered, whilst that age was the age of great things, as the\n world estimates greatness. The church was a babe, in swad-\n ling clothes, amidst a host of full-grown giants, each one\n determined to crush it out of existence. The courts and coun\u00ac\n cils of kings arrayed themselves against it. The whole world\n determined to destroy it. But see the result.

Worldly influence, and well disciplined\n armies were not the source of its power and triumphs, but\n were marshaled against it.

Its characteristics are not human\u2014directly the reverse.\n It condemns what the world applauds, denies what the world\n believes, ignores as a vanity that which men esteem of the high\u00ac\n est value, and warns against the danger of trusting in the things\n which promise the greatest strength. These things naturally\n antagonize the world and excite its contempt and foster its\n hatred.

Paul, in\n his epistle to the Collossians, says, \u201c He is the head and body\n of the church,\u201d and to the Ephesians he says, \u201c And hath put\n all things under his feet and gave him to be the head over all\n things, to the church which is his body, the fullness of him\n that filleth all in all.\u201d This is strong language, and means just\n what it says. \u201c Head over all things.\u201d How very significant!\n \u201c Hath put all things under his feet.\u201d How positive God is in\n asserting the supremacy of Christ and his church! It is also\n emphatically declared that we can be saved only through\n Jesus Christ, \u201cHe is the way, the truth and the life,\u201d and\n that there is no salvation save through the atonement made by\n him. Christ being the head of the church, and all power\n given to him, it must follow that all who would inherit the\n life of Christ, and obtain grace to overcome the sins of the\n world, must find it in his mystical body, the church.\n</p>\n<p>\n Is not this reasonable from the oft repeated declaration of\n God\u2019s word? The title page of the church\u2019s history has writ\u00ac\n ten upon it this significant declaration, \u201c And the Lord added\n to the church daily such as should be saved.\u201d Men do not\n unite themselves by their own will or power, but are drawn by\n the Father. Saul did not of himself apprehend Christ, but\n was apprehended. In all ages has the church gone forth\n apprehending and subduing the unregenerate heart, and is\n placed in the world for the redemption of the race. Hence it\n is fitly said \u201c That out of the whole human race, from the\n beginning to the end of the world, the Son of God, by his Spirit\n and word, gathers, defends and preserves for himself unto\n everlasting life, a chosen communion in the unity.of the true\n faith; and that I am now and forever shall remain, a living\n member of the same,\u201d which accords f ully with the significa\u00ac\n tion of the word church, which means, in the original, to call\n forth, to call together for a specific purpose, which is to serve\n God, and him alone and entirely. Every system of theology\n that is in accord with the word of God accepts the definition,\n as given above, as true.

To found\n such a kingdom, two things had first to be accomplished: The\n penalty of sin had to be paid, and human nature delivered\n from the power of sin. By his active and passive obedience,;\n Christ achieved these two prerequisites. By his sufferings he\n atoned for the sins of mankind, and by his sinless life deliv\u00ac\n ered us from the power of sin and Satan. This was, indeed, a\n work of marvelous greatness. It is the sure foundation of the\n church. It is the only hope for a sin-cursed world.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was the union of divinity and humanity in Christ that\n enabled him to lay such a sure foundation. As a mere man he\n could not have performed such a work. The adaptation of\n Christianity to meet all the needs and wants of man must be\n ascribed to its perfect Founder.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is another feature peculiar to Christianity which must\n be traced to the same source, that is its permanence. The\n declaration of Christ \u201c that the gates of hell should not prevail\n against the church,\u201d has been most clearly demonstrated in the\n history of Christianity. Organizations, inventions, social\n reforms, as well as all the orders of life, partake largely of the\n character of the source from which they spring. In all these\n the relation of cause and effect is clearly visible. The nature\n of the cause universally determines the character of the effect.\n The church is perfect because its founder was perfect. It is\n ultimate, or permanent in character, because its founder was\n possessed of infinite wisdom and power. A work performed by\n one possessed of such power and wisdom, must of necessity be\n characterized by the highest degree of excellence. The skill\n and the genius of the workman, as a rule, determine the pro\u00ac\n duct of the labor. He imparts to all his work that which is\n peculiar to his personal agency. The life and character of the\n child are largely determined by the parents; the culture and\n training of the pupil are mostly fixed by the teacher. The\n stream will rise to the same height as the fountain that feeds\n it, and the tree will grow according to the germ from which it\n springs.

Had he been less human, or had he been merely\n a Jew, Greek or Roman, he might have founded a system of\n philosophy like Plato, an empire like Alexander, and a relig\u00ac\n ion like Zoroaster; he might even have surpassed and gone\n beyond all who had preceeded him; but could not in the\n nature of the case have been the Redemer of the world, as he\n would not have been in real sympathy with humanity as a\n whole, which is the chief reason why all the schemes of\n humanitarianism, that have been devised have so signally\n failed, and lost their hold upon the world.

GEO W. WILLIARD, D. D., TIFFIN, 0.\n</p>\n<p>\n IIE CHARACTER of Jesus of Nazareth stands\n out, in every aspect in which we may look upon\n it, in striking contrast with all others. There is no\n one of all the sons of men like unto him. The\n most we can expect of men, fallen and imperfect\n as they are, is that they may excel in some one\n particular. Many never gain any distinction at all\n in moral excellence, being overcome by the temp\u00ac\n tations around them to vice and profligacy. Hence those who\n are fortunate enough to excel their fellow-men in wisdom,\n meekness, patience, patriotism or philanthropy, are ordinarily\n spoken of as paragons of excellence. Who has not heard of\n the meekness of Moses, the patience of Job, the wisdom of\n Solomon, the justice of Aristides, the zeal and energy of Paul,\n the boldness and intrepidity of Luther, the mildness of\n Melancthon, the philanthropy of Howard, and the patriotism\n of Washington. And yet distinguished as they were in the\n virtues referred to, they were still far from being perfect in\n them, whilst their characters in other aspects were very defi\u00ac\n cient and defective. It is, indeed, a sad but true confession,\n that of all the millions that have lived, the characters of the\n very best have been so blurred and defaced by sin, as to cause\n us to turn away from the sight with sorrow and regret. There\n is not one that has been perfect, for all have sinned and done\n evil in the sight of God. It is different, however, with Jesus\n of Nazareth, who exhibits a character not only free from every\n blemish and imperfection, but which also blends and unites in\n the most exact and beautiful proportions, like the colors of\n the rainbow, every possible perfection and excellence. For,\n according to the testimony of those who knew him best, he\n had no sin, neither was guile ever found in his mouth. And\n although his enemies have, for eighteen centuries, been putting\n every thing he said and did to the severest test of criticism,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0104/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0104/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0104/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0104/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0104/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0104/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0104.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 557041}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"104\">\n<p>\n 92\n</p>\n<p>\n THE CHURCH.\n</p>\n<p>\n and have twisted and tortured his words and actions in every\n conceivable way, there is not one of them that has even dared\n to charge him with folly, or been able to fasten the slightest\n blemish upon his snow-white character.

The facts in the case were just the\n opposite. For who of all the sons of men was tempted and\n tried as Jesus, during the whole of his public ministry.

He is born of a sinful race,\n and is \u201cmade sin for us, and yet he knows no sin.\u201d He is\n rejected, despised and hated; betrayed and murdered, but not\n an evil thought or deed is discernible, and only love and\n mercy are brought to view.

GEO. W. WILLIARD, D. D., TIFFIN, 0.\n</p>\n<p>\n w\n</p>\n<p>\n ^ OLY BAPTISM and the Lord\u2019s Supper are the two\n sacraments in the Christian Church, instituted by\n Christ, the head of the church; the latter just\n 8| before his death, and the former before his ascension\n into heaven. These ordinances stand closely related\n to each other, and subserve important ends in the\n church as means of grace. Baptism, being the rite\n t of initiation into the church, comes first in the\n order of time, so that no one unbaptised should be admitted\n to the holy communion. It is to be administered only once,\n as it is the sign of our reception into the favor and covenant\n of God, which remains valid and in force during the whole\n life, and needs not to be repeated as in the case of the Lord\u2019s\n Supper, in which there is a remembrance of the sufferings and\n death of Christ, together with a participation in the benefits\n thereof, and is, therefore, to be observed whenever the occa\u00ac\n sion presents itself. And if it should occur, as is lamentably\n too often the case, that one who has been baptized falls from\n the favor of God, and loses his standing in the church, sad as\n it is, he does not need a new baptism to secure his restoration,\n but a sincere and hearty repentance of sin. As a man is and\n only can be born once in the spiritual as in the natural world,\n the sign of his ingrafting into Christ is fully signified and set\n forth in the one single act of his baptism.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are two things to be considered in all sacraments\u2014the\n outward and inward\u2014the visible and invisible\u2014the earthly\n and spiritual\u2014the sign and the thing signified, which accords\n with the definition ordinarily given of a sacrament, which is\n the outward sign of an invisible grace. In baptism the out\u00ac\n ward and visible sign is water.; the invisible, the spiritual and\n heavenly, the promise of grace and eternal life through Jesus\n Christ. These ordinarily go together in the lawful use of bap-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0116/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0116/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0116/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0116/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0116/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0116/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0116.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 598062}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"116\">\n<p>\n THE CHURCH.\n</p>\n<p>\n 104\n</p>\n<p>\n tism, so that those who observe it according to the command\n of Christ, are made the recipients of the blessings signified\n and sealed thereby.\n</p>\n<p>\n As thus viewed baptism is a washing with water in the name\n of the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, and signifies that we are\n all by nature sinful and unholy, and need to be cleansed and\n purified by the blood and Spirit of Christ, before we can be\n admitted into the favor and fellowship of God, and become\n members of the household of faith, according to what we are\n taught in the gospel where it is said, \u201cExcept a man be born of\n water and of the spirit he cannot enter into the Kingdom of\n God.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The true meaning and signification of baptism is, therefore^\n a declaration and promise on the part of God that he will be\n merciful and gracious to all who repent and believe on his\n Son Jesus Christ, whilst those who accept the proffered grace,,\n make an open confession of his name and religion, and bind\n themselves to a life of holy obedience to all his commands.\n To make more of baptism than a means of grace through which\n God gives the comforting assurance to those who are in covenant\n with him, that they are pardoned and cleansed by the blood\n of Christ from the filth and pollution of sin, as the body is\n externally washed with water, ft has well been said, \u201cis to go\n beyond and therefore against the gospel.

This will become plainer from two considerations:\n First, the Eunuch was reading the prophecy concerning the\n suffering Savior, which begins with Isa. lii. 13, and where the\n cleansing power of those sufferings for the removal of sin is\n expressed under the form of sprinkling\u2014\u201c So shall he sprinkle\n many nations.\u201d In the face of this text Philip would not ad\u00ac\n minister baptism\u2014a sign of that same cleansing\u2014otherwise\n than by sprinkling. Secondly, we do not read that John or\n the apostles ever went to the water to baptize. John was at\n the Jordan and there baptized. Cornelius was evidently bap\u00ac\n tized in his own house; the jailer of Philippi, in prison, and\n Saul, in the house of Ananias. We should find some intima\u00ac\n tion of going to the water, if such had been their mode.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let us now consider Rom. vi. 3, \u201c Know ye not that so many\n of us as were baptized into Christ were baptized into his\n death? Therefore we are buried with him by baptism into\n death, that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the\n glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness\n of life,\u201d (Comp. Col. ii. 12).\n</p>\n<p>\n This goes beyond mode, and gives the very substance of\n baptism. We are baptized \u201cinto Christ,\u201d \u201cinto his death,\u201d by\n baptism buried with him into death. Our Savior\u2019s baptism\n was a consecration to that life of suffering and death for us,\n leading through the grave to a glorified life beyond. So our\n baptism is a consecration. We are to renounce sin, crucify\n the flesh, and die unto the world; but as Christ was raised by\n the glory of the Father, so we are to walk in newness of life.\n Whatever the mode be, baptism has this meaning. This being\n the case, these passages are not in conflict with our mode,\n much less do they establish immersion.\n</p>\n<p>\n III.

In this reply of\n the apostle we have the question answered, both as to the\n design and subjects of baptism. It includes adults and\n children.\n</p>\n<p>\n So far as adults are concerned, the reception of baptism\n must be an intelligent, voluntary act, in which there is a sin\u00ac\n cere repentance of sin, a profession of faith in our Lord Jesus\n Christ, and a solemn covenant in which the individual promis\u00ac\n es full and complete allegiance to Christ as Lord and King.\n Upon this there is little difference of opinion.

The most common objection is: \u201cInfants cannot exercise\n faith, therefore they ought not to be baptized.\u201d The burden of\n proof lies with the objector to show that they cannot exercise\n faith.

What good\n does this sprinkling of babies do? No objection seems more\n simple than this. It is made by those who are ignorant of the\n meaning and design of a sacrament, (which is not man\u2019s act\n toward God, but God\u2019s act towards man,) and who know not\n the power and grace of God. Can not God in his infinite\n goodness sign and seal to infants their adoption without their\n conscious knowledge?

Infants in the old economy were\n received into covenant with God, and most assuredly that\n blessing has not been lost to them in the new and better econ\u00ac\n omy of grace. Here are a few passages of Scripture to prove\n it: \u201cI will establish my covenant between me and thee and\n thy seed after thee, in their generations, for an everlasting\n covenant: to be a God unto thee and thy seed after thee.\u201d\n (Gen. xvii:7.) \u201cYou stand this day, all of you. before the\n Lord your God, * * * * ' and your little ones *\n</p>\n<p>\n * * that thou slialt enter into covenant with the\n</p>\n<p>\n Lord thy God,\u201d & c. (Deut. xxix:10, 11.)

By nature children are in a sinful condition, and are\n under condemnation with the whole human race. \u201cThat\n which is born of flesh is flesh.\u201d They can only be delivered\n from this condition through the precious influences of the\n blood of Jesus Christ and the Holy Ghost\u2014through regener\u00ac\n ation\u2014without which none can enter heaven. Salvation has\n been graciously provided for infants as well as adults through\n the atonement and sacrifice of Christ. They should receive\n the appointed sign and seal of their redemption. They are\n to be baptized because Jesus has saved them. No right\n thinking person will, for a moment, call into question the\n salvation of infants. Why then should they not receive the\n sign and seal of that salvation given in baptism ? That adults\n may be fit to enter the kingdom of God, they must become\n like little children.

Children of believing parents are entitled to church\n membership, and also to the sign and seal, or ordinance, by\n which they are distinguished from the children of infidels, as\n was the case in the Jewish Church. The conditions of enter\u00ac\n ing into the Old and New Testament dispensations was the\n same. The one was by faith, so also the other.

The idea of the family is lost sight of by those who\n deny infants the right of baptism. This idea was obtained in\n the Jewish church and was one of its glories\u2014the family as\n entering into covenant with God. It is, and ought be held,\n the great glory of the Christian Church. The family is a\n divine institution, as it was the first church including parents\n and children. If this initiatory rite to church membership is\n denied to children then they are excluded also from the\n church. Can that be called a church that receives the par\u00ac\n ents and excludes the children ? That children are members\n of the church triumphant we all believe\u2014then truly are they\n fit for the church militant. Let us not forget the mercy and\n condescension of God to the entire human family.

Job says, \u201cMy days are\n swifter than a weaver\u2019s shuttle.\u201d \u201cMy days are\n swifter than a post, they flee away. They are pass\u00ac\n ed away as the swift ships, as the eagle that hast-\n eth to the prey.\u201d The experience of this servant of\n God is the experience of each of us. The days go\n circling over our heads as swiftly as the birds of passage. A\n year is a very short season. Only a pulse-beat of the count\u00ac\n less thousands that have passed away, and yet it is no small\n part of the time allotted us on earth. We measure our exist\u00ac\n ence by years, and God knows we have not so many more\n to live.\n</p>\n<p>\n When w r e stand at the beginning of the year and look for\u00ac\n ward, how long it seems. There is the dreary winter before\n us, we can scarcely wait for the sunshine of spring, then\n comes the summer, the harvest, then the autumn w T ith its\n gorgeous colors. The number of the days and hours seem to\n have no end. The joys we see before us, they too, seem to\n have no end. We cannot count the castles we have built.\n But w T hen w r e stand at the end of the year and look back, how\n short it seems. We shut our eyes as we see the ruins of our\n best laid plans, and how sad we feel as we look upon the\n graves of our friends, and find what seemed to us a pleasant\n dream turned into real sorrow. Some poet has expressed this\n very beautifully.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe year\n</p>\n<p>\n Has gone, and with it many a glorious throng\n Of happy dreams. Its mark is on each brow,\n</p>\n<p>\n Its shadow in each heart.

The whole burden of prophecy\n in the dim ages that preceded his advent, gave\n special prominence to this feature in his life, rep\u00ac\n resenting him as \u201ca man of sorrow and acquainted\n with grief.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 The entire life of the Savior upon earth was one\n</p>\n<p>\n of suffering.

So that although he himself was free\n from sin, he was subject to the demands of the law and was\n treated as a sinner. No Jew who violated the law or defiled\n himself by touching any unclean thing, could come into the\n Divine presence without purification. As no one had thus\n obeyed the law the whole nation is represented by the prophet\n Haggai as being unclean before God.

And, as with the Jews, the interval between the\n Passover and Pentecost was holy time, so also with the primi\u00ac\n tive Christians the seven weeks between Easter and Whitsun\u00ac\n day were religiously observed. During this time those who\n had been baptized at Easter appeared at church in ivhite gar\u00ac\n ments, in ' token of the purity of life to which they became\n consecrated by their baptismal vows.

It was in the nature of a continuous\n Sunday, tending to spirituality, devotion and thanksgiving.\n Of the whole pentecostal period, the fortieth and fiftieth days\n were significantly prominent. The fortieth day after Easter,\n subsequent to the fourth century, was consecrated to the exal\u00ac\n tation of Christ at the right hand of God, and hence named\n Ascension Day. The fiftieth day, being the culminating point\n of this festival season, was specially the feast of the Holy\n Spirit, who on this day was poured out upon the disciples as\n they were assembled together, and was the real birthday of\n the Christian Church. As such, Whitsunday is of special sig\u00ac\n nificance and interest to Christians, who should observe it, not\n in any carnal or secular way, but sincerely and devoutly, and\n with the view of higher attainments in knowledge and spiritu\u00ac\n ality, influenced and directed by the Holy Spirit.\n</p>\n<p>\n And what is the Holy Spirit as to nature, office and power?\n He is not a mere influence or power, but a real person, who\n lives, loves, wills and acts.

Indeed all that is pure and lovely proceeds from\n the Holy Spirit as its author and source.\n</p>\n<p>\n The offices of the Holy Spirit are not so fully revealed, nor\n so well understood, as those pertaining to Christ the Messiah\n and Savior; yet they are of equal authority, importance and\n necessity in the economy of grace and salvation. This is\n implied in the parting words of Christ to his disciples. It was\n therefore \u201cexpedient\u201d for Christ to depart from the earth, as\n the mission and work of the spirit became possible only by his\n departure. The gift of the spirit, as an abiding power, was\n regarded better for the church than the continued personal\n presence of Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n I. The Holy Spirit is the immediate source of all life\u2014\n natural, intellectual and spiritual. He is the executive of the\n Godhead, and whatever God does in the sphere of grace and\n the government of the world, he accomplishes by the spirit,\n who is not only the fountain of all special and extraordinary\n gifts, but also the revealer of all divine truth and the unerring\n guide of its utterance. The prophets and Old Testament\n writers spake and wrote as they were moved by the spirit.\n The apostles and New Testament writers were also the organs\n of the spirit, who directed them in their teachings and work.\n The doctrines which Paul preached he did not receive from\n men, but God revealed them to him by the spirit. The whole\n Bible, as to its truths, promises and blessings, as w r ell as the\n triumph of Christianity and the success of the church, may\n therefore be referred to the spirit as their author. He every\u00ac\n where attends the use of the means of grace by his power, and\n enforces the truth wherever known on , the heart and con\u00ac\n science of men. To the all-pervading influence of the spirit\n we are indebted for all true enlightenment, religion, morality\n and order in the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n II.

Hence it is said, \u201cHe shall teach you all things,\u201d\n and \u201cguide you into all truth.\u201d This is essential because of\n the spiritual ignorance of men, and their aversion to the\n gospel. \u201cThe natural man receiveth not the things of the\n Spirit of God; for they are foolishness unto him.\u201d He does\n not rightly apprehend nor appreciate them.

According to this doctrine the unbeliever or hypocrite\n receives in the Lord\u2019s supper nothing but the symbols, while\n the believer truly receives and enjoys the glorified body of\n Christ, who in this manner condescends to unite himself with\n his own poor and needy followers, and imparts to them a\n necessary measure of his spiritual life. This is also the doc\u00ac\n trine of the Reformed Church, as we find it in plain and forc\u00ac\n ible, but also cautious language stated in the Heidelberg Cat\u00ac\n echism. In his explanations of the sacrament Calvin, with\n many of his contemporaries, made this mistake, that he did\n not observe the marked distinction between the soma or body\n and the sarx or flesh of the Lord, and that consequently he\n applied the eating of the Lord\u2019s flesh and the drinking of his\n blood directly to the Lord\u2019s supper. It is true, indeed, that\n both these statements have reference to Christ\u2019s atoning sacri\u00ac\n fice upon the cross, yet with the \u201cbody and blood\u201d in the in\u00ac\n stitution of the sacrament he certainly points to his death as\n the satisfaction for sin, and as the ground of pardon and the\n source of the sinner\u2019s justification, while by the expression\n u flesh and blood \u201d he refers more especially to his self-sacri\u00ac\n fice as the ever-flowing fountain of the new spiritual life in\n the world, as the cause of all true sanctification. It is for this\n reason that he calls himself repeatedly \u201c the bread of life,\u201d\n and makes the eating thereof the indispensible condition of\n all true life in the world. As by bodily eating and drinking\n we unite to ourselves the substances that sustain our natural\n life, so also must we by spiritual eating and drinking appro\u00ac\n priate to our souls \u201cthe bread of life,\u201d the crucified but also\n glorified Savior, for the support of our spiritual life.

D., TIFFIN, 0.\n</p>\n<p>\n HE ANNUAL festivals, which are now so gener\u00ac\n ally observed by the Christian Church, are not of\n Divine appointment as were those which formed\n so important a part in the Jewish ritualistic\n service. The tendency with the Christians of the\n Apostolic age, in their worship, was to strip it of\n its forms, and make it as purely spiritual as possible. They\n laid great stress on the words of the Savior, with reference to\n the manner of worshiping God, in his conversation with the\n woman at the well of Sychar, where he says, \u201cThe hour\n cometh, and now is, when the true worshipers shall worship\n the Father in spirit and truth: for such doth the Father seek\n to be his worshipers. God is a spirit: and they that worship\n him must worship him in spirit and truth.\u201d As the Apostles\n and their immediate successors to the office of the ministry,\n felt it to be of paramount importance to preach Christ cruci\u00ac\n fied and resurrected, they already introduced the custom of\n commemorating once a year these two events in our Savior\u2019s\n life. The idea was not wholly original with them.

Through Christ\u2019s holy conception by the Divine\n Spirit and his nativity, this nature is again restored to its\n original purity and innocence. In him we have the promised\n Immanuel, which means u God with us.\u201d Not merely as he\n is observed in his providential dealings with us, nor as ruler\n in his moral government, but as the head of the race, taking\n the place of the first Adam before the fall.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is highly appropriate for the church to commemorate\n such a great event, in which, not only a portion of mankind\n are interested, but the whole human family.

Something more must be done. It is not\n sufficient that Christ presents himself in his human nature\n to his offended father, as a model of purity, and ask him to\n remould all men after this perfect pattern. Our sinful nature\n cannot be disposed of in this way. Through sin we have\n become disobedient children. As such we are debtors to the\n law, and the claims of the law must be satisfied. On account\n of man\u2019s disobedience he cannot meet the requirements, no\n more than the culprit, who is under sentence, can. The law\n must be executed. Man, in his depravity, awaits the awful\n day of its execution. In this extremity, Christ, the God-man,\n proposes to pay the penalty. He offers himself as a sacrifice,\n by which to turn away the wrath of God from man and suffer\n in his stead. This he did during the latter part of his life,\n but especially on the cross. Here we have another impor\u00ac\n tant step in the scheme of redemption, which is solemnly\n commemorated on Good Friday. In the observance of this\n festival we are reminded of our sinfulness, and the price paid\n for our deliverance from it, and its dreadful consequences.\n It is usually preceded by four days of deep humiliation and\n penitential service. The history of the Savior\u2019s passion is\n read and studied during this time under the shadow of the\n cross upon which he was crucified. Humble confession of\n sin is made to God, in the belief that he will grant pardon for\n the sake of the one sacrifice offered on the cross.\n</p>\n<p>\n But the death of Christ was not only a satisfaction for sin.\n It pointed back to the past. In paying the debt, Jesus\n expired on the cross in great agony. He suffered all that\n was required of him, but his sufferings ended in death. The\n wrath of God was appeased, but man\u2019s worst enemy was not\n overcome. Death is still victorious. He, who came to con\u00ac\n quer it, has been conquered. His sympathizing friends bear\n his body off the field of carnage, and lay it carefully in the\n new tomb of Joseph.

J. MICHAEL, WINAMAC, IND.\n</p>\n<p>\n [HE BIBLE is the most remarkable of all books,\n and should be read more than all other books.\n We frequently come across books of great antiqui\u00ac\n ty, and of curious and interesting contents, but\n none of them are equal to the Bible in age, in the\n beauty of expression, style, or the important\n nature of the subjects treated. And yet there have been\n men in all ages, who have set their judgment against that of\n Jehovah, and have called in question the truth of many\n things recorded in the Bible, and have suggested different\n improvements that might be made by leaving out certain\n parts, and adding others, thus making the word of God of no\n effect; for if it could be changed and altered in this way it\n would soon lose the hold it has upon the world. What folly!\n The Word of God has been often tried in this Avay by men of\n reprobate minds, and has maintained itself under all the\n criticisms that have been made, and will, no doubt, stand the\n tests to which it may be subjected in the future, as it has\n in the past.\n</p>\n<p>\n The most terrible judgments were sent upon the Jews for\n disobeying the word of the Lord as it was revealed to them,\n and walking after their own ways, which should be a warning\n to men in the present day against substituting their will in\n the place of God\u2019s, lest similar judgments fall on them.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Bible being God\u2019s book, should be read with great\n care, in order that we may find out what his will is in regard\n to us. It will be of little practical use to us if we do not read\n and study it. It is gratifying to know that the Bible is not\n only highly prized, but also read by a very large number of\n persons, as is evident from the very large number*of copies\n that are printed and sold. There is no book that has the\n circulation the Bible has.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0162/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0162/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0162/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0162/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0162/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0162/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0162.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 669404}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"162\">\n<p>\n THE CHURCH.\n</p>\n<p>\n 148\n</p>\n<p>\n There have been many persons in the past, and also at\n present who give special attention to the reading of the Bible.\n Mr. Moody tells us he has made it a rule not to read any book\n which does not bear in some way upon the Bible, which is a\n very good rule; Some read the Bible through often in the\n course of a year. To show what interest certain persons have\n taken in the Bible, we will give the following instances, in\n the hope that their example may have a good effect upon us:\n The Emperor Theodosius wrote out the whole New Testa\u00ac\n ment with his own hand, and read some parts of it every day.\n George, Prince of Transylvania, read the Scriptures over\n twenty-seven times. M. de Bentz, a French nobleman, used\n to read daily three chapters of the Bible, with his head\n uncovered, and on his knees. Lady Francis Hobart read the\n Psalms over twelve times a year, the New Testament thrice\n and the other parts of the Old Testament once. Susannah,\n Countess of Suffolk, for the last seven years of her life read\n the entire Scriptures twice a year. Dr. Gouge used to read\n fifteen chapters a day; five in the morning and five before\n going to bed. The venerable Bede is said to have been a\n great reader of the Bible, and with such affection that he\n often wept over it. Robert Colton read the Bible through\n twelve times a year. Ulrich Zwingli wrote out the Epistles\n of Paul and committed them to memory. A Scotchman, who\n lived in Fairfield county, 0., a few years ago, read the Bible\n through eighty-four times. If it were necessary we might\n add many other similar instances of Bible reading, but these\n must suffice, showing, as they do, what a value good and holy\n men have put on the Word of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n As it is, however, possible to read the Bible without deriv\u00ac\n ing any direct benefit, it may be proper to give a few direct-\n tions as to how we should read it, in reference to which the\n following must suffice.\n</p>\n<p>\n I. We should read it thoughtfully and reverently, bearing\n in mind that it is God\u2019s Word, and that he is speaking to us,\n as really as he did to those to whom it was first given.\n</p>\n<p>\n II. We should read it daily, and then meditate on what\n we have }\u2019ead, that we may understand it, and treasure it up\n in our hearts. And if there is anything we do not under\u00ac\n stand, we should not lay it aside hastily, but seek such helps\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0163/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 157, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0163/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 314, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0163/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 628, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0163/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1257, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0163/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2514, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0163/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0163.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2514, "levels": 6, "size": 499352}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"163\">\n<p>\n THE CHURCH. 149 *\n</p>\n<p>\n as may be at our command, in order that we may find out\n its true meaning and intent.\n</p>\n<p>\n III.

The duties it enjoins are of such infinite value\n that eternal life is promised as the reward of obedience, and\n eternal death threatened as the penalty of disobedience.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dealing in matters of such vast importance to us, it would\n be reasonable to suppose that its style would be sufficiently\n plain to be understood by all, as we find it to be the case; for\n no language could be more simple than that which the Bible\n employs in revealing the way of salvation, and the duties\n incumbent upon us.

This is the more to be deplored, as we have\n greater facilities for its study than our fathers had. The\n Bible is more widely circulated than ever before. The Sun\u00ac\n day-school, with its literature, has also done much to famil\u00ac\n iarize the present generation with the teaching of the Bible.\n And yet, with all these helps, it is astonishing how much\n ignorance still prevails in reference to it, not only on the part\n of the world, but also on the part of those who profess to\n believe in and love it.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is nothing that can supply or supercede the necessity\n of earnest, personal Bible study. The gospel preached in its\n purity from Sabbath to Sabbath, and listened to attentively,\n will be all the more effectual when, like the Bereans, the\n Scriptures are searched at home to know whether the things\n they hear are true. The Old Testament presents beautiful\n examples of Bible study, especially that of David, who prized\n the house of God above all other places on earth. He not\n only frequented those courts himself, but was glad when he\n heard others say, \u201c Let us go into the house of the Lord.\u201d To\n him the word of God was most precious.

M., AKRON, 0.\n</p>\n<p>\n CRHAPS THE simplest definition of popular\n preaching is gospel preaching. There is a consti\u00ac\n tutional affinity between man\u2019s soul and God\u2019s\n word which indicates very plainly the proper and\n most acceptable theme for the pulpit. The people\n want the truth in its purity. The minister, who\n gives them that, has wound a tie about their hearts\n which binds them mightily to himself. The doctrine of the\n cross, which has proven so great an attraction through the\n centuries, has not lost its magnetic power, but still lays for\u00ac\n cible hold upon men.\n</p>\n<p>\n Popular preachers may differ in the manner of their address,\n but all agree in the matter. Joseph Parker reads his sermons\n without lifting his eye from the manuscript, yet his message\n is the \u201cold old story.\u201d John Hall, the distinguished Amer\u00ac\n ican, speaks from notes in very refined and polished diction.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0177/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 157, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0177/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 314, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0177/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 628, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0177/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1257, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0177/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2514, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0177/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0177.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2514, "levels": 6, "size": 556819}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"177\">\n<p>\n THE CHURCH.\n</p>\n<p>\n 163\n</p>\n<p>\n yet the burden of his discourses is redemption through Christ.\n Dr. Talmage appears before his tabernacle audiences upon\n an open platform, without scrap of notes, throwing voice,\n eyes, hands and body into his delivery, yet his unvarying\n theme is the Crucified. The one thing positively essential to\n the successful minister among any people is the constant use\n of divine revelation. Beyond that, it is difficult to indicate\n any uniform or conventional qualifications. To take up any\n particular man and analyze him for the purpose of discover\u00ac\n ing the certain characteristics of a popular, preacher would be\n confusing and misleading, for no two ministers in a thousand re\u00ac\n semble each other. Could we even find a number who fit into\n a certain mold, as to features, voice and manner, they would\n probably differ in the measure of their success, and thus, after\n all, furnish us no standard for estimation. There is but one\n person whom we can safely make our model. It is he \u201cwho\n spake as never man spake.\u201d He alone can be studied and\n imitated with satisf actory results.\n</p>\n<p>\n This great teacher gives us an illustration of what may be\n termed popular preaching in his life at Capernaum. Accord\u00ac\n ing to his custom, he went into the synagogue on the Sabbath\n day, and, taking the Book, read a short passage from the\n prophecy of Isaiah as the basis of some remarks. At the\n conclusion of his address, we are told, \u201c all bare him witness,\n and wondered at the gracious words which proceeded out of\n his mouth.\u201d He evidently succeeded in making a deep im\u00ac\n pression upon the minds of his hearers, and that not so much\n by the form as by the substance of what he said. From this\n model sermon we may learn a few things that conduce to make\n preaching popular.\n</p>\n<p>\n I. The text was well selected and brought out the truth to\n be conveyed in a striking manner. The Bible has a wonder\u00ac\n ful diversity of themes and illustrations. It has something to\n suit every emergency in life without any twisting or turning.\n There is no occasion for committing violence upon exegesis by\n forcing a passage to conform with circumstances.

The sermon should be the natural outgrowth of the\n text. It should be a logical deduction from and not some\u00ac\n thing put into the text. It should be the Scripture explained\n and applied in such a way as to prove food for the head and\n the heart. Men are spiritually hungry. There is nothing in\n the world that can still that hunger. After they have been\n engaged in the work and business of life during the week, the\n soul longs for something to satisfy its needs. This cannot be\n done by essays on science or history, by humor, anecdote or\n fiction. These all are as empty husks. The only nourishing\n diet for them is the eternal word, even Jesus Christ. He is\n the \u201cbread from heaven,\u201d the manna of the soul, whom we\n should preach.\n</p>\n<p>\n III. The manner also has something to do with giving force\n to the matter. A simple statement of doctrine, or a dry col\u00ac\n lection of facts, can scarcely be called popular preaching.\n The Savior spoke in such a way that his hearers became in\u00ac\n tensely interested. He made them to understand that he was\n a man among men and had sympathy for them. He was ten\u00ac\n der, devout, natural. His thoughts were not so much from\n books and memory as from life and nature. He avoided the\n pompous diction of the conventional orator and used plain,\n every-day language. His aim was not to cram the mind with\n his own ideas, but to suggest thoughts and set the people to\n thinking. He was logical, but not scholastic, deep, but not\n abstruse. He used the personal argument with great effect,\n and did not strive to see how near he could come without hit\u00ac\n ting. Having heard him, no one could f ail to see the tendency\n of his remarks. His desire was not to secure the applause of\n men, but to become popular by really instructing and eleva\u00ac\n ting them. Hence his preaching had not the hollow monotony\n of so many of the pulpits of to-day.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0179/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 157, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0179/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 314, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0179/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 628, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0179/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1257, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0179/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2514, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0179/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0179.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2514, "levels": 6, "size": 513257}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"179\">\n<p>\n CHURCH ATTENDANCE.\n</p>\n<p>\n REV. 0.

First, the\n stated preaching of the word and the observance\n of the sacraments, and, secondly, the employment\n of all the members of the church in the extension of the\n kingdom of God in the earth. We are confronted with no\n more complex problem than that of internal church organiza\u00ac\n tion. The general church government, valuable as it is, affords\n only the merest outline of warfare in the promulgation of the\n gospel of the Son of God. The securing and keeping of con\u00ac\n verts, with the rooting and grounding of believers in the\n truth, the proper execution of the various departments of\n church work, require more thorough and vital identification\n with the body of Christ than the mere acceptance of the creed\n and discipline of any of the churches.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is more work to do than is possible for any pastor.\n No pastor is able, even if he were disposed to assume the\n entire labor of a congregation of ordinary size, to successfully\n attend to the various duties that arise from every direction.\n There are duties and interests that naturally belong to laymen,\n who are often more competent to do this work than the pastor.\n The voluntary assumption of church membership is a public\n declaration of an earnest desire to be saved, and of a willing\u00ac\n ness to discharge the duties incumbent upon us. The neglect\n of pastors to avail themselves of the implied and expressed\n willingness of professors of religion to be useful laborers in\n our Lord\u2019s vineyard, has resulted in very great injury to both\n church and pastor. Additions may be multiplied, the member\u00ac\n ship increased, but it is building on the sand. The spiritual\n mortality, where the laity are only hearers and not doers of the\n word, will be lamentably great. They are called to be saints ,\n and commanded to u go work.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 12\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0184/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0184/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0184/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0184/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0184/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0184/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0184.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 570567}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"184\">\n<p>\n 170\n</p>\n<p>\n THE CHURCH.\n</p>\n<p>\n Pastors are often discouraged at the indisposition to recog\u00ac\n nize and assume the responsibility of church work manifested\n by members of their congregations. They have preached\n forcible and penetrating sermons upon personal work; duty\n has been analyzed and arrayed in the most charming and\n fascinating dress; the man with one talent has been arraigned,\n tried, convicted and sentenced; the thunders of the judgment\n to come have been hurled against the defenseless head of the\n idler; but the effect has been as evanescent as the morning\n cloud. Popular ideas and notions of personal responsibility\n must be conformed to the scriptural standard. Popular ideas\n and notions are children of example. Men live as they see\n others live, and are satisfied if their lives bear favorable com\u00ac\n parison with those of clergyman. No pastor can hope to have\n those under his care become active personal workers in\n Christ\u2019s kingdom, before he has given them practical demon\u00ac\n stration of its value. This end can be attained only by\n preaching the gospel from the altar in every family. He must\n insist upon the church\u2019s right to each member\u2019s hearty\n co-operation, and he must give them work to do.

While the churches of Christ bear\n the most marked features in common, there is that peculiar to\n each which makes it unlike all the others. Work upon the\n systematic plan must be conducted in the light of the wants\n of the congregation. Missions, charities, Sunday-schools,\n visitation of the sick, & c., suggest the importance of system\u00ac\n atic work, and while making such classification of the\n interests of the congregation, the members will arrange them-\n \u2022 selves naturally under the various divisions.\n</p>\n<p>\n That such a system is desirable, cannot fail to impress every\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0185/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 157, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0185/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 314, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0185/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 628, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0185/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1257, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0185/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2514, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0185/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0185.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2514, "levels": 6, "size": 561316}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"185\">\n<p>\n THE CHURCH.\n</p>\n<p>\n 171\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2022candid servant of God.

It is to this kind of a barometer that we\n liken the prayer-meeting.\n</p>\n<p>\n The prayer-meeting indicates the real state of the atmos\u00ac\n phere of the church. It is comparatively easy for many peo\u00ac\n ple to attend the Sunday services of the church. It gives\n them moral respectability in the community; it makes the\n Sabbath a more pleasant and interesting day; it is a real rest\n and relief to them, after the busy cares and toils of the w r eek;\u201e\n and, especially on Sabbath morning, they feel fresh and ready\n to go somewhere and do something. But it is not so with the\n prayer-meeting. This comes in the very midst of week-day\n toils and ambitions; special arrangements must often be\n made about business or professional labors and engagements;\n probably people are wearied, because of the labors of the day,\n or, in towns and villages especially, there is such a strong\n temptation to go to the stores and offices, where a company of\n men gather to retail the town\u2019s gossip, and discuss political and\n business and local matters; in the city, there, perhaps, is the\n club-room meeting, or public lecture, or concert, or other\n entertainments, of which men must deny themselves, if they\n go to the prayer-meeting. Thus the prayer-meeting is the\n most sincere, thorough and searching test and proof of the\n real spiritual state of any Christian church. But those, whose\n hearts are warm, will cheerfully make these self-denials,,\n because of their love for the house of prayer and the com\u00ac\n munion of saints in the prayerful fellowship of the house of\n God.\n</p>\n<p>\n Again, the prayer-meeting is the barometer of the church,\n because it will surely indicate any special changes, which are\n to soon occur in the life and work of the church. Perhaps no\n better, nor more wonderful illustration of this fact can be seen\n than in the relation of prayer-meetings to the great American\n revival of 1857-58.

A. S. ZERBE, PII. D., TIFFIN, 0.\n</p>\n<p>\n RAYER IS an essential element in congregational\n worship. The substance of prayer is obviously of\n the first importance, and decides, so far as the\n Being addressed is concerned, the character of\n this means of grace. As, however, one attitude or\n another must be assumed, different churches differ\n in the use of the three principal postures, standing,\n kneeling and sitting. In some denominations a part of the\n people kneel in prayer and others remain sitting; in some, a\n portion of the congregation stand in prayer and the remainder\n will be found sitting; while in others still, the people neither\n kneel nor stand, but remain sitting, as if they were listening\n to a sermon. It would be well if Christians of every name\n could be brought to adopt a uniform mode, but in the absence\n of this, it is at all events desirable, for the sake of order and\n harmony, that each denomination should, so far as it may be,\n conform to the same posture in all its churches.\n</p>\n<p>\n The ancient Hebrews were accustomed to different postures\n in public prayer. Omitting the less usual attitudes, kneeling\n was the mode in some cases, but generally only in deep humil\u00ac\n ity, when this posture was regarded as most appropriate, and\n was in a manner spontaneously adopted. So far as the evi\u00ac\n dence of the Old Testament extends, it seems clear that the\n posture of worshipers in public prayer was that of standing,\n with the arms stretched out toward heaven. The devout Jew,\n in prayer, turned his face toward Jerusalem, and, should he\n be in the holy city, he turned it toward the temple, himself\n standing all the while; The passages referring to this mode\n are numerous: I. Kings viii. 22, \u201c And Solomon stood before\n the altar of the Lord in the presence of all the congregation\n of Israel, and spread forth his hands toward heaven; \u201d as also\n Exod. xxxiii. 10, \u201cAnd all the people saw the cloudy pillar\n stand at the tabernacle door, and all the people rose up and\n worshiped;\u201d In I.

Kings viii. 14, II. Chron. vi. 13, and others. Indeed\n it is generally conceded that the Hebrews prayed, ordinarily,\n in the attitude of standing, an attitude which was observed in\n the synagogue.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the early Christian church the attitude was likewise, that\n of standing. The first Christian teachers sometimes used the\n Jewish places of worship in imparting instruction to the peo\u00ac\n ple, and would naturally conform, in this matter, to the usages\n to which the people had been accustomed under the old order\n of things. The early Christian church also observed, on Sun\u00ac\n day, a standing posture, in memory of the Savior\u2019s resurrec\u00ac\n tion from the dead, as well as in reference to the forgiveness\n of sin and the Christian\u2019s hope of heaven. The same mode\n Avas observed during the week-days on the fifty days between\n Easter and Whitsuntide, \u201cas a symbol of the resurrection,,\n whereby through the grace of Christ the Christian rises again\n from the fall.\u201d In the apostolical constitutions it is expressly\n provided that Christians pray three* times on the Lord\u2019s day,\n standing, in honor of him who rose the third day from the\n dead.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the writings of Chrysostom the allusions to the same\n practice are numerous, more particularly in the words used by\n the deacons in calling upon the people: u Let us stand upright\n with reverence and decency.\u201d Tertullian is careful to say r\n \u201c We count it unlawful to fast, or worship kneeling, on the\n Lord\u2019s day, and we enjoy the same immunity from Easter to\n Pentecost.\u201d There were none exceptions to this mode, but for\n the sake of uniformity the Council of Nice, in 325 A.

In the Reformed and Lutheran churches of Ger\u00ac\n many, Switzerland, and other parts of Europe, there were\n parochial schools in the sixteenth and seventeenth ' centuries.\n These schools had many points of resemblance to our modern\n Sunday-schools, especially in their general aim and purpose.\n But, it has long been generally conceded that the honor of\n being the founder of the Sunday-school system, in its mod\u00ac\n ern form and character, must be ascribed to Robert Raikes,\n of Gloucester, England. For, though there had been similar\n efforts here and there, previous to that of Robert Raikes, in\n Gloucester, in July, 1780, yet it was Robert Raikes, who,\n through his newspaper and other means of public influence,\n awakened the whole nation to the necessity and importance\n of Sunday-schools, and finally had the joy of seeing them\n established far and wide throughout the kingdom.

Religion, to be\n attractive and to be what Christ intended it to be, must be\n happily social. The Bible idea of the church is that it is a\n spiritual household, the family of the Lord\u2019s people, and as\n such, it should be characterized by that free, merry and cor\u00ac\n dial sociability, that makes the family fireside a litteral ful\u00ac\n fillment of the old German proverb, \u201c East and West, at\n home the best.\u201d What a delightful scene of Christian socia\u00ac\n bility it is to look over a busy, interesting Sunday-school,\n and see scholars and teachers gathered in such pleasant\n sociable groups, studying the word of God! In the Sunday-\n school, our ideals of Christian sociability can be realized\n better than in any other religious service of the church of\n Christ. It is to be regretted, however, that officers and\n teachers neglect to make the Sunday-school as social as it\n might often be made. There ought to be frequent Sunday-\n school socials ; every teacher ought to visit every member of\n his class, and encourage the scholars to visit their teacher in\n return; and no teacher ought to allow the year to go by with\u00ac\n out having his class at his home for dinner or tea, or to spend\n the day or evening. It would not only give the teacher more\n immediate influence in his Sunday-school work, and enable\n him to get more fully and heartily into the inmost lives and\n souls of the scholars, but a social Sunday-school would, in\n time at least, make a social church.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Sunday-school fortunately exerts its deepest and most\n powerful influence upon the young at that period of life when\n the aims, habits, ambitions and thoughts can be most easily\n and lastingly turned in the right channels.

For, to engage in such work, is to do\n that which Jesus commanded, when he said:\n u Go ye, therefore, and teach all nations, baptiz\u00ac\n ing them in the name of the Father, and of the\n Son, and of the Holy Ghost.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n For eighteen centuries the gospel has been\n preached, and yet the field is an ever widening\n one. Of the twelve hundred millions of the world\u2019s\n population, scarcely one-third have been reached by the\n gospel. At a glance, then, we perceive the need of activity\n on the part of the church, to bring Christ to a perishing\n world. What are the necessary elements to enable us, suc\u00ac\n cessfully to carry on missionary work ?\n</p>\n<p>\n We need to be consecrated to the work. In giving our\u00ac\n selves to God, as members of his church, we need also to give\n our time, talents, energies, to the work of God in the church,\n freely to regard ourselves as instruments in the Divine hand\n to use us as he will.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ministers are necessary to preach the gospel. The sons of\n Christian XDarents, who are pious and who manifest an aptness\n to teach, ought freely to be given to the cause of the gospel.\n Not only this, but parents ought to encourage their sons to\n enter the ministry. The young men ought, seriously and\n prayerfully, to consider whether they may not do more for\n God and humanity in the ministry, than in some other voca\u00ac\n tion, and if they can, they ought to preach the gospel. For,\n as Christians, we ought to please God, and do his will, rather\n than seek to please ourselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n Again, ministers must be educated. The missionaries,\n whether at home or in foreign lands, ought to be u master\n workmen that need not be ashamed.\u201d Therefore must the\n church establish and support colleges and seminaries of\n learning.

That is common to every\n age. God wants no other ministry. But along with that the\n age demands an educated ministry. There is demanded a\n ministry of sharp, keen intellect; a ministry possessing good\n natural powers, hut with these sharpened and cultivated by\n intercourse with pious and learned teachers; a ministry who\n can perceive the drift of the times: who observe the dangers\n and comprehend the fallacies of infidelity, and who can\n expose the sophistries of sin and unbelief to the people.

They\n must be well rooted and grounded in the faith, thoroughly\n instructed in the Word of God, and capable of using to\n advantage the truths of the Bible. Such a ministry is needed,\n and to aid in securing it, our colleges and seminaries of learn\u00ac\n ing have been established.

J. G.

The tree which produces\n 9 no fruit is barren and cumbers the ground, and\n deserves the sentence, \u201c Cut it down, why cum-\n bereth it the ground.\u201d \u201cHerein is my Father\n glorified, that ye bear much fruit, so shall ye be\n my disciples,\u201d is the language of our Savior. Healthy Chris\u00ac\n tianity without almsgiving is an impossibility. It stands by\n the side of prayer. Neither one nor both combined make the\n Christian. Faith makes the Christian, while prayer and giving\n are among the choicest fruit of our Christian life. There is,\n therefore, a necessity for almsgiving, not, it is true, because\n God has commanded it, nor because he cannot extend his\n kingdom without our aid, but because of the very nature of\n the Christian life, which would be incomplete without it.\n Prayer keeps the armor bright, gives exercise to faith and\n love, it is the Christian\u2019s vital breath and native air. In this\n sense, therefore, the Christian must pray, in order to live. So\n almsgiving developes the graces, elevates and ennobles the life,,\n beautifies and adorns the character. Hence there must be\n liberality in order to a healthy, beautiful, and fruitful Chris\u00ac\n tianity. The tree of the Christian\u2019s life will be filled with\n fruit, and this ought not only to be so, but it cannot be other\u00ac\n wise. Everything has a nature of its own. The wind will\n blow, fire will burn, water will moisten, and this cannot be\n otherwise. So life is manifested by activity, it will be filled\n with fruit. Almsgiving is the choicest fruit of this tree.\n Though placed side by side with prayer, it is more choice and\n precious in the sight of God, and is more frequently enjoined\n in the Bible, more specific directions are given in reference to\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0205/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 157, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0205/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 314, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0205/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 628, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0205/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1257, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0205/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2514, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0205/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0205.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2514, "levels": 6, "size": 534828}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"205\">\n<p>\n THE CHURCH.\n</p>\n<p>\n 189\n</p>\n<p>\n it, and has more and greater promises and blessings in store.\n Our Savior tells us that without self-denial and sacrifice we\n cannot be his disciples; giving exercises this grace.\n</p>\n<p>\n There can be no healthy Christianity without gratitude\u2014\n thankfulness expressed with the lip only is an empty service.\n We show our gratitude to God not so much by words as by\n acts, by giving first ourselves, then our means.

It is thus that\n our feet are turned from the way of death into the way of\n life. And, as the vine does not bear fruit for itself, but for\n the husbandman, the true church member does not live for\n himself, but for Christ. To say that we are in the church,\n solely and alone, to obtain salvation, is a grievous error. From\n the moment of our entrance into the church, we belong to\n Christ only, and are bound to an unreserved submission to God,\n ready obedience to Christ\u2019s commands, and cheerful liberality.\n True Christian fellowship, an earnest participation in the wor\u00ac\n ship and services of, the church, building up the institutions of\n learning, advancing the great cause of missions, caring for the\n needy and poor, prayer and faithful work in the family, the\n church, and the v r orld, constitute the church member\u2019s true\n element and sphere of life. And this is not the effect of\n forces terminating upon us from without, but the fruit of the\n spirit and life within us.

The objections based upon the imper\u00ac\n fections and hypocrisies of some church members, amount to\n nothing at all. The church does not profess to consist of\n angels and glorified saints, but of sinners saved by grace.\n There are many, too, who are not really in union with Christ\n or the church, but only outwardly attached, and for these she\n is not responsible, so that all these objections are but the man-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0212/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0212/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0212/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0212/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0212/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0212/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0212.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 600559}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"212\">\n<p>\n 196\n</p>\n<p>\n THE CHURCH.\n</p>\n<p>\n ifestations of unbelief and perverseness. \u201cTo the pure all\n things are pure,\u201d and to the base, for the same reason, all\n things are base.

The universal experience is that u as the hart\n panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee\n O God. My soul thirsteth for God, the living God.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Before we speak of a profession of religion, we must obtain '\n a clear conception of what religion really is, as there is\n reason to believe that there are many erroneous views on the\n subject. Religion is not a formal profession of a certain\n creed, a nominal connection with a certain church, nor a par\u00ac\n ticipation in its ordinances and its worship. Nor is it merely\n a certain kind of feeling or experience. It is not a groan nor\n a prayer even. All this may belong to it, but it is not relig\u00ac\n ion. True religion is more than all this. It is the life of man\n in all its tendencies and activities in covenant with God. If\n the whole inner and outer life is determined and controlled\n by the divine influence, we have religion. In true religion\n the soul must be in harmony with God, and the life must\n conform to his law. Christianity is the only true religion,\n because it alone brings the soul in blessed harmony with God,\n and holding up before us the highest ideal of life, gives us by\n grace, the power to attain it. Our souls can only obtain\n peace and harmony with God under the cross of Christ, where\n God reconciles us unto himself by the death of his Son. We\n cannot rise above our sin-cursed humanity and reach the full\n stature of manhood, except by the power of Christ\u2019s resurrec\u00ac\n tion. Christianity means the upbuilding of a Christ-like\n character on the foundation, which is laid on the Rock of\n Ages. The prophet Isaiah speaking for God says, u Behold I\n lay in Zion a chief corner stone, elect precious, and he that\n believeth on him shall not be confounded.\u201d The apostle\n Peter takes up the figure and applying it to Christ, says, u To\n whom coming, as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of\n men, but chosen of God and precious, ye also as lively stones\n are built up a spiritual house.\u201d Are you, dear reader, build\u00ac\n ing such a character, a spiritual house meet for God\u2019s inspec\u00ac\n tion, yea more, a house in which God himself may dwell ?\n</p>\n<p>\n Having seen what is the object and nature of true religion,\n we are now prepared to consider what is necessary to a pro\u00ac\n fession of it. The basis of a Christian life is a loving faith,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0214/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0214/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0214/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0214/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0214/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0214/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0214.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 689935}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"214\">\n<p>\n 198\n</p>\n<p>\n THE CHURCH.\n</p>\n<p>\n by which the believer becomes a member of Christ, and a\n partaker of all his benefits. When the Holy Spirit leads the\n soul by faith to embrace Christ, then all grace and mercy,\n strength and power for a new life are communicated to it.\n Faith in Christ is the golden key, that unlocks the treasure-\n house of God. It is the victory, that overcometh the world\n with its sins and temptations, and death with its terrors and\n fears. This faith is not founded on any human authority, but\n rests upon the testimony of God concerning his Son. This\n testimony is contained in the Bible, especially in the Scrip\u00ac\n tures of the New Testament, We must search these Scriptures,\n until we find in them eternal life through Jesus Christ, We\n must accept and rest upon those testimonies of God, and look\n up to Christ as our great teacher, who reveals to us fully the\n will of God ; our only High Priest, who, by his sacrifice on\n the Cross, has fully satisfied for all our sins; and our eternal\n King, who rules by his Spirit in our hearts, and forever pro\u00ac\n tects and preserves us in the salvation of our souls. Recog\u00ac\n nizing thus in him our u Lord, our life, our sacrifice, and our\n all,\u201d we come to him and say, a Lord, unto whom shall we go ;\n thou hast the words of eternal life, and we know and believe\n that thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God.\u201d In this way\n faith becomes the response of the heart to the testimony of\n God, and \u201c Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth\n speaketh.\u201d True faith and confession will always go together.\n Ihey are one and inseperable. Credo ergo condteor , (I be\u00ac\n lieve, therefore I confess,) is an an ancient maxim by which\n the heroes and martyrs, the confessors and saints of Christ in\n all ages, amidst fagots and flames, in dungeons and under\n the torture of cruel instruments, have manifested their faith\u00ac\n fulness and love to the Master, and their adherence to the\n truth as it is in Jesus. It may not be our lot to seal our faith\n with our blood as the martyrs did, but, nevertheless, it is our\n duty to profess it publicly to a gainsaying world, and to adorn\n it by a consistent and consecrated life. As God in the Holy\n Bible witnesses to Christ, so the believing Christian must also\n bear witness of Christ to the world.

There is in our days a\n great deal of talk about secret discipleship and the worthless\u00ac\n ness of creeds and confessions. A good many people fancy\n that they are just as well off outside the communion and fel\u00ac\n lowship of the Christian Church as in it.

That it was given as a name of reproach is not\n probable. Among the Gentiles, the gospel was now having\n great acceptance, and it was about this time that St. Paul\n established the first church among the Gentiles at Antioch.\n Nor did the Jews hold any prejudice against the coming\n Messiah. They were looking for him, and were waiting to\n welcome him at his coming. But that this man, who called\n himself Jesus, was that Messiah, they did not believe; and\n they cast reproach upon him by calling him a Nazarene,\n after the city out of which no good thing, no prophet should\n come.\n</p>\n<p>\n The apostles were known among themselves as brethren\n of one family, as disciples of one master, as believers of one\n faith, as those working together for the accomplishment of\n one great final end, the salvation of souls. Hence they were\n called brethren, disciples, believers, saints. All these terms*\n though clear to them, were foreign and meaningless to the\n outer world. The ungodly man knows little of the true\n meaning and import of such names as brethren in Christ*\n believers, saints. And the people of Antioch, desiring some\n falniliar name, gave expression to their natural wit and\n inclination to giving fictitious names, and thus gave to this-\n class the term Christian.\n</p>\n<p>\n This name, so appropriate and full of meaning, was by no\n means a cause of offense to the disciples. They accepted it,\n and rejoiced in the appellation.

There is nothing in a name or title, unless those, who bear\n it, are true to its significance. Even in the name Christian\n there is no merit, no virtue, no power that can save; but the\n heart must be made pure and white before it can be possible\n to assume this name. It is an honor to be a Christian ; and\n on this account, doubtless, many desiring the name, take it\n only for their own temporal gratification, without any\n thought that they are worthy. Thus hypocrites may escape\n and pass in the presence of men; but the great and final day\n will come, when the church will be judged, and its members\n u sifted as wheat.\u201d There is no room in the Christian church,\n except for the \u201cupright and pure in heart.\u201d Nor is the church,\n as many, by their actions, seem to think, a place for inactivi\u00ac\n ty and repose. Here the great object at stake is the soul.\n On this depends every useful faculty of man; all that is\n pure; all that is holy; all that is noble and good. For the\n preservation of this.great factor, man must be watchful, care\u00ac\n ful, prayerful; and in order that many others may be brought\n into a saving faith, the Christian must, above all others, be\n the most patient, enduring and energetic of beings, laboring\n continually for the salvation of souls. We do not mean to\n say that all should preach the gospel; nor that all should\n exhort or teach; but we do say that every one has some\n Christian mission to perform for the ingrafting of souls; and,\n further, that no one can be a true follower of Christ who does\n not do his duty to advance and support his religion. The\n Apostles were required to labor daily and continue in prayer,\n that they might keep the faith and win others to Christ; are\n we better than they? The early church fathers, too, met\n daily, for the purpose of praying to God that their faith might\n be strengthened and that the church might be firmly\n established; are we more perfect or worthy than they ? or is\n there less need of this now than then ? The cause is a great\n one, and he, who does not perform his part bravely, is not\n worthy of the kingdom. Extended is the field for Christian\n labor, and great the call for laborers. This call is not for\n church members; it does not mean simply good men and\n women; we have now a vast army of Christians, and many,\n too, whose virtue cannot be doubted or motives questioned;\n but this call means more than this; it is an urgent demand\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0224/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0224/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0224/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0224/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0224/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0224/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0224.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 606558}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"224\">\n<p>\n 208\n</p>\n<p>\n THE CHURCH.\n</p>\n<p>\n for the most persevering, earnest workers.

Every person has a right\n to ask: \u201c Why shall I become a Christian ? \u201d and he has\n an equal right to expect an answer. St. Paul says Chris\u00ac\n tian service is a reasonable service, and that every disciple of\n Christ should be ready to give an answer to him that asketh a\n reason of the hope that is in him.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many reasons may be given why all persons should become\n Christians, but we must be content in the short space allotted\n to us to state briefly the more important.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. Christianity developes the highest type of character. It\n denounces all manner of vice, and commends every virtue. It\n inspires us to hate all evil, and love all that is good. It sets be\u00ac\n fore us a perfect pattern, a heroic, unwavering, unselfish, for\u00ac\n giving, self-sacrificing, meek and loving spirit\u2014a character\n without spot or blemish, and of snow-white purity, exhibiting\n the glory of true and exalted manhood, in the Lord Jesus\n \u2022Christ. He is the Christian\u2019s lofty ideal, the object of his love\n and worship. Experience teaches us that the worshipper is\n naturally inclined to become like the moral character of the\n Being worshipped. If we worship the god of wine, we become\n drunkards; if the god of war, we become bloodthirsty; if the\n god of lust, we become licentious ; and if we worship Christ,\n who is the personification of love and purity, we become like\n him. But Christ adds also the supernatural influence of his\n Spirit to mould his followers into his own image. And so the\n Scriptures teach us : \u201cWe all, with open face, beholding as in\n a glass the glory of the Lord, are changed into the same image\n from glory to glory, even as by the Spirit of the Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. It promotes the highest interests of man in the present\n life. There is no relation of life over which Christianity does\n not throw its healthful and hallowed influence. It sets before\n man a worthy object for which to live. It teaches him to use\n the world without abusing it. It enables him to reap the\n greatest blessings for himself without tramping on the inter\u00ac\n ests of his fellow man. It defines the rights of all and leads\n us to give each his due. It is the advocate and guardian\n of liberty, justice, peace, and all that can contribute to the\n happiness and prosperity of any people. It sanctifies the\n home and makes it a type of heaven. It blesses civil society\n and relieves it of a thousand disaffection ' s.

The Chris\u00ac\n tian is secure whether his religion be true or not; but no one\n else can say as much. All who reject the salvation of Christ\n are running a great risk, for if the gospel be true, and who can\n prove it is not, their future existence must be unspeakably\n sad. But the Christian is assured that to die is gain. To be\n absent from the body is to be present with the Lord. To have\n the footstool is to ascend to the throne. And heaven, with its\n ineffable bliss, its rapturous joy, its ravishing beauty, and\n transcendent glory; the light of eternal day flashing on the\n crystal sea, and shining on the mansions of burnished gold ;\n the gladsome throng tuning their harps to the sweetest strains\n of music and singing the song of Moses and the Lamb; this\n is the inheritance of the saints. But how imperfect all at\u00ac\n tempts to describe it, for eye hath not seen, nor ear heard,\n neither hath it entered into the mind of man to conceive what\n the Lord hath in store for those who love him.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0227/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 157, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0227/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 314, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0227/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 628, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0227/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1257, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0227/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2514, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0227/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0227.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2514, "levels": 6, "size": 478194}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"227\">\n<p>\n EXCUSES FOR NOT BEING A CHRISTIAN.\n</p>\n<p>\n REV.

This is a most\n singular fact, and evinces great folly and inconsid\u00ac\n erateness. Men do not act thus in the affairs of\n the world. No one thinks of rejecting any earthlj\u201d\n good when sincerely offered him. The hungry and\n thirsty gladly accept meat and drink from the\n hands of any benefactor. Not so, however, in\n regard to spiritual and heavenly gifts, in reference to which\n many act still, as sinners have always done. When Christ wa &\n on earth he forcibly illustrated the conduct of many towards\n the gospel, by the parable of the great supper to which the\n master of the feast gave a free and cordial invitation. The\n guests, however, on being notified that all things were ready,,\n and that they should come and enjoy the festivities of the\n occasion, began with one consent to make excuse.

Not a few, when asked why they have not identified\n themselves with some Christian church, tell us that they can\n hardly give any answer, as they have not thought much about\n it. They go to church occasionally with their friends, or when\n some strange minister happens to come along. They like to\n hear an eloquent sermon, and believe that Christianity is a\n good thing, and should be maintained. But somehow, or\n other they have never considered it their duty to be Chris\u00ac\n tians, and have thought very little upon the general subject of\n religion. How any one can be thus indifferent about a matter\n of such vast importance as the salvation of the soul, is hard to\n understand. To say the least, it betrays a great inconsistency\n to be concerned about matters of minor importance, as many\n of these persons are, to the neglect of their souls. No man\n can treat the subject of religion, which affects his well-being\n for time and eternity, with indifference, without being guilty\n of great folly and inconsistency. To be or not to be a Chris\u00ac\n tian, is a question that ought to be settled by each one at a\n very early period in life.\n</p>\n<p>\n II. Others tell us that their business is too harassing and\n burdensome, to think of uniting with the church and living a\n Christian life. They must first get their worldly matters in a\n different shape, and have their families better provided for,\n before they can think about religion. But, what right has\n any one to allow himself to become so immersed in the world,\n as to have no time to attend to his spiritual interests, when\n his first, and great duty is to \u201c seek the kingdom of God and\n his righteousness.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n III. Others, again, excuse themselves for not being Chris\u00ac\n tians, because they do not feel like it. They do not want to\n act as many others do, go into the church merely for the\n name of the thing. They believe there must be some heart-\n work about it, and just as soon as they have experienced a\n change of heart, they will then unite themselves with the\n church. But how can they ever expect to experience this\n change whilst they are doing nothing to bring it about.

Thus\n the Bible speaks of the Sabbath-day, the temple,\n altars, vessels, etc., as being consecrated to the\n Lord. As applied to persons, it means a free and\n determinate dedication of one\u2019s self to the service\n and worship of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of the duty and reasonableness of such personal consecra\u00ac\n tion to the Lord, the apostle Paul says, \u201c I beseech you, there\u00ac\n fore, brethren, by the mercies of God, that ye present your\n bodies a living sacrifice, holy, acceptable unto God, which is\n your reasonable service.\u201d God does not impose upon man\n anything that is unreasonable, or unjust. God made man for\n himself, \u201c to glorify and praise him,\u201d a service, that is alto\u00ac\n gether agreeable to the principles of right reason. Man, how\u00ac\n ever, away from Christ, would rather live entirely for self and\n for selfish gratifications; yet God by no means relinquishes\n his claims upon him. It is still made his duty to serve, love,\n and worship God. Ceasing to walk in the way of his own\n heart, he is to make the will of God the rule of his life. \u201c Not\n as I will, but as thou wilt,\u201d must be the language of his soul,\n so that u whether he lives, he lives unto the Lord ; or whether\n he dies, he dies unto the Lord.\u201d He must be enabled to say,\n u that with body and soul, both in life and death, he is not his\n own, but belongs to his faithful Savior, Jesus Christ, who,\n with his precious blood, hath fully satisfied for all his sins, and\n delivered him from all the power of the devil.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n As the worshipers in the temple brought their offerings\n and presented them to the Lord, and as this action on their\n part was free and voluntary; so the act of devoting ourselves\n to God is also free and voluntary.

But it also\n teaches us that in consecrating ourselves to God our motives\n must be pure, and our principles of action in accordance with\n his will. We are to offer to him our best faculties, the vigor\n of our minds, and the heart\u2019s best service. Our youth, our\n health, our strength, are to be given him. God wants not a\n divided but a complete sacrifice.

He took care to embody in his\n verse the great foundation truths of the Bible, that being\n sung over and over by the people, they might never be for\u00ac\n gotten. So successful was he in this endeavor, that priestly\n influence might in vain have attempted to check the progress\n of the Reformation by destroying the Bible.

Like Luther, Calvin also attempted to\n destroy the practice of antiphonal chanting, and to restore\n the singing to the people, from whom it had been taken by\n the priests, centuries before. The hymns introduced among\n the Genevese, exhilarated their congregational worship, were\n heard on the streets, and were sung by artificers at their work.\n German, French, Bohemian, Dutch and Polish hymns multi\u00ac\n plied with intense rapidity, and spreading everywhere among\n the people, disseminated the new faith. Hymns were also\n composed in the popular dialects, and were powers of the\n press equal in influence, in many places, with the pulpit.\n</p>\n<p>\n At Heidelberg the people were aroused to the Reformation\n by the power of song. It is related that the Elector Fred\u00ac\n erick, fearing somewhat the power of the Emperor, did not\n at once order the discontinuance of saying mass. Therefore,\n on a certain occasion, just as the priest was about to begin\n his services at the high altar, some one began with the cele\u00ac\n brated hymn of Sporatus, u Es ist das Heil uns kommen her \u201d\n u To us salvation now is come,\u201d (given in Dr. Schaff\u2019s Gesang\n Bueh and instrumental in introducing the Reformation into\n other lands.) Thereupon the vast assembly united in the\n service, and, by the direction of the Elector, mass was no\n longer said in that church.\n</p>\n<p>\n The inspiring influence of sacred song was likewise felt\n during and after the Reformation period, in England no less\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0243/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 157, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0243/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 314, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0243/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 628, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0243/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1257, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0243/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2514, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0243/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0243.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2514, "levels": 6, "size": 592409}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"243\">\n<p>\n THE CHURCH.\n</p>\n<p>\n 227\n</p>\n<p>\n than in other lands.

The effective hymns and tunes spread\n everywhere among people who cared little for the eloquence\n of the preachers. An anecdote is related of the manner in\n which an Irishman was converted. \u201cAt Wexford the society\n was persecuted by Papists, and met in a closed barn. One\n of the persecutors had agreed to conceal himself within it\n beforehand, that he might open the door to his comrades\n after the people had assembled. He crept into a sack hard\n by the door. The singing commenced, but the Hibernian\n was so taken with the music that he thought he would hear\n it through before disturbing the meeting. He was so grati\u00ac\n fied that at its conclusion he thought he would hear the\n prayer also. But this was too powerful for him. He was\n seized with remorse and trembling, and roared out with such\n dismay as to appal the congregation, who began to believe\n that Satan himself was in the sack. The sack was at last\n pulled off of him, and disclosed the Irishman, a weeping\n penitent, praying with ali his might.

The exercise of Christian influence is\n most strongly implied by such phrases as \u201cthe salt of the\n earth,\u201d \u201c the light of the world,\u201d Ac.\n</p>\n<p>\n But what are we to understand by Christian influence ? It\n is important here to study the two words of which our subject\n is composed. The word influence has a deep significance. It\n means the effect one has upon the character of another; that\n by which action and life are changed. We can, perhaps, see\n farther into the depths of the word by taking its original, or\n literal meaning. Influence means, literally, a flowing in.\n The influence, then, of our mind upon another, is the flowing\n or transmission of the characteristics and ideas of one mind\n to the other.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0248/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0248/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0248/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0248/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0248/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0248/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0248.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 559160}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"248\">\n<p>\n THE CHURCH.\n</p>\n<p>\n A Christian influence, therefore, is the inflowing or trans\u00ac\n mitting of Christian elements of character. A Christian\n influence is a Christ-influence; an inflowing of Christ. This\n may appear as a strange and untenable view. But on a little\n further examination it will be found true. We maintain that\n a Christian influence must be a Christ-influence, i. e. an\n inflowing of Christ. To understand this position more fully,\n let us simply glance at the essential \u2022 elements of Christ\u2019s\n character. We find in Christ love, humility, devotion, self-\n sacrifice, grace and mercy. Now, if we have a truly Chris\u00ac\n tian influence, these qualities of Christ will w flow from us\n into the hearts of our associates.\u201d His brotherly love, his\n humility, his devotion and self-sacrifice should be impressed,\n by our example, upon the lives of our fellow-Christians. Our\n lives should be such as to make our fellow-Christians more\n Christ-like, i. e. more loving, more spiritually devoted, more\n humble and self-sacrificing.\n</p>\n<p>\n Again, our lives should be such as to cause the light of\n God\u2019s loving grace to shine into the souls of the unconverted.\n Our very presence should radiate the love and purity of\n Christ, so that the sinner may contrast therewith his own\n impurity; so that he will be terrified at his own corruption\n and guilt, and also overjoyed at Christ\u2019s mercy and forgive\u00ac\n ness. There may be moral influences which limit certain sins.\n There are no doubt social influences which cultivate much\n that is good in man. There are intellectual influences which\n stimulate study, and banish ignorance. But none of these\n are worthy of the aims of the true Christian, unless they\n subserve the ends of real Christian influence. They should\n aim to make all the excellencies of Christ ' ftow into the hearts\n of our companions.\n</p>\n<p>\n But why is Christian influence such an important duty ? In\n the first place, it is our duty to exert a Christian influence\n because we are the servants of Christ, who died to save lost\n souls. If our Master died to save these souls, we should\n surely exert ourselves to influence them in his favor. Our\n Savior desires that all men be not only saved from sin, but\n that they also grow in grace. Hence it is our duty to feed\n each other on his truth and love.\n</p>\n<p>\n But some may consider themselves so insignificant, as to\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0249/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 157, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0249/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 314, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0249/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 628, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0249/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1257, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0249/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2514, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0249/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0249.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2514, "levels": 6, "size": 542503}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"249\">\n<p>\n THE CIIURCII.\n</p>\n<p>\n 233\n</p>\n<p>\n have no influence.

It is impossible for minds to associate without some\n communication. Hence every mind has an influence, how\u00ac\n ever small.

If then we are not impressed as to our re\u00ac\n sponsibility in leading each other up, we should at least recog\u00ac\n nize the criminality of thrusting each other down. We are\n either a bright light, that cheers and elevates the sin-wearied\n soul, or a dark, offensive, smoky fire that blinds, and pains the\n open eye, and starts the seeker backward and downward. We\n are then under the double obligation to lead men up and\n avoid sending them down. If they go down by our influence,\n or by the means of it, their blood will be upon us.\n</p>\n<p>\n But how can we attain to an inflowing of Christ? In the\n first place, we cannot have a Christian influence upon others\n unless we have the Christ-like qualities in ourselves. And we\n cannot have them in us, except we receive them from Christ.\n We cannot shed a light, which we do not possess. And, as a\n planet has no light except what it receives from the sun, so\n have we no Christian light except what we receive from the\n Sun of Righteousness. We must then turn our hearts toward\n Christ, so that his light of love and humble devotion may\n shine into our souls.

Next, ask the person with whom\n you converse \u2018What is your chief religious difficulty ? 5 Per\u00ac\n haps he does not know what his greatest difficulty is. But if\n you induce him to make an effort to state that difficulty, you\n help him to solve it. * * * Try next to untie the\n</p>\n<p>\n knot by clear ideas and round words. Then lastly kneel\n down with that man, and by the courageous self-surrender of\n two souls face to face with the Unseen Hoty, ask the Divine\n Nature to untie the knot.\u201d If we were to follow these steps\n more closely, we should have a greater Christian influence.\n Finally, let us remember three things: First, to study Christ\n in prayer and in his word; second, to appropriate Christ to our\u00ac\n selves by prayer and practice; third, to transmit Christ by the\n four steps which Joseph Cook, points out.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0251/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 157, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0251/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 314, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0251/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 628, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0251/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1257, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0251/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2514, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0251/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0251.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2514, "levels": 6, "size": 525281}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"251\">\n<p>\n THE INFLUENCE OF DOING GOOD TO OTHERS.\n</p>\n<p>\n HAT MORE reasonable than the belief that life\n becomes broader, deeper, fuller, more abundant,\n in proportion as it is concerned with the virtues of\n others?

It was a day of holy rest.\n</p>\n<p>\n This day was kept before the people of Israel\n as a perpetual obligation, and, from the clouds and\n smoke of,Sinai, it was commanded: \u201cRemem\u00ac\n ber the Sabbath day to keep it holy.\u201d It was to the\n Jews, beside a moral and religious observance, also a\n ceremonial. With them it was a day of rest, of cessation\n from daily cares, a violation of which was punishable with\n death. But in it then, as now, were permitted all works of\n charity and necessity, and it was a special time for prayer,\n praise, the public and private worship of God and the study of\n his word. Being a necessity, its observance is a moral and\n Christian duty. Richard Hooker said of it, \u201cWe are to\n account the sanctification of one day in seven a duty, which\n God\u2019s immutable law doth exact forever.\u201d Justice M\u2019Clean,\n upon the same subject, says, \u201c Where there is no Christian\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0261/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 157, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0261/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 314, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0261/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 628, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0261/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1257, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0261/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2514, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0261/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0261.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2514, "levels": 6, "size": 543962}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"261\">\n<p>\n THE CHURCH.\n</p>\n<p>\n 245\n</p>\n<p>\n Sabbath, there is no Christian morality, and without this, free\n institutions cannot long be sustained.\u201d It is perfectly clear\n that the law of our being, as well as the law of God, demands\n a Christian Sabbath.\n</p>\n<p>\n u What day shall it be?

The change from\n the seventh day seems to have been made at once, and to all\n appearances, under the direction of the u Lord of the Sab\u00ac\n bath ; \u201d for, on the same day, the first day of the week, he\n appeared among his disciples, and on the next recurrence of\n the first day, he was again with them, and revealed himself to\n Thomas.\n</p>\n<p>\n We find a second reason for it in apostolic practice and\n precedent, for it appears that the disciples in all places were\n accustomed to meet regularly, for worship and for celebrating\n # the Lord\u2019s supper, on the first day of the week. Christians\n everywhere, proofs of which cannot be given in special ex\u00ac\n amples in this short article, assembled on the first day of the\n week for communion and religious instruction, as in the case\n of the church at Troas. Acts xx. 6-11. John, the revelator,\n regarded the day with special solemnity, and it had, already\n in his time, received the name of the u Lord\u2019s day,\u201d which it\n has ever since retained. Paul, in his writings, frequently re\u00ac\n fers to it as the day of the church\u2019s rest and worship, and\n commends with its observance giving as an act of worship.\n He exhorts them, when they meet on the first day of the week,\n evidently the day of their religious gatherings, to lift a col\u00ac\n lection for the saints.

It must be a place of all others most sacred, to which\n our hopes and affections cling amid the ever-changing scenes\n of our earthly life.

Happiness grows not up amid the bramble\n and brier of domestic life. It is not the weed of family strife,\n but is the golden grain of parental love. Happiness does not\n thrive in the burning sands of domestic heat, nor in the frigid\n zones of domestic infidelity. It cannot plant its beauty on the\n hearthstone of family strife, nor can it diffuse its fragrance\n through the chambers of a Christless home. Happiness is the\n flower of peace, and the fruit of faith ; it is the ambrosial air\n of a paradise-life, and the only warmth of unbroken friendship\n and love. A home without happiness is only a place. The\n highest idea of home can only be associated with domestic fel\u00ac\n icity.

In the\n lowly home at Bethany, we find the true elements of the happy\n family,.where Christ was a frequent and welcome guest. To\n its social and hallowed associations he was gladly welcomed,\n and in its small circle could be felt his divine presence. To it\n he retired when weary and hungry, and here he came when\n no other place was open in Bethany. To it he went as teacher,\n comforter, Savior, and companion. In ignorance he was their\n wisdom, and in sorrow their divine comforter. To this home\n he brought all the consolations of his grace, and into it he\n poured all the wealth of his earthly walks, and from it he\n drew the ministry of his love. This little circle was broken by\n the death of the parents, and now in the still and quiet of life,\n the Savior would make this his pleasure garden. When this\n home-life is again broken by the messenger of death, who\n snatches from these sisters their brother Lazarus, the Savior\n forgets not to come again. He comes when the cloud of sor\u00ac\n row has just burst, and when the heavens grew darkest, and\n with his omnific voice breaks the shackles of death, and glori\u00ac\n fies himself as Lord of all. This was the hour of greatest\n gloom and yet into this lowly home flowed a stream of highest\n joy. The happiness of this home was greatest when they min\u00ac\n gled in the associations of the Savior. To them the Savior was\n the source of joys unspeakable, because he came with all his\n consolations when most needed.\n</p>\n<p>\n That scene is but the type of what the Savior is to every\n home. With his advent comes in the halo of heavenly joy,\n with him as a companion and counsellor, life is stripped of\n its thorns, and clouds appear with their silver linings. With\n the holy principles of the Christian religion, comes into the\n home a charm and glory, which worldly fortune cannot pur\u00ac\n chase. Around him, as the fountain of supreme love may\n gather the loving father, the tender-hearted mother, and the\n silver-voiced children, in the delights of sacred praise. With\n this influence upon the life and character of all within that\n sacred place, the results may be easily measured and the re\u00ac\n wards are plainly revealed. No home is supremely happy\n without the comforts of religion.\n</p>\n<p>\n 18\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0284/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0284/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0284/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0284/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0284/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0284/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0284.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 463907}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"284\">\n<p>\n 266\n</p>\n<p>\n THE FAMILY.\n</p>\n<p>\n Christ still loves to go to the Bethanies where he may find\n loving hearts to appreciate his visits.

Need I stop to say of our subject that\n it is a divine institution, established under the holy shades of\n the \u201c Tree of Life \u201d in beautiful Eden bowers? Yes, such it\n is, based upon the nature, and grounded in the constitution\n of man. Just as every law upon the statute book is enacted\n because of a corresponding fact in human nature. He that\n planted the ear and made sweeter than Aeolian sounds to\n delight it\u2014he who formed the eye and pleasingly satisfies it\n with light, said, u It is not good that man should be alone; 1\n will make him an help-meet for him.\u201d This is the divine\n charter of marriage. And the Savior with the most vivid dis\u00ac\n tinctness set forth the true spirit inherent in this institution,\n as the inalienable right of those entering therein. While\n God made everything good, man has made many things wrong\n \u2014\u201csought out many inventions;\u201d and in this connection,\n the wife has often been made the burden-bearer. Her very\n origin bespeaks diviner rights, than have been accorded her.\n \u201cThey twain shall be one flesh,\u201d thus making her a \u201c help-meet\u201d\n in love and labor. Her creation accords her a holier standing,\n than man has given her in the marriage state. Not as man,\n was she created out of the dust of the earth, but from the re\u00ac\n fined dust of man\u2019s body; not from his head to rule over him,\n nor from his feet to be trodden down, but from his side to be\n his equal\u2014his companion\u2014his help-meet.

Is it not too\n true that just here, many narrow minds have sought out a\n most fiendish invention ?\n</p>\n<p>\n In this regard, marriage is only too often shamefully abused,\n and prostituted to a selfish purpose. The match is made for\n convenience, for social standing, for financial advancement,\n and a host of such conditions, as should never be put in the\n balance as weights and measures, where true happiness is\n sought. These marry, and are given in marriage, under the\n law providing, law of expediency. But is this true wedlock ?\n As well might you expect water and oil, poured into a bottle,\n to become one substance. In seeking matrimonial alliances,\n great care should be exercised, so that in the mutual choice, a\n true counterpart may be found. So many are ever on the\n look-out to find a good husband for their daughters, or a good\n wife for their sons, when the great care ought to be to fit the\n daughters to become good wives, and the sons to become good\n husbands, and under proper advice let their personal worth\n find and secure them a true help-meet. The future character\n of the home can usually be predicated from what preceded the\n marriage day. At the marriage of Juno, the gall of the sacri\u00ac\n ficed animals was cast behind the altar, which said, henceforth\n let there be no root of bitterness between you, only the sacri\u00ac\n fice of love. This is the same advice given lately by a minis\u00ac\n ter to a couple he had just married, when he said u Take two\n bears into your home, bear and forbear.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n If one would have the home an unbroken, happy scene,\n in choosing a life companion, there must be congeniality and\n concord, else how can two walk together unless they be\n agreed. \u201cBe ye not unequally yoked together.\u201d This has\n many sides and need not be dwelt upon. I will only give one\n illustration from life, worthy of being written in letters of\n gold, and hung up in every home.

The\n divine ideal sets these forth best in its spirit of \u201chelp meet.\u201d\n In this each brings to the new home a lighted torch, uniting\n them there in one of deeper flame, greater light, and brighter\n glow.

The facts most abundantly show that monogamy\n is the only safe theory as to marriage; and, hence, in all\n Christian countries, and even in some heathen countries,\n polygamy is forbidden by law. The law, while recogniz\u00ac\n ing that marriage is in the first instance founded on con\u00ac\n tract, also makes the married relation a social and civil\n status , which permanently attaches to the parties as the\n basis of rights and duties, and which, having entered into it,\n they cannot dissolve and destroy at their option. They can\n by contract bring themselves into this relation ; but they can\u00ac\n not absolve themselves from it at their pleasure. The parties\n in all ordinary contracts may terminate them when they\n please; but the law says, and correctly says that the marriage\n contract shall not be dependent merely upon the will of the\n parties. It says to both that the relation once entered into by\n their mutual choice shall be for life, except in those special\n cases which require and justify a sundering of the marriage\n tie by the same authority that declaims its permanency. These\n legal provisions are designed to make marriage what God in\u00ac\n tended it should be, and what the best interests of society de\u00ac\n mand that it should be\u2014the foundation and source of the\n family. A community made up of families based on monog\u00ac\n amy supplies the first condition of its own happiness and\n general good.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, just in proportion as divorces come in to disturb this\n order and break up this arrangement, the power of the family\n to bless society is impaired. Such a ratio of divorces to mar\u00ac\n riages as that which exists in Connecticut, Maine, and New\n Hampshire, and, indeed, in all the New England States, shows\n a sad state of things in the family. One marriage in every\n ten ending in a divorce is not the marriage that accords with\n the design of God, or that is consistent with the best interests\n of society. The question concerns the whole community, and\n not simply the parties who are divorced. Either the divorce\n law is wrong, or it is not properly administered ; and in either\n case the evil is of so grave a character that a remedy should\n be found. Generally speaking the divorce laws of the States\n are far too 1-ax as to the causes for which divorces may be had ;\n and these laws, are made still worse by*the careless manner in\n which courts grant divorce decrees.

SCOTT F. HERSHEY, PH. D., LANCASTER, 0.\n</p>\n<p>\n OYHOOD IN life is like spring-time in nature. It\n is the time for the healthful sunshine, and the\n refreshing shower. It is the time for seed-sowing.\n The Summer for busy growth is approaching,\n to be closely followed by the fruitage season.\n Somehow, there is a close connection between the\n seed and the harvest\u2014for both are the same in\n character. And, somehow, boyhood is closely rela\u00ac\n ted to manhood\u2014runs into it. The ways of boyhood deter\u00ac\n mine the settled purposes of manhood. The hopes of boyhood\n ought to reach into the purposes of manhood. The purposes\n of manhood comprehend and embrace the habits of boyhood.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is a touching Scripture incident I want the boys to\n ponder over. When Christ was a boy of only twelve years\n of age, his parents took him with them to worship, which is a\n sermon for parents to-day. It was the great passover feast\n that was to be celebrated. When the day for departure came,\n his parents thought Christ was with some relatives, going the\n same road. At the end of a day\u2019s journey they discovered he\n was left behind. Returning, they searched for that boy three\n days among the multitude of that great city. They did not\n find him on the Jerusalem common playing with the town boys,\n nor lounging in the streets, nor in the places of boyish amuse\u00ac\n ments, nor on the places of vice where seductive temptations\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0304/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0304/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0304/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0304/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0304/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0304/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0304.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 668852}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"304\">\n<p>\n THE FAMILY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 286\n</p>\n<p>\n poison the minds of boys, by first veiling their hearts. But\n they did find him in the Temple talking with the wise men of\n the Church ; asking them questions, - and explaining the Scrip\u00ac\n tures of God. In explanation to his mother, he simply said\n that he must be about his Heavenly Father\u2019s business.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are three things that boys ought to learn from this.\n First\u2014That these are the first recorded words of Christ, and,\n as such they are prophetical, and enable us to decide what his\n whole after life would be\u2014always about his F a tiler\u2019s work. The\n man may be seen in the boy. The child is father of the man.\n We can foretell the man of honor and principle from the child\n of honesty and truthfulness. The habits and thoughts of the\n child determine the life and character of the man. Charles *\n Kingsley, when a boy, sat of evenings, on the steps of his\n mother\u2019s cabin and listened to her as she sang the old.English\n bards, and, when a man, he became one of England\u2019s sweetest\n poets. John Randolph said to a friend, U I should have been\n an Atheist, but for the recollection of how my mother used to\n take my little hand in hers, and cause me on my knees,\n to say, 1 Our Father, which art in Heaven.\u2019 \u201d The good man\n must begin with the good boy, just as heaven must begin on\n earth.\n</p>\n<p>\n A second thought on this is, that instruction in divine truth\n is a necessary preparation for service in divine work. The\n Roman youth were schooled in Roman law, that they might\n become good citizens. The German youth were trained in\n military law, that they might become good soldiers. It is im\u00ac\n possible to know what God\u2019s work is, or how to do it, without\n being instructed in God\u2019s law. The boy that carefully reads\n the Bible, is sure to be a busy workman in the Lord\u2019s vineyard.\n William E. Dodge, began the daily reading of the Bible at twelve\n and, from a poor boy, left this earth the grandest Christian\n business man of the land.

A boy that\n is honest from principle, has within his character the pure\n gold of right. Remember, that to be poor, is more frequently\n a blessing than a misfortune. The splendid blaze of genius\n that has lit up the halls of civilization with the beneficent\n light of discovery, invention, and progress, was touched\n to life by those who came from the hut, the shop, and the\n factory. The discoverer of a new world must beg money\n through an old world to undertake his feat. A canal-boy\n becomes a President. A German boy gathering fagots in the\n Thuringian forests for a penny a bundle, becomes the Luther\n who orders Europe to turn half way round to see the God of its\n corrupted faith. The man who mauled-slavery to pieces first\n mauled rails. J. G. Whittier was a shoemaker.

Never mind that; when you get\n older you will see what you failed to see when you were a\n boy. No boy can expect to succeed and get along well in the\n world, who does not respect and obey his parents. Your father\n and mother are very near to you and have done more for you\n than anyone else. They watched over you in your infancy\n and childhood, fed and clothed you, and had many anxieties\n about you. You can never repay them for all they have done\n for you. It is your duty to honor and respect them and do\n all you can to make their old age comfortable. This is Bible\n doctrine.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the next place, be kind to your brothers and sisters. If\n you are always kind and loving to them you can hereafter look\n back with pleasure to the good times you had when you were\n all at home under the parental roof.\n</p>\n<p>\n Third, make good use of your time while you are young\u2014\n be useful and industrious. Read good books. Be sure and lay\n a good foundation to build on, so that when you start for your\u00ac\n self in your life\u2019s work, your super-structure may be founded\n on a solid basis.\n</p>\n<p>\n Fourth, be polite and treat everybody with respect, especi\u00ac\n ally old people. When I was a boy I always loved to be in\n company with old people. If you find persons, who are not as\n well educated as you are, do not make fun or laugh at them,\n but be respectful to them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Fifth, guard against idleness. It is a harsh saying, but only\n too true, that \u201cAn idle brain is the Devil\u2019s workshop.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Sixth, avoid profane swearing. This is not only a sinful and\n wicked habit, but one of the poorest paying habits. What, I\n would ask, does the profane swearer receive for his wages ? He\n has been spoken of by some one as \u201cbitingat a naked hook.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Seventh, avoid also Sabbath desecration, lying and stealing.\n These are an abomination in the sight of God, and a violation\n of the third, fourth, eighth and ninth commandments.

H., when I was a\n small boy, I was in the habit of coming with my father to your\n store, and would slip behind the counter, and I stole little\n things which, I think, would amount to about two dollars. I\n am very sorry, and I want to pay you and ask your forgive\u00ac\n ness. I cheerfully granted his request, but I refused to take\n the two dollars as the poor soul had remorse of conscience\n enough. Boys be honest. No doubt it was hard for this young\n man to muster courage to unload his burden, but by the grace\n of God he was enabled to overcome his shame. I have no\n doubt he asked the Lord to forgive him, but it seemed that he\n was not satisfied until he offered to make restitution.\n</p>\n<p>\n My young friends, I have another matter to present to you,\n and I do this in all kindness: I would most earnestly advise\n you never chew nor smoke tobacco. You may, it is true, justify\n yourselves by saying, \u201c Many good people indulge in this luxury\n and why should we be forbidden?\u201d Now I am not going to\n lecture nor find fault with good old people,who chew and smoke,\n for I, too, once used tobacco. First I smoked, then I began\n to chew. Like many otheis, I thought I had a good excuse,\n which was toothache. But that excuse was not worth much.\n One thing more on this point. Ask your father, who is a\n chewer, \u201cFather would you now advise me to smoke and chew,\n as you have tried it?\u201d He would say: \u201cSon, I tell you as\n an honest father and well-wisher of my children, let it alone.\u201d\n Your father would also likely say: \u201cSon, if I had to begin life\n again I would suffer a few teeth to be pulled out before I\n would enslave myself for life as I have done with tobacco.\u201d\n Once more, there is still a greater evil than the use of tobacco,\n and that is the habit of using intoxicating drinks. Now I\n know what I am talking about. I have lived long enough to\n see the tendency of the modest use of liquor. We have all\n seen the danger. Boys leave it alone, do not tamper with it\n and it will never \u201c bite you.\u201d You must not supjiose because\n some respectable men visit saloons that you may do the same\n thing and suffer no harm. You can easily see what all earnest\n Christians think of this evil. The only safe rule is to let all\n intoxicating drinks alone as a beverage, no matter what the\n examples of others may be.

All society is responsible, to a certain '\n extent, that women have received less literary and scientific\n education than men, and that they have, as a consequence,\n been less cultivated, and have often been afraid and ashamed\n to tell how they yearned for something better and higher.\n We do not contend that women are to perform all kinds of\n work that men do. This would be absurd; but we maintain\n that their mental powers are not inferior to those of men, and\n that, when they perform the same duties that men do, they\n should receive as much pay or more, as they often work under\n more difficulties.\n</p>\n<p>\n It has long since been admitted, as a settled fact, that\n educated parsons make the most successful workmen in any\n pursuit. An education is no hindrance in any calling; but is\n on the contrary a help and never comes amiss. And as this\n is so, parents should give their daughters an equal education\n with the sons, and let them drink freely from the crystal\n springs of science, and letters, and not be compelled from\n childhood to old age to stoop and quench their intellectual\n thirst at puddles. Nature\u2019s casket is full of curiosities, invit\u00ac\n ing the enquirer to come and view her wonders; the diligent\n to seek employment at her door, to dwell beneath her bowers,\n breathe the purity of her atmosphere, to admire the wis\u00ac\n dom of her author in the beautiful consistency of her plans\n and read the lessons written therein.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some may contend that woman\u2019s sphere is at home.

Here the roots of life find\n soil congenial for moral and spiritual development,\n or soil exhausted, in which growth is impossible.\n The prosperity and stability of a great nation rest\n not only on the number, but on the virtue of its\n families. If the home atmosphere is one of Christian devo\u00ac\n tion, the highest moral altitude may be attained; if the reverse\n be true, the lowest depths of degradation, reached. From the\n Christian home will go forth the most useful citizen, and the\n most loyal subject of the Heavenly King; and if we study the\n annals of crime, we will find that most of those who have\n opposed law, offended justice and outraged humanity, have\n been raised in ungodly homes.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the spirit of the greatest candor, let us consider the sub\u00ac\n ject of this article.

Thus\n some of the first elements of religion, obedience and re verence,\n are secured, and indeed the very idea which is found in the\n word family, harmonizes with this. We must not think that\n we can enjoy religion in the family, and secure its benefits, if\n we ignore its conditions. The God we worship has everywhere\n established the law of order.

G. H. LEONARD, A.

What this is, has often\n been pointed out by those who have written upon\n the subject, so that no one need be in ignorance\n respecting the influence which religion has upon\n the well-being of the family. No well-regulated family can\n be without its altar where morning and evening sacrifices are\n offered to God, without serious loss. There can, in fact, be no\n substitute for the family religion. For neither wealth, intel\u00ac\n lectual culture, refinement, natural affection, good manners\u2014\n neither one, nor all combined, desirable as they are in many\n respects, and much as they may be made to contribute to our\n temporal welfare, can make up for the want of religion in the\n family. This is of paramount importance, and should never\n be neglected. The Psalmist well understood this when he\n said \u201c the voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the taber\u00ac\n nacles of the righteous.\u201d They alone have sufficient reason\n to rejoice.\n</p>\n<p>\n Such now being the importance of family religion, it\n becomes a question of deep interest to us all to know how we\n can promote it so as to make it productive of the greatest\n good. To secure this desirable end, there must be a faithful\n discharge of the various relative duties which the different\n members of the family owe to each other. What these duties\n are, may be very readily understood by consulting the Scrip\u00ac\n tures. Let every parent, child and servant, read carefully the\n first six verses of the sixth chapter of Ephesians, where these\n relative duties are clearly presented. The number of happy\n families may be very readily increased by a faithful observ\u00ac\n ance of what the Scriptures enjoin. No one can maintain\n that these duties are properly discharged, without engaging\n in the worship of God in the family.

This is only\n too frequently done. The Scriptures are read with such rap\u00ac\n idity as to divest the service of all solemnity. The prayers\n are also in many instances offered in such a low tone of voice,\n as not to be distinctly heard ; or they are so loud and so long,\n or so very short, that they are not to edification, and fail to\n interest the different members of the family. To make the\n worship of God in the family as interesting and impressive\n as possible, the prayers should always be offered in a solemn\n and devout manner, so as to u worship the Lord in the beauty\n of holiness.\u201d There should frequently be a reference in the\n prayers to the doctrines, precepts, and promises contained in\n the Scripture lesson that has been read. The peculiar situa\u00ac\n tion of the family, as well as the circumstances by which it is\n surrounded, will also always furnish something to give\n variety to the prayers. There is no actual necessity of the\n same forms of expression being repeated every day, and of\n praying for everything at each service.

Its primary and central truth is that\n of unity. And when this unity prevails, there is a sympa\u00ac\n thetic cord which so unites the different members together,\n that when either joy or sorrow touches the heart of one, the\n hearts of all are affected thereby.\n</p>\n<p>\n This oneness is more sacred, and assumes a higher form,\n when all the members of the family are united in the same\n faith, and hope of heaven. Divisions in families, which\n merely refer to the pursuits and avocations of life, as when\n one member is a mechanic, another a merchant, another a\n farmer, a physician, a lawyer, or a minister, are not only not\n material, but rather meet the daily wants, and subserve the\n interests of society.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2022 It is different, however, when one is an atheist, another a\n scoffer, and another an humble Christian; as the interests which\n are here involved, are vital, and will peril their happiness, both\n in this, and in the world to come.\n</p>\n<p>\n But why should a family not be united in the faith and\n hope of heaven, when the different members have the same\n great interests at stake. The soul of the one is just as valua\u00ac\n ble as that of the other. They have all been redeemed by the\n same precious blood. They all need pardon, and if pardoned\n at all, they must obtain it in the same way. They must all\n die, and stand before the same judgment seat of Christ.

These elements of character are\n the governing principles, and give to man the\n leading features by which he is distinguished from\n his fellow-men. Observation and reflection give\n abundant proof, and convince us that these influ\u00ac\n ences are powerful agents for good or evil. The various stages\n of life through which we are called to pass, from youth to old\n age, are periods of preparation, one for the other in their order.\n</p>\n<p>\n The golden opportunity comes in childhood\u2019s unclouded\n hours, when the mind is like the unsullied page-^without a\n stain\u2014waiting for the indellible marks, which are permanent\n and lasting, and not effaced by the countless changes of the\n future.\n</p>\n<p>\n The home and fireside influences have a great bearing on the\n future of the child, who is expected to perform some noble\n part in the busy scenes of life. In the very nature of things\n some one occupies a very responsible position in reference to\n the future of the youth, as he goes forth on the ocean of life to\n meet its stern realities. No one stands any closer, nor has any\n one an earlier claim than a mother. She comes forward as the\n first instructor, whose watchful eye is always ready to discern\n any of the needs and wants, and with an ever ready and will\u00ac\n ing hand to provide every comfort.\n</p>\n<p>\n The mother\u2019s influence is incalculable, and deserves the\n careful reflection of every individual, for it lies at the founda\u00ac\n tion of all future work. She not only performs an important\n part in seeing that the daily wants are supplied, but it is hers\n to sow the seeds of moral habits of character and conduct. It\n is in her power to stamp on the mind the impulses which lead to\n usefulness, honor and greatness, or to sorrow, shame, dishonor\n and ruin. Under her influence are those who go forth to fill\n the important places in life, to whom the people look for law\n</p>\n<p>\n 21\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0332/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0332/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0332/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0332/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0332/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0332/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0332.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 592256}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"332\">\n<p>\n 314\n</p>\n<p>\n THE FAMILY.\n</p>\n<p>\n and order, and who are to rule wisely to the glory and honor\n of God.

If we knew\n nothing more of David than the incident here referred to, this\n would of itself be sufficient to give him an immortality of\n f ame.\n</p>\n<p>\n The conduct of David suggests very important lessons, as\n we must also sooner or later die. Death, we are told, is the\n common lot of us all; for it is appointed unto all once to die.\n The king and the peasant, the young and the old, the rich and\n the poor, the learned and the ignorant are all on a level in this\n respect. Hence we should all endeavor to improve the occa\u00ac\n sion which thus presents itself in giving such counsel and\n admonition to our children and friends, as may be of service to\n them when we are dead and gone to our reward. It has often\n been the case, that a few words spoken by a pious father, or\n mother to their children when about to die, requesting them\n to fear the Lord, and endeavor to meet them in Heaven, have\n been followed with the happiest consequences. Children\n recollect and treasure up the last words of fond parents, and\n regard them as a precious inheritance. And it has often been\n the case, that the last words of dying i riends have been blessed\n of God to the conversion of those who had hitherto resisted all\n the influences brought to bear upon them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Death is always to be viewed as a very sad event, separating\n us, as it does, for a time at least, from those to whom we are\n allied by the ties of affection, and with whom we have lived\n very pleasantly, in some instances, for many years.

An existence is begun which no power is\n able to annihilate\u2014an existence which will either\n last forever in the joys of a heavenly home, or be\n banished forever from the presence of the Lord.\n Christian parents recognize their responsibility in\n view of the above fact, They accept the trust\n which God has given them, pressing it to their hearts with the\n prayer that his Almighty arms may be under and about the\n child. Those who have experience in these things, realize\n their inability to perform aright this responsible duty. To\n them the call of Jesus is most cheering, ;t Let them come unto\n me, for theirs is the kingdom of heaven; \u201d and trust that with\n divine help, they may be able to perform this duty to God and\n their children.\n</p>\n<p>\n On what a slender thread hangs the earthly life of a little\n infant! The law of God and man hold parents responsible\n for this life. God has also given them reason and judgment\n which should be properly exercised, in the trust committed to\n them. As much harm is often done through ignorance, par\u00ac\n ents should seek the best information available, and be pre\u00ac\n pared to meet their responsibility.

Several\n branches of the Christian church regard it as a sacrament;\n while this may be correct in so far as the Avord sacrament means\n a sacred oath , it is not correct in the sense in which Protestants\n hold the two sacraments enjoined by Christ, the head of the\n church. And yet while it is incorrect to class it among the\n holy sacraments of the church, it goes very far to show that it\n is calculated to make a solemn impression upon the mind when\n looked at from its divine side. The deep signification and the\n solemn relation of the family could not well receive a greater\n sanctification than that conferred upon it by our Lord in using\n it to set forth and illustrate his church. He seems to take\n delight in calling himself the bridegroom, just as if by that\n position it was regarded an honor to Him, and then the church\n is the bride, she is said to be brought to the king, the bride\u00ac\n groom, adorned in the raiment of fine needle-work.\n</p>\n<p>\n This union between Christ as the bridegroom and the church\n as the bride, is calculated to impress the family relation with\n deep solemnity, and where the marriage is in the Lord, as God\n intends it to be, and the Apostle commands it, the union\n between husband, wife and children is an emblem of Heaven\n itself. The natural, or the church militant, together with the\n entire natural universe is but a visible reflection of the super\u00ac\n natural. The family in the Lord is a perfect compact, a com\u00ac\n plete unit and a striking illustration of the prayer of our Lord,\n \u201cThat they all may be one, as thou, Father art in me, and I\n in thee, that they also may be one in us.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This oneness, for Avhich our Lord prays so fervently, is as\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0344/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0344/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0344/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0344/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0344/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0344/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0344.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 616765}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"344\">\n<p>\n THE FAMILY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 326\n</p>\n<p>\n indissoluble, when once formed, and so constituted by the\n power of God, as the Godhead itself, and is intended for a\n revelation from God to teach us the nature of the plurality ot\n the persons in the Godhead.

Then marriages were\n brought about and consummated in the courts of Heaven, and\n were made indissoluble. In those days of patriarchal sim\u00ac\n plicity when the human family was less contaminated through\n the influence of corrupt legislative enactments, childhood did\n not cease at a certain age. The relation between parent and\n child continued until terminated by death. And if the child\n was married and became the head of a family, this did not\n sever the relation to the parents.

This is hope, blessed hope, the child of patience\n and experience; the plant by which we are saved, because it\n maketh not ashamed, since the love of God is shed abroad in\n our hearts by the Holy Ghost which is given unto us.\n</p>\n<p>\n We next come to charity, the fairest plant ever seen by\n man or angel, which Paul immortalizes in the thirteenth\n chapter of his Epistle to the Corinthians. But right here by\n the side of charity is another plant which seems as modest as\n the violet, as lovely as the rose, and as pure and sweet as the\n lily of the valley. What is it? No one, it seems, can tell.\n Let us, therefore, call the gardener, to come and explain its\n name and qualities. He comes and requests the parents to\n call their children to come and see this flower also, and learn\n how valuable it is in every calling in life. What did he call\n it? I hear the children ask in voices as sweet as the angels\n have, and the gardener and the parents answer in concert,\n u Courtesy,\u201d in a voice more charming than sirens ever sung,\n and as the melody lingers upon the air, and seems loath to\n leave a place so heaven-like, courtesy bows and smiles, and all\n the other flowers in the garden become more fragrant and beau\u00ac\n tiful than before, and the Lord of the garden says, \u201cMy courte\u00ac\n ous little beauty, yonder by the side of charity, is making a very\n eden out of my garden.\u201d Since courtesy has taken her place\n by the side of charity and began to bloom, all the other plants\n and flowers have become more attractive.

I do not know anything that has\n encouraged me more in laboring for children than\n my experience in the inquiry room. In working\n there, I have found that those who had religious\n training, whose parents strove early to lead them to Christ,\n have been the easiest to lead towards him. I always feel as if\n I had a lever to work with when I know that a man has been\n taught by a godly father and mother, even if his parents died\n when he was young. The impression that they died praying\n for him has always a great effect through life. I find that such\n men are always so much easier reached, and though we may\n not live to see all our prayers answered, and all our children\n brought into the fold, yet we should teach them diligently, and\n do it in love. There is where a good many make a mistake\n by not teaching their children in love\u2014by doing it coldly or\n harshly. Many send them off to read the Bible by themselves\n for punishment.

Children want the same\n kind of food and truth that we do ; only we must cut it up a\n little finer, so that they can eat it. I have great respect for a\n father and mother, who have brought up a large family, and\n trained them so that they have come out on the Lord\u2019s side.\n Sometimes mothers are discouraged and do not think they\n have so large a sphere to do good in as we have, but a mother,\n who has brought up a large family to Christ, need not consider\n her life a failure.

It is a true exponent of the character and quality\n of the life of home\u2014it is its unbiased commentary. The\n child\u2019s character is the public proclamation of the private life\n of the family circle. The life and spirit of every home is the\n atmosphere in which the child constantly lives, it feels every\n power and force of its home, and it would be passing strange\n if living and unfolding under such circumstances it would not\n receive most lasting impressions therefrom. Even the granite\n rock is worn by the constant dropping of water upon its sur\u00ac\n face. How much more, therefore, is the child\u2019s character\n .influenced and moulded by the constant pressure of the home\n life, especially since its nature is so pliable, and it is ever in\n its character reaching out after new impressions and is so very\n imitative in its disposition. The child is thus daily gathering\n from the never-ending supply of home influences, its brick and\n mortar, u its hay, wood and stubble,\u201d and building its own\n character for time and eternity. After all, the deeds and acts\n of our maturer years are, generally speaking, the fruits of the\n planting of childhood\u2019s days, so that the responsibilities resting\n upon parents are very weighty. The old truism is full of\n force, saying: \u201cFrom the home to school, from school to the\n church, from the church to Heaven.\u201d But whilst this is the\n golden pathway of life, how many parents live so utterly\n neglectful of the best and highest interests of the children.\n It is only too manifest that to the majority the future, for\n weal or woe, has not its. proper weight or controling influence\n in shaping the life and character of those so near and dear to\n us. The moral and spiritual life of to-day is the true back\u00ac\n ground of the character of the next generation. How very\n important that the powerful influences of home should be of\n such a quality that our sons and daughters may be fully\n equipped for life\u2019s great conflict. The power of the truth as\n felt in the home, as the rich dews of Heaven constantly drop\u00ac\n ping around the family circle into the young and tender hearts,\n is the master wheel that moves on and up to lasting good,\n both in church and state. A nation\u2019s morality is never above\n the average moral sense of the citizens of the families.

But\n dear reader, can you justly blame the fire for burning when\n the fuel is dry and very combustible\u2014can you with any right\n blame the sun-beams for warming the earth and making it\n bloom and blossom? Can you blame the water for seeking\n its level ? Until you can, do not be too severe on the evil doer\n until you see where the blame lies. We speak of the evils of\n intemperance and the curse of gambling in all its forms, but\n who is to blame ? The hog that loves to wallow is not of\n choice going to forsake the mire. And the inebriate will clutch\n as with death-grip the flowing bowl, and the gaming table will\n hold spell-bound all its devotees. I lay the blame of the\n existence of these wide-spread evils at the door of those who\n pretend to abhor them. Do we not lack the moral courage of\n our convictions on these all important questions ? If all Chris\u00ac\n tians would work together and lay aside all selfishness and\n stand forth boldly along the line of truth, right, and the highest\n good of all, they could throttle these vices and make our law\n makers wise and our laws a terror to evil doers. And the\n influences of our homes have no small part to play in prepar\u00ac\n ing a generation who will boldly stand for right and truth,\n and lift the nation into a higher plain of life. The Spanish\n have a saying, that u an ounce of mother is worth a pound of\n clergy, and an ounce of life a ton of professionso that the\n home is here presented as the place where the true estimate\n put upon everything is brought to light, and impresses for good\n or ill all its occupants. The experience of that nation taught\n it the value and influence of the mother in the formation of\n the character of the nation. The elements of honesty, sobriety,\n industry, and a fine moral sense in the people not only secure\n economy in government, but also guarantee peace, happiness\n and contentment. It does not require a palatial residence to\n make a good home in its highest sense. Only too frequently\n such ornamented structures are the very prisons of misery\n wretchedness and moral death, whilst the unpretending cottage\n or cabin is the centre of good cheer and contentment, and\n becomes a power for good.

GEO. W. WILL1ARD, D. D., TIFFIN, 0.\n</p>\n<p>\n E HAVE all been so constituted as to need some\n amusement or recreation to satisfy the promptings\n of our nature. \u201cAll work and no play,\u201d it has\n been well said, \u201c makes Jack dull all the day.\u201d\n Hence it has been common in all ages, and among\n j all nations to have in connection with the ordinary\n pursuits of life, certain sports, and diversions,\n which differ according to the tastes and culture of\n the people who practice them. The ancient Greeks, who sur\u00ac\n passed all the nations of antiquity in culture and refinement,\n had a great variety of games, which consisted in running\n races, boxing, Ac., which were celebrated at certain seasons,\n and were largely attended and participated in by persons\n occupying the highest social positions. The same was true of\n the Romans and other nations of antiquity, all of which had\n their peculiar customs and amusements. And, although the\n world has in this as other respects, greatly changed, so that\n few of the sports and recreations of former times have come\n down to us in their original form, yet others have been substi\u00ac\n tuted in their place, such as ball, card-playing, croquet, danc\u00ac\n ing, checkers, pic-nics, excursions, Ac., which are now observ\u00ac\n ed and practiced with as much interest and delight as were\n those of antiquity, showing that something of the kind is\n necessary to meet the wants of our nature.\n</p>\n<p>\n If we go into families living side by side, in the same neigh\u00ac\n borhood, we find a great diversity of amusements practiced\n by the children* and youth, making it often a very difficult\n question to determine which are the most innocent, least\n objectionable, and best adapted to afford the recreation needed\n for the healthful developement of our nature, without leading\n to dissipation and excessive indulgence.\n</p>\n<p>\n That parents need to exercise great care and prudence as to\n the recreations which they introduce into the family for the\n amusement of their children, so as to adopt the best possible\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":

With them education means nothing more than a\n professional training, a training for business pursuits, a train\u00ac\n ing that will enable their children to cany on their craft or\n occupation more successfully in life. In this sense an educa\u00ac\n tion means only a livelihood, material success and welfare in\n this life. Such a view of education is beneath our dignity.\n It is equal to saying that all of life is but to live. This life is\n made to consist too much in the development of our material\n resources and the enjoyments they afford rather than the cul\n ture of heart and soul, and the richer joys flowing therefrom.\n Education naturally implies teaching the active, living instruc\u00ac\n tion of human teachers. Many are the means employed, but\n above all stands the living teacher. It is mind in contact with\n mind, heart glowing upon heart, soul enchanting soul, that\n arouses thought and fosters thinking. The soul is not wholly\n self-developed, neither is it moulded like the clay, but requires\n the active co-operation with the teacher, who acts as an\n awakening and quickening influence upon the thought.\n</p>\n<p>\n Childhood is the important period in the cultivation of our\n powers. The child\u2019s education is begun in the home. Here\n are started tendencies that will tell in after years. Fathers and\n mothers, whether you will or will not, whether for weal or for\n woe, you are your child\u2019s first teachers. Nowhere else is the\n relation between teachers and taught so close as between parent\n and child. At no other time are the powers more tender and\n plastic, fuller of health and vigor, and at no other time will\n the impressions received, be stronger and more lasting. It is\n your privilege to weave into their lives feelings and thoughts,\n noble, rich and beautiful, that will make their after years\n happy and good. Or it is yours to plant the seeds of a blighted\n life. With few exceptions its little craft is turned toward\n heaven or hell before the child goes out from home.

It\n is well, therefore, to have some \u201cyearly festival for all the\n family \u201d\u2022 connected with the house of the patriarch of the clan,\n and when we heard, as we did the other day, of preparations\n being made for an assembling of sixty relatives beneath one\n roof of this Thanksgiving occasion, we were exceedingly de\u00ac\n lighted, and saw in such a fact the promise of good to the com\u00ac\n munity. Home is the center of our social life, and, if its\n sanctions are destroyed, or its attractions weakened, or its as\u00ac\n sociations degraded, everything else in the land will suffer;\n while its place is maintained among us, and the members of\n our families are knit together in love, and sympathy, and\n union to the Lord Jesus, everything else will come right,\n almost as a matter of course.\n</p>\n<p>\n So, to-day, let us rejoice in home. It is the place of tender-\n est affection. What tie so strong as that which binds husband\n and wife together, when they are to each other as they ought\n to be! They learn each other\u2019s ways, make allowances for\n each other\u2019s failings, strengthen each other\u2019s weaknesses, and\n solace each other\u2019s sorrows: As the years revolve over them,\n dropping their snows upon their heads, they seem to become\n parts of each other, and there are many households among us\n in which the beloved grandam, if she had but voice enough,\n might sing with all the tenderness and sincerity that beautiful\n lyric, which seems almost the apotheosis of old age, u John\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0387/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 157, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0387/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 314, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0387/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 628, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0387/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1257, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0387/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2514, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0387/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0387.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2514, "levels": 6, "size": 568571}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"387\">\n<p>\n THE FAMILY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 367\n</p>\n<p>\n Anderson my Jo John.\u201d Blessings on both the \u201c frosty pows \u201d\n to-day, for it is from scenes and homes like those that the\n true grandeur of a nation spring.

P. C. PRUGH, BUTLER, PA.\n</p>\n<p>\n HILDREN ARE the legitimate offspring of the\n family; hence, their natural place is in the\n family. By the ordination of their Heavenly\n Father, they are, from the beginning, as much in\u00ac\n cluded in the family, as their parent. They are\n the body; children are the members. They are\n born, not into, but in the family. This is their\n normal condition. Outside of the family, they\n are \u201cbastards, and not sons.\u201d This being so, it is easy to see\n that the proper place for rearing and training children is in the\n family. No other institution, however, beneficent and kind,\n can assume to itself the right and authority to do this work,\n nor can the responsibility be shifted from the family. He who\n instituted the family from the beginning, knew well how to\n farm it. Hence its restriction to a comparatively small num\u00ac\n ber. Although, children among the Hebrews were regarded\n as an heritage from the Lord, yet rarely, if ever, were so in\u00ac\n creased, as to make the support and proper education of the\n children burdensome. Sometimes, however, in the providence\n of God, families thus legitimately constituted, are broken up.\n Parents are bereft of their children, and children of their\n parents. In the first case the family is only partially destroyed.\n In the latter, the destruction becomes complete; only the\n limbs of the family tree are now left. These may be grafted\n into other stems, and thus have their union with the family\n again, at least partially restored, or they may be left to wither\n and die, as they sometimes are outside of and away from the\n vital nourishment of family life.\n</p>\n<p>\n Children bereft of parents are called orphans. In this con\u00ac\n dition, cut off from their original source of life and support,\n they are beyond all conception, the most helpless. Without\n the throbbing heart of a father to feel for them, and the loving\n breast of a mother, upon which to nestle, their destitution\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0396/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0396/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0396/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0396/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0396/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0396/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0396.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 600857}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"396\">\n<p>\n THE FAMILY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 376\n</p>\n<p>\n seems to be hopeless. No father\u2019s house! No home! No\n counsel to guide untoward feet! Among the Jews, the\n greatest possible calamity that could befall children was to be\n left fatherless. But in the midst of such destitution, our\n Heavenly Father nlade ample provision for them. Natural,\n as well as many heathen religions, teach society to rid itself\n of all such parasites; being so utterly helpless, and with\u00ac\n out the ability in their present state, to add anything to general\n good, society is taught to throw off the incubus by any means\n it may desire. Hence, in countries, where no higher law\n governs, than mere self-preservation, orphans, with their\n widowed mothers, are often cast upon the funeral pile of their\n deceased fathers; or, if allowed to live at all, they became\n mere servants of masters cruel, and selfish. But the religion\n of the Bible, unlike all other religions, bestows special care\n upon orphan children. No richer display of God\u2019s love has\n ever been exercised towards any of his creatures than that\n which shows itself in his care for the orphan. One of the\n special marks of Jehovah\u2019s character is, that in him the father\u00ac\n less findeth mercy . The Bible is full of the brightest prom\u00ac\n ises given to them. False gods of the heathen are usually\n notable for their cruelty, but our God is \u201c A Father to the\n fatherless, in his Holy Mount.\u201d Hardly had he given the law\n upon Mount Sinai, than he made special provision for the\n fatherless. The Lord pitieth all them that fear him, even as\n a father pitieth his children. But he seems to have treasured\n up special tenderness for orphan children. This is his law.\n \u201c Ye shall not afflict any widow or fatherless child.\u201d u If thou\n afflict them in any wise, and they cry at all unto me, I will\n surely hear their cry ; and my wrath shall wax hot, and I will\n kill you with the sword, and your wives shall be widows, and\n your children fatherless.\u201d And, as if to show still further\n how near to his heart lay the cause of the orphan, he enacted\n special laws for their sustainance, as in the case of the insti\u00ac\n tution of the tithe. Not only the Levite, because he had no\n part, or inheritance with the other tribes, but also the widow\n and orphan were to have a share in it. \u201c And the Levite, and\n the fatherless and widow which are within thy gates shall\n come and eat and be satisfied.

These are two-fold. The\n family and the orphan home. Of these the family is the first\n and highest. There are always some exceptions to the general\n order. There are families in which no children are born, and\n there are families from which all the children have been re\u00ac\n moved by death. Into these God incorporates the fatherless.\n And, although, only adopted, they nevertheless, here find\n again their legitimate place.

These institutions are sometimes established and sup\u00ac\n ported by the state, sometimes by societies, sometimes by\n individual effort, but most frequently by the church.

No one can be indifferent to it as it is one\n of those questions which will every now and then\n intrude themselves upon our minds, whether we de\u00ac\n sire it or not. And, although we may not be able to\n give a satisfactory answer to it, the very mysteri\u00ac\n ousness of the subject will invest it with such\n interest as to make it impossible for any one to\n treat it with indifference.\n</p>\n<p>\n At first view we might suppose the question,\n What is life ? easy of solution, as there is nothing\n of which we are more conscious than that we live. We feel\n the presence and energizing influence of life in every part of\n our system, in every lnotion of the hand and foot; in every\n thought we think, in every word we speak, and in every act\n we perform. But as soon as we attempt to grasp this myste\u00ac\n rious entity which we call life, and define in precise language\n what it is, we are utterly confounded.\n</p>\n<p>\n Such, however, is the inquisitiveness of the human mind\n that it has made various attempts to tell us what life is. One\n has defined it as matter organized, another as a property of\n protoplasm, whilst a third tells us \u201cit is the outflowing of\n some inner, some higher, some altogether unbodily force;\n that it is more subtle than the subtlest power we can detect\n in nature, swifter than light, and more impalpable than the\n ether, abiding even when what you call the vital forces have\n worn themselves out and have ceased to act; it is the beam of\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0402/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0402/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0402/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0402/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0402/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0402/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0402.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 615851}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"402\">\n<p>\n LIFE.\n</p>\n<p>\n 382\n</p>\n<p>\n another sun than that which sustains our system and gives\n strength and activity to everything connected with it; it is a\n voice not heard in the rustling leaves, or where the sea-waves\n break upon the tawny sand.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n But how little do such and similar definitions help us to\n understand what is meant by life, for we still ask in the face of\n all that has been said, What is it ?

I\n knew not how to answer his last question as I did not clearly\n comprehend its meaning. He saw my embarrassment and as\n if to afford me the opportunity to ask more definite questions,\n said, \u201c Shall we turn to the grassy earth, to the hills, vocal\n with songs in the depths of their ancient woods, to the babbling\n brooks, to the rivers, meandering along their green banks ?\n Or shall we look to the sea, that with giant arms encircles the\n globe, where verdant isles stretch far beneath the tropics ?\n Or shall we go where mountains of ice glisten? Or to the\n burning sands of the desert ?\u2022 All! All these are overflowing\n with life. Millions upon millions of beings swarm through\n earth, air and water. But all this is not life.

Is it not good for you to learn that it is vanity to\n act like the butterfly going from place to place sipping sweets\n from things perishable ? Were it not better to go to the foun\u00ac\n tain of life for pleasure? I see you are disappointed. You\n expected to have been made acquainted with great wisdom.\n But beware fond youth, nor vainly inquire into the mysterious\n future, nor think if the wisdom of this be denied you, that\n you are deprived of true bliss, which finds perfection in\n supreme knowledge.

It is the period\n most favorable to lay the foundation for a pure,\n useful, and beautiful life. There is something of\n innocence upon the youthful face, as the index of\n a corresponding comparative innocence within.\n The shadows of sin are not put so dark upon the\n countenance nor its stains so deep in the heart. The stream\n of life, like all streams, is purest and freshest near the foun\u00ac\n tain. The life of the young scion is fresh, healthy, beautiful,\n and vigorous in its early growth. He looks forward to promi\u00ac\n nence, and visionary air castles float in clear skies and bright\n sunshine before his youthful imagination. He launches his\n trusting bark on life\u2019s troubled sea; he has no fears, he\n suspects no danger, and glides on as gaily and unconcernedly\n as the morning birds fly in the summer air above him. But\n treacherous shoals and hidden rocks lie in his way. His very\n gladness and hope have lulled him to an unsafe repose. His\n eye is not quick to discern the appearance of danger, yet it is\n near him. Storms of temptation are already strong about him,\n driving him towards the fatal reefs along which have dashed\n and wrecked many a gallant bark\u2014the breakers of an over\u00ac\n mastering ambition, or of a raging and ruinous lust. The\n ideals of his imagination suddenly assume the shape of dry\n reality, and the experience of a celebrated philosopher (Fichte)\n in early life, is the experience of many now. He said : u I\n started out with my head full of grand projects, which all burst\n one after another like so many soap-bubbles, without leaving\n me so much as the froth.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Life\u2019s morning is its loveliest season.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Heaven lies about us in our infancy!\n Shades of the prison-house begin to close\n Upon the growing boy.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 26\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0416/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0416/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0416/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0416/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0416/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0416/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0416.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 662294}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"416\">\n<p>\n 394\n</p>\n<p>\n LIFE.\n</p>\n<p>\n Every word and action receives a beauteous hue from the\n fresh breath and dew of early day.

The flowers by the wayside may be beautiful, the\n scenery may be enchanting, the music of the gay and frivolous\n may entice the ear; but the earnest soul must be willing to\n toil now, that it may accomplish its mission and enjoy the\n reward beyond. This steadiness of purpose, unwavering de\u00ac\n cision, and willingness to labor on amid sunshine or in storms,\n in adversity or in prosperity, is indispensible to success. Trials\n may prove heavy at times, but these may be turned to real\n blessings in disguise. They may bring out the mental quali\u00ac\n ties and foree of soul that could have been brought out in no\n other way. They may teach lessons of wisdom the benefits\n of which may be experienced through life.

The man that\n returned the one talent without having used and increased it,\n was cast out.

While the child grows in\n stature, the mind also develops and in its determinations and\n ideas becomes gradually more fixed and settled. When\n the period of manhood is entered upon the past feelings and\n intentions are, to a great extent, superceded by those that are\n more staple and real. Childhood and youth live largely in\n fancy, and are made up of ideals which are never realized.\n The man often is amused at the fancies of the child, yet\n remembers that he too once lived in the same world of unde\u00ac\n veloped thought\u2014and indeed looks back upon that period of\n innocent life as the most pleasant of all. The body and the\n mind are both in a formative state, and are gradually approach\u00ac\n ing the goal of their full maturity, which being reached, the\n period of manhood commences. What his impressions and\n advantages are at this point will depend very much upon the\n preceding periods of life. The training of the past usually\n determines the trend of manhood.

Sometimes\n the after-life makes up what has been lost by a defective train\u00ac\n ing ; but such cases are the exceptions and not the rule.

At this point also other forces begin to show\n themselves\u2014though these can only be seen in the general\n conduct of the man. The buoyancy of youth has given place\n to a serious and calm consideration of the higher claims and\n duties of life. The expression of his face gives evidence that\n he is endeavoring to solve the problems of life as they present\n themselves. He lives in the present, but has his face turned\n toward the future, endeavoring to anticipate what is in store\n for him. By the care which he thus exercises and the energy\n which he displays, must his character be determined, so far as\n the physical life is concerned. He puts his will-powers to the\n test and determines what his standing shall be in society.\n Noble aims and ends, pursued with unflagging energy, will give\n a man an honorable standing among his fellows. In this every\n man must determine his own destiny. The child, with its\n undeveloped will-powers, cannot control its actions as the fully\n developed man can.

They are often so woven together in our own\n nature, in our families, in our friends, in the community, in\n the Church, in civil government, in the world, that it becomes\n exceedingly difficult to separate them, to choose the good and\n cast the bad away. We must know, discriminate, decide,\n accept some things, and reject others. But this process often\n becomes very painful and embarrassing. The stoutest heart\n may here hesitate or fail.\n</p>\n<p>\n If there were no sin in the world, there would be no per\u00ac\n plexities. But sin entangles us in many anxious thoughts,\n and strange straits. Our ignorance brings care and perplexity.\n No man knows every thing. We come into the world know\u00ac\n ing as it were nothing. Almost everything is to be learned.\n And only after much effort and worry do we learn the\n simple lessons of life, how to be good, useful, and happy. This\n u much study which we undergo to free ourselves from igno\u00ac\n rance and prejudice \u201d is a weariness of the flesh.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our weakness brings us care and perplexity.

J. S. SHADE, SUMMUM, ILL.\n</p>\n<p>\n HE DESIRE of a happy life is universal. And yet\n few, comparatively speaking, adopt the right\n method to make life happy. By life we mean the\n present state of existence, the period between\n birth and the grave. Life, however, is not mere\n existence or length of days, but real and legiti\u00ac\n mate enjoyment.\n</p>\n<p>\n How is life made happy? Not necessarily by the accumu\u00ac\n lation of great wealth. u For a man ' s life consisteth not in\n the abundance of the things which he possesseth.\u201d A man,\n though poor, may have greater comforts and more happiness\n in thirty years, than a rich man destitute of the grace of God,\n has in three score years and ten.\n</p>\n<p>\n Neither is it self-gratification, nor yielding to the bidding\n of the human will, that makes life happy. The soul is spiritual\n so that carnal things do not suit its nature. That which is\n adapted to the needs of the soul and satisfies its longings, is\n infinitely more precious, satisfying, permanent and abiding\n than earthly treasure.\n</p>\n<p>\n Life is a race, a journey, and in order to be a happy, pleasant\n and enjoyable journey, it must have a right beginning. A trip\n across the continent to some distant city, must be right in its\n commencement and direction, otherwise it will be darkened\n with clouds of doubt and uncertainty. Lif e can only be happy\n when its beginning, its middle and its end is in Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our present life does not terminate our existence. Death\n does not end all, for when it occurs we enter upon another\n state of being that will have no end. Hence, in order that our\n life in this world may be happy, we need the assurance that it\n will end well, and that we will be greeted with the words,\n \u201c Come ye blessed of my Father.\u201d We all desire to have the\n end better than the beginning, especially the end of our life as\n to this world.

The power of sin is\n overcome and Christ lives within. The gospel is obeyed. The\n sacraments are held as the divinely instituted means of grace,\n and Christ is faithfully served in the use of the means of\n grace. In a happy life prayer is not neglected, the cross is\n taken up and borne daily. Make your life happy with a\n pleasure that never wears out,Avhich is^the pleasure of doing\n good.

The\n best method of moral training, and soul-culture, are the vari\u00ac\n ous vocations which require physical or mental labor, or the\n two combined, so as to make man a unit of energy. Neither\n the mind nor the body works without the aid of the other.\n They are dependent upon.each other, and, together, they con\u00ac\n stitute a man\u2019s power for conquest of position and pre\u00ac\n eminence.\n</p>\n<p>\n Physical labor depends upon the mind to plan, invent,\n direct and perfect the engagement in advance of the real fin\u00ac\n ished work. To work well is to think right. The mind\n governs the body. Since the body is the prime motor every\u00ac\n thing depends upon it for progress. Physical labor is, there\u00ac\n fore, necessary and all-important to produce a sound, healthy\n physique; to develop bone and muscle, broad shoulders and\n deep chest, over which should tower a well-balanced brain.\n Manual labor brings health to the body by producing pure\n blood, and normally developing the parts and organs.

When the body is rejuvenate with health\n and vigor, only then is the mind capable of producing its\n purest thought. Some men look with disgust on their trades\n as mean and low, but a man becomes interested in labor just\n in proportion as the mind works with the hands. Intelligence\n gives dignity to work, and educated laborers will give dignity\n to their toils. An enlightened farmer, who looks intelligently\n on his work is a much more cheerful, as well as a more digni\u00ac\n fied laborer, than he whose whole life is the same dull, un\u00ac\n thinking, unimproving toil. It is the man who determines the\n dignity of the occupation, not the occupation which measures\n the dignity of the man. A man is just what he makes of him\u00ac\n self by force of application and by resistance of difficulties.\n No greatness or goodness is worth much unless tried in these\n tires.\n</p>\n<p>\n In mental labor the mind depends upon the body for its\n support. While the mind works the body must feel and stimu\u00ac\n late the organs of sense and the faculties of the brain to quick\n and lively perception. There must be physical energy before\n there can be mental results. There must be bone and muscle\n produced as a base for the magnetic nerves and the electric\n brain. They are of the highest importance, and can only be\n produced by vigorous toil and a proper development of the\n body to its normal state. Therefore the physical and the\n mental endowments matured constitute the man, and his toil\n and activity make him an energetic unit.\n</p>\n<p>\n The benefits derived from labor are many and various, and\n may be properly classed under the four divisions of physical,\n intellectual, social and moral. Under these are realized and\n enjoyed all the embellishments of civilized life. A man well\n balanced in these has vouchsafed to him all that can be en\u00ac\n joyed in life, and is on the road to eminence, dignity, and\n true happiness, and will be the recipient of the divine\n benediction.\n</p>\n<p>\n Physically, man is so benefitted that he becomes an inde\u00ac\n pendent unit in his life\u2019s struggle for existence. He works\n himself into line with the survival of the fittest.

A miser is neither sociable nor\n liberal. The indolent man is never liberal, and because he is\n not benevolent he does not aid the interests of society. In rest\n from weariness there is healthful vigor and a lively kindness\n of disposition. In recreation from earnest labor there is affa\u00ac\n bility, and a pleasure to sociability.

For many reasons, it is well that it is so.\n Farmers, as a class, are among the most quiet, good and law-\n abiding of our citizens; they are not easily changed in feeling\n and conviction ; the great vices of society are not so prevalent\n among them as in most other classes of our population; they\n are so situated in life, as to be encouraged thereby to think\n and act for themselves with manly independence, and are\n almost universally imbued with a noble patriotism.\n</p>\n<p>\n Farming is an honorable occupation, because of its divine\n origin. Whatever God commands must be honorable. To till\n the soil, or do any other work in obedience to the decree of\n God, is to be a laborer under the great Master of all things,\n and to devote our days and energies to the fulfillment of divine\n purposes. Some men would have honored God far more by\n the good and successful life they might have spent upon the\n farm, than by the poor life they have actually lived elsewhere.\n And yet, perhaps one of the chief reasons why so many young\n men forsake the farm for other pursuits in life is because they\n have the vain idea that some profession or some business\n would be more honorable. Let them read the first few chap\u00ac\n ters in the Bible, and see what was the very first and God\n commanded occupation of mankind way back in the beauty\n of Eden u dressing it and keeping it,\u201d as well as earning their\n bread in the sweat of the face and tilling the soil, when thorns\n and tares sprung up as the awful harvest of the curse.\n</p>\n<p>\n Again, in this country especially, agriculture is the basis of\n the nation\u2019s wealth and prosperity. See how they change with\n rich or poor harvests! See how not only the tiller of the soil,\n but also the business man, the professional man, the laboring\n man, the capitalist, all anxiously ask, u How\u2019s the wheat,\u201d as\n the snow and ice of winter clear away, and the first spring\n shower and warming sun tell of the financial future! Who\n could ask to be more closely and honorably identified with the\n nation\u2019s wealth and prosperity, with the interest of business\n life, and with the joy and bounty in the homes of the mechanic\n and artisan?\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0457/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 157, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0457/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 314, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0457/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 628, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0457/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1257, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0457/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2514, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0457/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0457.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2514, "levels": 6, "size": 534310}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"457\">\n<p>\n LIFE.\n</p>\n<p>\n 433\n</p>\n<p>\n Many of the most honored names on the long roll of Ameri\u00ac\n can fame are closely linked with farm life and work. George\n Washington, the most noble name in the world\u2019s patriotism\n and manliness, was the actual owner of a farm of 8,000 acres\n of land, half of wdrich was tilled under his own direct super\u00ac\n vision. One of the last arduous acts of his life was to write a\n long letter only the week before he died, directing his super\u00ac\n intendent at Mount Vernon in even the details of his large\n farm. Thomas Jefferson invented the side-hill plow. Daniel\n Webster owned two farms, and when the end of life was\n sensibly drawing nigh, he gladly went to his Marshfield farm,\n spending his last days amid the lowing of his favorite cattle,\n viewing the broad fields and died in the peaceful quiet of that\n country home.\n</p>\n<p>\n Farm life has many advantages. No other pursuit in life\n brings men into more close and constant intimacy with nature.\n From nature man learns most useful lessons, and the whole\n life of the farmer leads to reverence, love, purity, honesty and\n manliness.\n</p>\n<p>\n Farming is also a healthful occupation. To plow the soil,\n break the sod, tread in the soft, mellow soil of mother earth,\n breathe the pure air and eat the fresh, invigorating products\n of the farm, to toil in the sunny days and enjoy the quiet rest\n of the nights on the farm, are the true elements of real health,\n which is worth more for the joy of life than riches or earthly\n station. The farmer has the added advantage of being enabled,\n by his very situation, to rear his children largely free from the\n contamination of city vices.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the course of a public address at the dedication of a great\n college years ago, Horace Mann, that distinguished New Eng\u00ac\n land educator, asserted that, if all the vast outlay of money,\n time, labor and talents expended in building and equipping\n that college would result in saving only one boy from a bad\n life, it would amply justify that lavish expense, ^.friend,\n who had been rather surprised at this bold assertion, soon took\n opportunity to ask Mr. Mann if that had not been an extrava-\n gent statement. u No,\u201d answered the noble man, who had\n such ample ideas of the true worth and value of even one\n mind and heart and life, \u201c no, not if it was my boy, that was\n saved.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":

It is what\n the Bible calls u walking in the way of a man\u2019s heart, and in\n the sight of his own eyes.\u201d One man, for example, is entirely\n absorbed in making money. When this becomes a greedy\n appetite, the money-lover must pay for it with daily anxiety\n and worry, and he runs the fearful risk of being eaten up with\n covetousness. A greed for wealth grows with years.

What a fare that old millionaire had to pay for travelling\n farther and faster than others on the road to wealth! It\n shrivelled up his very soul. Gold may be a useful servant,\n but it is a cruel master. It is not easy to own it without its\n owning us. Where one man makes it a rich blessing to others,\n thousands make it the ruin of their souls. Love of money\n drew Lot to the fertile valley of Sodom, and he u paid the fare\n thereof\u201d in the destruction of his family. Love of money\n made Gehazi a knave; he \u201c paid the fare \u201d in an incurable\n leprosy. Love of money was one of two sins for which Judas\n paid with the suicide\u2019s rope, and everlasting infamy. No man\n can make money safely and wisely, unless he holds his earn\u00ac\n ings as a trust from God. What would it profit you to win the\n wealth of an empire, if you should pay for it the price of your\n undying soul? u What shall a man give in exchange for his\n soul?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Into no road do young persons press more eagerly than the\n road to sensual indulgence.

The beautiful but ill-\n fated girl from New Jersey, whose tragical end once awakened\n such a universal thrill of horror, may have taken only one\n false step at first. But how far that led! It requires but one\n step to go down Niagara. She paid dearly for yielding to\n temptation, for the end of which was death.

Man does not live by bread alone. He has\n wants and aspirations of soul which are as real and pressing\n as those which are physical. His nature, w r hen true to itself,\n seeks communion and fellowship with God, and gives utter\u00ac\n ance to its wants in prayers and acts of worship, so that men\n everywhere observe and practice some form of religion.

The word in its ordinary signification\n means soundness, completeness, wholeness, entire\u00ac\n ty, comprehending all that belongs to true man\u00ac\n hood. As thus viewed, a man of integrity and\n uprightness embraces more than a meek, patient,\n humble, and forgiving spirit, as these are merely\n qualities that go to make up the true man, and may exist\n singly and in an eminent degree, whilst other qualities are\n sadly deficient. It is no uncommon thing to see men cultivate\n one side of their nature to the neglect of the others. With\n some the physical predominates, with others the intellectual,\n and with others again the moral, the result of which is, there\n is no soundness, completeness, nor fulness of character. In\n like manner one quality or grace of the true Christian may be\n cultivated and developed so as to exhibit great strength and\n beauty, whilst the others are left in the background. Moses\n was a man of great meekness, Abraham of faith, Solomon of\n wisdom, Paul of energy and heroism, whilst John excelled in\n love and meekness. As plants differ from each other, and\n stars shine with different degrees of lustre, and as no two\n persons are exactly alike in appearance and disposition, so\n we, in like manner, find a great diversity of Christian charac\u00ac\n ter, with only here and there one that has the completeness\n necessary to constitute uprightness and integrity, which, when\n attained, is the highest style or type of manhood.

And yet, much as they are\n to be esteemed, none of them surpasses an humble, lowly\n frame of mind which is of great value in the sight of God,\n who resisteth the proud, but giveth grace to the humble.\n</p>\n<p>\n But much as there is in humility to commend it, it is like\n the other graces of which the Bible speaks, not as prevalent\n as it should be. Men are much more disposed to be proud and\n think more highly of themselves than they should, than to be\n humble. And yet, although hard to attain and excellent as it\n is, when possessed, it is still within the reach of all, and should\n be sought by all.\n</p>\n<p>\n Not everything that looks or sounds like humility is such in\n reality. Everything that is good has its counterfeit. There\n is a dead faith as well as a living faith, a love that is in words,\n but not in deed and truth, a hope that is vain as well as true,\n a joy that is spurious as well as real, so there is a false\n humility as well as that which is real.\n</p>\n<p>\n What then is the humility of which we speak? It is not a\n smooth, soft form of speech by which we disclaim everything\n like pride or arrogance. This may and often is done where\n pride still lurks in the heart. Nor is it mere self-abasement,\n or abhorrence of ourselves, as they may be the result of\n wickedness and bad conduct on our part. True humility as\n one of the fruits of the spirit, is a feeling that springs up in\n the heart in view of the many sins and transgressions we have\n committed against God, and of our entire destitution of all\n good, in consequence of which sorrow and penitence fill the soul\n with a sense of its entire unworthiness of the divine favor and\n goodness. It is, therefore, nothing that is assumed or put on\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0472/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0472/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0472/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0472/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0472/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0472/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0472.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 597817}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"472\">\n<p>\n LIFE.\n</p>\n<p>\n 448\n</p>\n<p>\n for effect sake, but is a genuine feeling of the heart, causing\n those who possess it to humble themselves in the sight of God,\n and to make no account of anything they do or meriting\n his favor and approbation. The more goodness and excel\u00ac\n lence they may possess, the more humble they are, as they\n regard it all the result of the operation of divine grace in their\n hearts so that they are ready to say with Paul, \u201c It is by the\n grace of God we are what we are.\n</p>\n<p>\n Being one of the graces of the true Christian, it enters\n essentially into his character and pervades his entire life. It\n is not like a garment which he can put on and off at pleasure,\n one day being humble and the next day proud, but is an\n essential part of his being pervading all he says and does. If\n he is rich he does not despise the poor, if learned he does not\n turn aside from the ignorant, if honored he does not look down\n with contempt upon those who occupy the lower walks of life,\n but endeavors to imitiate in all things the Savior, who was\n meek and lowly in heart that he may find rest for his soul.\n</p>\n<p>\n Surely such a frame or habit of mind is of great value and\n importance. No character is complete without it\u2014neither\n riches, learning, fine clothing, promotion, fame, nor anything\n the world calls great, can supply its place. Neither gold, nor\n silver, nor gems can purchase it. It can neither be bought\n nor sold. Like all that is good and Christ-like, it must be\n sought and acquired by each one for himself. No father can\n transmit it to his son, or mother to her daughter, like a jewel\n or piece of property. It is of more value than rubies, nor\n can any one be a Christian without it, for except we have the\n spirit of Christ we are none of his.\n</p>\n<p>\n Humility is also favorable to a life of communion with God,\n who abhors and hates the proud, but delights in those who are\n lowly and tremble at his word. As the valleys take up and\n absorb the rain that runs off the rock and down the mountain\n side and so produces a rich and abundant harvest, so the\n showers of divine grace falling upon the humble find a genial\n soil, refreshing and invigorating them, whilst the hearts of the\n proud are not affected thereby and remain barren and hard.\n Well did Jesus say of the Publican, who humbly prayed, God\n be merciful to me a sinner, that he went down to his house\n justified, pardoned and forgiven; whilst the proud, haughty\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0473/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 157, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0473/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 314, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0473/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 628, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0473/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1257, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0473/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2514, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0473/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0473.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2514, "levels": 6, "size": 425318}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"473\">\n<p>\n LIFE.\n</p>\n<p>\n 449\n</p>\n<p>\n and self-righteous Pharisee received no blessing at all.

They can\n be realized, but they must be carefully and patiently developed\n in order that the very highest possibilities be unfolded to their\n fullest extent. In the acorn lies the possibility of a mighty\n forest oak, but if the acorn be not placed in the proper con\u00ac\n ditions of soil, and rain and sunshine, and thus be develox > ed\n in the slow process of growth throughout the years, although\n it have the plastic power within itself, and have the possibility\n of the full-grown tree, it would still be but a possibility, and\n forever remain a possibility.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the minds and hearts of men lie grand possibilities.

But\n they become such only by development. A wild untutored\n mind is like a piece of wood, useless until it has had the car\u00ac\n penter\u2019s ax, chisel, plane and square upon it. It is simply a\n bundle of possibilities and nothing more. The same might be\n said also of the untutored heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n The formation of character is a life work, and comprises the\n whole period from the cradle to the grave; though the early\n years of life are of the greater importance, since in them the\n foundation is laid on which the super-structure is reared.

The most\n devoted and zealous Christian seems to be borne down with\n the greatest trials, yet from these lives of trial spring forth the\n effulgence and glory of a brighter day. When the storm-cloud\n makes its appearance and the heavens become wild and\n furious, we remember that above those heavy clouds and\n darkened sky the sun shines with all his brightness and glory,\n and here and there we see the luminous clouds as beacons of\n the coming calm.\n</p>\n<p>\n So to the troubled, care-worn Christian there appears a light\n above the terrors through which he is passing, which inspires\n within the breast brighter hopes, and moves the heart toward\n the attainment of higher virtues and more lasting glories.\n When Abraham had passed through the trials of faith and\n was about to sacrifice his only son, there was not wanting a\n ray of light even in the darkest clouds.

These clouds are necessary to prepare the\n heart for higher developments. These sorrows and trials are\n the refining agents, and having passed through them there is\n left the pure heart and the fine gold. These clouds of despair\n in the Christian life are sure precursors of coming light which\n shines even to the perfect day. The Christian\u2019s path lies up\n the rugged mountain, and as he advances beholds at his feet\n the craggy heights and scattered clouds. As he ascends he\n comes to the summit, whence he looks down upon the clouds\n playing beneath his feet, whilst above him shines the unchang\u00ac\n ing light of the eternal day.\n</p>\n<p>\n The pilgrim willingly passes through the dark valley.

In the multi\u00ac\n plicity of \u201c mistakes \u201d that are made by many\u2014\n yea too many\u2014there are likewise those that awaken in the\n reflective and serious mind a feeling of sadness and regret,\n because of the serious and fearful results which follow. Mis\u00ac\n takes of the lips, which are expressed In words may be cor\u00ac\n rected. Mistakes arising from actions before the public eye,\n may in like manner be remedied. The mistakes of youth may\n be outgrown and forgotten.

If death ends all,\n mistakes made in the formation of character would.not be so\n serious. But as there is a life beyond the present, upon which\n each will enter at death, and as the characters here formed are\n unchangeable, there can be no improvement after death.\n Hence any mistake that affects and leaves a lasting impression\n upon the character, becomes serious and demands the exercise\n of caution and careful action.\n</p>\n<p>\n Again ! A mistake made in this life with results reaching\n in the life beyond, becomes wonderfully serious when it not\n only affects him who makes it, but reaches out and leaves its\n baneful effects upon others who perhaps might have made life\n a success if they had not been brought within the reach of this\n mistake. How often parents\u2014perhaps thoughtlessly\u2014make\n a mistake of this class, by improper reasoning and wrong-\n influences, in aiding their children in the formation of their\n character. When reason, observation, conscience and holy\n influences call for the child to be brought to him, who said :\n u Of such is the kingdom of heaven,\u201d they say, \u201c too young.\u201d\n Oh, w T hat a sad mistake is contained in these two w T ords. They\n are not too young for ' the enemy of souls to look after and\n even ruin, but \u201ctoo young\u201d for the care and service of the\n Son of God. A mistake is again made when the parent says:\n \u201c I\u2019ll wait\u2014,\u201d for while he is waiting Satan is earnestly at\n work, sowing the seeds, the fruit of which when gathered is\n death. Your waiting may bring sorrow and grief to your\n heart, gray hairs to your head, and a premature grave. Do\n not, therefore, make this mistake. If you love Christ and his\n church, if you appreciate holy and right influences, if you love\n your child, let it come, yea bring it to Christ, and in this no\n mistake will be made. No one can make a mistake by bring\u00ac\n ing children too early to Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mistakes are, again, often made by young men and women\n in delaying to secure the influence of the spirit of Christ to\n aid them in the formation of character. They think they will\n lose the pleasures of life if they become the . disciple of Christ.\n This is a mistake.

Yea, has he pointed out the skele\u00ac\n ton behind your door, at which you became offended? If so,\n you have made a mistake in so doing. Is church discipline\n to rigid for you ? This is also a mistake.

Literally\n there is nothing hid that shall not be displayed\n before the eyes of angels and men. We have\n no secret-chamber, where our motives may se\u00ac\n curely hide themselves ; no dark cellar where\n they can be concealed from the light of day. There is\n not earth enough on this globe to cover them, and if they\n were buried beneath the mountains, the mountains would tell\n the tale of what was buried in their bosom. Upon the purity\n of the fountain of conduct depends the lasting effect of our\n lives. It is very necessary that man\u2019s understanding should\n be right, that his will should have its proper place, and every\n part of his being, be in a healthy condition; but if the true\n end of life is gained, we must begin at the beginning, with the\n heart, for out of it are the issues of life. If this world were\n the Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end of our lives,\n then other aims and purposes might receive our devoted pur\u00ac\n suit, but life is opposed to death.

The\n tears that were caught in the lachrymatories\n brought up from Herculaneum and Pompeii are all\n gone, and the bottle is as dry as the scoriae of the\n volcano that submerged them. Not so with the bottle in\n which God gathers all our tears.\n</p>\n<p>\n First I remark that God keeps perpetually the tears of\n repentance. Many a man has awakened in the morning so\n wretched from the night\u2019s debauch that he has sobbed and\n wept. Pains in the head, aching in the eyes, sick at heart\n and unfit to step into the light. He grieves not about his mis\u00ac\n doing, but about its consequences. God makes no record of\n such weeping. Of all the million tears that have gushed as\n the result of such misdemeanor, not one ever got in God\u2019s\n bottle. They dried on the fevered cheeks, or were dashed\n down by the bloated hand, or fell into the red wine-cup as it\n came again to the lips, foaming with still worse intoxication.\n But when a man is sorry for his past and tries to do better\u2014\n when he mourns his wasted advantages and bemoans his\n rejection of God\u2019s mercy, and cries amid the lacerations of an\n aroused, conscience for help out of his terrible predicament,\n then God listens; then heaven bows down; then scepters of\n pardon are extended from the throne; then his crying rends\n the heart of heavenly compassion; then his tears are caught\n in God\u2019s bottle. You know the story of Paradise and the\n Peri. I think it might be put to higher adaptation. An angel\n starts from the throne of God to find what thing it can on the\n earth worthy of being carried back to heaven. It goes down\n through the gold and silver mines of earth, but finds nothing\n worthy of transportation to the celestial city. It goes down\n through the depths of the sea where the pearls lie, and finds\n nothing worthy of being taken back to heaven.

D. WINTERS, D. D., DAYTON, OHIO.\n</p>\n<p>\n HE LIFE of man may be and often is variously\n viewed, so that we may speak of it as a journey,\n a pilgrimage, a battle, a warfare, a dream. Or we\n may divide it into epochs, such as infancy, youth,\n manhood and old age, corresponding with the divi\u00ac\n sions of the year, according to which we speak of\n the spring tide, summer, autumn and winter of\n life. And although we may not be able to draw the line that\n divides one period from another, telling just where the one\n begins and the other ends, the periods themselves are clearly\n marked and well defined. All know that infancy is the\n period of helplessness and dependence, during which the child\n has to be fed, clothed and taken care of by the parents, being\n able to do but little for itself. Passing from this to youth all\n is changed. The body and soul with all their powers are now\n so developed and strengthened that life opens joyously, and is\n taken up with the sports and amusements, builds air-castles,\n dreams of the future, and lays the foundation for what is to\n follow. Manhood is the period of action and conflict, when\n the stern realities of life are to be met and its great work done.\n As the season of fruitage in the natural world follows the\n spring and summer, so the period of manhood is but the out\u00ac\n growth and full development of his former life. He now\n chooses a profession, settles down to business and provides for\n himself and those associated with him the comforts and con\u00ac\n veniences of life. Passing from manhood to old age, man\n reaches the period of comparative rest and enjoyment. His\n powers now, however strong they may have been, gradually\n grow weaker, and admonish him of the near approach of\n death, when he must leave the scenes and friends of former\n years all behind and pass to that bourne from which no traveler\n ever returns.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is a question often asked which of these periods in the life\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0509/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 157, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0509/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 314, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0509/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 628, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0509/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1257, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0509/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2514, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0509/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0509.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2514, "levels": 6, "size": 1057671}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"509\">\n<p>\n llow old art thou?

I think, how beautiful is spring! And when\n the summer comes and covers the trees with heavy foliage and\n singing birds all among the branches, I think, how beautiful\n is summer! When autumn loads them with golden fruit and\n their leaves bear the gorgeous tint of frost, I think, how\n beautiful is autumn! And when it is sere winter and there is\n neither foliage nor fruit, then I look up and through the leaf\u00ac\n less branches, as I could never until now, I see the stars shine\n through. This is the blessed privilege of age. The young\n look forward with bright hopes through blooming flowers and\n opening buds of promise, the middle-aged are so engaged with\n life\u2019s work and toil that they do not look beyond the thick\n foliage that droops around their cots, imparting its cooling\n shade and pleasant breezes to fan their feverish brows; and\n when life\u2019s autumn brings forth its golden store, when chil\u00ac\n dren\u2019s children climb upon the knee, and when the crisp air is\n laden with the harvest song, and the reapers of life\u2019s golden\n grain return with many sheaves, the heart is then so full that\n youth seems to return again with lively hopes.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The thoughts just expressed, whilst they may not answer\n to the satisfaction of all, the question, which perio4 of life is\n most desirable, are nevertheless very suggestive and give food\n for profitable reflection to all concerned.\n</p>\n<p>\n To many, especially the young and pleasure-loving portion\n of mankind, old age, as they look through the summer and\n autumn of life, has a very sombre appearance, seeming as\n black and dreary as winter itself, from which they recoil and\n often wish it might never come to them.

The sacred word refers to the Garden of Eden,\n and to Adam and Noah as gardeners. Moses represents gar\u00ac\n dens as \u201clocated by the riverside, having cedars by the\n waters, and the whole land watered by the foot as a garden of\n herbs.\u201d The hanging gardens of Babylon and Nineveh are\n described. Homer sings of the gardens of Alcinous, adorned\n with its trees and vines, full of flowers and fruits at the same\n time. Virgil, in his Georgies and Bucolics, treats at length\n of horticulture as it was more than two thousand years ago.\n He describes most of the shade and fruit trees known to us.\n He speaks of the ivy, acanthus, poppy, marigold and violet.\n He teaches the propriety of grouping plants and trees, and\n adorning gardens with fountains and statuary. Charlemagne,\n in the eighth century, established gardens for improvement\n in horticulture, prescribing by royal edict the plants which\n should be reared in them. Castle and convent gardens in the\n middle ages were numerous. At the present day, the differ\u00ac\n ent nations express their love for the beautiful in gardening.\n</p>\n<p>\n Horticulture is doubtless the most elevated and elevating\n pursuit known to the civilized world. In embarking in the\n culture of fruits and flowers, we approach nearest to the\n threshold of primeval purity and innocence.

Therefore,\n we who were created to have the care of, and the dominion\n over, every living thing upon the face of the earth, should\n consider with attention the plants and flowers around us, how\n they grow, how varied and eloquent they are, with what\n exquisite skill they are fashioned and adorned, the rich and\n delicate perfume they emit, and learn with profit the lesson\n they teach.

The more interest taken in horticulture\n the greater the increase of the love at home. There will be\n no danger of the boys and girls wishing to leave such homes\n for the over-crowded cities and towns. If they are properly\n educated, they can enjoy the influence of good society in the\n country as well as in the city. There is not a farm so small\n that a yard filled with shrubs and shade trees would not\n beautify. There is no other class of men who have it in their\n power to make their homes home-like by trees, shrubs, and\n flowers so easily and cheaply as the farmer. In this beauti\u00ac\n ful land of ours, this land of wood and prairie, hill and dale,\n the All-wise Creator has Carpeted this vast extent of country\n with a mantle of green, and bespangled it o\u2019er with myriads\n of floral gems. Therefore, as we clear away the forest and\n plow up the prairie, thereby banishing the beautiful flowers,\n trees, and vines from their native haunts, let us bring them\n to our homes and plant them in our yards and gardens, that they\n may be perpetuated; that we and our children, in the heat of\n the day, may enjoy the cool shade of the trees, and at even\u00ac\n tide listen to the sweet murmur of the wind among the\n branches; that we may behold with admiration the exquisite\n beauty of the flowers, and inhale with delight their delicate\n perfume, and learn with profit the lesson they teach.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0518/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0518/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0518/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0518/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0518/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0518/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0518.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 548543}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"518\">\n<p>\n 492\n</p>\n<p>\n LIFE.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Then make your home beautiful\u2014bring to it flowers.\n</p>\n<p>\n Plant them around you to bud and to bloom;\n</p>\n<p>\n They will give life to your loneliest hours,\n</p>\n<p>\n And also bring light to enliven your gloom.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then shall it be, when afar on life\u2019s billows,\n</p>\n<p>\n Wherever your tempest-tossed children are flung,\n</p>\n<p>\n They\u2019ll long for the shades of the home weeping willow,\n</p>\n<p>\n And sing the sweet songs which their mother had sung.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The special field of activity which we have considered, is\n urged upon you, not only as a pleasant pursuit, but profit also.\n Much might be said in regard to the neglects of horticulture ;\n not only as regards the beautifying of our homes and sur\u00ac\n roundings, but also as respects the cultivation of the luscious\n fruits which Providence has created for our health and\n gratification.\n</p>\n<p>\n In no enterprise is success universal.

Therefore, prepare for\n it. \u201c He that hath ears to hear, let him hear.\u201d The hour\n of death is the hour of the Lord\u2019s coming to bring our life to a\n close, to separate the spirit from the body, and call the soul to\n its tribunal, and fix its state in endless bliss or woe. And, al\u00ac\n though his coming in death will not be visible as it will be at\n the last great day, it is equally important and solemn in its\n consequences, as Jesus has the keys of death and the unseen\n world, and will open the doors of heaven to his people, and\n that of misery to the wicked.

But\n where these bounds are no one can tell; for it is not for us to\n know. To be prepared to meet death should, therefore be the\n first great object of our lives. And, as no one remaining in a\n state of sin is prepared for death, we should ask, what is it to\n be ready for death and in what does a preparation for it\n consist ?\n</p>\n<p>\n The foundation of this preparation is an interest in Christ,\n for, u Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord,\u201d As sin and\n death came by Adam, so righteousness and life are by Christ.\n As our being in Adam is the cause of death in this, and in the\n world to come ; so our being in Christ is the cause of life in\n this, and in the world to come. As our union with the first\n man subjected us to sin and death, so our union with the sec\u00ac\n ond ^.dam can alone secure to us righteousness and life. \u201cI am,\u201d\n said Jesus, \u201cthe life, and am come that they may have life ;\n and he that believeth in me though he were dead, yet shall he\n live ; and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never\n die.\u201d The only security, therefore, against sin and death, is\n faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.

Hence, the great desire of Paul was that he\n might be found in Christ, not having on his own righteousness,\n but the righteousness of Christ, by faith.

Butin what\n does this repentance consist ? Is it a mere desire to be saved,\n a cold, heartless wish not to have sinned, is it sufficient if I\n should sav, \u201c I believe that Jesus Christ came into the world\n to reconcile me to God\u2014I know that God is merciful and\n gracious, and that I shall, therefore, be saved for Christ\u2019s sake ?\u201d\n Or does repentance also imply a radical change of heart, and\n thorough reformation of life ? By regenerating grace, the true\n penitent is formed for glory. God has given a new direction\n to his affection, for he now sees the evil of sin, and sincerely\n hates it. He sees the beauty of holiness, and evidently desires\n it. In these blessed dispositions consist the believer\u2019s habitual\n readiness for death, but it is usual also to speak of his actual\n readiness.

Daily the dole\u00ac\n ful funeral knell admonishes us that our fellow-men\n are passing away from earth to \u201c that undiscovered\n country, from whose bourn no traveler returns.\u201d\n It matters not in what we are engaged, or in what\n direction we incline our steps, the solemn thought\n that death is on our track, haunts us ever and\n anon. And because of the solemnity so naturally\n associated with it, many persons, like Voltaire, have vainly\n tried to banish it entirely from their minds. Death is in the\n land\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c He rides on ev\u2019rv passing breeze,\n</p>\n<p>\n He lurks in ev\u2019ry flower\u201d\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n so that any attempt to exclude the thought from the mind\n will prove utterly futile. On every hand we see the vestiges\n of death, and are made to shudder at the awful desolation it\n has made. On land and water; at home and abroad; by night\n and by day, the arrows of death are flying swift and thick, caus\u00ac\n ing our fellow-men to fall on every hand, reminding us of the\n solemn fact, that soon we will be necessitated to follow,\n and be also numbered with the pale nations of the dead.\n Death reigns without a peer. None can evade his grasp. He\n is ruthless in the extreme, and mocks at human grief. Our\n sighs and entreaties he alike condemns, and lays our vaunted\n glory in the dust. He deprives us of our earthly joys, blights\n our cherished hopes, frustrates our plans, and what is still\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0530/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0530/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0530/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0530/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0530/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0530/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0530.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 631488}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"530\">\n<p>\n 504\n</p>\n<p>\n DEATH.\n</p>\n<p>\n more appalling, severs the most endearing ties of nature and\n friendship.

So also\n the cruel and arrogant monarchs of days gone by, who swayed\n empires, monopolized diplomatic honors, and devoted hun\u00ac\n dreds, yea, thousands of their subjects to death, had to submit\n to the same destiny, their royal-dust now mingling with that\n of the once cringing slave; their boasted splendor and power\n all buried beneath the sod of the valleys.

Very appropriately,\n therefore, is death styled the King of Terrors. As the wind\n drives the chaff, and the flame devours the stubble, so death\n makes sad havoc of the nations. Imagine the countless num\u00ac\n bers that have fallen upon the field of battle, far away from\n home and friends, where their bodies were buried without\n even a rude memorial to mark their silent abode, or were left\n to waste away, or be devoured by rapacious vultures, ever\n watchful for their prey.

It is the question which\n millions have asked time and again, Is there not a single ray\n of hope left us, that the bodies of our dear departed friends,\n now deposited in the silent tomb, will ultimately rise again,\n as the grains of wheat and corn put forth a new life from\n beneath the soil ?

The most\n arrogant apostle of infidelity in our day, feigns to solve the\n problem by saying, \u201cNo, death ends all.\u201d So Voltaire said\n and taught in his day. But alas, when too late, he awoke to\n a consciousness of his delusion, saying, \u201cI have swallowed\n nothing but smoke. I have intoxicated myself with the\n incense that turned my head.

To the two weeping sisters of Bethany,\n at their brother\u2019s grave, Jesus said, \u201cI am the Resurrection\n and the Life.\u201d And what he there declared, he also demon\u00ac\n strated when he raised Lazarus from the dead.

The\n rich and the poor, the young and the old, the\n bond and the free, are here all on a perfect level.\n Of all the millions that have lived during the suc\u00ac\n cessive generations that have come and gone,\n since the creation of man, we read of only two,\n Enoch and Elijah, who have escaped death. No\n amount of care, precaution, or medical skill can\n shield us from this destroyer, who lurks in every part of the\n habitable globe, waiting to carry off his prize. Methusela\n lived 969 years and died, as did all his long-lived cotem\u00ac\n poraries. There is no discharge in this war, for it is appointed\n unto all men once to die.\n</p>\n<p>\n The reason why all men die is because all have sinned.\n Had sin not entered into the world neither death nor any of\n the evils of life would have been felt or known. All would,\n in this case, have been happy, and would have lived for ever\n in perpetual youth, from which we may infer what a great\n and terrible evil sin is.\n</p>\n<p>\n View it in any light we may, death is a sad calamity, of\n which all have an instinctive dread. Yoltaire is said to have\n offered his physician one-half of his fortune if he would give\n him a release from death for six months. There are few who\n do not shrink from death with terror and dismay. Even the\n Christian, for whom death has lost its sting, is not indifferent\n to its approach, but views it with solemn earnestness.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0536/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0536/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0536/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0536/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0536/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0536/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0536.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 618870}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"536\">\n<p>\n 510\n</p>\n<p>\n DEATH.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is reason why death should be thus shunned and\n dreaded. It is in itself a great evil, severing as it does the\n connection which exists between the soul and the body. For\n as soon as it occurs all the members or parts of the body cease\n to act and become motionless. The eye is set and loses its\n vivacity, the blood ceases to circulate, the pulse and heart\n stop beating, the hands and feet are motionless, the senses\n refuse to act, in short all is at an end as far as this world is\n concerned. The body becomes a corpse and is soon com\u00ac\n mitted to the grave, the house appointed for all the living.\n How sad to behold a wreck like this! There is no one who\n can look upon the lifeless remains of a fellow-mortal without\n a feeling of sadness. The very approach of death is affecting.\n</p>\n<p>\n Death also breaks up all the tender relations of life, and\n sunders the ties that bind parents and children, brothers and\n sisters, husband and wife in the tender bonds of affection, so\n that no one dies unlamented. Had Xerxes only thought of\n the sorrow and distress which the death of the five millions\n over whom his eye ranged as he sat upon his lofty throne,\n would occasion, this of itself was enough to cause him to\n weep as he did, knowing that they and he would all be dead\n in less than one hundred years. For who can count or estimate\n the sighs, the tears, the heart-throbs, the groans and distress\n occasioned by the death of five millions of mortals, bound by\n the ties of kindred and affection. And yet sad as the effects\n of death are the stern monster pursues his ravages with an\n unrelenting grasp, hurrying one generation away after another,\n as with a mighty flood.\n</p>\n<p>\n Seeing, therefore,* that death awaits us all we should pause\n amid the hurry and bustle of life, and ask ourselves what\n lessons a thought so solemn and affecting as this should teach\n us? The following suggest themselves to our minds:\n</p>\n<p>\n First, we should never lose sight of our mortality. Nothing\n is more common than for men to banish from their minds all\n thoughts of death in the day of prosperity and hilarity, hoping\n that to-morrow shall be as to-day. It was a wise precaution,\n therefore, on the part of the King of Persia, who had a ser\u00ac\n vant to come into his presence each day, repeating the solemn\n truth, \u201c Darius, remember thou art mortal.\u201d O that we had\n eyes to read the same truth in the faded leaf, the withered\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0537/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 157, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0537/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 314, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0537/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 628, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0537/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1257, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0537/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2514, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0537/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0537.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2514, "levels": 6, "size": 399015}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"537\">\n<p>\n DEATH. 511\n</p>\n<p>\n flower, the broken reed, the sudden deaths, and many changes\n that are ever and anon occuring all around us.\n</p>\n<p>\n Again, knowing as we do, that we must all die, we should\n be intent upon doing the work committed to our hands.

I am to die, although entirely unpre\u00ac\n pared.\u201d A death-bed prayer! It is like the shriek\n of a man suddenly overcome by flames. In the\n history of four thousand years, contained in the\n Bible, we read of but one dying impenitent, who\n was converted and actually saved in the last hour\n of his life. Multitudes will thank God, to the end of time, for\n the story of the penitent thief on the cross. This only narra\u00ac\n tive of its kind was graciously written, and transmitted to\n future generations, that no sinner might ever despair, and\n likewise that no sinner might ever presume. However, the\n dying malefactor is an extraordinary instance of an extraordi\u00ac\n nary conversion, at an extraordinary time. It was an hour of\n prodigies. It was an exceptional day, of exceptional events.\n Never, again, will the world see another such a day. The\n atrocities of Calvary will never be repeated. Were Christ\n again to die the death of the cross, and two thieves again cru\u00ac\n cified with him, then might there be reason to hope for another\n such a royal pardon by our Savior-King. But there is no\n need of a similar miraculous conversion, now that his Messiah-\n ship and the soverignty of his forgiving grace have been so\n gloriously attested. It is an example of what God can do,\n but it is an example without promise. And yet it is to be\n feared that every year thousands go out of the world with a lie\n in their right hand. They look at the broad fact that he was\n saved, and so fancy that they, too, will be saved. They over\u00ac\n look the essential condition in the case. To be saved as he\n was saved, the seeking soul must believe as he believed, and\n repent as he repented. To obtain a like passport to paradise,\n with the dying thief, there must be the utterance of a like\n faith, the feeling of alike sense of guilt, the acknowledgement\n of a like power to save, and the fervency of a like prayer.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0552/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0552/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0552/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0552/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0552/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0552/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0552.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 607104}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"552\">\n<p>\n 524\n</p>\n<p>\n DEATH.\n</p>\n<p>\n The world-famous Boston lecturer, Joseph Cook, when\n speaking of Webster\u2019s death, took occasion to make this cau\u00ac\n tionary remark: \u201cA death-bed repentance is never to be en\u00ac\n couraged before the time, nor discouraged at the time.\u201d All\n Christians accept this statement. It would be folly to cir\u00ac\n cumscribe the bounties of the divine compassion. No mortal\n can tell what God may be ready to do in the hush of the\n dying chamber. Equally wrong would it be to deny the pos\u00ac\n sibility of a death-bed change. But it must ever remain ex\u00ac\n tremely hazardous to expose the hope and success of such a\n change to a death-bed contingency. The various forms of\n death, sudden and otherwise, and distracting pain, loss of\n mental power, unfavorable conditions of mind and body,\n which so often characterize dying moments, are either the\n sealing up of all hope or render the dying one incapable of\n handling or using the means of hope. Certain it is that the\n moral opportunities of life are superior to those of death\n near at hand, and the impenitent assumes an awful risk by\n the dreamy speculation that one dying glance at the Savior\n may repair the reckless waste. Indeed, nothing, on general\n principles, is so thoroughly unsatisfactory as a death-bed re\u00ac\n pentance. While true repentance is never too late, still a late\n repentance is seldom true. A city missionary once kept a\n careful record of two thousand impenitents who were sup\u00ac\n posed to be on their death-bed, and whom, had they died, he\n would have put down as converted persons. The result was\n so disappointing that it almost staggers belief to hear the sor\u00ac\n rowful tale. One , positively only one, afterwards gave evi\u00ac\n dence of a repentance that needed not to be repented of.\n Perhaps, this was an exceptional inventory, nor may it justly\n serve to determine the real average of genuine death-bed\n conversions. But judging from the experience of those w T ho\n closely study human character in its great moral crises, it may\n be safe to estimate that probably only seventy out of one\n thousand, who repent in view of death near at hand, show by\n their lives, when delivered from the fear of death, that their\n repentance was true and trustworthy. Moreover, the possi\u00ac\n bility and the probability of an effectual death-bed repen\u00ac\n tance correspondingly decrease as the unrepentant one is\n more or less advanced in years.

There was no day of grace for us before we were\n born, and their will be no day of grace for us after we are\n dead. The siren gospel of Liberalism teaches the doctrine of\n u another chance \u201d after death. This theory is arrogant, un-\n philosophical, unscriptural. The fascinating fiction of u a\n probation after death \u201d is very congenial to such who would\n do in this life just as they please and after the stream is\n crossed make Christ the scapegoat to bear their sins, the slave\n to work for their exaltation and the unthanked servant to go\n before and open a way of escape from deserved condemna\u00ac\n tion. It does seem as if men who are not willing to use the\n chances of the life that now is, are not worth saving at all\n upon a u second chance\u201d in the life to come. No! the offer\n of salvation does not extend beyond the present world. And\n it is even quite possible for the offers of salvation to termin\u00ac\n ate before life terminates. In such an event a death-bed re\u00ac\n pentance is hopelessly unavailing. Where there has been\n long and persistent resistance of grace, a persevering with\u00ac\n standing of the influences and impulses of the Spirit of God,\n a habitual fighting away of duty and conviction, there is\n great danger, indeed a strong probability, of bringing on a\n state of callousness and incapacitation, which puts the offen\u00ac\n der beyond the susceptibility of salvation. The sinner can\n bring himself into a permanent dissimilarity with God and\n practically end his probation before the time of his death.\n For such there is no room for repentance. In such, the\n advances of grace no longer waken the requisite response.\n There comes, in every one\u2019s history, a moment of spiritual\n crisis, a final turning point, when, once for all, the way the\n man moves, settles his destiny forever.

In some places it was on one day, in others on another\n day. After a time the practice became more general.

It is well that a nation does honor\n those who died while battling for its life and liberty and unity.\n They are worthy of all the flowers that can cover their graves,\n and all the honors which the living can bestow are, after all,\n but a small part of the debt of gratitude which is justly due\n the memory of these heroic dead.

Never was a more costly\n sacrifice made to the principle of civil liberty than the blood\n of American patriots shed twenty years ago. Only twenty\n years ago, in the very blaze of nineteenth century civilization,\n hundreds of thousands of men fought like demons\u2014literally\n like demons\u2014for the right to buy and sell their brothers, nay,\n for the right to scourge and butcher them like cattle ! And if\n there had not been other hundreds of thousands of men with\n equal tenacity of purpose, imbued with a love of liberty and\n a sense of justice, ready to offer their lives in defense of human\n rights, free government would have been wrecked here where\n our forefathers established it.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is plain, then, that liberty is not as cheap in this latter\n day. If it is not buttressed with careful political thought and\n action, it will have to be supported in the future, as in the\n past, by swords and bayonets, and will cost precious blood.\n It is the best blood that is spilled on such occasions. There is\n no gain-saving this. The man who offers his life for his\n country is a braver and a better man, other things being equal,\n than he who avoids the fight. He belongs in the world\u2019s cata\u00ac\n logue of heroes. His dust can never cease to be sacred, for\n he died that other men might live in the enjoyment of the\n peace, quiet, and joy of home.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0571/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 258}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0571/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 322, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 516}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0571/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 644, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0571/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1289, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2065}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0571/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2579, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4131}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0571/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0571.jp2", "height": 4131, "width": 2579, "levels": 6, "size": 550682}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"571\">\n<p>\n DEATH.\n</p>\n<p>\n 543\n</p>\n<p>\n This is an inestimable sacrifice.

Human theories and\n plans of various kinds have been proposed ever since sorrow\n cast its dark mantle over this otherwise happy abode of man.\n and in every instance, after the fairest trial, they have all been\n found wanting. Man has, indeed, .sought the world around to\n find that balm that would heal all earth\u2019s wounds, and has\n only been rewarded by additional disappointment and sorrow.\n Earth cannot afford us the peace for which we sigh. And just\n as long as man turns his eyes to this world so long will his\n search be in vain. Light does not spring out of the earth. It\n flashes down upon us from yon blazing sun high up in the\n heavens. If you would have light to dispel the darkness of\n life\u2019s sorrows, look up to the great source of light and comfort.\n If you would find that true balm that heals all wounds and\n alleviates all sorrows, go to the truest and best of all philo\u00ac\n sophies, the religion of Jesus Christ. All else has failed.\n This never has proven false, but has been found to possess the\n purest peace and most perfect satisfaction for the deepest\n wants of the soul. Millions that have gone before, and mil\u00ac\n lions living to-day, all rise up to bear testimony to the truth\n of this declaration. This, and this alone, comforted them and\n cast light over life\u2019s tempestuous sea, while battling with the\n adverse winds and tides. By this they were able to steer their\n frail barks into the desired haven.\n</p>\n<p>\n But you ask in what particular way does Christianity afford\n us this longed for peace and rest of soul ? It teaches that all\n our troubles and conflicts in life are the result of sin. Sin is\n the mother of all sorrow. \u201c Name me the evil that springs\n not from this root\u2014the crime that I may not lay at her door.\u201d\n Much comfort comes to us, therefore, in knowing that this\n present, troublous state of things is not the result of divine\n appointment. God does not, as a heartless sovereign, send\n these sorrows upon us only that he may delight himself with\n our miseries. They are the direct and legitimate fruit of evil\n in the world.

Instead of\n sending sorrow therefore, he helps us as brave soldiers to\n endure it till sorrow shall be no more. Indeed, the everlast\u00ac\n ing arms are constantly beneath and around us. The faintest\n sigh of the upturned soul here on earth is heard in heaven.\n The great divine heart is but too anxious to manifest its depths\n of love and sympathy to all earth\u2019s sorrowing and struggling\n ones. If we but love and trust in him, he reveals himself in\n the most tender relation to us, teaching us to call upon him as\n \u201c Our Father who art in heaven.\u201d In recognition of this glor\u00ac\n ious relationship, the blessed Master hath said, \u201cIf ye, being\n evil, know how to give good gifts unto your children.

Have we\n not yet learned that there are sweets in adversity? Have\n we not yet known that disappointment is better oftimes than\n success ? If not, we have much yet to learn. The greatest\n concern therefore that we should have in this life of conflict\n and woe, is not so much how we may escape suffering as how\n we may best and most patiently endure it. It should not be\n forgotten that the purest peace of mind and of soul that we\n poor mortals can possibly possess here under the present con\u00ac\n dition of things, is not in being free from trouble, but in living\n with the constant and ever-abiding conviction that the great\n and loving Father is daily and hourly making \u201c our light afflic\u00ac\n tion, which is but for a moment, work for us a far more\n exceeding and eternal weight of glory.\u201d \u201c For I reckon, that\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0580/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0580/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0580/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0580/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0580/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0580/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0580.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 576115}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"580\">\n<p>\n 552\n</p>\n<p>\n DEATH.\n</p>\n<p>\n the sufferings of this present time are not worthy to be com\u00ac\n pared with the glory which shall be revealed in us.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Only believe.

That little word God is a satisfactory explana\u00ac\n tion for all the mysteries in the universe. If we cannot see\n through all our troubles in life, we can be assured that they\n are all under the supreme and immediate control of God; and\n to know that, for the trusting child, is enough.

Some are already\n catching gleams of glory from the approaching day. We\n sometimes think we almost hear the sweet music of the heav\u00ac\n enly harpers. It will not be long.

G. W. REMAGEN, NAVARRE, OHIO.\n</p>\n<p>\n HEN OUR friends and loved ones have closed\n their eyes in death, and we gather round them to\n take a last farewell, we seem to think their voices\n are hushed for evermore to earth. On the funeral\n day our pangs and griefs would not be half so great,\n were it not for the comfortless thought that the\n sweet melody of mother\u2019s voice, the familiar spee ch\n of brother or sister, the joyous greeting of friends we love,\n and the soft lullaby of the infant\u2019s lips, have been silenced in\n the cold embrace of death. It were not half so hard to bear\n the grim remorse of friends departing from our sight, could\n only their voices be heard through the darkening vail that\n hides them from the world. But, alas! the voices that were\n once so dear to us are forever silent and will no more speak as\n once they spake, although there is a constant longing in the\n heart to hear their words as we often heard them when together\n in the world. Probably the constant longing in the heart has\n done much towards giving evidence to the lying vanities of\n modern mediums. But Spiritualists, like the witch at Endor,\n would be shocked and horror-stricken, if by their spells and\n incantations they should cause slumbering ones to awake and\n appear at the summons of such deception and sorcery. The\n voice that once spoke is silent, but the words spoken are re\u00ac\n echoed in the hearts of friends on earth. The words of Patrick\n Henry to this day thrill the patriotic heart with high ideas of\n national liberty. Abraham Lincoln\u2019s voice against slavery is\n heard throughout the length and breadth of this \u201c land of the\n free.\u201d Although they are long in their graves, death cannot\n unspeak their words so fitly spoken. u The just shall live by\n</p>\n<p>\n 36\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0582/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0582/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0582/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0582/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0582/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0582/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0582.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 622420}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"582\">\n<p>\n 554\n</p>\n<p>\n DEATH.\n</p>\n<p>\n faith,\u201d is re-echoed throughout all Protestantism as the favo\u00ac\n rite scriptural text of Dr. Martin Luther.

H. H. W. HIBSHMAN, D. D., TIFFIN, OHIO.\n</p>\n<p>\n EAVEN is to be regarded as the place in which the\n Most High has his abode, and where \u2022 he reveals\n himself in unrivaled splendor, majesty and glory,\n as nowhere else in the immensity of the universe\n to his intelligent creatures. This opinion has been\n entertained both in barbarous and civilized nations\n and in every age. The Greeks and the Komans,\n the Jews and the Christians, believe in a place\u2014a\n heaven\u2014as the peculiar residence of a Supreme\n Being\u2014God; in a place as the special habitation of the good\n and virtuous during an endless future; in a place of felicity\n filled with the brightness and glory of an ineffable God.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is much theorizing in regard to this place and its\n locality. Numerous opinions have been advanced by men\n given to speculation on religious subjects, concerning the\n future abode of happiness. Many of the theories are more\n fanciful than scriptural, and not a few of the philosophical\n opinions are based on hypotheses grounded on passages of\n Scripture that will not allow the interpretation given them. It\n is not our province here to refute false theories and opinions\n concerning heaven, but to set forth such things as are con\u00ac\n firmed by the revealed word.\n</p>\n<p>\n The place of happiness is designated by various terms in\n the Scripture. It is called the Father\u2019s House of many man\u00ac\n sions ; Paradise; the Best that remaineth to the people of\n God; the Father\u2019s Kingdom of light and glory; Eternal Life;\n Everlasting Salvation; the New Jerusalem ; the City, whose\n maker and builder is God. These phrases are synonymous\n and teach unmistakably that there is a place of future happi\u00ac\n ness for the children of God when the conflicts and turmoils\n of this present life are over.\n</p>\n<p>\n This abode of happiness has locality.

It is somewhere\n localized in God\u2019s unlimited expanse.of space. It is a place\n definite and fixed by the Lord God, in which unfallen angels\n and the saints, robed in white garments, dwell. Where this\n place is, it did not please the Lord to reveal to finite beings.\n We speak of it as above our heads, as on the other side, and\n beyond the river of death.

The ten thousand and more attempts made to describe\n it have ever proven futile. It never will be given to man to\n enjoy more than glimpses of it.

Our finite\n mind and imperfect heart do not enable us to grasp\n or realize the blessedness of heaven. Paul says\n that when he was caught up into Paradise, he\n heard and saw things unutterable. John, in his\n apocalyptic vision, tells us he saw a great multitude which no\n man could number, heard them praise God\u2014and saw the\n beautiful city, the new Jerusalem.

Here we have sickness, pain, sorrow, death\u2014a mul\u00ac\n titude of afflictions.

But nothing apart from Christianity can\n give us the hope of regenerating the world. Hence we hail\n with joy its message of peace, and the hope which it instills\n in the human breast of the world to come. Christianity, truly\n and rightly understood, has a direct tendency to give us a\n clearer comprehension of the true object of life, and a deeper\n feeling of the truth in the world to come.\n</p>\n<p>\n Human life is subject to constant changes, from the cradle\n to the grave. Man is borne along life\u2019s billowy ocean, on\n whose bosom there is unceasing fluctuation. Now he is wafted\n upward on the waves of fortune, then plunged to the depth in\n cruel adversity. But let come what may, his soul is not\n frightened at the gloomy contemplation, but rather brightens\n in the hope of heaven, and of what God has prepared for them\n who love him.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is magic in the word heaven to him who entertains\n the hope of a blessed immortality^, however discordant his life\n may be. Man is ever allured onward and upward by the\n spiritual powers and forces implanted in his being. With\n philosophic speculation he probes the mysteries of time and\n space. On wings of fancy he scales the heavens, and filled\n with holy and heavenly impulses, he longs to burst the\n shackles and bonds of sin, and breathe the incense of the spirit\n world, destined to be his final goal.

Only a foretaste of this heavenly\n inheritance is enjoyed in this life. Now we know only in part\n as to the glories of this inheritance; yet in our inability to\n apprehend perfectly as to the height and depth, the length and\n breath of this inheritance, we are not discouraged, but rather\n encouraged to press onward by the thought that \u201c eye hath not\n seen, nor ear heard ; neither hath it entered into the heart of\n man to conceive of what God has in store for them that love\n him.\u201d Yes, the child of God is thrilled with the assurance\n that his inheritance is infinitely greater than his holiest antici\u00ac\n pations.\n</p>\n<p>\n A very superficial view of our surroundings is all that is\n necessary on the part of the true Christian, to recognize the\n fact that \u201c this is not our abiding city.\u201d The power of sin in\n working corruption is on every side made manifest.

The\n crowns of palm leaves that have so often been placed upon\n the victorious have faded away, but that crown which shall be\n placed upon them that overcome, u shall not fade away.\u201d O,\n precious secrets in the life of the faithful. Sweet voice that\n whispers to the weary heavenly pilgrim, unfading inheritance.\n Blessed, blessed, thrice blessed are they that obtain that\n heavenly inheritance.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":

The question is one that naturally pre\u00ac\n sents itself to every thinking mind, and has led to\n much speculation on the subject. The Bible,\n whilst it gives us much information respecting\n heaven, and often refers to the employments of the saints in\n glory, no where reveals to us in exact language all we may be\n expected to do in our heavenly home, so that much room is\n left for conjecture. This much, however, we infer from the\n wonderful powers with which we are endowed, and the wide\n range and scope which they take already in this world, that it\n will not be a life of rest and inactivity. Man was evidently\n designed by the allwise Creator for a life of activity and use\u00ac\n fulness. Labor is not only dignified and elevating, but also\n necessary to health and happiness. The sluggard and idler\n can have no real enjoyment, but spends a miserable existence.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0617/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 258}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0617/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 322, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 516}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0617/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 644, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0617/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1289, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2065}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0617/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2579, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4131}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0617/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0617.jp2", "height": 4131, "width": 2579, "levels": 6, "size": 599944}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"617\">\n<p>\n HEAVEN.\n</p>\n<p>\n 589\n</p>\n<p>\n As heaven is only a continuation of the existence we begin in\n this world, and as it will afford a much wider range for our\n powers than that which we now have, it is altogether presum\u00ac\n able that our future life will be one of much greater activity\n than the present. But in what particular way, or manner this\n activity will be employed we cannot now determine, but must\n patiently wait until we reach that blessed shore to know what\n our employments will be.\n</p>\n<p>\n It has been well said, \u201cIt is not probable in such a universe\n as this that there can be any lack of ample field for effort.\n God has not thrown worlds and systems of worlds from his\n creative hand, peopling universal space with material globes\n for nothing. Those twinkling points of light have some other\n object than to excite the wonder, or task the science of mortals\n on earth. We cannot doubt that God has peopled them all\n with sentient beings of intelligence. If so, there is ample\n enough space in this universe of God for eternal study, even\n though our minds are eternally progressing in capacity, and\n forever enjoy the mental and moral vigor of an archangel. It\n is not probable that launched abroad upon such a universe\n there will be any lack of created things, the study of which\n will forever reveal more and more of God; nor will there be\n any lack of intelligent beings with whom we may have the\n sweet intercourse of mind with mind, and heart with heart.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n But whatever may be the work or service in which we will\n spend our eternity in heaven, it will be eminently one of love\n and praise. Love is one of the mightiest powers and forces\n on earth, giving to honest hearts peace and comfort, and is so\n essential to our happiness, that without it life would be devoid\n of all real enjoyment. It cheers every heart, comforts every\n soul, adorns every home, and imprints Christ-like features\n upon the vicious and rude barbarian.

To the active,\n restless mind there is something attractive about\n a city with its eager throngs, hurrying to and fro,\n on business or on pleasure bent. The larger the\n proportions, the more absorbing is the interest. When I read\n of the New Jerusalem above which the angel measured, find\u00ac\n ing it fifteen hundred miles in circumference, I am impressed\n not only with its great dimensions, but with the vast number\n of inhabitants I conceive it must possess. London with its\n twenty miles of area, and its population of four million has\n something awe-inspiring about it; yet what is that compared\n with the upper city. Our thoughts stagger when we try to\n grasp it. It has been the end of their journey to a mighty\n company of earthly pilgrims, and is the destination of, per\u00ac\n haps, as many more. The philosopher Dick tells us that every\n second fifteen of the children of men pass away.

The other, a spontaneous hope and\n conviction of a heavenly recognition which noth\u00ac\n ing can erase.

And if the Divine\n Revelator speaks but once it is as certain, as if he had said it\n ten thousand times.\n</p>\n<p>\n In our Lord\u2019s parable of the rich man and Lazarus, the\n former is represented in his place of torment as recognizing\n the latter in his state of glory, and even recognizes Abraham,\n though he never knew him personally, but doubtless knew\n him historically as the spiritual father of the faithful.

A co-existent relation\n between the organization of our associations in time, and that\n of our promised association in heaven, is the primary and ulti\u00ac\n mate principle of its development. In the organization of our\n associations on earth we are endowed with peculiar faculties\n and capacities as sacred trusts, by which we can recognize one\n another as friends, and love one another as a part of our own\n nature. Impressions of recognition and affection often come\n upon individuals, as it were, by a secret and unknown cause.\n Yet they come not by chance nor altogether by human thought.\n They are the product of a divine and eternal law, and, though\n they may be modified by a change of circumstances, they can\u00ac\n not be wholly obliterated. These endowments\u2014the faculty of\n recognizing and the capacity of loving\u2014are given us for the\n purpose of promoting mutual confidence, true happiness and\n needful comfort in time, to the end of ultimate and perpetual\n glory. In their proper exercise, and in consequence of the\n attending divine principle which regulates them, they cannot\n but yield the intended fruit.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the organization of heavenly associations the same purpose\n is designed\u2014our perfect happiness and the continued praise\n and glory to God. If these endowments are essential to the\n promotion of these interests in time, is it reasonable to suppose\n that they will be dispensed with in the future ? And, if the\n all-wise Creator saw proper to invest us with these sacred trusts\n to secure a taste of real happiness, and a beginning of a holy\n life on earth, with a longing desire for its continuation after\n death; is it likely that he will deprive us of them on our transit\n from earth to heaven when we have the promise of consum\u00ac\n mated bliss? The two organizations are so intimately con\u00ac\n nected that they are not incompatible with each other. For\n the one only begins that which is to be continued in the other\n in a higher and glorified state.

But here, we may yet see a blessed fulfill\u00ac\n ment of the promise that \u201c all things work together for good\n to them that love good ; for that which causes our greatest\n and deepest earthly sorrow, will possibly minister most glori\u00ac\n ously to our rejoicing in heaven.

When we consider that fully\n two-fifths of the human race die as infants and children, it is\n in their salvation and assured entrance into heaven that we\n can see how it is that, where sin abounded, grace did much\n more abound. Thus it was, as Jesus hung on the cross and\n thought of the myriads of children saved through his redeem\u00ac\n ing grace, that he saw of the travail of his soul and was satis\u00ac\n fied.

Our blessed Savior, in speaking on one\n occasion of the future state and condition of the\n righteous, says, \u201cNeither can they die any more;\n for they are equal unto the angels, and are the\n children of God, being the children of the resurrection.\u201d\n They are all equally angels and saints, the children of God,\n and are perfectly happy in his presence.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are some who, seeing the different terms used in the\n Bible in reference to the inhabitants of heaven, where they\n are spoken of as thrones, dominions, principalities and powers,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0661/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 258}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0661/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 322, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 516}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0661/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 644, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0661/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1289, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2065}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0661/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2579, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4131}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0661/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0661.jp2", "height": 4131, "width": 2579, "levels": 6, "size": 576221}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"661\">\n<p>\n HEAVEN.\n</p>\n<p>\n 633\n</p>\n<p>\n angels and archangels, cherubim and seraphim, spirits of the\n just made perfect, & c., entertain the idea that heaven is a\n kind of hierarchy consisting of a variety of grades and orders\n of being, subordinate one to the other. As the expressions,\n however, which are used in this connection are vague and in\u00ac\n definite we can come to no certain conclusion respecting the\n matter. Augustine, who is regarded as a great light in the\n church, did not venture even an opinion upon the subject as\n may be inferred from what he says: \u201c What difference there\n is between these four words (thrones, dominions, principali\u00ac\n ties and powers) let them tell us who are able, so they prove\n what they tell us ; but for my part I confess I know not.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n As the Scriptures, therefore, make no clear revelation on\n the subject, leaving it in uncertainty, we may conclude it has\n no great practical value, and that it is better for us to wait\n patiently until we enter our heavenly home, when all will be\n made plain to us.\n</p>\n<p>\n The following remarks cover the subject so fully that we\n give them for the benefit of the reader: \u201cWe know that\n there can be no distinctions there, which can gratify ambi\u00ac\n tion ; or, on the other hand, engender jealousy and envy.\n Every one will know and love his own station; will be satis\u00ac\n fied with it, and desire no change. It has been thought that\n the Word of God teaches that some among glorified human\n spirits will be exalted to higher glory than others; and some\n have even maintained the superiority of the saints to the\n angels in heaven. But whether either of these opinions be\n true or not, we cannot think them important, or they would\n have been more clearly revealed, or have received greater\n prominence in the Scriptures of truth. It is more important\n for us to know that the society of heaven will be perfect.\n There will be no clashing interests, no emulations or strifes\n there. Saints and angels will know and love each other, and\n will be perfectly happy in each other\u2019s society. In one sense,\n they will be perfectly equal; they will be perfectly holy, as\n well as immortal. There will be nothing to prevent the\n sweetest intimacy, and the most perfect communion of soul,\n on the part of those who compose \u2018 the whole family in\n heaven.\u201d There will not only be the closest, and most\n endearing intimacy between saints, but between saints and\n</p>\n<p>\n 41\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0662/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0662/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0662/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 640, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0662/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2060}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0662/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2561, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4121}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tr:ea:su:ry:of:fa:mi:ly:00:wi:ll:treasuryoffamily00will:treasuryoffamily00will_0662/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tr/ea/su/ry/of/fa/mi/ly/00/wi/ll/treasuryoffamily00will/treasuryoffamily00will_0662.jp2", "height": 4121, "width": 2561, "levels": 6, "size": 659940}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"662\">\n<p>\n HEAVEN.\n</p>\n<p>\n 634\n</p>\n<p>\n angels.

Differences and distinctions exist in the\n world, and they have been the cause of innumera-\n bles troubles and heart-breakings, but the glory of\n heaven is greatly enhanced by the knowledge, that\n there these are not known. All will be on an equality. Here\n this has not been the case. We have been oppressed, despised,\n disappointed, men have imposed heavy burdens upon us, and\n we have been made to feel that we were insignificant, that we\n had no right which our superiors were bound to respect. Well,\n all this will not be known up there.

To one side we see a mansion. Gardens and groves\n surround it.. Its inmates know only luxury. Every want is\n supplied. They stand aloof from the poor of the neighbor\u00ac\n hood. They dash by them in their splendid equipage with\n haughty look. Upon the other side we see the hut of a poor\n man, the slave of the proud man of the mansion. Everything\n about that hut indicates poverty. The children cry for bread.\n When they are burning with fever, money is wanting to buy\n that which they need. We ask now, will this state of things\n never be righted ? Is the poor man to be poor forever ? Is\n the rich man to Lord it over him for an eternity? No ! No !\n It remains true as ever that u the first shall be last, and the\n last first.\u201d The time will most surely come when the poor\n man shall be rich as his lord, and when the yoke of oppression\n shall be removed from his neck.\n</p>\n<p>\n What comfort would man have in the idea of heaven, if he\n was not assured that there would be an end to all his trials ?\n If he knew that the distinctions now existing would exist for\u00ac\n ever, and that he would be compelled to bear the contumely,\n and scorn of men in another sphere he would rather go into\n oblivion. But this shall not always be. Heaven is a place\n of adjustment. That which has not been right here shall be\n righted there. The mind lingers around that thought. There\n is satisfaction in it. We are living here upon a shattered\n world. A deformed, effeminate race is born here. They live\n here. They oppress each other. They die here. But in\n heaven no damaged thing is found. Everything there is in per\u00ac\n fect equilibrium. The ceaseless unrest of this world is not\n known. Things are just as they should be, and as a wise God\n desires them. How our spirits long for that land when we\n remember the disappointments of this. We can appreciate the\n language of the Psalmist when he sighed. \u201c 0 that I had the\n wings of a dove, for then would I fly away, and be at rest.\u201d\n We wander here as exiles in the darkness, and in the shadow\n of death.

C. F. IvRIETE, A. M., FT. WAYNE, IND.\n</p>\n<p>\n HERE IS no place on earth like home. How\n many joys, comforts and sweet recollections are\n concentrated in this one word\u2014Home? How\n</p>\n<p>\n longingly and affectionately we think of home\n when in distant lands where we must forego the\n sweet pleasures and comforts, which home alone\n can give! How much do we miss a kind father\u2019s\n thoughtful love and a devoted mother\u2019s tender care when\n sickness and trouble overtake us far away from home. No\n period in life, after we have left home to fight our own battles\n in life\u2019s great conflict, will equal in sweetness and beauty the\n time spent in a happy, Christian home in the hopeful spring\u00ac\n time of life.\n</p>\n<p>\n And yet there is no abiding home on earth. All earthly\n homes will at the best only shelter us a few short years. No\n earthly home is perfect; no earthly home can give us com\u00ac\n plete satisfaction; no earthly home is entirely without pain\n or grief or disappointment on account of the lamentable,\n disturbing fact of sin. The awful power of sin has entered\n every home on earth, and brought in its train disturbance,\n unhappiness, separation and death. Since sin came into the\n world and through sin death, no home is sacred enough to\n shut out this last and terrible enemy of mankind\u2014death.\n How many homes have been made desolate by the ravages of\n sin and invaded by the fell destroyer\u2014death, tearing assunder\n all the holy ties, which bound heart and heart together in this\n life, bearing away at one place the ripened fruit, and at the\n other plucking out the tender flower. We have no abiding\n home on earth; we are all pilgrims and sojourners toward\n another country; we stop a little here and a little there, but\n our goal is eternity; we are strangers and pilgrims like all our\n fathers.\u201d u Whither are we going, and what is our God-given\n destiny? Is it only to live a few short days, or months, or\n years, and then to fall back into hopeless nothingness ? Have\n we only been created to die ? and does death end all ?

In the contemplation of\n a subject of such interest and importance, we should approach\n it with becoming reverence and seriousness that we may\n draw from it the inspiration it is calculated to impart. \u201c Let\n us, then, take our stand on the Pisgah of promise, and strive\n to catch through the mists that hang over the stream of death\n some glimpses of Beulah, the beautiful land, and of the Jer\u00ac\n usalem in the midst of it, where is our inheritance, incor\u00ac\n ruptible, undefiled and that fadeth not away \u201d for those u who\n are kept by the power of God through faith unto salvation.\u201d\n There Jesus the forerunner hath for us entered, and thither\n the light streaming down through the rent vail will guide all\n his people.
