What was with him the substance of\n things hoped for is now the evidence of things\n seen. Thousands, and even minions of Ameri-\n cans, who have followed his wii^e4) counsel and\n \u201c gone West,\u2019 5 have laid there tk^jfoiinflfttions\n of mighty industrial empires, and opened, vast\n areas of agricultural and mineral lands as the\n most promising fields for new enterprise and\n immigration on the face of the earth.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Tribune under Mr. Greeley ' s successor,\n Mr. Whitelaw Reid, has steadily kept abreast\n of the westward march of empire. Corre-\n spondence from the Territories has been one\n of the permanent features of its files. On\n seveial occasions experienced members of its\n staff have been sent to the Far West on a\n roving commission to explore localities which\n weie unknown to Eastern readers, and to re-\n veal the wonderful progress made by Ameiican\n (enterprise in developing hidden sources of\n National wealth, and in opening fertile regions\n where hundreds of thousands of thiifty and\n ambitious settlers were finding prosperous\n homes and rapidly getting on in the world.\n The late Z. L. White, for many years the head\n of its Washington bureau, and an accomplished\n journalist of mature judgment, was a pioneer\n in describing the mineral resources of the\n Western mountain ranges, and his admirable\n series of letters did much to direct the progress\n of settlement and to attract reserves of Eastern\n capital to the newer distiicts and more remote\n territorial frontiers. The admission of four\n Northwestern States to the Union this year of-\n fered another opportunity, of which The\n Tribune promptly took advantage. One of\n its most versatile and accomplished staff corre-\n spondents, Lemuel Ely Quigg, was sent to the\n Dakotas, Montana and Washington to record\n the progress which these new Commonwealths\n had made, and to forecast the era of growth\n and prosperity which would inevitably follow\n the acquisition of the dignity of membership\n in the Union.\n</p>\n<p>\n Horace Greeley.\n</p>\n<p>\n This series of letters from the new States\n ha$ ^attracted the attention and commanded\n thfe jdtertst of thousands of American readers.\n Animated and incisive in style, comprehensive\n in-^^cpP 6 \u2019 a ^d candid and vigorous in treat-\n ment,^ it hasljcovered the entire range of human\n activity.- yi^he Northwest, and brought before\n the the picturesque features, local col-\n</p>\n<p>\n on^g-\u2018 > arid characteristic elements of pioneer\n tife-and advancing civilization. In response\n to pressing demands from all quarters of the\n Union these letters are republished in the pres-\n ent number of the Library of Tribune Extras,\n in order that the series may be read consec-\n utively and the information contained in it\n deliberately digested. These letters, as col-\n lected, form a popular handbook on the Da-\n kotas, Montana and Washington of the high-\n est practical utility.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was impossible for our correspondent to\n cover in his itinerary every promising town in\n the new States ; but every important centre\n of industry and population was visited, and no\n section with an existing record of progress as\n well as a future of unlimited expectations be-\n fore it was neglected. The letters deal with\n all the varied industrial interests in every\n stage of development. There is information\n in them for every class of settlers, artisans and\n immigrants ; and the series, as brought to-\n gether and handsomely printed in this vol-\n ume, will inevitably impart a powerful impulse\n to the rapid process of filling up the new States\n with an intelligent and industrious population.\n Nowhere else are such opportunities offered to\n workingmen and people of moderate means to\n make homes for their families where pros-\n perity will await them. The Tribune, after\n laboring arduously as the chief and most in-\n fluential journal of the Republican party to\n secure the admission of the Dakotas, Montana\n and Washington into the Union, has considered\n it a happy privilege to direct public attention\n to them in the most commanding way. It\n issues this volume as an earnest of its good\n wishes in speeding them on their journey to\n prosperity, influence and power.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0004/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0004/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0004/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0004/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0004/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0004.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 753568}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"4\">\n<p>\n 2\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n SOUTH DAKOTA.\n</p>\n<p>\n i.\n</p>\n<p>\n ON THE THRESHOLD .\n</p>\n<p>\n MEN AND THINGS IN A GROWING COUNTRY.\n</p>\n<p>\n EIOTJX FALLS, THE GATE CITY; HER CONDITION,\n HER PROSPECTS, HER HOPES AND\n HER NEEDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sioux Falls, Dakota, April 10.\n</p>\n<p>\n In attempting to picture what the typical\n Westerner, with a fond pride all his own, loves\n to call the \u201c wild and woolly West,\u201d it is most\n appropriate that the beginning should be made\n here where the first settlement was effected upon\n Dakota soil. There are Wests and there are\n Wests, but the \u201c wild and woolly West,\u201d the\n West wherein a solitary teepee or mud-hut grows\n within thirty days into an incorporated city with\n a Mayor and a Common Council, a fire department\n and a National bank, or may be, too, a daily\n newspaper and a university\u2014 this is the great\n Northwest. Its geographical limits are a subject\n of much contention. Minneapolis insists that\n the \u201c wild and woolly West\u201d begins with the\n Falls of Minnehaha, and that St. Paul is not\n in it. St. Paul earnestly dissents from this view,\n and to make her claim the more emphatic her\n newspapers not infrequently start their depart-\n ment of local news with the \u201c .wild and woolly\u201d\n headline.\n</p>\n<p>\n Under these circumstances it would be presump-\n tion to undertake to define the geographical\n boundaries of this delectable region. But in\n Minneapolis I met a man of commercial and social\n prominence who pointed out a handsome block\n of buildings, and said \u201c Isn\u2019t that a noble struct-\n ure ?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It was a noble structure, there could be no\n doubt of that.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c That building,\u201d he continued proudly, \u201c cost\n $500,000\u2014 yes, sir, $500,000! Two years ago\n there was a church there; I\u2019m a member of it.\n It was put up in 1865, and the lot then cost\n us $600. Well, sir, we sold it to the people\n who own that building for $110,000. Then, sir,\n we built us another church for $60,000 odd, made\n our clergyman a handsome present, and put\n $40,000 on bond and mortgage at 8 per cent.\n That, sir,\u201d he concluded triumphantlv, \u201c that\u2019s\n the way we boom the Gospel out here!\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n There was nothing irreverent in this. It\n was said naturally and sincerely, but where\n else under the sun could such a phrase\n as \u201c boom the Gospel\u201d be heard, save only in\n \u201c the wild and woolly West\u201d ?\n</p>\n<p>\n Dakota, all glowing with satisfaction at\n the victorious issue of her long struggle with\n the Democracy in Washington, and with hope\n for her future as one of the members of the sister-\n hood of States, Dakota is astir with one grand\n and mighty boom. You feel it in the strong,\n hearty grasp with which her people take you\n by the hand. You see it in the quick and rest-\n less flashing of their eyes and in every motion\n of their incessantly active bodies. They have\n been a long while, as whiles go in this country,\n malting their opportunity, but they have it at\n last, and they know they have it. ' Settlers are\n coming in by droves every day. Houses are\n</p>\n<p>\n starting up in such numbers that the township\n map of yesterday is useless to-day. Right here\n in Sioux Falls a\u00bb I drow around this morning\n I counted 1 68 new residences in course of con-\n struction, and the ground is being broken for\n more at the rate of a dozen per day. Nor is this\n any evanescent spurt. It is a progressive move-\n ment that has been going on for ten years. The\n city, as it is to-day, has been built within that\n time, two-thirds of it within the last four years.\n One of the most active of its citizens, who built\n the first frame shanty down by the falls twenty\n years ago, who came here when the place was\n a wilderness broken only by a frontier military\n post, and whose cash capital on arrival was 75\n cents, surveyed the city on behalf of the Govern-\n ment, and then concluded to settle. He is now\n the chief factor in a National bank, the owner\n of a score of handsome dwelling-houses, and is\n building at this moment a great block of jasper\n buildings, a one-hundred-thousand-dollar theatre,\n a cotton mill, and a motor street railway. What\n is the use of being surprised at what you hear\n of Western progress and opportunity when this\n is what you can actually see ?\n</p>\n<p>\n On the train coming hither I chanced to meet a\n Western specimen, who struck me then as mon-\n strously amusing. Whether he was really so droll\n as I thought is now a question. He was a very\n \u201c tough\u201d -looking major, with a face of dark\n bronze, mustaches that stuck out far beyond his\n cheeks, a huge slouched hat, an antique and faded\n flannel shirt, trousers that ballooned, so to speak,\n at the knees, and a coat that was old in War times.\n To a group of Eastern men, dudish by contrast\n with him, he was descanting in most extravagant\n terms of the wonders of his country. It was the\n most magnificent land in the world : there never\n was nor could be anything like it; the finest tim-\n ber, the richest soil, the choicest game, the most\n splendid everything ! And, as for the town itself,\n no human language was powerful enough to do it\n even the faintest approach of justice. Curious to\n know where this Canaan lay, I ventured a query.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c It\u2019s in Montana, sir, the Eden of States!\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c What\u2019s the name of the town ?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Buzzard\u2019s Gulch!\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Happy name,\u201d said I. \u201c Many inhabitants ?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Many ? Well, I should say so. There was\n 60T) when I left six weeks ago, and there\u2019ll be\n 900, I know, by the time I get back. We\u2019ve got\n electric lights and a grand opera-house that\u2019ll\n hold the hull dern town!\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Interpreted in the light of the fact that the pop-\n ulation of this Territory is increasing at the rate\n of 500 per day, it wouldn\u2019t be remarkable if the\n claim of the man from Buzzard\u2019s Gulch were hap-\n pily realized.\n</p>\n<p>\n To those people in the East\u2014 and they are by no\n means all dead yet\u2014 who think that the \u201c hardy\n settlers\u201d of this region are in constant danger of\n their lives from Indians, or are subjected to week-\n ly blizzards that take the roofs from houses or\n bury whole villages under the snow, Sioux Falls\n would be a revelation. On the day last week\n when six inches of snow fell in Richmond, the\n thermometer here marked 50 degrees as its lowest\n extreme, and as for Indians, the appearance of a\n red man in Sioux Falls, whence but twenty short\n years ago settlers were driven away, often minus\n their hair, excites universal curiosity. People\n stop on the streets to watch him. Children run\n out from houses to catch a glimpse of him, and he\n is eyed by all and guyed by many as an Arab in\n his native dress would be in the streets of New-\n York. There is but one place in the Territory\n where an Indian can be seen in his natural con-\n ditions without maldng a trip into the reserva-\n tions. At the same time, as I shall hereafter ex-\n plain, the Indian question is all-paramount in\n South Dakota, and upon its solution the prosperity\n of the new State will in the largest measure de-\n pend.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is difficult to comprehend where the social\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0005/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 428}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0005/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 857}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0005/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0005/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3430}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0005/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0005.jp2", "height": 3430, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 739642}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"5\">\n<p>\n SOUTH DAKOTA.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3\n</p>\n<p>\n and commercial forces come from that build up,\n almost before one knows it, these handsome and\n well-appointed cities of the plains. Here, lor in-\n stance, are four large colleges, a State prison of\n the first class, two immense dour mills, gasworks,\n packing-houses, foundries by the score, a deaf-\n mute school, quarries, brickyards, breweries and\n at least 12,000 people, and all these have come in\n ' during a period practically of less than four years.\n The every-day needs of the people are being as\n well supplied here as anywhere else. They do not\n depend on other comm ur ' ties. They get what\n they want, and get it themtelves. The whole town\n is moved by a common impulse. If you have a\n spoonful of honest red blood in your veins, you\n < jan\u2019t help but contribute to the general current.\n Tlu* spirit of push and enterprise has so completely\n taken hold of the people that its effects are felt\n on everything. One man\u2019s interests go because\n -everybody else\u2019s are going. Naturally the class\n of people attracted by these conditions is socially\n and morally superior. Fifteen churches iind no\n difficulty in obtaining congregations, nor the\n means wherewith to erect and maintain costly and\n handsome edifices. The Protestant Episcopal\n Cathedral of All Souls, for which the ground has\n been broken, will be rapidly constructed, and will\n be in every way an impressive structure. This is\n the memorial church which John Jacob Astor is\n building for Bishop Hare, in memory of the late\n Mrs. Astor, whose deep interest in Western mis-\n sions was manifested during her life by many\n beneficent deeds. Sioux Falls is also the seat of\n the Roman Catholic episcopate, and in another\n year St. Rose\u2019s Academy will be in operation under\n Bishop Marty\u2019s personal direction.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nature has been kind to Sioux Falls, in-\n closing the city on all sides the Big Sioux River\n winds in an S-like channel falling from a series\n of magnificent rocks. In a run of half a mile the\n river falls ninety-one feet over six solid wails of\n jasper. A water-power is thus rendered available\n for industrial purposes scarcely inferior to that\n developed by the Falls of St. Anthony at Minne-\n apolis. In the river and in the enormous quartz-\n ite formations that serve as its bed and peep up-\n ward through the earth for many miles around,\n the future prospects of the city are largely found.\n This rock is a pure jasper, and already four large\n firms employing 800 men are at work blasting and\n breaking it for building and paving stones^\n Geologists describe it as a metamorphic rock thrown\n up at least 10,000 years ago. The deposit ap-\n pears to be about 3,000 feet deep and extends\n over twenty-five square miles of territory. Its\n hardness is 6uch that saws make no impression\n upon it whatever. It simply chews them up. But\n that which renders the handling of it cheap and\n enables the quarries here to compete in Chicago\n markets, 600 miles distant, with Wisconsin gran-\n ite, is its quality of breaking to a line, which it\n does as easily and neatly as chalk. With 40 per\n cent of the hardness of a diamond, this jasper\n takes a perfect polish and is used in all the\n Western cities now for ornamental columns,\n pilasters and monuments. Such powerful ma-\n chinery was required to obtain this polish that\n one of the firms handling jasper was encouraged\n to attempt to utilize the petrified wood of Ari-\n zona in the manufacture of chalcedony. Its\n success was so perfect that it cornered the entire\n silicified forest and now works out at its leisure\n wonderful specimens of this agate wood. Its\n smallest blocks contain countless thousands of\n interblended colors, vivid and startling in their\n marvellous richness or pale and faint with the\n daintiest hues. Within a square inch are often\n to be seen the red of the rose, the pink of the\n 6almon, the gorgeous yellow of the salamander,\n the green of a budding wheat-field and the blue of\n an inky sea; and then dying away from these\n milder colors, with perhaps a field of chocolate or\n snowy white to peep through, comes every tint,\n every shade the spectroscope has dreamed of.\n</p>\n<p>\n It goes without saying that Sioux Falls covets\n a capitol. So does every other city in South\n Dakota, and the feeling of rivalry, while in no\n 6euse bitter, runs, nevertheless, high and deep.\n The location of Sioux Falls is against her, so far\n as concerns her hope of becoming the capital\n city. She is to South Dakota what Fargo is to\n North Dakota, and what Omaha is to Nebraska\u2014\n the gate CJiy. Commercially, this is immensely to\n her advantage, for the people of the West always\n buy their goods from a point east of them. If\n Sioux Falls realizes her commercial ambition -and\n there is no reason, with her water-power and her\n easternmost situation, why she shouldn\u2019t\u2014 she will\n be a great point of supply and distribution for the\n State of South Dakota. Yankton will be her\n only very dangerous antagonist. But the Western\n people usually prefer central capitals, and aro\n always loath to give an individual town too many\n advantages. This sentiment will tell strongly\n against Sioux Fails. On the other hand, pene-\n trated by no less than five railroad systems, she\n has a strong, though quiet, influence at work for\n her. I was told in Chicago, and also in St.\n Paul, that the railroad presidents had distinctly\n agreed among themselves not to attempt the ex-\n ertion of the slightest influence upon the capital\n question They may be relied upon, I dare say,\n not to do any active lobbying. But the railroad\n men are only human, and they would doubtless\n look with satisfaction on that placing of the\n capital which wouli not necessitate the extension\n of theic lines. They all come into Sioux Falls\n and into Watertown, and they probably think\n that either Sioux Falls or Watertown would be a\n nice place for the capital.

Aber-\n deen\u2014 all these are struggling for the prize, and\n all are prepared to bid high.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sioux Falls to-day most stands in need of manu-\n factories and wholesale houses. Yesterday a man\n who came here on a tour of inspection from Ver-\n mont toid me he had decided to put up a cotton\n mill immediately. Ex-Senator Sabin has been\n looking around the town for several days, and\n talks quietly aoout a new $250,000 bank. Money\n is lending on improved real estate for 8 per cent.\n Plenty of such loans can be safely made, if\n capitalists look sharp whom they deal with. The\n class of houses now being built in Sioux Falls\n are homes, most of them costing from $3,000 to\n $10,000. The sound of the builder\u2019s hammer is\n heard in every block, and the houses are occupied\n before the paint on their doors is dry. Most of\n them are carrying small mortgages, and the in-\n variable interest is 8 per cent, payable semi-annu-\n ally.\n</p>\n<p>\n The importance of public schools escapes no\n Western community, and in Sioux Falls the peo-\n ple have been liberal and public-spirited to a\n degree unusual even in towns of its sort. The\n collegiate institutions are all under the auspices\n of religious societies. Bishop Hare, to whose\n tireless energy the city is indebted in more pap\n ticulars than those that concern his church, has\n had the College of All Souls busily at work for\n four years. It is a college for young women\n and a grammar school for boys. The Baptists\n have founded and endowed and are successfully\n conducting a university for young people of both\n sexes. All these various church institutions pos.\n sess buildings of a fine type, but none sur-\n pass the common schools of the city, upon which\n money and thought have been affectionately lav.\n ished. A graded system is in operation which\n terminates in a high school course and affords\n the people of Sioux Falls as fair a chance to\n educate their children as can be obtained in any\n ordinary Eastern village.\n</p>\n<p>\n No wonder the people of Sioux Falls wear a\n cheerful countenance. Their city, marching for.\n ward at a pace as steady as it is rapid, is estab.\n lished upon a substantial foundation and is pros-\n perous because it has fairly earned prosperity.\n No one who wants to work is without work, and\n his earning capacity is limited only by his in-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0006/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0006/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0006/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0006/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0006/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0006.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 649258}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"6\">\n<p>\n 4\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n dustry and ability.

He will spread before you whole acres\n of signal service reports showing that the climate\n of Dakota is really that of a Southern State,\n and he will lead you to believe that he intends\n next spring to start an orange grove. He has\n got by heart a set and formal address which he\n fires at you without a halt or a break, full of wise\n statements about the isothermal lines and the\n warm currents from Japan. It appears that\n there is an air current known as the Chinook\n winds specially heated for Dakota somewhere in\n the Indian Ocea ' n, and when the weather gets a\n little chilly the Dakotans turn on their Chinook\n current.\n</p>\n<p>\n Undoubtedly the climate of this Northwestern\n country is much misunderstood in the East, for\n which circumstance the newspaper funny men\n are held responsible. They have done Dakota\n more harm, say the people here, than fifty\n carloads of signal service reports can correct.\n Low temperatures in this latitude are accompanied\n by such delightful atmospheric conditions that\n you rather welcome them. One goes without\n one\u2019s overcoat when the mercury is in the neigh-\n borhood of zero, and feels all the better for it.\n There is little snow or rain, little cloudy weather.\n For ivonths and months together, often for half\n</p>\n<p>\n the year, the sun\u2019s rays will fall unobscured\n through a sky of perfect blue. But when storms\n do come, you want to be ready for them. They\n lose no time. They finish up their work and go\n off as quickly as possible, but they manage to\n put in considerable business while they are at it.\n Southern Dakota is one vast prairie land, with\n only an occasional gently sloping mound, rising\n from ten to thirty feet above the immeasurable\n plain. This is no obstacle to the wind, serving\n only to give a direction and a channel to its\n destructive course.\n</p>\n<p>\n But for several reasons the blizzards are not\n especially minded. Shelter is the only necessary\n provision against them, for here tliev leave no\n such deposit of snow behind them as was left\n by the great Eastern blizzard of March, 1888.\n Here they are a sudden, vicious storm, quickly\n over, and always followed by warm, brilliant\n weather. In the main it is unquestionably true\n that Dakota weather is ideal. Its cold is a dry,\n healthy cold, with pure, bracing air and clear\n bright sunshine. It is not variable. It does\n not begin with a warm glow in the morning, and\n wind up with a dreary mist at night.\n</p>\n<p>\n Next to his weather, the Dakotan felicitates\n himself upon his soil, and he can furnish any\n quantity of proof that it will grow anything. He\n will explain that Dakota was once covered by a\n great continental glacier, which, suddenly thrown\n by a turn the earth took upon its axis from an\n arctic to a temperate zone, melted and produced\n floods, and ran along in their path, grinding down\n the mountains, and leaving the present great\n plains of Dakota strewn with drift. For centuries\n the whole region was one vast lake, at the bottom\n of which mud was precipitated, full of vegetable\n substances. This lake mud is now the soil of the\n country, richer than ever by reason of the de-\n cayed prairie grasses that year after year have\n fallen and rotted upon the plains. He brings the\n testimony of half a hundred eminent geologists\n to support his theory, and then points you to the\n dense blackness of the earth as his plough turns\n it up.\n</p>\n<p>\n Yankton\u2019s soil is her hope and her dependence.\n She is the outlet of an immense agricultural re-\n gion, embracing about 20,000 farms, devoted\n chiefly to the growth of corn and flax and to the\n development of stock. Seventy bushels of corn\n to the acre is regarded as a moderate result to be\n obtained with the physical advantages natural to\n these prairies. The farmers\u2019 homes in Yankton\n County are as large and comfortable as those to\n be found in Western Pennsylvania, and are main-\n tained in a style that tells its own story of gen-\n eral prosperity. No less than 647 cars were re-\n quired in 1888 in which to ship the grain products\n of the farms about Yankton; 316 more were filled\n with the Hour and feed of native manufacture;\n 250 were occupied by Yankton cattle, and 325 by\n Yankton hogs; 125 carloads of hay w r ere shipped,\n and altogether this little community of 4,000\n people sent out the surprising shipment of 2,419\n carloads of native goods. They brought back for\n their own supply 2,025 carloads of foreign goods,\n completing a traffic which must be regarded as\n anything but mean.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0007/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 428}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0007/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 857}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0007/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0007/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3430}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0007/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0007.jp2", "height": 3430, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 729411}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"7\">\n<p>\n SOUTH DAKOTA.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n Yankton is on the Missouri River, or, at least,\n was this morning. r lhe Missouri, however, ap-\n pears to have a mind of its own, and when it takes\n a notion it skips oif in one direction or another,\n coldly abandoning the towns that border on it\n Ihen, as if tired of wandering, it will shift its\n channel again and come back. Yankton can never\n tell just where the river is. Yankton goes to bed\n with the river washing the chalk bluffs which lie\n at the foot of the town. It wakes up with the\n river as much as two miles away. The philosophy\n of this extraordinary conduct is found in the soft\n bed over which the river flows. It is a deposit\n brought down from the sources not only of the\n Missouri, but of all the great rivers that flow into\n it, and this deposit forms successions of bars.\n The country round about is very low, and as these\n bars are washed away the channel shifts, often\n causing great overflows that do immense damage\n to the people who are foolish enough to farm with-\n in the imperilled territory. Many people are\n tempted to take the risks by reason of the wonder-\n ful richness of the low lands. Yankton\u2019s protec-\n tion against the river\u2019s treacherous disposition is\n a long line of chalk cliff whifch is likely to prove\n not only a wall of defence but a source of wealth\n to t lie people. They are beginning to think they\n have in these cliffs as ample a fortune as Sioux\n Falls possesses in its jasper rock. Blocks of the\n chalk were recently taken to Chicago and tested\n as the foundation ingredient for cement, and a\n syndicate of capitalists from that city, the princi-\n pal of whom is an Armour, has purchased a site\n and is about to erect a cement factory.\n</p>\n<p>\n Yankton is regarded by the rest of Dakota as a\n primeval town. Her antiquity is alluded to in\n almost reverential tones. She is as much as\n thirty years old, and an old log house exists which\n is pointed out to visitors with the same sort of\n respect that characterizes New-Yorkers when they\n \u25a0show strangers Fraunce\u2019s Tavern. Upon one oc-\n casion, just after the terrible New-Ulm massacre\n in 1 863, all that was left of animate and civilized\n Dakota was crowded into a corral 300 feet\n square, in the heart of Yankton, waiting for an\n attack from the hostile Sioux. Governor Ziebach,\n the leader of this devoted band, is still in Yank-\n ton, and tells a graphic story of the fateful hours\n they spent in their stockade. The savages were\n all around them, and occasionally one or two ap-\n peared on the bluffs. But the threatened descent\n was not attempted. The settlers were too well\n prepared for it. This was the last Indian trouble\n in Dakota, and now that the redskins have grown\n civilized and lazy they would as soon think of\n working as of fighting. The Government gives\n them all they can gorge and wear, and they live\n the idle, shiftless, filthy life that is the only thing\n to expect of an ignorant race that has no motive\n for self-improvement.\n</p>\n<p>\n With its age Yankton has acquired a conserva-\n tism in strange contrast to the rest of Dakota.\n Its people look with suspicion upon \u201c booms.\u201d\n Some restless folks from Sioux Falls have been\n recently buying up Yankton real estate at a great\n rate, paying SI 0,000 and SI 2, 000 for lots of forty\n acres on the edge of the town, and taking all they\n can get. Such speculations would set other towns\n crazy, and real estate options would fly around\n from hand to hand so fast you couldn\u2019t keep track\n of them. But the Yankton people, while much in-\n terested, do not get excited. They bank for their\n future upon their natural advantages, and not\n upon temporary spurts in the town-lot market.\n</p>\n<p>\n None of these advantages is so much talked\n about as the subterranean lake from which the\n city draws its water and its motive power. It\n has been practically demonstrated that at a\n depth of from 500* \u2018to 3,000 feet directly under\n the city there exists an immense body of water,\n supplied from high levels\u2014 probably the Rocky\n Mountains. It is not merely a stream such as is\n often found in this country under bed rock. It\n must be a lake, for tapped at fifteen different\n</p>\n<p>\n points it rushes forth with tremendous power,\n chemically the same everywhere, and without\n being weakened either in force or in supply\n no matter where nor how often it is tapped*\n The city obtains all its water through an artesian\n well sunk to a depth of about 600 feet. Two\n reservoirs holding 40,000 gallons each have been\n built on a bluff, and into them a six-inch pipe\n delivers the stream. This entire apparatus cost\n the city $3, 000, and for that picayune sum they\n get all the water they or twice their number\n can possibly use. There is no machinery to get out\n of order, and no use lor watchman or engineer.\n The entire thing consists of a shaft of iron pipe\n and a couple of tubs. It never fails to operate.\n But there it runs night and day, and there it\n must run forever. No wonder Yankton, with her\n 4,000 people, can afford to spend $40,000 for a\n public school house. Needless to say, the water\n rent at Yankton is reasonable.\n</p>\n<p>\n An immediate stop was put to the use of steam\n by the discovery of this novel power. Engines\n were laid away to rust or sold for what they\n would fetch. Fires were put out, windmills\n locked. People who required a motor drilled\n a hole in the ground, slid a pipe through it, and\n let the water turn their wheel and give motion to\n \u00bbtheir machinery. The fire company, supplied\n from the city\u2019s reservoirs, found that they could\n throw a stream over the highest building in town,\n and promptly sold their engine to a less fortunate\n community. The owner of a brick-yard combined\n with the company operating the electric lighting\n plant, and procured from a six-inch shaft a stream\n of 2,000 gallons per minute, with a pressure of\n fifty-six pounds to the square inch, or about\n 35-horse power, brought into play with a turbine\n wheel. With this costless and exhaustless motor\n at hand manufactories are being rapidly estab-\n lished in Yankton, and with the coming of the\n new railroad lines that are being pushed forward\n rapidly, several more are promised.\n</p>\n<p>\n Two great Western systems, the Chicago and\n Northwestern and the Chicago, Milwaukee and St.\n Paul, already run several daily trains into Yank-\n ton, and within the next six months at least\n two other lines will arrive. The Manitoba is\n now as fa? on its way as Sioux Falls, giving\n the points it strikes an air-line directly to the\n lakes. A road in course of construction from\n Norfolk, Nebraska, to be completed by August,\n will connect with the Union Pacific, and will\n bring to Yankton wliat it stands greatly in need\n of\u2014 a bridge over the Missouri. These enter-\n prises promise rapid development to the city,\n and their assurance has stimulated local improve-\n ments in an astonishing degree. In these wonder-\n ful Western towns it only requires the trust-\n worthy pledge of railroad facilities to bring\n capital and energy together with results that\n spring up almost before your very eyes. Much\n of the great work of development is done with\n Eastern money. Agents representing New-York,\n Boston and Philadelphia capitalists are constantly\n travelling over the country looking into this or\n that proposed investment, and often, if not usually,\n leaving much money behind them when they go\n away. This, it is perhaps needful to say, is\n the \u2018only safe way of investing. The people of\n these new cities are morally a most superior\n class, but there are enough rogues among them to\n do them and the East too a vast amount of\n harm. I am told by trustworthy men that fully\n a third of the capital in actual use comes from\n the three towns of New-York, Boston and Phila-\n delphia, a fact which of itself shows how widely\n the East is interested in the progress of the new\n States. Large sums, however, have been lost\n through the manipulations of dishonest men, ' and\n in making the caution emphatic that persons\n contemplating Western investments should come\n out and see for themselves where their money\n is going, I am but giving expression to the earnest\n wish of the reputable Western men.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0008/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0008/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0008/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0008/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0008/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0008.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 674647}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"8\">\n<p>\n 6\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n III.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE INDIAN QUESTION.\n</p>\n<p>\n LOOKING FOR THE OPENING OF THE SIOUX\n RESERVATION.\n</p>\n<p>\n A VISIT TO THE BBHLE AGENCY\u2014 ABE THE BEST\n INDIANS DEAD INDIANS?\u2014 THE DAKOTA\n VIEW OP ' IT.\n</p>\n<p>\n Chamberlain, South Dakota, April 18.\n</p>\n<p>\n The 500,000 people who live in South Dakota\n feel themselves much afflicted, and in all that\n pertains to their prosperity as a State much im-\n peded by the big Sioux Indian reservation, which\n extends from the west bank of the\n Missouri up and down directly through\n the heart of the new State, cutting it\n into an eastern and a western section; between\n which there neither is nor can be, under present\n conditions, any communication whatever. They\n complain that they are the victims of an unin-\n formed sentiment in the East, which assumes\n that the Indian is in need of sympathy and pro-\n tection against their malevolent desiens upon\n the Indian possessions. Eastern people, they say,\n having no barbarous nations about them to block\n their way toward whatever is desirable in civil-\n ized life, lose sight of the real facts composing\n the Indian question, and incline to think the\n savages a hard-used race, who are being rapidly\n robbed and exterminated. They claim that Indian\n legislation has hitherto been determined by men\n thus minded, with results ruinous to the Indians\n socially and morally, and ridiculously expensive\n to the taxpayers.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dakota\u2019s Indian population is much larger than\n that of any other State or Territory, except that\n inhabited by the Five Nations, and practically\n the whole of it is in South Dakota. Here, upon\n a domain of the richest and most productive\n land on earth. 24.000.000 acres in area, a territory\n nearly as great as the State of New-York, quite as\n great as Indiana, and five times greater than\n Massachusetts, lives a body of 23,000 Indians\n who, with immeasurable resources at their com-\n mand, lead an utterly idle and shiftless life, and\n cost the Government $1,750,000 a year for their\n food and clothing. One-half of the Sioux are in\n a certain degree civilized, but as many as 1 2,000\n of them live far within their reservation, where\n they lead as wild a life as ever, and few of them\n come personally to the agencies. Their animosity\n against the whites is held in check only because\n they have learned the lesson of an outbreak, and\n know a hostile attempt will end in their punish-\n ment. But they are bitter and savage, and are\n a source of constant vexation to the agents, for\n their influence over the more enlightened Indians\n continues to be strong, and is always exerted\n against everything that tends to improve their\n race and bring it out of its low and worthless\n condition.\n</p>\n<p>\n Although you hear from Western people the\n most hopeful assurances that the Indian can be-\n</p>\n<p>\n come a civilized and useful citizen, entirely self-\n supporting, and capable in ail ways of exercising\n the rights and improving the opportunities of\n citizenship, with his savage nature wholly\n obliterated, and his manliness so brought out\n that he will hold the hie he came from in abhor-\n rence; yet they ask with a reasonableness that\n must be acknowledged, how you are going to do\n that when you take from him all motive for\n sell-exertion, when you make him a beggar,\n remove him from community with white pouple,\n shut him up in a reservation where he has no\n personal property rights, maintain his tribal rela-\n tions and the authority of the hereditary chiefs,\n and teach him to depend on the Great Father\n for all his supplies. This policy, once necessary\n and good, is now simply degrading to the Indian\n and costly to the white man. When it was\n instituted it was the only thing possible. Great\n blocks of country were assigned to small tribes,\n not only because they were otherwise useless,\n but because they afforded nunting-grounds.\n But now there is scarcely an eatable wild animal\n in the entire West larger than a jack-rabbit, and\n everything the Indian puts in his mouth or on\n his back is given to him outright by the Govern-\n ment.\n</p>\n<p>\n How many white people would work under\n these circumstances ? ask the Dakotans. Corral\n the people of a tenement-house district from New-\n tfork City cut here on these prairies, tell them\n the land is theirs in common, but not a foot of\n it within any one\u2019s individual reach, build them\n houses to live in, give them weekly rations and\n clothes, and what would you expect of them ?.\n To what civilized heights would you think them\n likely to attain ? They might have been mechanics\n before you brought them hither, and without\n motive or use for their skill, how long would\n they retain it? If it be admitted that the\n Caucasian nature would deteriorate in so depress-\n ing an environment, you are asked how much\n more harmful it must be upon a race, most of\n whom still worship rocks, and whose system is\n established on the fundamental principle that all\n labor is degrading.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Indian cannot be blamed when ho sees\n the Government buying all he wants for him\n if he concludes that the Government owes him\n a living. He despises labor, he knows he doesn\u2019t\n have to labor, and he believes it\n the duty of the whites to labor for him. Not\n long ago one of the Agency officials at Crow\n Creek came walking over the brow of a big\n bluff, and saw two ponies and two Indian women\n pulling and pushing a wagon up the hill, in which\n White Ghost, a great burly 200 pounds of Indian\n majesty, sat glum and grand. The March wind\n was blowing an icy gale down the bluffs, and the\n women were almost frozen stiff, but White Ghost,\n under his Government blanket, was warm enough.\n The white man told him to get out and help\n push the wagon, but \u201cheap big Injun\u201d didn\u2019t so\n much as grunt. He simply drew his blanket\n closer around him, glanced contemptuously at the\n white man, and sat. At last, in pity for the\n women, the white man added his muscle to\n theirs and the ponies\u2019 and helped to carry th &\n noble savage along. White Ghost is the prin-\n cipal chief at Crow Creek. He would sooner die\n than work.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Brule Indian agency is about five\n miles below Chamberlain, and you reach it in a\n row-boat under the patronage of an elderly\n gentleman, who has been on the Missouri for\n twenty years, and who knows Injun through and\n through. Like all older Westerners who remem-\n ber the experiences at New-Ulm, he has one set\n phrase in which he speaks of the redskin. He al-\n ways uses it as if it were a single word,\u2019\n \u2014thus : \u201c Themdaminjuns I\u201d And as he glides you\n along under the shadow of the steep bluffs that\n overlook the water everywhere, he entertains you\n with stories of the noble savage.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0009/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0009/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 537, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 868}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0009/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1075, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1736}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0009/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3473}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0009/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0009.jp2", "height": 3473, "width": 2151, "levels": 6, "size": 700878}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"9\">\n<p>\n SOUTH DAKOTA.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c I use ter think they wer\u2019n\u2019t no virtoo \u2019t all in\n themdaminj uns, an\u2019 thet th\u2019 on\u2019y way ter make\n \u2019em good was with a gun.

They\n wasn\u2019t no harm come to them cattle!\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n We were rowing gently down with the current\n upon the muddiest water I ever saw. On either\n side of the river, ' stretching up and down for\n miles, rose a countless succession of mounds and\n bluffs\u2014 the Gumbo Hills of the Missouri. Sterile,\n tough and sticky, the soil of the hills is bereft\n of vegetation, though just behind them rolled as\n fair and rich a prairie land as anywhere exists.\n Once, centuries ago, as you easily* may see, the\n waters of this great river touched the highest\n summit of the furthest bluff, and reached at least\n twenty miles from peak to peak. Gradually, as\n they fell, they moulded these curiously shaped\n hills, cutting deep gullies and gulches between\n them, and forming a long island in the river now\n covered with a heavy growth of timber.\n Below this, the river has made long lines\n of ever-shifting sand-bars, and with scarcely\n enough water to accommodate our little skiff, we\n paddled our way through the bars to the reserva-\n tion landing.\n</p>\n<p>\n There the agency wagon was waiting for its\n mail-bags and supplies, and in it I made my\n further journey. It was \u201c killing day\u201d upon the\n reservation, the day upon which cattle were\n slaughtered. r JTie Indians were already gathering\n from all over the prairies, coming fleetly in upon\n their ponies\u2019 backs, or with their squaws and chil-\n dren in little Dearborn wagons. They were any-\n thing but pretty to look at. Some, pointed out as\n the wilder and more savage of the tribe, who blit\n rarely, and only upon such occasions as the pres-\n ent, came to the agency, were clad in their native\n costume, picturesque certainly, and even im-\n pressive, hut scarcely of a kind to excite agreeable\n sensations. Buckskin trousers, heavily trimmed\n with a leathern fringe, covered their legs, oddly\n painted here and there with grotesque representa-\n tions of horses, covotes, and other creatures.

Of these\n fellows nothing was visible excepting their ugly\n dark faces, always bearing a most sinister expres-\n sion, but animated only by their little black eyes\n that gleamed like snakes\u2019. Some of them did\n without the hood, wearing nothing over their hung\n wiry hair, which fell from a parting in the middle\n straight down upon their shoulders. A headdress\n of gaudy feathers was often tied to the scalp-locks\n and stuck up therefrom in the familiar style.\n They all had moccasins upon their feet and walked\n without making the slightest noise, the circum-\n stance which, most of all, affected my nerves.\n The greater part, however, were clad in an ugly\n and ridiculous conglomeration of civilized and sav-\n age dress, which left them none of the native dig-\n nity that in a high degree characterized the ap-\n pearance of the wilder portion.\n</p>\n<p>\n As human curiosities the women were by far\n more interesting than the men. They wore more\n native toggery, beads, bracelets, necklabes, belts\n and such vanities. They sat around in small\n groups upon the ground, catching the pneumonia\n and chattering like monkeys, often with their\n papooses strung over their shoulders in the ap-\n proved fashion. Fully half the tribe were paint-\n ed with a light red dust. Being as ugly as possi-\n ble without the paint, it had no other effect than\n to make their ugliness a trifle more striking.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many of the Indians go armed. You could see\n their pistols or \u201c guns,\u201d as everything that fires\n a bullet is called in the West, stick-\n ing out from under their blankets all around\n you. Hess than a dozen white people live at the\n agency, and removed from all others of thoir land,\n surrounded by tribes noted for their malicious\n tendencies, one would think their situation any-\n thing but enviable. There are no soldiers at the\n agency, only the principal himself, Major Tippetts,\n a physician, a store-keeper, a civil engineer and\n half a dozen assistants. Major Tippetts and his\n superior officer, Major Anderson, whose head-\n quarters are at Grow Greek, some miles above\n Chamberlain, are regarded as model Indian man-\n agers. ' 1 ' hey are both, after long experience\n among the Sioux, advocates of the new policy,\n which contemplates the establishment of each In-\n dian family upon a farm, to which the head of the\n family shall have a title in fee simple: the break-\n ing up of the tribal relations, the founding of\n public schools upon the reservations, so that\n children shall not be taken from their parents\n and the educational influence shall be felt bv both\n young and old: and, briefly, the substitution of\n modern civilized methods and manners for those\n wlrch are at best a compromise with barbarism.\n Maior Tippetts believes that the Indian will never\n make substantial progress until his interests are\n identified with tho-e of the whites, and his am-\n bitions are stimulated by the same chances of\n profit that render exertion worth while to other\n people.\n</p>\n<p>\n In a corral, not far from the agency, thirty\n head of Texan steers were waiting to be butchered,\n a process that fills the Indian soul with a huge\n barbaric joy. Ghiefs. bucks and squaws, maidens\n and chil ' ien take their part in it and fill the air\n with howls of savage rapture, as each furious\n steer succumbs to the marksman\u2019s bullet. The\n Indians began t < o gather around the corral full an\n hour before the shooting, coming across the prairies\n from all directions and in all sorts of conveyances.\n The old women and young girls sat around on the\n hill-tops, gabbling like a (lock of geese, while the\n bucks and the boys mounted the corral fence and\n prepared their knives and axes for the slaughter.\n Upon a little platform in the centre of the corrn I\n two - white men stood, armed with Winchester\n rifles, and as the cattle scampered around the\n inch sure, they selected their victims and fired.\n In most instances a single bullet sufficed, and the\n steer, uttering a wild snort or a long, low moan,\n rolled over dead. But some, tougher than the\n rest, or poorly hit, were simply rendered furious by\n</p>\n<p>\n the first shot, and bellowing madly, lowered their\n beaus and rushed at tne platform, at the\n fences or at any other object in their way,\n Then, from the squaws upon tne hills and from\n the bucks and boys arose a chorus ol savage\n yells. They pelted the wounded steer with stones\n and sticks, shrieked their favorite taunts at fum;\n told him he looked like u Fonca or au Omaha,\n and kept up a constant howl until a second, a\n third or a fourth bullet finished him. This specta-\n cle, 1 am told, is tame and spiritless compared\n with that produced on such occasions until about\n two years ago, and the success of Mayor Tippetts\n in preventing the cruelties practised formerly upon\n the steers is pointed to as proof of the tractabiiity\n of Indian nature. When the last steer had fallen\n and before many of them had actually died, tho\n Indians poured forth into the corral with knives,\n hatchets and axes, and keeping up their savage\n din, cut the bleeding cattle into pieces. Their\n first act was to hack out the tongue, which, drip-\n ping with blood, some began straightway to de-\n vour. Then they ripped off the skin, and getting\n finally to the heart and liver, without further\n ceremony\u2014 without an oven or a fire\u2014 they entered\n upon a feast which will not require a more\n extended description. The Sioux Indian may bo\n capable of attaining something like civilization,\n but I should prefer to try my hand on his friend\n and neighbor, the coyote.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is only fair to add that the people of Cham-\n berlain, who have watched the process of improve-\n ment as it has been practised on the Brule Sioux,\n are agreed that a much better condition of tilings\n prevails at the agency than existed even three\n years ago. The Indian police, organized by Major\n Tippetts, are said to be an efficient and trust-\n worthy body of men. The Major has created a\n court of criminal offences, composed of Big Main,\n John De Smit and Eagle Star, three of the most\n progressive men of the tribe, who dispense justice\n according to the Interior Department code with\n gratifying success. The court has plenty of work\n on its hands. Big Main is a handsome Indian and\n is regarded with much esteem bv the white people.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ail Dakota, North and South, is looking forward\n with the intensest interest to the opening of the\n reservation. The Dawes bill, intended to ac-\n complish this result, has been a law for two\n years, but it is founded on the theory that the\n Indians are not an element of the United States,\n but a foreign nation. Before it can become cf-\n fective, the consent of three-fourths\n of the male adult Indians must be\n obtained. The Government policy is a\n curious jumble; with one voice we command, with\n another we beg. We take their children from them\n against their will and consent to be educated in\n the East,. We establish laws for their control\n and guidance and compel them to adopt certain\n modes of life. But, with Supreme Court decisions\n on file holding that the Indian has no fee simple\n title to his land, we cannot or do not legislate\n upon his territory except by treaty. He is made\n at once a subject and a foreign power.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is what the Western people most complain\n about. It is not true that their feeling as a\n body of men is hostile to the Indian. On the\n contrary, they speak kindly of him, and I\n do them but meagre justice in saying that they\n would be as quick as any to resent and oppose\n measures looking to his injury. They are more\n anxious, as they have more reason to be anxious,\n than anybody else, for his improvement and for\n the removal of those conditions which keep him a\n worthless vagabond or a savage brute and leave\n him a stumbling block in their way. They want\n to lift him up, and they ask only that their plan\n be tried. Seeing that the oiler plan, pursued\n for forty years, still admits of such practices as\n 1 witnessed in that corral, and that other practices\n far more revolting and offensive, such, for instance,\n as the Sun dance, are prevented only by the ex-\n ercise of force, it may be wise at least to listen\n with deference and respect to what the Westerners\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0011/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0011/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 537, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 868}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0011/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1075, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1736}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0011/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3473}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0011/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0011.jp2", "height": 3473, "width": 2151, "levels": 6, "size": 696733}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"11\">\n<p>\n SOUTH DAKOTA.\n</p>\n<p>\n 0\n</p>\n<p>\n fiay.

And above all, they say, the\n ruinous system of supporting him must be stopped.\n Let him have lands and tools. Let him be taught\n how to use them. Help him in every way, but\n make him earn his living.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Dawes bill is a long step toward this policy.\n The Westerners have made great progress in im.\n pressing their views upon Washington, and they\n are lull of hope that when the Last understands\n them, these views will prevail. Under the Dawes\n bill, so soon as the Indians consent, 11,0U0, 000\n acres of the reservation are to be opened for settle-\n ment, lor which the Indians are to be paid $10,.\n 5Uu,o00. Then they are to be invited to take\n iand in severalty, and to such as -will do this the\n Government will set apart 320 acres, giving them\n also a complete farming outfit, $50 in money, a\n team of horses and a supply of seed. Tlus is by\n no means all the Western people ask. They want\n the land-in-severalty plan made compulsory. They\n want, a compulsory public school system among\n the Indians, which, they say, would be easily\n established and popular. They want the Govern-\n ment, to stop treating with the Indian as if he were\n a civilized equal. If we concede him to be\n socially and morally capable of taking care of\n himself, they say, why support him? Why con-\n trol him? If he is not so capable, why submit\n our plans for his improvement to his unen-\n ghtened judgment? He won\u2019t approve them \u2014\n of course not, for he doesn\u2019t comprehend them.\n If he did, he wouldn\u2019t be in need of them. But we\n know they are for his advantage, and that is\n enough. He will find it out when, through their\n operation, he has ceased to be a savage and lias\n become a man and a citizen.\n</p>\n<p>\n One commission, it will be remembered, appointed\n to obtain the necessary consent of the Indians to\n the opening of the reservation, failed in its quest\n through the hostile influence of the old chiefs and\n their wilder followers. Another commission is\n soon to be appointed. Dakota is united in asking\n that Colonel John II. King, of the Black Hills,\n shall be one of its members. He is the champion\n of the Western idea and is at the same time in favor\n personally with the Indians. I asked him the other\n day if he really thought there was any chance of\n making a good citizen out of a Sioux. \u201c The In-\n dian,\u201d he said, \u201c is smart. Ilis eyes and ears are\n better than ours, his mind as quick, his desires as\n keen. Teach him the operation of the law of cause\n and effect, of work and pay, and he will become one\n with us and one of us.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Indian is smart\u2014 there can be no doubt of\n that. A party of big chiefs went to Washington\n last winter to visit the Great Father. One of\n them, since his return, has been dubbed \u201c Make-the-\n White-Chief-Wait.\u201d How he acquired this title is\n a funny story. When they reached Washington,\n Mr. Vilas, the Secretary of the Interior, arranged\n to see them. Vilas is one of those nervous,\n bustling men who never have the tenth part of a\n second to spare. The Indians are, above all things,\n deliberative in ceremonial matters. When they\n were ushered into the Secretary\u2019s room, he wheeled\n around in his chair and said he was the Great\n Father\u2019s secretary and would hear what they wished\n to say. His brusque manner greatly offended the\n Sioux. There was a long pause, broken at last by\n</p>\n<p>\n the Secretary, who urged them to go ahead, speak\n their speech and get done. Finally one old fellow\n arose and delivered himself as follows : \u201c We are\n glad to see the Great Father\u2019s chief. We are glad\n to hear his voice. We are his friends. We have\n come a long way in the Great Father\u2019s carriage\n that says \u2018chul chu!\u2019 (imitating the puffs of a\n steam engine.), and that roils and bounces\u2014 sol\n (imitating the motion of the car). We are tired.\n We will see the white chief on Monday.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Vilas was much disgusted. He said he didn\u2019t\n do business that way. If they wanted\n to talk they must do it now. Another\n long pause, and then a second chief arose.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c We are glad to see the Great Father\u2019s chief,\u201d\n said he. \u201c We are glad to hear his voice. We\n are his friends. We have come a long way in the\n Great Father\u2019s carriage that says \u2018chu! chu!\u2019 and\n that rolls and bounces\u2014 so ! We are tired. We\n will see the white chief on Monday.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Again the Secretary remonstrated. He said he\n was a busy man. He could not see them again.\n They must talk now or not at all. A third pause,\n more prolonged than ever. Then the third chief\n slowly got up and said : n We are glad to see the\n Great Father\u2019s chief. We are glad to hear his\n voice. We are his friends. We have come a long\n way in the Great Father\u2019s carriage that says \u2018chu I\n chu!\u2019 and that rolls and bounces\u2014 so! We are\n tired. We wii] see the white chief on Monday.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Poor Mr. Vilas was becoming as tired as the\n weary Injun. But he tried it once more, this time\n appealingly. The fourth chief, alter waiting fully\n five minutes in silence, responded : \u201c We are glad\n</p>\n<p>\n to see the Great Father\u2019s chief. We are glad to\n hear his voice. We are his friends. We have\n come a long way in the Great Father\u2019s carriage\n that says \u2018chu! chul\u2019 and that rolls and bounces\n \u2014so ! We are tired. We will see the white chief\n on Monday.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Vilas gave it up. He meekly replied he\n guessed Monday would suit him as well as any\n other day. L. E.

An\n amiable and enthusiastic friend who drove me\n around one of the prairie cities in the Jim Valley\n solemnly assured me that I\u2019d never seen a more\n picturesque sight than that presented by a little\n *un m( mnds, perhaps as much as six feet\n high, that extended for half a mile back of the\n town. I ventured to suggest that there was a\n spot or two in the Adirondacks just a trifle more\n imposing, but he wouldn\u2019t have it so at all.\n Nothing, he said, could be more magnificent than\n that six-foot mound.\n</p>\n<p>\n No wonder these plains, the \u201c Great American\n Desert\u201d of school-boy geographies, and as barren\n as a moor only ten years ago, are to-day covered\n with rich populous cities. Everybody has his\n immortal soul invested at its full value in his\n own particular place, and things hum and boom\n because they\u2019ve got to. The first railroad car\n passed between this city and Pierre, 125 miles\n west, on the Missouri River, nine years ago, and\n not a single white man lived along the entire\n route. The men who went over on it spent their\n time shooting antelope which covered the prairies.\n Droves of antelope two miles long passed within\n rifle shot Huron\u2019s municipal seal shows a sur-\n veyor driving a stake in the ground with a lot\n of antelope standing off watching him. The\n ls historic and occurred in 1880, where\n 4,500 people are living now.\n</p>\n<p>\n is a Jim River town. The people are\n unwilling to accord their river any distinction\n not enjoyed by themselves, and. therefore,\n christened James, it is always called Jim. It runs\n lor 1,200 miles, north and south, through Dakota,\n with barely enough fall to keep its waters in\n motion, Ike prairie land, for fifty miles on either\n side slopes gently toward it and forms the \u201c valley\n of the Jim,\u201d a phrase significant of good crops,\n where rams are frequent, snows almost unknown,\n and the temperature in winter generally 10 de-\n grees higher than that of Chicago. In describing\n one of these Jim River towns, you describe all.\n they are the depots of shipment and supply for a\n great block of surrounding agricultural country,\n through which, stoneless and smooth, a plough\n can be driven a dozen miles -without breaking a\n furrow. The fact that South Dakota cannot be\n looked upon as exclusively a wheat-raising coun-\n try, but one more adapted to general farming, has\n become established, and the farmers, -with few ex-\n ceptions, aie growing more corn than wheat, much\n flax, small fruits in great abundance, and are\n raising sheep and cattle in immense herds. Those\n who engaged early in general agriculture have\n grown wealthy, and the old \u201c shacks.\u201d houses\n thrown together of sods, logs or the roughest\n timber, are giving way to fine large modern\n houses, with barns to match. Only a few of the\n original sod \u201c shacks\u201d remain, but one of them, a\n few miles from Huron, contains a new Si. 200\n piano and a buffet with cut glass decanters. There\n are but two rooms and but two occupants in the\n house\u2014 an old man and his daughter. He built\n the \u201c shack\u201d himself, piling sod on sod. with holes\n cut through here and there for doors and windows.\n The roof is made of cottonwood timber and the\n floor of Mother Earth. The old man says it\u2019s a\n good warm house and will last as long as he does.\n</p>\n<p>\n Huron is chasing the capital, and with true\n Western avidity. When the people of South Da-\n kota took a vote on the capital question in 1885\n Huron led all the towns, with a couple of thousand\n votes to spare. Pierre, Huron\u2019s Missouri River\n neighbor, secured the second place .and Sioux Falls,\n Chamberlain and the other towns came straggling\n along far behind the leaders. This vote was taken\n under the Sioux Falls Constitution, and in the hope\n that General Harrison, then in the Senate, would\n be able to get South Dakota into the Union. This\n plan failing on account of the action of the Demo-\n cratic House. Huron lost her advantage, for under\n the Admission bill passed by the hist Congress and\n now the enabling law. the capital question must be\n submitted again to the people. They will vote on\n it when they elect State officers next October, the\n</p>\n<p>\n race being free for all and all being in it. It is in\n no sense a partisan question. It will be decided\n by those town affiliations, on the one hand, and jeal-\n ousies on the other which arc so striking a feature\n of settlements in the West. The lirst vote Is not\n the final one. it decides simply where the capital\n shall be set up temporarily. That grateful boon\n goes to whichever town sfiail lead in the ballot,\n and the first State Eegislature is required to pro-\n vide at the next general election for anotner tree-\n for-all light for the permanent capital, if any\n town shall be so happy as to secure a majority of\n ail the votes cast, it has the prize; but if not a\n third election must be called, and in it a choice\n must be made between the two towns that led on\n the last vote.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is much to be said for and against this\n method ol choosing, and much is said both ways.\n Hut it is probably as satisfactory a scheme as\n could be devised. It is conceded wherever I have\n been that the towns which led on the last ballot,\n Huron and Pierre\u2014 the one the present centre of\n population, tiie other geographically the\n centre of the State\u2014 will be very like-\n ly to lead again, though as to the\n order in which they will lead opinion is as shape-\n less as a crab. Huron knows for a certainty\n that she has Pierre on the hip, while Pierre is\n cocksure that the hearts of the people are fired\n with zeal in her cause. I have an opinion on\n the subject, but I shall wait until 1 am well\n out of Dakota before it escapes me.\n</p>\n<p>\n Each town has advantages peculiar to itself,\n and both are working ardently and well. Both\n are on the line of the Chicago and Northwestern\n Railway, and that powerful corporation is main-\n taining an attitude of dignified reserve. Pierre\n is its western terminus, and the point from\n which, when the Sioux Reservation is opened, it\n will proceed onward to the Black Hills. Huron\n is its Dakotan headquarters, where its trainmen\n live, and where it distributes $30,000 a month\n in wages. Each town has a handsome, well-\n placed site all ready for the capitol corner-stone,\n and nobody is permitted to visit either town\n without inspecting it.\n</p>\n<p>\n All down the Valley of the Jim that wonderful\n subterranean water-route which is so powerful\n at Yankton extends, and is available both as a\n source of mechanical power and domestic supply.\n A single well furnishes Huron with three times\n the flow she can make use of, and other wells\n afford for manufacturing houses from thirty-five\n to fifty horse-power. This is regarded by the\n people as a happy promise of the future, and they\n are offering large inducements to versons who\n will bring capital into the place for manufacturing\n purposes. They call particularlv for mills, pack-\n ing houses and canning factories. The grain is\n here, the pork is here, and so are the fruits and\n vegetables. Routes to the markets of the East\n and South are already excellent, and are multiply-\n ing rapidly. The St. Paul and Manitoba system\n is here now, and is rapidly pushing on to Denver.\n This system gives Huron an air-line to the lakes,\n from which vessels carry freight seven months\n in the year to Buffalo, and so soon as Mr. Hill\u2019s\n quickly moving plans are accomplished, liis rail-\n road -will do the same work the year round.\n It is believed in the Northwest that the com-\n oletion of these lines will enable merchants in\n Washington, Montana and the Dakotas to pur-\n chase their goods as cheaply in Now-York as in\n Chicago. The company represents that it can\n carry wheat from Dakota to Buffalo for 15 cents\n a bushel. The Northern Pacific has completed\n its surveys for a. line from Morris, Minn., to\n Huron, which will furnish a competing outlet\n to Lake Superior. The Missouri Pacific line,\n heading now for Yankton, is quite certain to come\n onward into the State, and negotiations are now\n pending for a right/ of way into Huron.\n</p>\n<p>\n In their educational and religious equipments-\n all these Dakota towns have everythin cr that\n could in any reason be asked of them.

A place with three\n or four thousand inhabitants often has as many\n as six great railway systems and a dozen trains\n a day connecting it in the shortest possible time\n with the entire country. The fact is, Dakota\n has been made by the railroads. Minnesota, Io wa,\n Nebraska and other Western States have shown\n them that it pays to open way f or settlements,\n rather than to follow settlements. Three thousand\n miles of track had been laid in Dakota before the\n Territory contained a single town of more than\n 800 people. In other parts of the West settlers\n came along in wagon trains with a few blankets,\n a few farming implements, a yoke of oxen, a little\n hard tack and a barrel of water as their only\n equipment. When they had turned the wilder-\n ness into wheat-fields, the railroads cautiously\n came along after them. Then it was seen that\n as fast as the tracks were laid cities arose to\n meet them and that no judicious railroad enter-\n prise could fail.\n</p>\n<p>\n This experience prompted new methods when\n eyes of settlers turned toward the rich black soil\n of Dakota. The railroads perceived that if they\n took time by the forelock they could not only\n get their rights of way for nothing, but they\n could direct immigration and grow rich as well\n by the sales of land along the lines of their roads\n as by ordinary traffic. They took the risk.\n It was not very great. They could build upon\n the level prairies for $3,000 a mile. They could\n also bond for $30,000, as some of them did, to\n the immediate good fortune of themselves, but.\n</p>\n<p>\n of course, to the final ruin of their roads and\n their investors. But such of them as pursued a\n legitimate business have already reaped a golden\n harvest, and are still leaping and will reap for\n years to come. Under the Lberal and wise policy\n of Congress they were allowed to make out their\n own routes and to take for nothing a strip of\n 100 feet as far as they would build. They picked\n out prospective town sites, took up two or three\n square miles of land around under the pre-emp.\n tion law, at an expense of $1 25 per acre, laid it\n out in lots, put up a few houses, gave the place\n a name and waited for settleis.\n</p>\n<p>\n They did not need to wait long. A host of\n farmers were waiting for the chance that now\n arose. They were all ready to go wherever they\n could have a fair opportunity to market their\n produce. They chased the railroads and gave an.\n immediate value to these town sites. Village after\n village thus lifted itself upon the plains and the\n prairie grass made way for grain. Industrious\n people could not help but make money, and they\n were the only class who had any motive for com-\n irg. Their cattle ranged winter and summer upon\n the prairies, living on the richest hay that grows,\n cured as it fell upon the ground. They thrived\n and multiplied, while the settlers built their sod\n \u201c shacks\u2019\u2019 and barns, sowed their wheat, gathered\n it in and sent it off to market. These facts tell\n the story of Dakota\u2019s development. They show\n how it is that a social condition has been ac-\n complished here easily and quickly which in other\n Western States was attained only after twenty\n and thirty years had been spent in the severest\n experiences with hardship and poverty. They\n show why Dakota, save in the Black Hiils district,\n has always been free from those deplorable evils\n that form so shocking a chapter in the liistory of\n early settlements elsewhere.\n</p>\n<p>\n The only town east of the mining lands which\n has ever known what it is to be dominated by\n gamblers and desperadoes is Pierre, now the scene\n of as much that is peaceful and refined as can be\n found anywhere in the Territory. But. before\n the railroads got into the Black Hills Pierre was\n the point from which they received all their\n supplies, and to which they shipped all their\n minerals. A wagon trail extended straight across\n the big Sioux Reservation, which separates all\n South Dakota east of the Missouri from the Hills.\n The eastern terminus of the trail was at Fort\n Pierre, a settlement on Indian land, and there\n by sufferance only, just across the river from\n Pierre. Though assuming a military name. Fort\n Pierre never was anything but a trading post,\n fortified in the early days by the traders them-\n selves. Pierre Choteau. the old French fur mer-\n chant of St. Louis, established it in 1820, and\n put men there to stay during the winter and take\n lurs from the Indians whenever they could be ob-\n tained. Then barges came up in the spring from\n St. Louis, loaded down with provisions and\n trinkets, which -were left as the capital for an-\n other winter\u2019s bargaining. Choteau\u2019s men were\n mostly French-Canadians. They were on good\n terms with the natives and made wives of the\n dusky maidens, whose half-breed progeny -form\n the iarger part of Fort Pierre\u2019s present popula-\n tion. They are a curious lot of people, and they\n have a curious town. It contains a most in-\n congruous collection of houses, mud \u201c shacks.\u201d log\n huts, peacocky Queen Anues, Indian tents and\n mere corrals with sod roofs. Its people have\n gradually become more Indian than French, though\n they resemble no creatures on earth except them-\n selves. They are neither barbarians nor are they\n civilized, neither savage nor tame, neither white\n nor red. Thev wear clothes the sight of which\n would make Chatham-st. sick with envy. They\n seem to have neither emotion nor ambition, but\n they can trade horses, shoot jack-rabbits, fish and\n hunt with the best Indian in the land. Few of\n them do. or at, least few will, speak English. You\n must talk in Sioux or mongrel French, if you ex-\n pect to draw them into conversation. They are\n beyond the reach of all legal processes, for the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0014/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0014/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0014/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0014/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0014/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0014.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 743696}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"14\">\n<p>\n 12\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n Territorial courts have no jurisdiction over them\n and the United States courts are too remote lor\n use.

Eight years\n ago, when the railroad came in, it\n comained one of the wildest populations in the\n West. People began to concentrate so soon as the\n railroad pointed toward the river, and in antici-\n pation of a ** boom\u201d they filed their claims, started\n a score or two of saloons and gambling dens and\n waited for victims. Those were bad days in\n Pierre. Filled with robbers and cutthroats, specu-\n lators, ranchers and traders, without the sem-\n blance of government, each man for himself, and\n relying only on his gun for protection, human life\n was of small value and crime of all kinds ran ram-\n pant. buch of the people as were honest lelt very\n lonely. There were no houses in the place. A\n barge had come up the river with a little jag ol\n lumber, which had been eagerly seized upon, but\n was almost useless for want of tools with which to\n fasten it together. A couple of Chicago young men\n who learned of this situation conceived it an op-\n portunity to make money, and they spent their\n last penny in the purchase of a carload of stoves\n and hardware. When it reached Pierre they had\n nothing left to pay the freight bill with, but they\n 6aw an amiable-looking old fellow on the street and\n they told him their story. He went with them to\n the depot, paid their bill of $250, and they estab-\n lished themselves in a shedded corral. Neither of\n them knew the first thing about the hardware\n business, and their invoices not having arrived,\n they could only guess at the proper prices. They\n made no mistake in guessing, however. One of\n their customers wanted a pick. They fished out\n a pick and told him the price was $4 75.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Great Scott!\u201d he exclaimed. \u201c Do you know\n what this pick cost you ?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Well, since you put the question,\u201d they re-\n plied, \u201c we may as well own that we don\u2019t.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c It cost you about sixty cents,\u2019\u2019 he said. \u201c 1\n must have the pick, and, if $4 75 is your\n price, ' I\u2019ll have to pay it, but it seems to\n me that $1 25 would be more like the fair\n thing.\u201d , Mill\n</p>\n<p>\n ' they said they didn\u2019t want to cheat him, and\n took his $1 25. Not all their customers, however,\n were as well posted in hardware prices as this one,\n and when their invoices arrived they found they\n had cleared something over 500 per cent; on then-\n investment. They decided that the hardware\n busi ness was a good one to remain in.\n</p>\n<p>\n The aristocracy of Pierre and its ruling element\n were all saloonkeepers. They and the desperadoes\n ran the town. Nobody ventured out of his\n \u201c shack\u201d at night, unless he was a robber, and even\n then nobody supposed to have money was sate.\n Men were \u201c held up\u201d in broad daylight. Murders\n were ordinary happenings. Bands of robDers\n prowled the streets after dark, hammereo\n down resisting doors, and if they thought, their\n victims lying, or even if their expectations v '\n plunder were not fully realized, they wouin\n shoot a man down where he stood with as little\n hesitancy as if he were a coyote. This sort or\n thing, of course, did not last long. Robbers\n were met by regulators, murders by lynckmgs.\n One festive desperado who had ridden horseback\n through the town shooting at random was ti naus-\n ea unlit. in a \u201c shack\u201d and literally perforated\n with bullets.\n</p>\n<p>\n That Pierre is gone, almost forgotten, now.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of two \u201c old-timers\u201d remain, minus an arm\n or a leg, or gullied through with a bullet, as\n a reminder of the glorious past. But the Pierre\n of to-day is not only a changed, but a new Pierre.\n It possesses a handsome jail, but the jail is a\n white elephant. There hadn\u2019t been a soul in\n it for six months, until the other day, when the\n town went wild with delight on learning that\n a man had been caught drunk and disorderly,\n and was actually to be imprisoned in the jail\n for sixty davs. If it had been possible, under\n the law, to put him in lor lilo there is no doubt\n it would have been done. r Ihe police authorities\n have readied a point in their search for occup & nts\n for that jail where nobody who gets within\n their clutches need hope lor mercy, they built\n x poorhouse in Pierre three years ago, and it\n has bad just three inmates since it was opened,\n for whose benefit the sum of $150 has been\n charged against the county. These racts tell\n more eloquently than any language can of tne\n general condition ol the community.\n</p>\n<p>\n Pierre ' s situation is such as to make the Indian\n auestion oue of the gi-vmtcst moment in all her\n calculations. That part of the reservation which\n is to be orenea for settlement under the Dawes\n bill is directly across the river and Pierre is\n the nearest point through it to the Black Hills.\n To reach Deudwood from Pierre by rail now one\n must travel through eastern Dakota down Into\n Iowa and Nebraska, a distance ol 1,200 nines.\n One could as easily and more cheaply go to\n New-York. Acioss the reservation the distance\n is bun 100 miles. So soon as the way is clear,\n the Chicago and Northwestern wiH span the\n Missouri with a bridge. and push its Dakota\n ifao directly into the Hills. This means every-\n , I.. n ^ to Pierre, and not only to Pierre,\n but 2 to all Central Dakota. While there\n ate no public lands left, outside of the\n reservation m the southern division ol the State,\n there is any amount of land to be bought at\n from $5 to $t > an acre, and prices along the\n railroad between Huron and Pierre are even\n lower. This stretch of country is thinly settled.\n Ic is too near the forbidden track whence nothing\n of value is to be derived, to sell well. So soon\n as the Dawes bill has done its work an imme-\n diate impulse will be felt in all this territory.\n</p>\n<p>\n Pierre is making a fierce campaign for the\n capital In every letter her citizens send away\n is inclosed an elaborate description of her natural\n resources and of the reasons why all wise and\n intelligent people will surely vote for Pierre.\n She is 2 shown to have the finest site m Dakota\n for the capitol building. A chart in vivid white,\n red and green proves here to be the geographical\n centre of the State. Wherever you go, you see\n the lettered inspiration posted in flaring colors,\n \u201c Pierre for the capital.\u201d Her citizens frankly\n acknowledge that they are going to have the\n capital if it costs them half the town. A large\n fund has been raised for campaign work. Messen-\n gers are being dispatched all through the State\n with Pierre literature, and the regular political\n canvass is being conducted in the regular political\n wav The other night I stopped for an hour\n or two at a little prairie village waiting for a\n train in wh\u2019 \" \u2019 1 to complete my journey.

It will interest many, I am sure, to\n learn the cold, hard facts about what has been\n done by the people who, coming here with\n practically nothing, have drawn right out of the\n earth in wheat and corn and Uax a substantial\n fortune. It is a widespread impression that for-\n eigners constitute the Larger part of Dakota\u2019s\n population, and it is quite true that there are\n many citizens here of German and Scandinavian\n birth. They are good citizens, too, unsurpassed\n for their common-sense, industry and patriotism.\n Incidentally it may be mentioned that they all\n vote the .Republican ticket. But they are only\n a small minority of the people. By far the greater\n part came originally from States east of tue\n Alleghenies, and thousands from New-York and\n New-England. At least four-fifths of the men in\n Dakota are under forty years of age. Gray hairs\n are rarely to be seen.\n</p>\n<p>\n In a journey of about 1,500 miles through the\n Territory, I have found only ten men who came\n here, until within the last three years, when\n manufactories began to be established, possessed\n of more than $7,500, and nine-tenths of the\n present population brought with them less than\n #500. The farmers, especially, who settled\n down under the homestead laws, were deplorably\n poor when they took up their claims. Thousands\n of them are now, ten years later, lending money.\n It goes without saying that there have been\n countless failures. Anybody can faiL The\n practical question is : What can be done in the\n way of success, and what is required to do it?\n</p>\n<p>\n These Western States are divided into square\n miles. Each square mile is called a section. One-\n fourth of a section, or 160 acres, is a homestead.\n Every foot of available soil in South Dakota is\n owned by somebody now, and to get a farm you\n must buy it. It. can be had at from $5 to $50\n an acre, tho difference in price referring not to\n the character of the soil, but to its distance from\n towns and railroads. One is assured wherever\n one goes, and in all sincerity, no doubt, that the\n lands lying just there, fifty miles either way, are\n the best in the State, but the probable fact is\n that it is all equally good. The soil is black.\n Dig till you touch bottom and you turn nothing\n up but black vegetable mould, that can never\n wash down to the clay. Seen from a distance,\n newly broken, surrounded by the green prairies,\n it looks as if a heavy coating of black paint had\n been spread all over the ground.\n</p>\n<p>\n It requires from $500 to $1,500 to establish\n one\u2019s self on a homestead. People have done\n it on $100, hut they were men of more than\n</p>\n<p>\n ordinary resolution. A house to live in must\n be built, and a barn for grain and cattle. A pair\n of horses and oxen, ploughs and other implements\n must be hud, and $5 on is as little as one can\n get along with, unless he has uncommon grit\n and plucK. From thoroughly wild lands scarcely\n anything can be realized the first year, but with\n the second season a start toward recovering\n the investment can easily be made. A farmer\n living a few miles from Watertown, who estab-\n lished himself on his homestead in 1879 with a\n cash capital of $70, produced 1,500 bushels of\n wheat the next season. His second crop was\n 2,000 bushels, and in 1887 he gathered in 5,500\n bushels. He owns 1,280 acres to-day, bought\n and paid- tor. He owns sixteen horses, thirty\n cattle, twenty-four sheep, and he has a modest\n fortune of $15,000 earning him 10 per cent\n interest. This is an unusual record, or, more\n accurately speaking, it is the record of an un-\n usually prudent and thrifty man. He did not\n start out in a gabled mansion, but in a sod\n shack. He began with a yoke of oxen, and\n waited for his trotting horses until recently.\n</p>\n<p>\n Driving over the prairie yesterday I came across\n an old man sowing his wheat. It is no offence\n to introduce yourself out here\u2014 the people are\n sociable. I stopped him when he got to the\n end of his row, and asked him how long he\u2019d\n been in Dakota.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c I ben in Dakoty,\u201d he said, \u201c goin\u2019 on eight\n</p>\n<p>\n year.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Where did you come from P\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c I were born in Vermont, but I kim here\n from Wisconsin.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c How much land do you own ?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Jest one square mile.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c How much did you own in Wisconsin ?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Two lots in a buryin\u2019 patch.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c How much wheat did you raise last year ?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Air you buyin\u2019 wheat ?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c No, but I\u2019d like to know if you don\u2019t mind\n telling.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2019Tain\u2019t no secret.

They do not occur so frequently as the\n instances of men who come and start in with\n a spread, securing more land than they can\n utilize, running in debt for their equipment,, and\n finally winding up in loss and disappointment.\n 11111 , they do occur often enough to give the\n State a solid, 1 thrifty population, to fill it with\n nice, comfortable homes, and to make it the mine\n of golden chances. Even yet. as you drive into\n the interior, you can see men living in covered\n wagons upon their claims, too poor to build\n themselves a house, but with 75 or 100\n acres ploughed up and sown.

The hill is\n about one-eighth of a mile from the town, to-\n ward. which it slopes in a very pretty way, and\n at its summit one can look across as tar a stretch\n of country as one would wish to see. Eake Peli-\n can, long and narrow, is on one side. Lake\n Kampeska, broad and wide and agate bound, is\n on the other. Behind it is the prairie, limited\n only by human sight, tinted with green and gold\n und traversed by the shadows of the clouds. Be-\n fore it is the city, than which there are hosts of\n worse-looking places. It is a choice site for\n any public building. Watertown has not been\n considered a factor in the capital fight until re-\n cently, but she has been stirred up by other\n smaller towns around here, which have urged\n her into the field, and now, an announced candi-\n date, she is running for votes To an outsider\n the capital question is delightfully amusing. Each\n town can figure out its majority before your eyes\n and show where every vote is coming from. It\n is all perfectly clear and indisputable until some-\n body from another town comes along. Then the\n figures whirl and the facts flutter, until you feel\n as if a sand blizzard had hold upon you and was\n turning you around, upside down, inside out, and\n filling nose, eyes, ears and mouth.\n</p>\n<p>\n In its animating spirit, Watertown wants noth,\n ing. It has all the push and energy that 5,000\n people could conveniently use. It is wealthy,\n as wealth goes here. Its banks in 1888 wrote\n $5,144,000 of exchange and carried from seven\n to ten millions of deposits. Its flour mill rolled\n out 90,000 barrels of flour from the grain picked\n up all around the city. Its farmers marketed\n 600,000 bushels of wheat and 155,000 bushels of\n flax, 60,000 bushels of potatoes and 73,000 pounds\n of wool. In its ten manufactories a round million\n of money is invested, and from five railroad sys-\n tems its receiving and distributing service is\n acquired.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, when you group facts a little, when you\n consjder that there are here six banking institu-\n tions, one with an office building that cost\n $ 80 , 000 ; three public school houses, and a fourth\n soon to be built at a cost of S40.000; a motor\n street railway; a handsome and trim little opera\n house; a Grand Army assembly hall; three good\n hotels, loan, trust and insurance companies, brick-\n yards, paint factories, flour mills, foundries, tan-\n neries, carriage and plough factories, and around\n it a county with 85,000 acres of land under culti-\n vation and yielding over 1,600,000 bushels of\n grain a year, where, in 1875, were but three white\n inhabitants, and in 1887 only one frame house\u2014\n when one takes a birdseye view of these, facts\n he appreciates the stuff these Western folks are\n made of. He appreciates, too, the wisdom of\n those much abused Congresses that devised the\n homestead laws aDd that made it to the practical\n advantage of capital to come out upon these\n rrairie wastes and risk money in railroads.\n It, is, I know, the popular thing\n with a certain class of politicians nowadays to\n abuse the railroads, to call their grants \u201c land-\n grabs,\u201d and to beat a tattoo upon the heads of\n the legislators who conceived the policy which has\n turned a desolate, barren, trackless wilderness into\n rich and populous States. The people who con-\n tribute t ' o that, chorus of silly chatter have never\n been West. They don\u2019t know what they are talk-\n ing about. If they would come out here they\n would soon feel heartily ashamed of themselves.\n That, individual railroad rings have done certain\n tricky or dishonest acts, that Congressional flesh\n has sometimes proved weak, may all be true, but\n what of it ? The Government policy of free homes\n</p>\n<p>\n to industrious people and of free lands to railroad\n capital, read in its practical results, is proved to\n uc one ol tne wisest, uoblest conceptions ol states-\n munsnip ever reoorueu on a statute-book. If the\n good it has done lu turning poverty into com-\n parative wealtn and misery into happiness, m con-\n tributing to the food of tne country, in relieving\n congested populations, and tiiereby diminisiiing\n crime, and in tflousands of collateral ways, could\n be put into figures and measures, the tool wflo is\n so lug a fool as to find lauit with it would be a\n curiosity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Townships in this country are blocks of land six\n miles square, and divided into sections or square\n miles, lwo sections in each township, Nos. 16\n and 3 6, are held under acts of Congress until the\n territories become States. Nobody is permitted to\n touch them, ' lfiey are called school sections, and\n when the Dakotas, Montana and Washington be-\n come States these school sections, millions of\n acres, worth millions of dollars, will be turned over\n by the National Government to that of the States,\n to be employed :n the creation and maintenance of\n a public school fund, many of tuese sections\n would sell to-day for $25,000. Some are in Che\n heart of growing ciues. These States will from\n the very start possess a school fund that will re-\n lieve the people ol all educational taxation. They\n are not waiting to avail themselves ol tins fund,\n however. They have already provided themselves\n with aa excellent graded system, and 1 mightily\n wish the people of the East could have the oppor-\n tunity to mane an analysis of the expenditures and\n tax-rates out here, it would open their eyes.\n TUese folk think nothing of spenumg $4o,ooo or\n $50,900 for school or other public buildings. And\n yet they regard a tax of one dollar on the hundred,\n the valuation being a third of the real valuation,\n as exceedingly high. Watertown\u2019s assessed\n value is $1,000,000. Its tax-rate is\n 16 1-2 mills on the dollar. The meaning\n of this is simply that the rascals are not in politics\n here. Public contracts are honest contracts.\n They are not let to enable rings to cheat the\n people. Tho engineers do not \u201c stand in\u201d with\n the contractors and the contractors with the poli-\n ticians. The people are not yet civilized to the\n point at which such methods are regarded with\n indifference.\n</p>\n<p>\n iu the Dakotan vocabulary there are two words,\n \u201c rustler\u201d and \u201c boom,\u201d which occur with marked\n frequency in every conversation. The rustler is\n the direct product of the blizzard. He moves with\n a quick, resistless force. He does not rest for\n sleep or food. He knows no weariness of the\n flesh. He has no doubts or fears. He believes\n and he is an inspirer of faith. He will build a hotel\n of 300 rooms on a stxeet^motor railway on the\n blank prairie and wait for a town to grow up\n arcund it. The town always comes, if he be a\n genuine rustler.\n</p>\n<p>\n You can ' t tell liim by his looks, nor by the cut\n of his clothes. His grammar is often addled, and\n he makes a bib of his napkin at table. But when\n he turns himself loose upon a project with money\n in it the project projects. It looms. It yawns.\n He keeps it ever in the way of your eyes, and be-\n fore you know it you begin to see rainbows\n around it.\n</p>\n<p>\n He cares nothing for money after it is made.\n Ask, and it is given you. Tell him a tale of\n woe. and out comes his purse. He would moulder\n in a week behind a desk or in a counting-room.\n He is always on the lope. To-day he is getting\n options on corner lots in Pierre. To-morrow he\n is building mills at Yankton. Then he is off to\n St. Paul bulldozing \u201c Jim\u201d Hill for more railroads,\n or off to New-York placing the stock of a new\n loan and trust company. He is interested in\n everything, lie lets no enterprise escape him.\n They\u2019ll all pay, he says, or all \u201c bust.\u201d There is\n no middle liDe out here.\n</p>\n<p>\n I rather hesitate to define a boom, but, as nearly\n as I can perceive, if is a sudden rise in values\n which, if occurring in my town, denotes sub-\n stantial and permanent progress, but in\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0017/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0017/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 537, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 868}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0017/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1075, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1736}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0017/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3473}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0017/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0017.jp2", "height": 3473, "width": 2151, "levels": 6, "size": 671209}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"17\">\n<p>\n SOUTH DAKOTA.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15\n</p>\n<p>\n your town only an unhealthy and dis-\n honest inflation.

It is only six years old, and it has\n 6.000 inhabitants. It is near the border line be-\n tween the two Dakotas. It is filled with young\n men and young women, practically all from the\n East, and a busier, brighter, quicker, sharper lot\n of people never were drawn together. There is\n something intensely fascinating about these com-\n munities. where absolute democracy prevails, where\n independence is exalted, and where the cast-iron\n rules of conventional society are not so much as\n thought about. Some amiable people the other\n evening were good enough to ask me to a recep-\n tion ; and the prettiest and most charming woman\n I met. the wife of a rich young merchant, re-\n marked that she came from Boston.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c And did your husband come from Boston ?\u201d\n I asked.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Oh, no,\u201d she said, \u201c I met him here. He came\n here a year or so after he was graduated from\n Amherst, and boarded for a while in the family\n where 1 worked l\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n She was a dainty little creature. Her voice\n was sweet, and her manner exceedingly refined.\n I glanced at her gloved hand. It was small and\n slender. At the tips of her little feet. They were\n neatly dressed. 1 looked at her costume, and\n while my knowledge of feminine apparel does not\n entitle me to speak authoritatively as to the\n degree of perfection in this case, yet there was\n certainly nothing conspicuous about it. and she\n looked trim and. in brief, .lust as she ought to\n have looked Later in the evening I asked some\n questions about her. and ascertained that she came\n West as a general domestic in the family of a\n New-Englander. Now she was the mistress of one\n of the finest houses in town and an ornament of\n society. The richest man in Aberdeen, a banker,\n</p>\n<p>\n not yet thirty-five years old. whose hand directs\n every public enterprise, and whose purse is open\n at every worthy solicitation, came into Dakota\n first as a fireman on a locomotive. He says \" was\u201d\n for \u201c were\u201d and \" them\u201d for \u201c those.\u201d but when\n he is securing employment lor the young college\n graduates who come to him a hundred a year\n they don\u2019t haggle because he isn\u2019t the scholar\n they are. His word is law in Aberdeen, and his\n edicts would be thought of no better if they were\n written in Latin.\n</p>\n<p>\n lo understand society in these new cities, it\n must be remembered that they have been built by\n every type of energetic man. They contain plenty\n of people who are used to all the refinements of\n Eastern life, and whose homes here are maintained\n in as gentle a style as prevailed in the homes they\n came from. They contain others, just a a rich and\n just as poor and ,iust as necessary to the develop-\n ment of the community and just as important in\n the community\u2019s eyes as these, who eat beans\n with a knife and drink soup from all over the\n spoon with a palpable gurgle. But neither the\n people who have been gently bred, nor those who\n came along a la Topsy, can do without the other,\n and public opinion would not tolerate an attempt\n at social discriminations. The result of the com-\n mingling of all classes is to bring out the manhood\n and womanhood of all, to teach those who have\n lacked social advantages, and to create a society\n devoid of all artificial manners, sincere, generous,\n hearty. The men do not wear dress suits at\n dinner or at evening assemblies, and the women\n rarely appear in low-neck costumes. They all put\n on the best they have, and that is sufficient. It\n would be possible, undoubtedly, to describe society\n here as crude, but that, if true, w ould be important\n only to shallow people, who are themselves not in\n the least important to these Westerners. The\n great charm of life here is that every man stands\n on his own individual merits. If he has no\n merits, he has no standing.\n</p>\n<p>\n When you look at the topography of Aberdeen\n and the country around it, you wonder why its\n first settlers started it where they did. rather than\n anywhere else. It sits down on the prairie, with\n never a tree, shrub or brook at hand,\n und with nothing to commend the ground\n it occupies as a town site over the ground for ten\n miles in any and all directions. How it has suc-\n ceeded in obtaining its rank as the second city in\n Dakota is explained in its railroad relations. It\n has grabbed for railroads every time it saw the\n chance of getting one. It has thought no sacri-\n fice too great if only a new railroad was the com-\n pensation. This sagacious policy has given it\n an immense tributary country, with thirteen rail-\n road lines distributing its produce, manufactures\n and other goods. Its merchants sell, not exclu-\n sively, but largely to 100,0\u201d0 people, scattered\n along 1,100 miles of railroad running into Aber-\n deen as the nearest or best point of supply. This\n situation is an advantage as well to the farmers\n around Aberdeen as to the merchants in it. With\n such unusual opportunities of putting their prod-\n uce upon the market, they have cultivated their\n land thoroughly. Every available acre in Brown\n County is growing grain or feeding stock, and in\n 188ft, the 9000 farmers of Brown County grew\n 5,000.000 bushels of wheat, a trifle more than one\n per cent of the whs.it crop of the whole world. Be-\n ing thus profitably engaged in actual business, Aber-\n deen has taken no part whatever in the \u201cboom\u201d\n speculations, a circumstance which cannot be esti-\n mated too much to its credit. It possesses nine flnan-\n eial institutions\u2014 banks, loan and mortgage com-\n panies\u2014 -with a capital of 82,350,000. They do an\n enormous business in small loans of about $2 per\n acre upon improved and cultivated farms. I sup-\n pose, from what I can see and^ hear, that no class of\n investment, if wisely made, is so richly profitable\n as these Western farm mortgages, and for the very\n good reason that men can come out here practi-\n cally penniless and pay for their farms in a sin-\n gle crop of w ' heat. A farmer near Aberdeen told\n me that upon 1,600 bushels of wheat, sold at 82\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0018/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0018/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0018/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0018/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0018/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0018.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 751505}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"18\">\n<p>\n 16\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n cents, his net profit was $1,044 60.

A local\n boomer got hold of the farmers in the adjacent\n country and made them contribute what amounted\n to 10,000 days\u2019 work grading a railroad. The\n railroad was prepared to be ironed, the company\n was organized and he was sent East to get hold of\n capital. An admiring friend of his told me the\n story. \u201c Bill, ye know,\u201d said he, \u201c didn\u2019t hev\n no money\u2014 not a blame cent.

As things are now, the people\n have no protection against these boomers. There\n are no banking laws to protect depositors, and\n no adequate insurance laws to protect policy-\n holders. The remedy for this condition of affairs\n will be quickly applied next winter, and the\n influence of Aberdeen, always a centre of con-\n servative business methods, will be felt heavily\n on the side of wise and honest laws. Real estate\n is low in Aberdeen, and largely held by its own\n people. Business houses can be obtained at rentals\n which invite business establishments, and while\n no vacant, property exists, it can be and constantly\n is being built on sound conditions and at reason-\n able terms.\n</p>\n<p>\n In coming to Aberdeen I supposed I was at\n last going to meet an unselfish community who\n could tell me candidly where the capital of South\n Dakota would be placed. All through the State\n I had been assured that Aberdeen was not in\n the race, that her geographical situation at the\n extreme north of the lower Dakota had led her\n to decide against any effort to get the prize.\n But this proves to be false information. Aberdeen\n is very much in the race. She says she has\n 12,000 votes at her command, and they are good\n for either one capital or two or more railroads, she\n doesn\u2019t particularly care which. I grieve to say\n that the bartering between towns and individuals\n upon this capital question is fast assuming colossal\n proportions. Sometimes you can\u2019t distinguish\n it from downright bribery. Each of the candi-\n date cities is going to get something out of the\n contest, if not the capital, then a railroad or a\n State institution or an important office, or some-\n thing. It is a shame to find decent people\n</p>\n<p>\n countenancing this sort of business. They don\u2019t\n seem to understand that its influence upon their\n political morals is surely and actively corrupting.\n The other day in one of the towns 1 visited I\n was invited to take a walk to the spot where,\n i was assured, the capitol building was bound\n to go. The individual who escorted me descauted\n with great fervor and pride on the beauty ol the\n proposed site. When we reached it, he pointed\n out its many attractions. \u201cSeel\u201d he said, with\n a series oi enthusiastic gesticulations, \u201c ain\u2019t\n that a splendid hi il r ' \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n I said it looked like a good, substantial\n hill.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Look at the river I\u201d he cried. \u201cAin\u2019t it a\n beautiful stream ?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n it was a nice river.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLook at those bluffs I\u201d he continued. \u201cDid\n you ever in ail your life see such bluffs as them,\n such big, round, sightly bluffs ?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Nothing, in truth, ailed the bluffs.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Well, now,\u201d said he, \u201c what do you think, on\n the whole, of that site!\u201d\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n I said 1 thought it a first-rate site.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Me an\u2019 some of my friends,\u201d he went onj\n in a lower tone, \u201c owns all this here land, \u2019bout\n a thousand acres.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n I remarked that that was very nice for him and\n his friends.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c We\u2019re platting it now,\u201d he said ; \u201c laying it out\n in town lots. 1 s\u2019pose it\u2019ll take half of \u2019em to get\n the capital.

I\u2019m real glad you like the site.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n There was a moment\u2019s pause, and then he put his\n hands on his hips, grinned amiably, and remarked:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c There\u2019s no reason in the world why you shouldn\u2019t\n pave that there corner lot, if you\u2019d like itl\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Immigrants are pushing rapidly into the coun-\n try west of Aberdeen. Within eighteen months\n nearly e,000 Russians have arrived, planted a city\n and tilled up 2,000 homesteads. They call their\n town Eureka. It is as lively a spot as I have seen\n in Dakota. An immigrant train with sixty new\n families arrived yesterday. When it approached\n Eureka the peasants began to sing hymns, to\n cheer, to hug and kiss each other, and some of\n them, quite overcome with their emotions, joyful\n and otherwise, sobbed aloud. They were a fine-\n looking body of hardy men and women, and are\n welcomed by the people generally. The banks\n out here trust them implicitly, and supply them\n with all the money they want.. They work with an\n industry hardly credible, and get out of debt with-\n out fail after their second or third season. All\n the Russians around Eureka were at the depot yes-\n terday awaiting the newcomers. Hundreds of\n horses and carriages blocked the streets, and a\n crowd had gathered that completely filled the open\n space around the station. They went wild with\n delight. They shouted and sang as the train was\n discharged of its human cargo, and, rushing up to\n their friends gave them the Russian salute. Each\n nut an arm about the other\u2019s neck while they\n smacked their ups together < n two resounding\n kisses. This was done quite indiscriminately, men\n kissing men as well as women. In the afternoon\n they disappeared into the country, where, in tho\n majority of cases, their homesteads have already\n been selected for them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Their houses are all built in the old-country\n style. They make big bricks, a foot square, of\n the white clay to be found in vast deposits among\n the Coteau Hills, and dry them in the sun. Then\n they build of these a low, long house, one story\n in height, and containing four or five rooms\n formed by partitions placed at proper distances\n through the house. The walls are about 1 8 inches\n thick, with apertures here and there for windows.\n At one end of the building, which is often 200\n feet long, is the stable ; at the other, the dairy and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0019/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0019/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 537, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 868}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0019/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1075, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1736}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0019/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3473}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0019/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0019.jp2", "height": 3473, "width": 2151, "levels": 6, "size": 642916}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"19\">\n<p>\n SOUTH DAKOTA.\n</p>\n<p>\n 17\n</p>\n<p>\n granary.

GBEELEY.\n</p>\n<p>\n HIS WIDE INFLUENCE AMONG EARLY WEST-\n ERN SETTLERS.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE GREAT DAKOTA WATERSHED \u2014 MILBANK\n AND ITS SURROUNDINGS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Milbank, South Dakota, May 3.\n</p>\n<p>\n In wandering about the Western country, one\n is quickly impressed with the strong and per.\n vasive influence exerted by Mr. Greeley upon\n Western immigration. Of the early settlers, every\n third man bases his highest claim to distinction\n upon the fact that, he once had a letter from\n Mr. Greeley or an interview with him. There\n must be hundreds and hundreds of Mr. Greeley\u2019s\n \u201c Go West\u201d letters treasured on the walls or\n hidden away in the drawers or old \u201c secretaries\u2019 - '\n in the farm houses of Minnesota and Dakota.\n He was that sort of unique genius, as bis friends\n well remember, to whom everybody felt entitled\n to go for advice; and not once, but half a\n dozen times have I been met with some such\n greeting as this, from grizzled old fellows who\n first crossed the plains in a prairie schooner :\n \u201cFrom The Tribune, hey? Well, now, really 1\n I bin takin\u2019 The Tribune ever sence it begun. I\n uster know Mr. Greeley down in York State when\n he come our way, speakin\u2019. I had a letter from\n him onct. I writ to him askin\u2019 what he thort\n about my cornin\u2019 West, and I\u2019ll show what he\n writ back.\u201d Then they hunt around and present-\n ly fish out one of Mr. Greeley\u2019s disconcerting\n communications, browned with age, and ask me\n to read it. Well, maybe I do, or maybe I don\u2019t,\n but I manage to leave them satisfied. The gen-\n eration sent inte the West by Mr. Greeley, to Kan-\n sas, Illinois, Wisconsin, and those States, to which\n Dakotans refer as \u201c down East,\u201d is now some-\n what advanced in years. But their children re-\n main, and with them the name of Horace Greeley\n stands for the highest courage and wisdom.\n There is something touching about the affectionate\n way in which he is mentioned in the West, and\n</p>\n<p>\n particularly by the children of those who were,\n in the stricter sense, his contemporaries, and who\n knew the sympathetic interest he always took in\n Western problems. People act on their impulses\n here, and there is probably no quicker way of\n creating a riot than by assailing the memory of\n Horace Greeley.\n</p>\n<p>\n In Aberdeen I ran across an old man who\n glories m an experience with Mr. Greeley, to the\n story of which every one who meets him is expected\n to listen. He was an Iowa pioneer. He had\n lived in Ncw-England, and once he heard Mr.\n Greeley lecture on the West. That settled him.\u2019\n He took a homestead in Iowa, near a little town\n which he soon came to look upon as the best\n and grandest spot on the footstool. While visit-\n ing New-York afterward he thought he would\n call on Mr. Greeley and tell him about \u201c Kolly\n P\u2019int.\u201d So I went to The Trybune Buildin\u2019,\u201d he\n says, \u201c an\u2019 w\u2019en it come my turn I went inter\n the room where Mr. Greeley was. I guess the\n man that was in the room before me must hev\n riled him some, fer he looked mad. an\u2019 jest give\n me a nod as much as ter say, \u2018Speak quick!\u2019 So\n I sailed in. I tole him he was the means o\u2019 my\n goin\u2019 West, an\u2019 I\u2019d settled at \u201c Kolly P\u2019int an*\n it was the finest place in the country, an\u2019 he\n orter put a piece in the paper sayin\u2019 so.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018Les ' see,\u2019 sez\u2019e, \u2018ain\u2019t thet the town where nine\n men was kilt by a desperado a little w\u2019ile ergo?\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWell, they hed been a little kinder squabble\n there on account of a cow-puncher ridin\u2019 aroun\u2019\n town shootin\u2019 people, and I s\u2019pose they was\n somebody got hurt. So I sez: \u2018Yes, thet\u2019s the\n town,\u2019 and he give a grunt. I see then thet I\n hed ter \u2019polergize fer the cow-puncher, so I sez,\n sez I: \u2018Kolly Pint is a splendid place, Mrj\n Greeley. It hez the finest soil, the finest air,\n the finest water you ever see. It don\u2019t need\n Dothin\u2019 in the worl\u2019, ' ceppin\u2019 a little good serciety\n an\u2019 a little rain.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018Hump!\u2019 sez\u2019ee. \u2018thet ' s all Hell needs!\u2019\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Dakota is not as badly off as Kolly P\u2019int and the\n other place in the matter of society, but it does\n need rain. No problem is so full of difficulty\n as that which attends the proper irrigation of\n the soil. If, at the appropriate season, a suffi-\n ciency of water gets into the ground it will stay\n there, and its effect in keeping the soil fresh and\n damp will be felt for months. It cannot get\n through the hard clay that lies under the soil\n proper, and the soil, a spongy substance, holds it\n in suspension and uses every drop of it.. But\n this is not enough, or, at least, it cannot be\n depended on. It was because people believed\n it never rained in this region that Dakota, a\n dozen years ago, was termed the \u201c Great Ameri-\n can Desert.\u201d Undoubtedly the rainfall is in-\n creasing every year as the broken ground in-\n creases, and the conditions that generate moisture\n multiply. The people need waterways. They\n need sources from which irrigating streams can\n be drawn.\n</p>\n<p>\n Just north of Milbank is the line which separates\n the waters of North America\u2014 \u201c the Divide,\u201d as\n they call it here. There are two long, narrow\n lakes marking the boundary between Dakota and\n Minnesota. The waters of the lower lake, Big\n Stone, empty through the Minnesota River into\n the Mississippi at Fort Snelling, a few miles\n below St. Paul, and are carried thence to the\n Gulf.

They rise among and run through a\n range of \u201c coteaus and coolies.\u201d or. as we should\n term them in the East, hills and ravines, which,\n thirty miles wide, extend, north and south, a\n distance of 125 miles. The coteaus rise about\n 1,000 feet above Hie prairies, and are ccvered\n with natural timber. They are already availing\n to devote the country around Milbank to the rais-\n ing of stock. They furnish grazing grounds and\n shelter for large herds of sheep and cattle. Every\n year the droves grow larger and this branch of\n industry more important. Throughout Dakota an\n interest in blooded stock is developing. At Yank-\n tou. at Watertown, at Aberdeen, and particularly\n at Milbank. large stables of line imported horses\n and cattle have been established. One stable at\n Milbank contains twelve magnificent Clydesdales\n brought directly rroiu Scotland to be sold as\n breeders of draft horses. Several Hainbletonians,\n with pedigrees as long as their legs, are creating\n a trotting stock whose records are not to be\n despised. Hundreds of polled Angus cattle have\n been brought over recently from Aberdeen. Scot-\n land. The natural result of these importations\n is to produce throughout Dakota a high class of\n horses and cattle.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here, as everywhere else in South Dakota, the\n instances of phenomenally successful farming are\n multiplied, until the conclusion seems irresistible,\n as it really is, that a man can\u2019t work and stay\n poor. The country about Milbank is nine years\n old. but it is thickly settled and under cultiva-\n tion already. In 1880 the first editor in Milbank\n brought his printing outfit across the plains in\n an ox-cart. He issued a paper when there were\n not white men enough in the county to fill the\n public offices and half-breed Indians had to be\n employed in important places. I have already told\n how the railroads preceded civilization in Dakota.\n A chapter might well be written on the experiences\n of the editors who preceded the railroads. They\n must have been in love with their profession.\n When men print newspapers in a region inhabited\n only by themselves, a \u201c bunch of Iniuns\u201d and an\n occasional jack-rabbit, it is tolerably clear that\n the printing of newspapers was their destiny.\n They furnish a powerful argument for the Theo-\n sophist. If they were not working off the sins\n of an earlier existence, what under the sun were\n they doing?\n</p>\n<p>\n There are Indians at Milbank, and, as usual,\n the problem is how to make them honest and in-\n dustrious. They are the Sisseton and Wahpcton\n Sioux\u2014 dwellers by the lakes and dwellers among\n the leaves. They number less than 1,500 anil\n they have 1,000,000 acres of land that they\n neither use nor let any one else use. These\n Sioux are civilized Sioux. They all wear civilized\n clothes and go to church on Sunday. Their two\n great men are the chief and the preacher. A\n \u201c bunch\u201d of them\u2014 they \u201c bunch\u201d Indians in this\n</p>\n<p>\n country\u2014 went down to Watertown last summer\n to attend the fair. Races were arranged for\n them; in fact, an entire day was given up to\n their amusement. But, somehow, nothing seemed\n to please them. They were glum and ugly.\n They stood around and grunted, did more or less\n thieving, but upon no consideration would they\n become cheerful. The fair committee, in some\n distress, appealed to their native clergyman, a\n big Injun of vast influence among them. What\n ailed the Indians ? the committee asked. Why\n weren\u2019t they enjoying themselves ? The preacher,\n Grenville by name, made a gesture of disgust.\n \u201c Bah! \u2019 he said, \u201c white man no gamble a cent!\u201d\n These Indians, as I said before, are civilized.\n</p>\n<p>\n Efforts are now being made to open the reserva-\n tion to settlement. Under the present law it\n can be done by the proclamation of the President\n upon the Indians giving their consent. They are\n tractable. Ail they want is money. They have\n taken their lands in severalty and are self-sup-\n porting to an extent. It doesn\u2019t take a great deal\n to support beings who esteem dead dogs a delicacy.\n As for this being the fact, let no one deny it. I\n have seen enough of the Indian ' to know that he\n is the dirtiest thing that walks on two legs.\n</p>\n<p>\n L. E.

Our National system,\n it is true, is wonderfully elastic. It admits of\n the harmmious operation of interests wholly di-\n verse and ordinarily opposite. In a political\n envelope less ethereal, less sympathetic, disorder\n would be inevitable.

When this is considered, and\n when we test our recollections to discover\n how much or how little we have followed the\n amazing story of Northwestern development, and\n the history of the political oppression these people\n have suttered, the statement may not be so very\n surprising that in their single-handed light for\n their rights they have more than once approached\n the line between constitutional agitation and ac-\n tive rebellion. There have been times during the\n last four years when it was an open question with\n many of them whether, between the evils of ex-\n pelling their oppressors or permitting themselves\n to be robbed and outraged, they would not fare\n better on the whole by taking the revolutionary\n course. It will ever remain an honor to the\n founders of these States that harassed with so\n many internal jealousies, fought with so many\n unfair and malicious weapons at Washington, they\n have succeeded in their undertaking without com-\n promise on the one hand or violence on the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dakota, as cut from Minnesota, was a block of\n land 400 miles square. The southern part of it\n was settled more rapidly than the northern, and\n by a different class of people, who came upon a\n different plan and engaged in a different pur-\n suit. The people of Vermont are not more dis-\n tinct as a type from the people of Georgia than\n are the settlers of South Dakota from their\n neighbors north of the 7th standard parallel.\n The South Dakotans are engaged in general\n farming upon small holdings of from 160 to\n 320 acres. The North Dakotans raise nothing\n but wheat and stock and they operate upon a\n colossal scale. There are many farms in North\n Dakota of 20,000 acres. In North Dakota\n there are the extremes of wealth and poverty to\n be found wherever tie employers are few and the\n employed many. In South Dakota wealth and\n poverty are comparative terms. There are no\n palaces and no poor-houses. The Territorial\n Government of Dakota was established in 1861,\n and by 1880 the diversity of interest between\n North and South became so apparent that both sec-\n tions were favorably disposed toward division,\n which became at about that time an organized\n movement.\n</p>\n<p>\n Until Mr. Cleveland\u2019s inauguration there had\n been no party politics in Dakota. Everybody\n had a general idea as to the party attachments\n of everybody else, and the Republicans possessed\n an organization, but in conventions and other as-\n semblies intended to promote the welfare of the\n Territory, and in the Territorial Legislature, no\n partisan distinctions were made. .Everybody\n could get himself nominated who made the effort,\n and voters often had a chance to choose between\n half a dozen aspirants. As distinguished from\n party polities, there existed a sort, of town politics,\n the demoralizing effects of which are still ap-\n parent in the South Dakota capital contest.\n Men went to the Legislature, not to advance the\n interests of the whole people, not to make laws\n for the whole Territory, but to get what they\n could for their own towns. Their availability\n as political leaders was measured, not by the\n wisdom of their general course, but simply by\n what they got for their friends. In this respect,\n and very naturally, every Legislature was worse\n than the last, one. This body became a sort of\n grab-bag. Little time was wasted on the con-\n sideration of general laws. The code became an\n inconsistent jumble. What one Legislature did,\n the next undid. There was no restraint, no an-\n chorage, no fundamental law. and so far as a\n government existed, it was simply one of give\n and take. If one town received an appropria-\n tion for a school of mines, then another one had\n to have a university. The rule was that you\n</p>\n<p>\n could only get what you wanted by giving me\n what I wanted.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this eternal clashing of town interests North\n Dakota drew most of the prizes. The politicians\n of N orth Dakota almost invariably outmanoeuvred\n their rivals of the South. They were, and are, an\n uncommonly clever set of men, and they worked\n together, contriving at the same time to divide\n the South and split it into factions. Then they\n combined with whichever Southern faction it\n seemed best to combine with, and they and their\n allies got the pudding. But their affections were\n iickle. Now they stood by one faction, then by\n another, and then again by a third, until they\n had alternately won and lost the favor of the\n entire South, and the conviction had gradually\n sunk into the minds of both sections that their\n ways lay apart, that they were too different in\n motive, in manner and in habit, to assimilate\n advantageously. This was the condition of pub-\n lic sentiment when in 1883 a call was circulated\n through South Dakota for a convention to meet\n at Huron to form a State Constitution. It was\n proposed to create a State, to be called Dakota, of\n which the northern boundary should be the\n forty-sixth parallel. An earlier effort had been\n made to get the State admitted in 1881, and it\n had failed only by a fluke which furnished the\n Democrats in the Territory choice material for\n inflammatory speeches. A railroad had been built\n from Yankton to somewhere, and its bonds were\n .hieflv held in Maine. It bad failed and\n defaulted, and its Maine creditors were com-\n pelled to whistle for their money. Their Con-\n gressional Representatives, all Republicans,\n prompted by tins lne.dent, opposed the Dakota\n bill, and beat, it, contending that people who\n didn\u2019t pay their debts were not yet fit for citizen-\n ship. This was an unfortunate affair, though\n not an unnatural one, for there had been no\n preliminary agitation of any account on the\n Statehood question, and Congress was poorly\n informed on the merits of the Admission bill, quite\n aside from the Maine grievance.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the Huron Convention they made a\n series of absurd speeches, advocating the\n expulsion of the Federal Governor by\n force and the establishment of a State Gov-\n ernment which Congress might admit or not, just\n as it chose. They had a considerable following,\n too, but wiser men carried the day, and the only\n outcome of the convention was a call to the\n people south of the 4 6th parallel to elect\n delegates to a second convention to meet at\n Sioux Falls in September.\n</p>\n<p>\n There was an even hundred present at this as-\n sembly. One-third of the members were Democrats.\n An once the convention divided into Conservatives\n and Radicals. All the Democrats were Radicals\n and they indulged in much bitter\n talk. They wanted to give the Government at\n Washington to undertsand that they would stand\n no more nonsense. Dakota must be divided; the\n northern half was a drag on the south; the two\n sections were in no way sympathetic; the time\n for talk was gone, and it was now high time to\n act. This oratory was met, ot course, by the\n practical question, \u201c What do you propose to do?\u201d\n But the Radicals could furnish no very definite\n answer. They contented themselves with the\n threat to go home. They urged that if the Con-\n servati/es didn\u2019t mean business, they ought to\n sav so. Finally the convention settled down to\n the work of forming the constitution, and three\n full weeks were spent in that serious labor. Its\n issue was an instrument ol ' much strength and\n beauty in many respects, and notably in its sim-\n plicity. its directness, its lucidity and its happy\n grouping of constitutional forms and declarations,\n a model of which a far more experienced people\n might well be proud. Upon its completion the\n storm broke out with renewed fury between the\n Conservatives and Radicals concerning the methods\n that should be employed to give it effect.

But\n again conservative men succeeded in stem-\n ming the revolutionary tide, and it was\n finally decided simply to appoint a committee to\n present the convention\u2019s petition to Congress,\n and in the hope that this orderly plan would avail\n the convention adjourned.\n</p>\n<p>\n Until this moment the people north of the 46th\n parallel had been as warmly committed to the\n policy of division as those south of it. But an\n incident occurred in the Legislature that immedi.\n ateiy succeeded this convention which rendered the\n North Dakotans less anxious to be cut away. The\n Territorial capital was Yankton, in the extreme\n southeast. Feeble efforts to remove it uad been\n frequently made, but none of them amounted to\n much until the organizing genius of Larmon G.\n Johnson was brought to bear upon the scheme\n to do a good thing for Dakota, and incidentally\n for himself and his friends, by placing the capital\n buildings at Ordway. Johnson is a Democrat,\n and as brilliant a politician as the Territory con-\n tains. \u2018In the light of events his scheme seems\n preposterous, but his failure to carry it through\n was not due to the fact that his dice were not\n loaded. He had things about as well fixed as\n is possible to any finite hand. Ordway was a\n two-penny little hamlet, squatted upon the prairie\n at a point that was the centre of thle Territory\u2019s\n population. Mr. Johnson lived there, moved\n there, had his being there. He was practically\n all there was to Ordway. In appearance he does\n not look an intellectual giant, but he possesses\n great nerve, and he \u201c rustles.\u201d He and his\n friends bought about 40,000 acres around Ordway,\n and when he began to agitate the removal question\n he knew what he was about. He was unable to\n induce the Legislature to discharge its functions\n directly, for its members were timid, but he\n worked through a bill appointing nine commis-\n sioners with full and final powers to place the\n capital where they chose. The commission spent\n several months junketing about the Territory, os-\n tensibly considering the claims of the various\n towns. But none of them offered such induce-\n ments as Ordway. Ordway was prepared to build\n the State a $250,000 Capitol and give it land\n enough for a stock farm.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the commission began to ballot, Mr. John-\n son felt quite confident of the issue. One man,\n however, weakened. The papers had been saying\n disagreeable things about him, hinting that Mr.\n Johnson had \u201c fixed\u201d him, and his hand faltered.\n The commission began to ballot, taking precious\n good care not to do so effectively, ard after a\n while Bismarck received four votes. The starch-\n less gentleman made it five, and went to Bismarck\n to live. Mr. Johnson made a few picturesque\n remarks, returned to Ordway, and putting his\n town on wheels, carted it off to Aberdeen. An\n elderly German innkeeper was about all he left\n in the deserted village. She was reduced to de-\n spair. She stood out in the twilight one evening\n watching the town as it disappeared across the\n prairie. Mr. Johnson rode up on his pony. They\n were a solemn pair.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Well, mother,\u201d said he, affectionately, \u201c you\u2019re\n not looking well.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Ah, Mr. Shonson,\u201d she replied, with a sob,\n \u201c how now I make my life 1\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Johnson stroked his mustache thoughtfully.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Er\u2014 mm,\u201d he said, \u201c I\u2019m doing a little thinking\n on that point myself.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The effect upon Northern sentiment of the re-\n moval of the capital to Bismarck was at once\n apparent. Bismarck is in the heart of North\n Dakota and the Northern people, having the\n capital safely in their grasp, now became dis-\n tinctively cool about the division project. Thev\n were also annoyed at the South for refusing their\n proposition to divide on the 7th standard parallel,\n which separates counties from counties, rather\n</p>\n<p>\n than on the 4 6th, and to call the States North\n Dakota and South Dakota. The Sioux Fails con.\n vention had adopted the name Dakota, to which\n the North justly felt it had as much claim a., the\n South. In the meanwhile the committee sent to\n Washington by the convention had returned, after\n spending the winter at the National Capital, with\n nothing but discouragement and failure to report.\n It was in no very good humor, therefore, that the\n Kepublican Territorial Convention of 1864 met\n in Pierre to nominate a candidate for Congress.\n</p>\n<p>\n They tell me that of all the shows on earth\n a Territorial Convention is the funniest. Be the\n end sought great or small, be the offices disposed\n of important or trivial, no Territorial Convention\n would think of adjourning in less than two or\n three days. They meet and fuss a little and go\n to dinner, come back and fuss some more and go\n to tea, return and fuss like everything and go to\n bed. On the morning of the second day, they\n are beginning to feel in good shape, like a race-\n horse after he has got warmed up, and they\n enter upon the day\u2019s fussing with a robust enthu-\n siasm. The excitement is usually at its height\n on the evening of the second day, when John H.\n King, the General Husted of Dakota, is always\n called to the chair. King is the only chairman\n who has been known to survive the second night\n of a Territorial Convention. On the third day\n being somewhat tired, it usually occurs to the\n convention to do the ten-minute job for which it\n assembled. A ballot is taken, and the thing is\n over. The Pierre convention, however, eclipsed\n all that had gone before. For four days and\n nights the flood-gates of everybody\u2019s wrath were\n kept open. The only real business to be done\n was to nominate a Congressman, who was only a\n half Congressman at that, but not until the\n fifth day did they get down to work. Then they\n all began to explain to one another, and North\n and South, parted on good terms, reunited in\n favor of division. The Southern men, however,\n seem to have been pursued by a fatality. As\n soon as the Legislature met they hatched a\n scheme to rob Bismarck of the capitol and to\n send it down to Pierre. They actually passed\n such a bill, which the Governor wisely vetoed.\n But its effect was to arouse the resentment of\n the North against the South with renewed\n vigor.\n</p>\n<p>\n This, then, was the condition of affairs when Mr.\n Cleveland became President. In the twinkling of\n an eye the Democratic party of the Territory\n sprang into organized being, and the larger part\n of it hurried off to Washington to give the Ad-\n ministration some good advice. It came buck solid\n agairst division. Those dauntless Radicals who.\n the year before, had wanted to smash everybody\u2019s\n head, who were going to divide and set up a\n State Government whether or no, now, meek as\n lambs and twice as guileless, urged the sweet\n virtues ol moderation and peace. Every Demo-\n crat in South Dakota, without, enoueh exceptions\n to fill a claim shanty, doubled on his record, and\n from a rampant Divisionist, ripe for rebellion,\n became a One State man, inclined to think a\n Territorial form of government,, after all, the\n best! The Democrats then gave themselves over\n to the business of grabbing for office. They had\n no time to fool -with unprofitable questions of how\n to found an empire. Keeeiverships. collector-\n ships, land offices judicial offices\u2014 upon the e tlrnos\n their hearts and minds were concentrated with\n an intense and lusty longing. They said that\n circumstances altered cases: that the sacred lib-\n erties of the people were no longer in danger of\n being overthrown, and that with a, good man like\n Cleveland holding the plums of official patronage\n and dealing them out to trusty souls, the Terri-\n tory would get, along better than if it were running\n itself. The Legislature of 1884 had summoned\n another Constitutional Convention\u2014 the third\u2014 to\n meet- at Sioux Falls in September, 1885. It came\n togethp\u201d under rather a gloomy sky.\n</p>\n<p>\n I shall continue and conclude this historical and\n political sketch in a later article. L. E.

It was well understood before the Sioux\n Fails Convention of 1885 assembled that the\n Democrats in a body would oppose all they had\n been theretofore seeking to accomplish. Stories\n were already in circulation vagueJy\u2019hinting that\n there had been immense land frauds committed\n in Dakota under the Republican Administrations,\n and the sinister suggestion appeared in many\n forms and through many sources, that in all\n probability at least half the patents issued to\n the small farmers of South Dakota would have\n to be revoked by the virtuous gentlemen who\n were conducting the Nation\u2019s affairs. The Trib-\n une\u2019s Washington correspondent, it will be\n remembered\u2014 and is most gratefully remembered\n here\u2014 pounced at once upon these adroitly cir-\n culated stories and declared with some warmth\n and directness that the officials of the Interior\n Department, seconded by the Territorial Democ-\n racy, were engaged in a conspiracy to steal the\n proposed new State from the Republicans. It\n was charged that Mr. Lamar had gone into the\n Interior Office as Mr. Whitney went into the Naval\n Office, resolutely determined to prove fraud on\n his predecessor, whether there was any fraud to\n prove or not. Before taking off their hats and\n coats, they gave the public to understand that\n there would be some exposures now, right off.\n There would be no more nouscuse, and with many\n mysterious nods and winks they notified the\n country that it should shortly be put into posses-\n sion of some hair-lifting facts.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sparks\u2019s antics in the Land Office were par-\n ticularly disquieting to the Dakota farmers. At\n first they didn\u2019t understand just what was meant.\n They didn\u2019t quite see the point\u2014 they didn\u2019t ;atch\n the idea that their patents were fraudulent only\n in case they eoninued to vote the Republican\n ticket, and that if they concluded to readjust\n their political relations they would thereby im-\n part a saving grace to their land titles. All they\n perceived at first was that the rights they had\n acquired, and the claims upon which thousands\n were about to submit their final proofs, were\n suddenly menaced by an indefinite charge of\n fraud, brought by the very official who was con-\n stituted in law the judge of the evidence.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another affair that caused much grumbling and\n alarm was the sudden reversal of President\n Arthur\u2019s order opening the Crow Creek Indian\n Reservation. This reservation, comprising 622,000\n acres, is on the eastern bank of the Missouri, just\n above Chamberlain, and almost engulfing that\n young city, it can be laid open for settlement\n upon the President\u2019s order. General Arthur, after\n a careful study of the law and the facts, issued\n a proclamation on February 17, 1885, opening the\n</p>\n<p>\n lands, and settlers went in by hundreds. In two\n weeks claims were filed on about half the reserva-\n tion, a thousand shanties were being built, and\n the hammer and plough were everywhere at work.\n On March 17, thirteen days after he took office,\n Mr. Cleveland annulled General Arthur\u2019s action so\n maturely taken, closed the reservation, and ordered\n the settlers oft. Only a few obeyed this order,\n and the President, as if determined to admit of\n nothing that tended to make Dakota greater or\n more prosperous, sent a troop of soldiers and drove\n the settlers from the reservation. They went out\n literally at the point of the bayonet, and looked\n back to see the Indians, unmolested, burning and\n cutting down the little houses in which, upon the\n Government s own offer, they had established\n themselves. The local Democracy, emboldened by\n these demonstrations and returning from Washing-\n ton loaded with instructions, were soon indis-\n creetly declaring what the policy was that had\n been determined upon. They said it was highly\n important that the Senators to be admitted with\n the new State should be Democrats, and so soon\n as it was reasonably clear that the Democratic\n minority would become upon Dakota\u2019s admission\n a majority, all would be well. To that end it\n was necessary to manufacture some Democratic\n voters in the Territory.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Sioux Falls Convention, not heeding these\n political clouds, met quietly and did its work.\n It drew up a new Constitution, and again the\n proposition was made to elect State officers and\n form a State Government, but it was received with\n coldness by the- late Radicals. Twitted with their\n inconsistency, they naively replied that they were\n satisfied with the way things were going now, and\n they couldn\u2019t think of disturbing it. By a large\n majority, however, the convention voted to order\n a State election, but it was patriotically and\n wisely provided that the government thus con-\n stituted should perform only such acts as were\n preliminary ' to the Territory\u2019s admission and\n necessary to secure favorable action from Congress\n upon its petition. The Constitution was sub-\n mitted to the people south of the forty-sixth\n parallel immediately! and, in a total vote of\n 31,791, its majority was 18,561. Under its pro-\n visions and by popular election, a State Govern-\n ment was organized, with the Hon. Arthur C.\n Mellette at its head. Governor Mellette has re-\n</p>\n<p>\n cently been appointed by President Harrison to the\n office for which he was thus selected by the people\n of his State. The strong common-sense which\n has so highly distinguished the conduct of the\n Dakotans in civil affairs was never more con-\n spicuously shown than in his selection as their\n leader. He is a large-minded, liberal-hearted man.\n In physical form and in mental quality he is\n built on a large scale. He has none of the arts\n of the smart politician. He could not be cunning\n if he tried ever so much. Sincerity and di-\n rectness are his most conspicuous characteristics.\n He does not know how to bargain and arrange,\n but he does know how to plan and execute. In\n his personal appearance he is startlingly like\n General Garfield, and those who know him say\n the resemblance does not stop there, but that in\n temper and in his cheery, optimistic faith he is\n Garfield over again.\n</p>\n<p>\n Governor Mellette\u2019s coadjutors in the new State\n organization were the Hon. Hugh S. Murphy,\n Secretary of State ; the Hon. D. W. Diggs, Treas-\n urer ; the Hon. Frank Alexander, Auditor, and\n the Hon. Robert Dollard, Attorney-General.\n General W. H. H. Beadle was chosen Commissioner\n of School Lands, his duties being to administer\n upon the fund to be raised for public school\n purposes by the sale or leasing of sections 16 and\n 3 6, each a square mile in area, reserved by the\n United States out of every township, or block of\n 36 square miles, to be donated to the State,\n when formed. A. S. Jones was made Superin-\n tendent of Public Instruction. The Hon. O. S-\n Gifford and the Hon. Theodore D. Kanouse were\n elected to Congress, and when the Legislature\n met in December it chose Judge G. C. Moody,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0024/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0024/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0024/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0024/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0024/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0024.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 724118}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"24\">\n<p>\n 22\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n of the Black Hills, and Judge A. J. Edgerton,\n of this city, to be United Suites Senators. The\n Governor, the two Senators and the two Congress-\n men were appointed a committee to go to Wash-\n ington and to present the Territorial case to Con-\n gress.\n</p>\n<p>\n General Harrison was at this time chairman of\n the Senate Committee on Territories, aud he\n espoused the cause of Dakota with an enthusiasm\n that left no doubt of the result in the chamber\n in whicn he was a leader. But the moment they\n encountered the Presiuent they struck shoals.\n That tireless and keen-witted Ordway statesman,\n the Hon. Harmon G. Johnson, of whose brilliant\n device to capture the eapitol I have already told\n you, had preceded them and had taken complete\n possession of the President\u2019s ears. Mr. Johnson\n was a one-State man. He was not a believer\n in the Democratic notion that a Republican\n majority of 20,000 could be starved and bull-\n dozed into subjection. He knew that both\n divisions of the Territory were surely and salely\n Republican, and he could see no sense in giving\n the enemy four Senators rather than two. More-\n over, having towed Ordway down to Aberdeen,\n he was beginning to think that Aberdeen would\n be a good place for the capital of the single\n State* He had his One-State bill in Ins pocket\n ready to spring it in the House so soon as the\n Republicans made their move in the Senate.\n</p>\n<p>\n At their first interview with the President, ob-\n tained only after much difficulty, the Republican\n committee were treated with downright incivility.\n \u201c You have no business with me, gentlemen,\u201d he\n said; \u201c none whatever, I assure you. Go to Con-\n gress, get your bill passed. Then my auty will\n begin. In the meanwhile, 1 do not care to talk\n with you, for I am satisfied you mean mischief!\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mean mischief, indeed! This, coming from the\n head of an Administration whose officials were\n then actually engaged in a conspiracy to cheat\n honest settlers of their homes, the farms they had\n been cultivating for years, with the sole object\n of forcing the Territory to become Democratic!\n</p>\n<p>\n Governor Mellette asked the President how he\n had reached the conclusion that they meant mis-\n chief. He replied that their formation of a State\n Government while yet a Territorial dependency\n was a species of rebellion. They urged that\n this view of their conduct was wholly unfounded,\n since the convention upon whose authority they\n had organized had explicitly directed them to\n commit no acts and take no measures except\n such as were in aid of the Territory\u2019s admission.\n They then proceeded to enlighten the President\u2019s\n mind upon matters of history. They showed that\n their course was identical with that pursued\n by Tennessee, and that the then President, George\n Washington, so far from rebuffing Tennessee\u2019s\n representatives, so far from accusing them of\n mischief, so far from declaring, that they had\n no business with him, had, on the contrary,\n forwarded their petition to Confess accompanied\n with a special message urging its immediate and\n favorable consideration. Mr. Cleveland\u2019s manner\n became decidedly more gracious as these facts\n reached his mind, but they did not avail to\n render him a whit more favorably inclined\n toward the cause of Dakota. The Senate bill,\n drawn to admit South Dakota, passed the Senate\n and failed in the House. It was ^tabbed to pieces\n by the ingenious Mr. Springer.\n</p>\n<p>\n Meanwhile the crusade upon the settlers had\n gone on with conscienceless vigor. Sparks had\n the effrontery to declare that 90 per centum of\n the entries made upon lands in the Northwest\n were fraudulently obtained either by perjury or\n in the interest of speculators, a statement 60\n utterly preposterous as to be difficult of reconcilia-\n tion with the notion that Sparks was sane.\n The Land Commissioner of the Interior Department\n is an absolute monarch. At any time before\n the actual issue of the patent, he can turn the\n settler from his homestead at pleasure. He made\n</p>\n<p>\n an order suspending the issue of patents until\n every application was specially investigated. This\n order produced in Dakota the wildest confusion\n and entailed upon settlers all such losses, amount-\n ing, of course, to many thousands of dollars, as\n must naturally ensue upon a wholesale destruction\n of land titles. Nobody knew what he could do.\n He could not sell his claim, he could not let it, and\n it was a question whether or not it was worth while\n even to cultivate it. Thousands upon thousands\n of settlers who came into South Dakota with the\n second tide of immigration in 1880 and 1881 were\n now just about ready to put in their final proofs\n of actual occupancy and cultivation, and to receive\n their titles. Sparks\u2019s order left them all at sea.\n</p>\n<p>\n There was one thing that prevented the success\n of this Democratic steal. Few people could be\n found despicable enough to live among these farm-\n ers and aid in doing them such fatal injury. It\n could only be accomplished through the land\n agents here, and they soon found their task\n odious. They exerted themselves ably and effi-\n ciently in that part of the conspiracy directed\n toward the promotion of Democratic immigration,,\n but they sooit grew tired of that other part calling\n on them to harass and browbeat settlers by de-\n laying the issue of titles until they revised their\n politics. Such of them as persisted in doing this\n dirty work became objects of general contempt.\n The rank and file of the Territorial Democracy\n looked -with undisguised disgust upon the whole\n business. Its effects were too cruel and too dis-\n honest for men of decent blood to witness tamely.\n Everybody in Dakota, no matter what his politics\n might be, knew that charges of general fraud were\n lies. They knew that general fraud was impossi-\n ble, and that even an individual fraud could be\n perpetrated only by far-reaching aud systematic\n deviltry. The game was not worth the powder.\n The Territories are settled, except along the line\n of the Northern Pacific land grant in the Red\n River Valley, by small farmers, owning from 160\n to 320 acres. There are only two farms in South\n Dakota of more than 1,500 acres. The question\n of the faithful performance of the Homestead law\u2019s\n conditions is one that adjusts itself. Everybody\n is watching like a hawk to avail himself of the\n advantages to be derived from exposing the neg-\n lect or fraud of everybody else. The Interior De-\n partment officials learned in time that they could\n not make their miserable trickery profitable, and\n they gave it up. But not before they had inflicted\n heavy loss upon thousands of poor and honest set-\n tlers under the wicked pretext that they were re-\n forming the administration of the land laws.\n</p>\n<p>\n YVhat remains of the history of Dakota\u2019s\n division and admission is National, and was a\n consequence of the late Presidential election.\n The Republican party declared its policy at\n Chicago by admitting eight delegates from South\n Dakota, the quota to which it -would be entitled\n as a State, and but two from North Dakota, which\n has not yet adopted a State Constitution. When\n General Harrison was found to be elected, the\n Democrats realized that nothing remained for\n them but to save what they could from the wreck\n of their plans. They knew if they failed to-\n pass an enabling act, it would be done, and done\n just as South Dakota desired, by the next Con-\n gress, even if the President should not summon\n an extra session for that very purpose, so soon\n os he was inaugurated. They yielded to the\n inevitable, however, very reluctantly. They did\n their best to prevent the division, and forced at\n last to abandon that feature of their opposition\n they set up a device to secure the defeat of the\n Sioux Falls Constitution. They utterly refused\n to accept the vote of November, 1885, as final,\n and the Omnibus bill as it passed makes a series\n of ridiculous provisions as to the process of South\n Dakota\u2019s admission. It orders a new conven-\n tion, and directs that when the people vote for\n delegates they shall also vote once more for or\n against the Sioux Falls Constitution. If they\n declare again in favor of it, the convention\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0025/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0025/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 537, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 868}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0025/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1075, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1736}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0025/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3473}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0025/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0025.jp2", "height": 3473, "width": 2151, "levels": 6, "size": 539823}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"25\">\n<p>\n SOUTH DAKOTA.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2*\n</p>\n<p>\n must amend it by substituting \u201c South Dakota\u201d\n instead of \u201c Dakota \u201d as the name of the State, and\n \u201c south of the 7th standard parallel\u201d instead of\n \u201c south of the 4 6th parallel\u201d \u2014they are three\n or four miles apart\u2014 as the dividing line.

Some of their hopes were hung\n on the liquor section, which orders a prohibitory\n amendment to be submitted to the people, but\n both the Prohibitionists and the liquor men \u2019 each\n probably fearful lest in another deal they should\n fare worse, profess themselves content. Nor can\n the local Democratic leaders drive their party to\n vote against the Constitution. The people.

Sunset is coming\n out to Huron to deliver a Fourth of July speech,\n and they are going to make him happier than was\n ever an amiable elderly gentleman before. An\n indiscreet paper at Sioux Falls, thinking someth ' ng\n should be done for Springer, suggested that he be\n asked to come there upon a similar errand, a mal-\n adroit suggestion which came alarmingly near\n taking Sioux Falls out of the capital race.\n</p>\n<p>\n That the Constitution will pass with practical\n unanimity is everywhere conceded. The Repub-\n licans are a unit upon it, and no Democrat, no\n matter what he would like to do, dares open his\n mouth against it. Popular feeling, aroused by all\n the trickery, intrigue and rascality practised or\n attempted to be practised during the Cleveland\n Administration, will tolerate no more nonsense.\n The people want their Territory admitted at the\n earliest moment possible under the enabling act,\n and they are going to carry things through with a\n rush. They are to elect their delegates to the\n convention on May 14, the convention meets on\n</p>\n<p>\n July 4, and its work is submitted in another elec-\n tion on October 1, at which tbe State officers will\n also be chosen. These dates apply to the process\n of admission in North Dakota, Montana and Wash-\n ington also. In each of them, under the Springer\n bill, the minority will be sure of representation,\n as, out of three delegates to be elected from each\n of the twenty-five districts into which the States\n are divided, no person can vote for more than two.\n This vicious principle of robbing the people of a\n third of their franchise rights in order to secure\n the election of persons who could not otherwise\n obtain a majority of the votes cast, is naturally the\n subject of much denunciation.\n</p>\n<p>\n Governor Mellette\u2019s appointment was made as\n the result of his earlier election, and of the unani-\n mous indorsement of his name to President Har-\n rison by all the prominent Republicans of the\n Territory. His task upon talcing office was one\n of the greatest difficulty and delicacy. He had\n several hundred appointments to make, and for\n each of them there were hosts of applicants, but\n he has discharged that feature of his duty with\n such tact that scarcely a murmur of dissatisfac-\n tion is heard. His renomination is completely\n assured, no other candidate being so much as\n suggested. The Democrats have no candidate as\n yet. They are a demoralized and disorganized\n party. The factions into which they were tom\n by the long-continued fight between Governor\n Church and Mr. Day, who wanted Church\u2019s\n office, are still arrayed against each other. Day\n is much talked of by his faction as the Guber-\n natorial candidate, and as hopeless defeat is not\n a very enviable distinction, he can probably got\n the nomination if he wants it. Among the Repub-\n licans, who will have almost a unanimous Legis-\n lature, but three men are mentioned as United\n States Senators. These are the Hon. Frank Petti-\n grew, of Sioux Falls, and the two men who were\n elected to the Senate in 1885, Judge Moody and\n Judge Edgerton. Judge Edgerton\u2019s services as\n Chief-Justice of the State Supreme Court are\n thought by most lawyers to be indispensable, and\n it is quite possible that he will be induced to\n accept that important post.

East of it, in Minnesota, twenty\n miles, and west of it, in Dakota, forty miles, arc\n lines of hills running parallel with each other and\n the river, and marking in outline an immense\n basin of 10,000 square miles. When the earth\n was young, the wise men say, these hills were\n the banks of a great inland lake, which existed\n during many centuries, and was finally drained\n off through the Red by a slow and deliberate\n process. It left a heavy, black alluvial deposit\n from two to 6ix feet deep, to become the soil\n of a habitable valley in which to-day, though\n only a fifth of it is in use, 35,000,000 bushels\n of wheat, a sixtieth of the world\u2019s crop, is an-\n nually produced. In Dakota there are six Red\n River counties. They contain 7,325 of the 10,000\n quare miles which compose the valley. The rest\n lie across the river in Minnesota. Half the wealth\n of North Dakota reposes in this valley. Half the\n taxes that support the State are collected here.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Red River is regarded by Dakotans as a\n noble and majestic stream. In the East it would\n be called a creek ; in the South a \u201c branch.\u201d This\n illustrates how everything is or is not, according\n to comparison. I heard much of the Jim River\n before I saw it, that it was 800 miles long and\n the life of Central Dakota, and when at last\n my eyes beheld it, I was filled with emotion. A\n fellow with good supple legs can jump across it\n almost anywhere from its source to its mouth.\n Rivers are scarce in Dakota, and they make the\n most of them. Earth, however, is plentiful, and\n if aquatic measurements seem scant, nothing can\n be said to ail notions of distance by land. It\n is told of an Eastern man that he advertised\n to exchange some country property about Huron\n for city property in Huron, and receiving several\n answers he came out to investigate them. One\n of his correspondents met him at the station\n with a wagon, and suggested that they drive to\n look at their respective properties. They pro-\n ceeded some five miles from the city, and the\n Huron man checked his horses. \u201c Here,\u201d he said,\n \u201c are my lots, right in the heart of the town,\n as you observe. Now, where\u2019s the country prop-\n erty you want to dispose of?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c We passed it three or four miles back on the\n road.\u201d answered the amazed New-Englander.\n \u201c What extraordinary notions of distance you peo-\n ple have out here I \"\n</p>\n<p>\n A pair of ponies educated in this Western\n country would f^cl mortified at being brought\n back to their stable before they had gone at\n leust fifty miles, and if you will ' let them, they\n will keep up a steady canter all day, without\n thinking they\u2019ve done anything to boast of.\n While over on the Missouri, I heard of a queer\n</p>\n<p>\n patch of land called Hell\u2019s Half Acre, some sixty\n miles from the town I was visiting. 1 was told\n the earth was on fire; that there was a deposit\n of some lignitic substance which had been fired\n by spontaneous combustion last winter and had\n been burning ever since ; that there was no vegeta-\n tion within half a mile of the affected spot; that\n it gave forth a light smoke during the day and\n produced a faint glow at night. I expressed some\n curiosity to see the phenomenon, and an amiable\n friend offered to put a pair of mules and a pair\n of ponies to his sulky and \u201c draw\u201d me over.\n We went, and besides seeing Hell\u2019s Half Acre, I\n learned all the things that a combination of\n mule and pony in harness can do to the human\n system. The fire appeared to be on the surface\n of the ground, burning downward. It produced\n light ashes and hard cinders. What the com-\n bustible substance was, nobody thereabouts was\n geological enough to say, but it would seem to be\n a very soft coal, more recent in its formation\n than the coal of the carboniferous period, for\n in the examination that had been made I thought\n I could detect vegetable matter in an early stage\n of its conversion into mineral coal. The fire when\n discovered had already spread over about half\n an acre of ground, beyond which it has not since\n gone. Its force is diminishing and, of course,\n as it becomes covered with the ashes and cin-\n ders, it must die out. Our team of mules and\n ponies performed their journey in fifteen hours,\n affording us time to investigate Hell\u2019s Half Acre,\n to chase a jack rabbit, to shoot three wild\n chickens and to make the acquaintance of a\n colony of prairie dogs. The prairie dog is a\n strange being; strange in the class of creatures\n he keeps around him, strange in the social eti-\n quette he so carefully observes, and particularly\n strange in the use he makes of his tail. I would\n give a good deal to have a little conversation\n with him ; to ask him, for instance, why he al-\n ways gives his short, stiff, stubby, little tail\n a jerk when he barks. Nothing could be fun-\n nier than to see 200 or 300 of these little creat-\n ure ' s, looking just like miniature kangaroo^\n with their eyes sparkling and their ears cocked\n up, sitting each over a hole in the ground, bark-\n ing away as if their very lives depended on\n their giving so many barks per minute, with\n a prize for the one who should beat the record,\n while their tails go up and down, up and down, '\n with a certainty and rapidity that could not be\n better attained were there an electrical connec-\n tion between tail and throat. They evidently\n possess a great talent for seeing fun. They\n take a cheerful view of life. The difference\n between them as they scamper and play, roll-\n ing over one another in the merriest kind of\n sport, and the stiff, fluffy, sober, little owls who\n [live with them, scarcely ever moving from\n the spot where they seem to be planted, ex-\n cept when they give themselves a sudden lift\n and then drop back into their holes\u2014 the differ-\n ence is so wide that you wonder what sort of\n a social relation it is that exists between them.\n The owls seem to have nothing to do with the\n dogs, merely blinking at them now and then in\n a solemn way. Mv own opinion is that the\n owls possess some kind of a sacerdotal function.\n</p>\n<p>\n The colony usually contains as many as 2,000\n dog ' s Their holes are about six feet apart\n and the town is built in an arc perhaps an\n eighth of a mile in circumference. As soon\n as you come within sight, every dog springs to\n his particular hole and stands over it barking\n for dear life. When you approach within a cer-\n tain distance all the dogs in that neighbor-\n hood,\u2019 or ward, so to speak, pop under the\n ground, leaving only the sentinel dog on guard.\n He goes on barking until you get within pis-\n tol-shot range and then he, too, disappears. The\n remoter dogs are still above ground: but if you\n continue to advance thev go below also, until\n the colony is deserted. The owls betake them-\n selves off in an amusing fashion.

It is an inaccurate de-\n scription to call the sound made by a prairie\n flog a bark. It is a shrill chic ! chic ! chic ! and\n resembles a bark only in that it is monosyllabic\n and produced with the same sort of bodily effort\n that the ordinary canine makes. The prairie\n \u2022logs are cunning, pretty little fellows. It is\n dreadful to think what would happen to one\n \u2022of them if you were to cut off his tail. He would\n probably be as voiceless as a clam. They are\n fast disappearing from the prairies. Like the\n buffalo and the antelope, they will soon be gone\n forever. But I am wandering some 300 miles\n from Fargo and the Red River valley.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Northern Pacific Railroad enterprise has\n iS? j a nd unmade a great many great men.\n Thaddeus Stevens was its father. Abraham\n Lincoln signed its first charter. The first com-\n pany that organized for its execution was com-\n posed chiefly of Boston men. They spent the\n time from 1864 to 1869 doing nothing. Then\n \u25a0Governor Gregory Smith, of Vermont, took hold\n he succeeded in awakening a widespread\n public interest in it and a merciless opposition\n t\u00b0 it from the other Pacific roads. He invited\n Jay Cooke to become its financial agent and\n under that wonderful operator, who sustained\n it for four years, it actually completed 550 miles\n of railroad, running from Duluth, via Lake Su-\n perior, and from St. Paul, on the Missis-\n sippi, across -the Red River at\n .cargo to the Missouri at Bismarck,\n</p>\n<p>\n and from Kalama, on the Columbia River, to Ta-\n coma, on Puget Sound. It had earned 10,000 000\n acres of its land grant. It had surveyed its route\n across the continent. It had established a score\n of cities, and had sent out thousands of settlers\n But the financial resources of Mr. Cooke had been\n -drained, and the war in Europe dissipated his\n scheme of a Rothschild connection. He and his\n bonds were a dead weight on the market at 12\n cents.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then, in 1874, George W. Cass became president.\n He contrived to give his name to this, the richest\n of Dakota counties, and to give his railroad into\n the hands of a receiver. Thence it was rescued\n by a committee of its bondholders, chief among\n whom was William Windom, and Charles B\n Wright was intrusted with the task of reviving\n the fallen enterprise. He did a good deal toward\n paving the way for a greater man, and he might\n have done much more but for his physical in-\n firmities. He ran trains at all events, sold large\n areas of the earned lands, and put a live, earnest\n population at work growing wheat, whose profit-\n able labors attracted Congress\u2019s attention, and\n enabled his successor, Frederick Billings, in 1880\n to throw westward another hundred miles of\n track. And then came the era of Henry Villard,\n the famous blind pool, triumph and prosperity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Villard in 1875 became interested in the\n budding railroad enterprises of Oregon, and he\n soon became president of the consolidated trans-\n portation companies of Oregon and Washington.\n He and Mr. Billings got along very well at first\n and made a traffic arrangement, but when Mr.\n Billngs began to plan the pushing of his road into\n Mi-. Villard\u2019s territory they clashed, and the weak-\n er man went under. Mr. Villard conceived the\n idea, unique in its proport o-s of s curing $9,000,-\n 000 from friends, who should know nothing of\n what he was about, and, with it, of buying up a\n controlling interest in Northern Pacific stock in\n open market. He goi, the money. He gave no\n receipts. He took no One into his confidence, but\n he, or somebody else, began to tell sad stories of\n Northern Pacific decrepitude, and when its stock\n had fallen to a proper ebb he quietly bought it\n fn. and one fine morning he called on Mr. Billings,\n asked him how he did, and informed him that the\n stockholders were dissatisfied with his manage-\n ment and would thank him to resign. Mr.\n Billings made a virtue of necessity. He parted\n with his stock and got out. In two more years\n the remaining 800 miles of railroad were complet- I\n</p>\n<p>\n ed, and the company has from that day grown in\n prosperity and usefulness. It was not materially\n injured by the ten. reversal of Mr. Villard\u2019s\n</p>\n<p>\n fortunes a few ye nee, and he has now re-\n covered Iris hold r it. it runs daily trains\n</p>\n<p>\n from bt. Paul to tt coast, over 2,0u0 miles of\n rail.\n</p>\n<p>\n The fortunes of Lis railroad enterprise have\n had a great influence upon Fargo and the Red\n River Valley, and in this respect more than in all\n others, that they made the great bonanza farms\n ol North Dakota a possibility. These wonderful in-\n stitutions exist nowhere except along the line of the\n Northern Pacific, because such immense tracts of\n country can nowhere else be acquired. They ex-\n ist in their finest form here around Fargo, because\n here, in the Red River Valley, is the soil most\n favorable to the growth of wheat. Under the Gov-\n ernment laws no individual can acquire more than\n 160, or, under certain conditions, 320 acres of\n ground. The talk one hears from political dema-\n gogues in the East about rich men getting vast\n areas of the public lands and holding them for\n speculation is mostly nonsense. Many frauds have\n been attempted, and some have been perpetrated,\n but to no considerable extent. When Jay Cooke\n collapsed, however, the opportunity to get hold of\n immense areas of land presented itself to those who\n had bought the railroad\u2019s bonds, and they were\n quick to improve it as the only way of getting\n their money back. The bonds were worth from\n twelve to twenty cents, at various times, and were\n exchangeable at par for the company\u2019s lands. Sev-\n eral of the bond-owners who saw into the future\n wisely forgave the company\u2019s debt and took in ex-\n change from 1,000 to 30,000 acres of land. This\n whole Western country, as I have explained, is\n laid out into sections each of thirty-six square\n miles. The Northern Pacific land-grant comprises\n every other section in a strip for forty miles on\n cither side of the track. It was thus made possible\n to buy a large farm profitably, either at the rail-\n road price or through the exchange of the rail-\n road\u2019s securities. One Northern Pacific investor\n who thought himself completely ruined by Jay\n Cooke\u2019s failure took land for his bonds, and to-\n day possesses the largest farm on the earth\u2019s sur-\n face, with 20,000 acres under cultivation, and\n yielding him a princely income every year.\n</p>\n<p>\n The bonanza farms\u2014 there are eight of them,\n varying in size from 2,000 to 30,000 acres\u2014 are\n conducted upon the most careful business princi-\n ples. They require a large capital, and no manu-\n facturing or mercantile institution in the East is\n governed by more exact or rigorous rules. Tlio\n finest and latest appliances are used in their opera-\n tion. The land, being perfectly level and contain-\n ing neither stones nor trees to impede cultivation,\n can be worked with great rapidity and upon a\n large scale. It is an interesting process by which\n the soil is first brought into subjection. Spon\n after the grass has started in the spring the prairie\n sod is ploughed to a depth of about two inches, a\n process called \u201c breaking.\u201d The grass roots\n quickly die in the sun. and during July the same\n sod is turned over again with about one inch of\n dirt covering it. This is called \u201d back-setting.\n Nothing further is done until the following spring,\n when the ground is deeply ploughed and harrowed\n and sown to wheat, which is cropped in the usual\n manner. Seeding begins in tbis district about t be\n 1st of April. The brealdng of new soil occupies\n the latter part of May. ITay is cut after the\n Fourth of July. Backsetting begins about the\n 25th of the same month. Oats are harvested about\n August, 1 0. and wheat ten or twelve days later.\n</p>\n<p>\n As many as ten or fifteen crews of men are at\n work on the bonanza farms, each under a different\n foreman, who is himself controlled by a super-\n intendent. Press drills run by six horses do their\n seeding. They sow two acres for each mile they\n are drawn. The farm is divided into fields, each\n of one square mile, and the work performed is\n measured in miles. A strip of land one mile\n long and eight feet three inches broad is an\n acre, and all machines, whether for ploughing.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0028/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0028/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0028/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0028/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0028/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0028.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 733994}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"28\">\n<p>\n 26\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN TIIE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n harrowing, seeding, cutting or binding, are worked\n in echelon, so as to make the greatest possible\n number of miles in a day. It is usual to put 100\n horses, with the complement of men to run them,\n in each field. The field-foremen go about on\n horseback, watching every foot of ground, and per-\n mitting no deviation, however slight, from the\n rules of the establishment. It is a great sight, and\n brings to one ' s mind a powerful impression of the\n advantages of method and business principles in\n agricultural work.\n</p>\n<p>\n No part of the profit to be derived from the\n production of their grain escapes these bonanza\n farmers. They take it all up to the moment of\n shipment. They have their own thrashing outfits\u2014\n their separators, callable of thrashing 2,000 or\n 3,000 bushels per day; their engines, their swing-\n ing stackers for stocking the straw as it comes\n away, from ten to twenty bundle teams, and from\n five to ten grain teams. They do not sack the\n grain, but lift it at once into bulk wagons, hold-\n ing 100 bushels, and draw it to their enormous\n elevators, or direct to the cars lor shipment.\n Laborers in the West are migratory. They come\n and go with the birds. In the winter many of\n them work in the timber regions of Wisconsin and\n Minnesota, and others, the harvesters especially,\n begin work in the South and work northward\n with the ripening crop. Their wages vary largely\n with the season and the region. Winter labor is\n paid at from $12 to $20 a month and board.\n Seeding men can make $1 25 a day and board,\n while harvesters are paid all the way from $1 50\n to $1 a day and board, according to the degree\n of their expertness. Some are employed by the\n season at from $20 to $25 a month and board, the\n season beginning as soon as the frost goes out of\n the ground and ending with the final plough-\n ing, which is done after the crop is gathered.\n Every farm keeps a store-house, from which the\n men are supplied with all such goods as clothing,\n shoes, tobacco and medicines.\n</p>\n<p>\n Not only is the wheat of this valley the best\n in the world, but it is produced at less expense\n tnan anywhere else. The average cost of the crop\n per acre is about $7, and on the bonanza farms\n it is even less. A fair table of expenses would be :\n Rent of ground, $1 ; seed, $1 ; ploughing, $1 25 ;\n dragging, 20 cents; seeding, 25 cents; harvesting,\n</p>\n<p>\n Jthreshing and marketing, $2; total expense,\n $6 (0 per acre. As many as thirty bushels have\n been gleaned from a single acre, but the average\n crop is not more than fifteen, which would make\n the expense per bushel just 45 cents. The lowest\n price at which this No. 1 hard wheat, the Duluth\n wheat, as it is called in New-York, has sold is\n 4 9 cents. The highest is $1 35, but the average\n price the year around is 80 cents. Several of the\n bonanza farms have 10,000 acres sown this spring\n Their net earnings cannot be less than $50,000.\n</p>\n<p>\n It scarcely needs to be said, wnen these facts\n are considered, that Fargo, from which at least\n half the crop of the valley is shipped, presents\n the appearance of a comfortable, thriving town.\n It contains 8,500 people. Its banks, with a\n capital of $1,500,000 and deposits of a million\n more, write ten millions of exchange annually.\n Ihe receipts of its railroads are not less than\n $2,500,000 a year, a fact which speaks elo-\n quently of the business done within\n the city. No less than eighteen agri-\n cultural warehouses make it their headquarters,\n supplying the country west of them with farming\n machinery to the extent of five millions a year.\n Its buildings are substantial, and its homes are\n rapidly taking on those little, but significant\n appearances that tell of comfort, refinement and\n prosperity. It contains an editor who supplies\n the State with more politics than a Tammany\n boss ever heard of. and as choice a collection\n of good fellows on the one hand and Mugwumps\n on the other as the most catholic taste could\n call for. In other words, Fargo is a city with\n all that that implies. Its population is more\n evenly divided as to sex than is usually the\n case in Western towns, though women are plenti-\n ful in Dakota, and a cultivated society of edu-\n</p>\n<p>\n cated and refined men and women is every-\n where to be found. In this respect Dakota is\n not nearly so crude as is the Eastern idea of it.\n Its people are not the rag-tog, tough, or\n impoverished element that went w r est in the early\n days because the East had no room for them , but\n their minds and their stomachs, too, are quite\n capable of nice discrimination.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this section there is a large foreign element,\n mostly Scandinavians, who constitute the labor-\n ing class. They are industrious, but none too\n moral and altogether devoid of sentiment. Scan-\n dinavian girls are employed in the hotel dining-\n rooms all through Dakota, as waitresses, wdiere\n they seem to do pretty much everything else\n except wait. They are artists at rattling the\n dishes and possess a positive genius for spilling\n the soup in your lap, and then, when you look\n up furiously, the sweet-tempered way they have\n of smiling ' and ot saying, \u201cYell, pardons; Aye\n no sporka mooch Anglish,\u201d is altogether distress-\n ing. That phrase, \u201c Aye no sporka mooch Ang-\n lish\u201d is the eternal apology. Ask a servant why\n she doesn\u2019t bring your dinner, why she doesn\u2019t\n fix up your room, why she persists in keeping\n a draught blowing on you, why anything, and\n the always grins and says she can\u2019t \u201c sporka\n mooch Anglish.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The bonanza farmers employ Scandinavian\n laborers largely, and many amusing stories are\n told illustrating their characteristics and propensi-\n ties. They have a dialect best described, perhaps,\n as a combination of German and Scotch. The accent\n is decidedly German. Their favorite vowel sound\n is that of the long \u201c a,\u201d which takes the place of\n both \u201c e\u201d and \u201c i.\u201d For instance, the pronoun\n \u201c I\u201d is pronounced \u201c aye,\u201d and \u201c he\u201d is converted\n into \u201c hay.\u201d They make no distinction as to sex,\n but say, \u201c May voomam\u2019s bay hard seek,\u201d mean-\n ing, \u201c My woman, she is hard sick.\u201d \u201c Aye no\n sporka mooch Anglish \u201d is an apology that serves\n in all emergencies.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many of the Scandinavians who work ita the\n harvest fields of this valley spend their winters\n among the pineries of Wisconsin, following the\n logs in the spring down the river. One of them,\n an Olsen, sought a job last summer on the Still-\n water boom. A boom, lest you should be un-\n familiar with this use of the word, is that spot\n in the river where the logs, having floated down\n from the pine forests, are sorted and sent onward\n to their respective owners. Olsen was asked if he\n could handle the logs.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Aye Rank so,\u201d he replied. \u201c Aye vark me\n blenty times on de Farks ofer en Visconsin, an\u2019\n Aye Rank Aye can yust vark any mams ofer de\n middle.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The foreman accepted him at his own estimate\n and put him at work, but in an hour or two he\n reappeared.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Maaster Poss,\u201d he said, \u201c Aye Rank Aye haf\n to get nudder mans.

Young men and\n maidens are now coming of age who were actually\n born here. It was in the remote year of 1879\n that the first settler built his \u201c shack\u201d on the high-\n est bank above the Red River. Not an acre of\n ground in all of North Dakota, except a garden\n patch or two at Pembina, directly north of him,\n was under cultivation. There, too, was his near-\n est white neighbor, ninety miles distant. Win-\n nipeg, then called Fort Garry, and a part of the\n Selkirk settlement, was a flourishing little village,\n and there were several other half-breed trading\n posts in Manitoba. How to open communications\n with these people, how to supply them with pro-\n visions from St. Paul and receive their furs for\n the markets of the East, formed the problem which\n the earliest settler of Grand Forks came here to\n solve. He knew he had a fortune in his hands if\n he could but get a line of steamboats plying up\n and down the Red River. There were a great\n many people in Manitoba drawing all they lived on\n from Fort Garry. Some were white, but the\n greater part were half-breeds, in the service of\n the Hudson\u2019s Bay Company. They were then re-\n ceiving their provisions from the East by way of\n the Bay, and they were able to communicate with\n their points of supply just once a year. They sent\n their orders in the spring and received the ' r goods\n in the fall. The going and the coming of their\n dog trains were the two annual events for which\n they lived.\n</p>\n<p>\n The first settler at Grand Forks lost no time\n getting his steamboat on the water. While he was\n building, a village sprang up around him and a\n postoffice was established. Its first official head\n was a woman. The mail always came in, brought\n</p>\n<p>\n by a dog-cart, on Monday, which was washday.\n It was brought in a cigar-box, and it was a sight\n to see the old lady wipe the suds from her arms\n and hands, hunt around for her spectacles, and\n then open her cigar-box and solemnly read the\n addresses aloud to the assembled settlement. The\n Indian title to the Red River Valley was not ex-\n tinguished at this time, and the ground was still\n red with the blood of braves, who were consider-\n ately paving the way for the peaceful use of the\n land by putting each other out of existence. The\n Red River Valley was the perennial battle-field\n between the Sioux of Dakota, and the Chippewas\n of Minnesota. Once, when the Sioux were the\n Dacotahs and the Chippewas were the Ojibways, a\n misunderstanding arose between a giddy young\n married woman of the Ojibway tribe and her hus-\n band concerning the too ardent attentions paid\n her by a fascinating young Dacotah chieftain.\n It was the familiar story. Some said it was her\n fault and some said it was his, but it caused a\n great deal of disagreeable feeling, and at last the\n indignant husband took his tomahawk and lifted\n the Dacotah dude\u2019s hair. That brought on a war,\n which, after progressing finely for about 200\n years, was ended only when the United States\n shut both sides within their respective reserva-\n tions and converted noble warriors into gluttons\n and thieves.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the spot where this early settlement was\n made stands what is now the second city of North\n Dakota, a busy, wealthy town. The census, if it\n hurries, will give Grand Forks at least 7,090 in-\n habitants, but more than sixty new houses are no w\n being erected, and the accretion is as steady as\n time. Enterprise has never worked more rapidly,\n nor with more care and wisdom, than here. There\n is a substantial reason for the growth of the town.\n Of course, it has all come since the railroads came.\n So long as people had to depend on river transpor-\n tation, though they multiplied sufficiently to in-\n crease shipments from 140 tons in 1871 to 8,000\n in 1875, there were not so many inducements for\n settlement in the country around Grand Forks\n as were offered elsewhere. The character of tlie,e\n Western towns depends wholly on the character\n of the country districts tributary to them. Peo-\n ple in the East are often heard to wonder how it\n is possible for a population of 7,000 to do the\n business which Grand Forks, for instance, is doing\n year by year. They wonder how so many rail-\n roads can profitably run through such small com-\n munities. They wonder how such a population\n can support three or four national banks, anAJjow\n the banks can possibly write eight or ten millions\n of exchange. They wonder how wholesale houses\n can exist, and where retail merchants find the\n trade that renders it profitable to carry lines of\n stock varying in value from 8100,000 to $200,-\n 000. They trill find an answer to all these ques-\n tions in the simple statement that Grand Forks\n draws at least $20,000 a day from the country\n region around it. It is the distributing point for\n a territory embracing more than a hundred smaller\n towns. Its business is contributed by an army\n of industrious farmers, who spend as they make,\n and whose growing prosperity necessarily builds\n up Grand Forks.\n</p>\n<p>\n Not all the land in the Grand Forks district is\n taken, but it is rapidly going, and within two\n years more free homes in the Red River Valley will\n be out of reach. During the year 1888 entries\n were made to the number of 1,952, upon 31 3, 000\n acres. The Grand Forks district occupies t.iie\n northeast corner of the Territory, and is about\n 100 miles square. As many as twenty townships\n \u2014a township is a block of land containing thirty-\n six sections, or square miles\u2014 are still unsur-\n veyed. There ate also about 150,000 acres of va a it\n surveyed lands open to settlement, making in all\n about 650,000 acres now available in this district..\n Some of it, of course, is inferior\u2014 that is, inferior\n to the wonderful soil bordering directly on the\n river, but if a Vermont farmer were to wake up\n some fine morning and find his farm transformed\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0030/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0030/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0030/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0030/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0030/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0030.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 766972}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"30\">\n<p>\n 28\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n into the meanest quarter-section to be found ja\n this whole region, 4 fancy he would think himself\n uncommonly well off. Them are valiey lands still\n idle and unclaimed, and if actual results are to\n be believed, a more fruitful soil does not exist on\n the face ol the earth than is now to be had right\n here for the asking. The Oklahoma craze seems\n all the more ridiculous when the fact is taken into\n consideration that twenty millions ol acres are at\n this moment subject to entry in a State which pro-\n duces one-thirtieth of the world\u2019s wheat crop.\n Dakota\u2019s growth of wheat in 1887 was 62,500,000\n bushels, of which North Dakota supplied 36,-\n 000,000, with only one-nineteenth of her soil at\n work. This North Dakota wheat, every grain ot\n ik is the famous \u201c No. 1 hard.\u201d It brings the\n highest price paid for wheat, and is here grown at\n a smaller expense than anywhere else. The land\n yet open is as fertile as land could be. It is near\n the railroads, and affords the settler every possi-\n ble advantage that, can be obtained in a new coun-\n try, and yet there are those crazy people down in\n Oklahoma ready to cut each other\u2019s throats over\n land which, however good, can be no better than\n the best.\n</p>\n<p>\n Much of the overflow from Oklahoma has al-\n ready come here. Hundreds of entries were made\n last week in the land ollices of North Dakota, aqd\n as I have now reached the territory where public\n lands are at the service of new settlers, I may as\n well take this opportunity of describing the pro-\n cesses by which they are obtained. Any citizen\n of the United States, or person who has declared\n his intention of becoming a citizen, may enter upon\n any unoccupied or Unreserved quarter-section\n (1 60 acres) of the public domain, and within thirty\n days alter settlement he must file his \u201c declaratory\n statement\u201d with the nearest Government land\n oflice. In this statement he simply declares his\n intention to cultivate and live upon the land he\n has taken. Within a year he must prove by -wit-\n nesses that he has actually been cultivating and\n living upon his land, and then he can have a\n patent of it from the Government for $1 25 an\n acre, or, if it be within fifty miles of the Northern\n Pacific Railroad, for $? 50 an acre. This is called\n \u201c pre-emption.\u201d Under the Homestead law, he\n can have a quarter-section free, or, to be exact, by\n paying the land oflice fee of from $14 to $18. But\n be must go upon his land within six months after\n entry and live there. He must cultivate it for\n five years, and then be can have his patent. But\n he has no right or claim in tire land until the neces-\n sary cultivation has been done. He can buy it\n under the pre-emption law, if he chooses, so soon\n as the conditions of that law have been observed.\n If he be an honorablv discharged soldier or sailor\n who has served not less than ninety days, or the\n widow of one, the time of actual service under the\n Government will be deducted from the requisite\n five years of residence. Under the Timber Culture\n Act, ' he may secure a quarter-section of such land\n as is naturally devoid of timber, which includes\n practically the whole of Dakota, by planting and\n cultivating ten acres of trees for eight years, and\n when lie \u201c proves up\u201d he must show that he has\n planted and eared for 2,700 trees, of which at least\n 675 are living and in good condition.\n</p>\n<p>\n If people contemplating settlement here have\n any money it is undoubtedly wise to look around\n a little before they make their final choice of a\n home. It is the universal experience in new\n countries that the first settlers are not the real\n settlers. The pioneers do not stay. They are\n usually of two classes, ne\u2019er-do-wells and adventur-\n ers. They have failed everywhere else, and they\n fail here. They take a homestead, break a little\n ground, mortgage their property to buy stock,\n have a poor crop, fail, get disgusted, and \u201c light\n out,\u201d leaving the banking or loan company from\n which they havo received financial assistance\n to gather in the property in payment of their\n debt, ' Dakota could give half a million farmers\n 200 acres each, upon which a population of\n</p>\n<p>\n 3,000,000 could happily subsist, leaving plenty\n</p>\n<p>\n of room for cities. As a matter of fact, the\n</p>\n<p>\n 62.000. 000 bushels of wheat raised in 1887 came\n from less than 70,000 farms, and less than half\n of these were in crop. In other words, less than\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.000. 000 acres, out of 96,000,000, did the work.\n These figures are eloquent if you will regard\n them for but a minute. They show how vast\n the room is out here, and how slightly it is\n occupied even yet. In South Dakota, where all\n the land is taken and in private ownership, not\n 20 per cent of it is in actual use. It is often\n cheaper to take one of these farms where the\n ground has been broken to some extent than\n it is to settle on wild land and spend a year\u2019s\n time rendering it receptive. Farms such as\n I have described, upon which some work has\n been done, and from which one or two crops\n have been taken, but whose tenants were for\n one reason or another, a reason, however, peculiar\n to themselves, incompetent and shiftless are to\n be had in every county in both Dakotas at from\n S4 to $10 an acre.\n</p>\n<p>\n Back from the Red River a mile or so the\n prairie slopes downward forming a valley perhaps\n twenty miles wide and 200 long, which\n is nearly a foot lower than the river bank.\n The years 1881 and 1882 are known out here\n as \u201c boom times,\u201d immigration during those years\n being particularly heavy. Settlers poured into\n this valley, but before they had done more than\n break the ground, trouble came. The winter\n of \u201983 was long and cold, and the river made\n three feet of ice. I am talking now of the\n northern half of the world, where the water\n flows north and seeks its escape into Hudson\u2019s\n Bay, the Northern Pacific and the Arctic. The\n Red River flows into Lake Winnipeg. The ice\n down here began to melt while it was still solid\n in the lake, and presently the river rose, over-\n flowed and submerged this valley. At that time\n there was no drainage whatever, and the newly\n arrived settlers were subjected to great\n losses. So S ' < oh as soring came, they\n packed up their goods and moved further\n west, leaving many of their farms in the posses-\n sion of bankers and loan agents. Since then the\n land has been drained, and were another such\n flood to come, which is very unlikely, as the\n river banks are from six to ten feet high, it\n could do no particular harm. But hundreds of\n those farms with their improvements are still\n vacant, and at least 50,000 acres in Grand Forks\n County can be had at $5 an acre. As many as\n 150,000 acres can be had at, from $6 to $10 an\n acre. If there is a more fertile spot than this\n on top of the world, it has yet to be found.\n</p>\n<p>\n Grand Forks is interested in another industry\n which is peculiarly its own, and which, as yet\n scarcely touched, must soon become almost the\n greatest, factor in the. city\u2019s prosperity. The Red\n Lake River flows into the Red River at Grand\n Forks, a circumstance which gave the city its\n name, the early voyagers being, at first, at a\n loss to know which was the main stream. About\n a hundred miles due east in Minnesota is the Red\n Lake, and for miles and miles around it are dense\n pine thickets. Quick to perceive the advantage\n that these timber lands might be to them, -with\n a river in which to float the logs down and a\n vast market to the west clamoring for lumber, the\n people of Grand Forks recently sent, a survey\n party to look the groves over and t,o estimate\n the quantitv of the timber. It, is all contained\n within the Chippewa Reservation, so that nobody\n can get at it just now. Such sections of it as are\n outside the reservation boundaries have already\n been gobbled up by a lumber dealer who is now\n operating an immense mill at Grand Forks, and\n whose sales last year to the territory west of him\n amounted to ten million feet. At present he is\n enjoying a delightful monopoly, but a commission\n is treating with the Indians for the opening of\n the timber lands, and before this year closes the\n lands will undoubtedly be available. It is esti-\n mated that there are about ten billion feet of\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0031/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0031/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 537, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 868}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0031/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1075, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1736}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0031/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3473}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0031/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0031.jp2", "height": 3473, "width": 2151, "levels": 6, "size": 702081}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"31\">\n<p>\n NORTH DAKOTA.\n</p>\n<p>\n 29\n</p>\n<p>\n pine, oak, ash and elm, from 50 to 150 feet high,\n within the timber belt, and the topography of the\n country is such that there can be no possible\n outlet for the trees except down the Red .Lake\n River.

M lieu\n the Scotch and English colonists of the Hudson\n Bay Company had pushed their way through\n Manitoba and had reached the spot that has\n since become known as Winnipeg, they en\n countered a party of Frenchmen under the patron-\n age of the Northwestern Fur Company, and there\n was forthwith a quarrel.

A long,\n deep, narrow river that has since received as\n its name the name of the town, its banks over-\n grown with poplar, oak and elm trees, flowed\n into the Red River at a short distance below\n the fort, and the surface of the country was\n lifted here into mounds and depressed there into\n ravines, which served greatly to relievo the\n monotony of the expanding prairies. When Sel-\n kirk learned two years later that his fort and\n his people were on American soil, he moved them\n across the boundary line, and established them\n where they had the right to be, but several of\n their descendants are yet living in Pembina, and\n the traditions of these early days are a source\n of pride to the whole community.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Pembina of to-day, however, is a town of\n recent growth, but little older, in fact, than ite\n neighbors in the Red River Valley. People are\n still accounted young who have travelled all the\n way from Winnipeg through Pembina to St.\n Paul in dog-carts, camping in the snow and cross-\n ing the river in skiffs of buffalo hide drawn to-\n gether in ten minutes and propelled by a pole,\n while boys and girls ten years old can tell you\n of Indian fights on the plains around the town\n where now the wheat is green and the pure-\n blooded Indian is as rarely to be iound as the\n bones of the buffalo, with which, even then, the\n prairies were literally strewn.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is nothing like Pembina in all Dakota.\n Not more than a third of its population are native\n Americans. Many are Canadians, many are half-\n breeds, many are Icelanders, and I saw one Esqui-\n mau. Not only the city, but the entire county\n of Pembina, has been overrun by Canadians.\n They have filled the county below it also, and\n still they come day after day. There are a million\n acres in Pembina County and 700,000\n</p>\n<p>\n of them at least are held by Cana-\n</p>\n<p>\n dians. They make the very best\n citizens. They have given such value to the land,\n have produced such results from it and have so\n conspicuously demonstrated its fertility, that the\n acres of this county are now the most expensive\n in all Dakota. The lowest price at which a quarter-\n section (160 acres) can be bought is $1,600, while\n there are farms in the county that cannot be ob-\n tained for a penny less than $50 an acre. There\n is no way of telling an English-speaking Canadian\n from a native-born American. They are just like\n the rest of us, and they receive from everybody\n the heartiest kind of a welcome. The half-breeds\n and Icelanders are marked. They possess inevita-\n ble peculiarities. The French half-breed is an\n Indian just touched with the fleur-de-lis. The\n Scotch half-breed is ever and foremost a Thistle,\n with a weakness for blankets and beads and moc-\n casins. There is something strange about the ef-\n fects produced by the crossing of bloods. The\n French half-breed is silent, swift, watchful, sin-\n ister and he always goes armed. The Scotch\n half-breed is slow, calculating, canny, and he hunts\n dollars with an eagerness and a persistency that\n tell their own story. But both, no matter what\n the degree of swarthiness in their complexions\n may be, have the Indian eyes, the Indian\n hair and the Indian walk. Neither is of any great\n account in such arduous labor as. the subjuga-\n tion of the wilderness calls for. They are both\n Indian enough to prefer the hunting ground to\n the ploughed field. They loaf around Pembina,\n harmless and useless, half their time, and spend\n the other half fishing in the Red River or following\n the smaller one in search of ducks and geese or\n chasing wilder and larger game over the woody\n marshes of Northern Minnesota.

The\n terrible deeds of \u201c Yaller Vic - \u2019 are still recounted\n in Pembina with bated Breath. \u201c Yaller Vic\u201d was\n a composition of Winnipeg, French and Red Lake\n Chippewa, and no good was ever known to come\n from this mixture of ferocity and devilment. He\n came to an untimely end at the hands of a Buck-\n eye tenderfoot. The only man in Pembina of\n whom \u201c Yaller Vic\u201d stood in fear was a storekeeper\n who had secured the services of a greenhorn clerk\n from Ohio. The merchant, soon after the ne.v\n clerk arrived, started off upon his annual trip to\n St. Paul. Before leaving he told his clerk to\n write him concerning the progress of\n some newly planted potatoes, and also\n instructed him that never, upon any\n account, should he permit \u201c Yaller Vic\u201d to\n set foot inside the store. He had been in St.\n Paul about a week when he received this letter :\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Deer Sur: Yesterday \u2018Yaller Vic\u2019 come to the\n store an\u2019 started fvr to walk in. Sez I, \u2018Yaller\n Vic, keep out.\u2019 Sez he, \u2018 I wants to come in.\u2019\n Sez I, \u2018It ain\u2019t ter be did.\u2019 Sez he, \u2018I\u2019m eomin in,\u2019\n an\u2019 he come.

S. them pertaties is all rite.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Nothing I have ever heard of more clearly il-\n lustrates the weakness of codified law than the\n legal proceedings instituted to punish the murderer\n of \u201c Yaller Vic.\u201d John ' s lawyer showed the cor-\n oner the statute holding that the principal was\n responsible for the acts of the agent, and under\n that appropriate rule Jc.hn was discharged, and\n the coroner held his employer. But when the\n employer was arrested, he set up an alibi, and\n showed beyond question that at. the time of the\n shooting he was in St. Louis buying goods. It\n remains to this day a mystery who was legally\n responsible for the killing of \u201c Yaller Vic.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Icelanders contribute another interesting\n portion of Pembina\u2019s population. I doubt if there\n is another spot in America wheie you can see\n four men on the street corners talking four dif-\n ferent languages and each understanding the\n others. It is a frequent thing in Pembina to hear\n a French half-breed, a full-blooded Cree, an Ice-\n lander and an American discussing human affairs\n each in his own tongue. The Icelanders are to be\n distinguished by their round shoulders. They\n always walk as if they were cold, with theii\n shoulders drawn into a knot around their heads\n and their hands stuffed into their trousers\u2019 pock-\n ets. Nothing could be more sheepishly tranquil\n than the expression of their staid and sober faces\n They chiefly contribute to the well-being of sc\n ciety as cooks. An Icelandic cook is described\n to be a great comfort. He doesn\u2019t want nights\n out.. You don\u2019t have to regulate the number of\n clothes you wear by the fear of his displeasure\n at the size of the wash, and if he isn\u2019t all a\n ** chef,\u201d at least he isn\u2019t all a tyrant.\n</p>\n<p>\n To a sportsman Pembina is a paradise. From\n year\u2019s end to year\u2019s end game is plentiful. He\n can begin his duck shooting in the spring, and\n can have his pick of about twenty varieties of\n wild duck that flock in immense numbers upon\n the Pembina River. The mallard duck is es-\n pecially abundant, though pintails and blue and\n gray teal are scarcely less so. There is no better\n goose shooting anvwhere than within ten or\n twenty miles of Pembina. The gray goose,\n Canada brant, and the wavy or snow goose are\n all to be found. A curious device for attracting\n the wavy geese at night is adopted by the in-\n genious hunters of this region. They obtained\n it from the Indians. They go to some spot to\n which the geese are known to resort, and there\n they build an immense fire. Presently, and al-\n most invariably, a flock of wavies will come\n</p>\n<p>\n and circle around the fire, falling a\n quick prey to the hunters ' shotguns. Can-\n ada geese frequently hatch ui North Dakota,\n and when their eggs are put under a hen, the\n gosling may be easi ly dunosticated. Ducks and\n geese are the only wild fowl available for the\n hunter at this time of year, but it will interest\n ornithologists to know that the birds of North\n Dakota, all of which can be obtained in this\n neighborhood, are numerous and varied enough\n to stock a museum. The bald eagle is seen con-\n stantly, especially along the Pembina River and\n around Devil\u2019s Lake. An eagle\u2019s nest reposes in\n an immense oak tree upon a point of land jutting\n into that curious Lake, which is said to be of\n altogether wonderful dimensions. It is abandoned\n now, in deference to the Devil\u2019s Lake small boy.\n Some of the sticks of which it is made are as big\n as a man\u2019s leg, and an ordinary double mattress\n could easily be put into it. It completely occu-\n pies the tree, which stands up above all Hie other\n timber, throwing the nest into a position both\n picturesque and prominent. Golden and gray\n eagles, the osprey, lute and falcon are all native\n here, and specimens are found in many houses and\n in all the taxidermist establishments. The\n sandhill crane, wary and hard to get at, but ex-\n cellent to eat when taken, the white crane, the\n night heron and the bittern often appear along the\n Pembina. The largest Dakota bird is the whoop-\n ing crane, a snow-white fowl that stands about\n five feet high. Owls are here in great numbers.\n The horned owl, often two feet long with a\n spread of wing of five feet, preys on every other\n bird except the bald eagle. Snow owls and round\n heads are also plentiful. It would form a long\n catalogue to enumerate all the smaller birds pe-\n culiar to this region. They include a score of\n rare species much prized by ornithologists.\n</p>\n<p>\n The fishing season begins almost as soon as the\n waters open and continues almost until they close.\n Pike, pickerel, gcld-eyes and sturgeon are to be\n caught so easily that a string of sixty or seventy\n fish is often taken with a single line in a single\n afternoon. Sixty-pound sturgeon and fifty-pound\n catfish revel in the Red River to the unbounded\n delight of fishermen. The prairie chicken season\n comes on about the middle of August and endures\n until the snow flies. What are called prairie\n chickens here are really pinnated grouse. The\n mnle bird is rather handsome and very wild.\n He has wing-like feathers projecting from his\n neck. The prairie chicken, as they serve it here, is\n food for a king. Ruffed grouse, or partridges, as\n we call them in the East, are common, though not\n much sought for where chickens are so numerous.\n</p>\n<p>\n But the game of game, the game that dis-\n tinguishes this country above all others, East or\n West, North or South, is to be found about thirty\n miles from Pembina toward the Red Lake region.\n Here, 6till in great abundance, are moose, elk,\n caribou and deer. Several of the present residents\n of Pembina came here simply that they might be\n able the better to gratify their taste for hunting.\n They spend a month or two on the plains every\n winter, starting out with the first good snow.\n One of these devoted sportsmen, whose home is\n stocked with specimens of his prowess, has re-\n duced the hunt to a science. He goes out with \u00bb\n few selected companions in a well-built cabin,\n light in weight but tightly put together, which\n he sets on wheels. Four bronchos pull it to the\n hunting grounds, and a sufficiency of ponies,\n trained to stand under fire follow. The cabin\n is supplied with sleeping berths, kitchen utensils,\n extra tents and a little stove, and under the bottom\n such essentials as coal, oil, ammunition and guns\n are stored in separate compartments. This hunter\n has been out ten seasons, and he never fails to\n bring back a goodly load of game. Every now\n and then a W\u00abck bear appears, but the favorite\n game is moose. Eighteen of these noble beasts\n were shot, last winter. Several have been taken\n alive. They weigh from 800 to 1,300 pounds.\n Elk will weigh from 400 to 700 pounds, and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0033/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0033/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 537, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 868}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0033/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1075, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1736}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0033/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3473}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0033/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0033.jp2", "height": 3473, "width": 2151, "levels": 6, "size": 614624}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"33\">\n<p>\n NORTH DAKOTA.\n</p>\n<p>\n 31\n</p>\n<p>\n reindeer from 300 to 450.

Q.\n</p>\n<p>\n XIV.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE DEVILS LAKE COUNTRY.\n</p>\n<p>\n HOW ITS PROGRESS WAS RETARDED BY COM-\n MISSIONER SPARKS.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE LAKE AND THE CITY\u2014 SOME STARTLING\n</p>\n<p>\n INDIAN LEGENDS\u2014 A DAKOTA SEA SERPENT.\n</p>\n<p>\n Devils Lake, North Dakota, May 20.\n</p>\n<p>\n In a recent article dealing with the political\n situation in South Dakota I spoke of the\n outrageous oppressions of Land Com-\n missioner Sparks and his officials prac-\n tised upon the settlers in that part of the Territory.\n I am aware that Sparks is no longer an issue, but\n the wanton mischief he did has not yet been re-\n paired, and its effects in North Dakota are so\n serious as to call for some special comment. All\n this country lying west of the Red River Valley\n and north of the Northern Pacific land-grant is\n new country. Its development began scarcely six\n years ago. The land ollice in Devils Lake was\n opened in 1883, and had been going only a year\n before Sparks entered upon his crusade. It is an\n enormous district, embracing nearly 10,000 square\n miles and containing about 6,000,000 acres, two-\n thirds of which are pure agricultural lands. The\n office had done a heavy business. Settlements had\n been made at the rate of ten or fifteen per day,\n and a large part of them were pre-emptions, claims\n in which the settler lives on his land for at least\n six months, cultivates at least so much of it, and\n then buys it from the Government * > t $1 25 per\n</p>\n<p>\n acre, upon proving that the conditions of the law\n have been complied with.\n</p>\n<p>\n These people claim that Sparks so held in check\n their country as to leave them to-day in point of\n development two years behind where they should\n have been and might have been. This is how he\n did it: Webster Merrifield, a young collegian\n from Vermont, came here in May, 1883, settled\n on 160 acres, and personally lived on it from May\n 6 till about November 1, when what proved to be\n the last illness of his mother called him to Ver-\n mont. He had spent over $600 improving his\n claim. He had put up a little house, bought a\n little stock, dug a well, and swears he meant to\n make his farm a home. His mother died, after a\n long siege of sickness, in August, 1884. In the\n previous June Mr. Merrifield was chosen a pro-\n fessor in the newly established University of\n Dakota, at Grand Forks. When he returned to\n Dakota, after his mother\u2019s death, ho went to the\n University, and not to his farm. Sparks held his\n patent for cancellation, on the ground that Pro-\n fessor Merrifield was \u201c evidently a speculator.\u201d Of\n course he wasn\u2019t, but what business of Sparks\u2019s\n was it if lie had been? There is nothing in the\n laws of the United States which says that a man\n shall not speculate with his own property, if he\n wants to. The law says he shall live on the land\n for so long a time, shall cultivate such an area of\n it, and shall pay so much for it. When he has\n done that it is his, and why should he not sell it\n i f he likes ? How under the sun could the Com-\n missioner properly undertake to control its dispo-\n sition alter the settler had done all the law called\n for ?\n</p>\n<p>\n A young lawyer named McGee took a similar\n claim, lived on it eight months, cultivated five\n times the area required by law, at the same time\n practising his profession. He sold his claim a year\n or so later and gave his whole attention to the\n law, a large part of his business being to de-\n fend settlers against Sparks. His patent\n was attacked and \u201c held up,\u201d as the phrase is,\n because \u2014 I use the agent\u2019s own words, taken from\n bis report \u2014 there was \u201c no evidence that he in-\n tended to make it (the farm) his future home.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Future\u2019\u2019 home 1 Mr. McGee and his purchaser\n are both still minus their land. It is still await-\n ing disposition because Sparks claimed the right\n to draw conclusions as to a man\u2019s intentions\n about where he would live in the future. Could\n anything be more idiotic ? Or more palpably\n malicious ?\n</p>\n<p>\n Cases just like these could be cited by the\n hundred. There are sixty-six of them still held\n up here at Devils Lake. There are as many more\n at Grand Forks. They have been pending for\n from three to four years. Thousands more were\n attempted, causing great loss and expense to the\n settlers, who had to come hundreds of miles\n with their witnesses to the proper land office,\n go through a long and barren trial and wait\n six or eight months for a decision. The only\n reason why this business did not ruin the country\n was because the Democratic Territorial land\n officers were too honest and high-minded to stand\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0034/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0034/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0034/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0034/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0034/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0034.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 755154}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"34\">\n<p>\n 32\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n by it.

When the great railroad pro-\n prietor whom everybody in the Northwest fondly\n calls \u201c Jim\u201d Hill came along in 1882 to see what\n the country looked like, a single log shanty was\n all he saw at Devils Lake. Tlis railroad came\n along in another year, and a city had meanwhile\n arisen to meet it. Now there are 2,0Q0 people\n living in handsome, comfortable houses. Build-\n ing improvements to the amount of $137,000\n were made in 1888. Though among the very\n youngest of the very young cities of North Dakota,\n Devils Lake has demonstrated lasting qualities.\n It has survived a boom, and that is a good guar-\n antee that it contains all the essential elements\n of prosperity. Its natural advantages are indeed,\n numerous. South and east and west of ft is a\n beautiful lake, fifty-five miles long, and from\n two to eight miles wide, with its shores cut\n into a hundred capes and promontories, forming\n delightful little bays and inlets. This lake is a\n never-failing source of interest to the people\n living near it. It has surprising habits, and \"\n upon it and within it is a population which has\n won for it, if not the confidence, at least the re-\n spectful consideration, of everybody. It is any but\n a useless lake, for all around is a heavy growth of\n timber, a godsend to all prairie countries. It sup-\n plies the fish market, too, and its influence upon\n the general rainfall must be great. Like all the\n waters in this country, it has been contracted to\n its present proportions from others far greater.\n It used to extend beyond its present shores over\n three successive \u201c benches,\u201d or steps, plainly de-\n fined upon the prairie, to the distant bluffs beyond,\n its original shores. In those days, which were many\n whiles ago, it undoubtedly possessed an outlet into\n the Red River. Now it is held within the tight clasp\n of the land, and its waters are as salt and as blue\n as those of the ocean. Within the groves of oak\n and elm that line its sandy and pebbly shores are\n many quaint and picturesque situations, soon to\n become summer resorts for practically the whole\n of North Dakota.\n</p>\n<p>\n As a market for wheat the city is fast realizing\n its destiny, but it is also becoming a great market\n for cattle. Beyond the Mouse River, a hundred miles\n away, immense cattle ranges exist. The land in\n that country is peculiarly adapted to the accom-\n modation of cattle, and many thousands are al-\n ready being herded in the valley. A vast denosit\n of lignite coal in the Turtle Mountains simplifies\n the problem and reduces the expense of livino- j n\n Devils Lake, greatly to the dissatisfaction of \" the\n aforesaid Sparks, one of whose most hurtful acts\n was the withholding of this Turtle Mountain region\n from settlement and development. Deaf to\u00b0tbo\n argument that the enormous timber tracts and\n coal mines of this mountain country were abso-\n lutely necessary to the comfort and prosperity of\n the people, Sparks shut it up and drove away the\n</p>\n<p>\n settlers who had come upon it to the ' ir loss and to\n the loss of the State, ills action was afterward\n overruled by Secretary Lamar, as his actions usu-\n ally were after they had done the injuries they\n were intended to do. Ten thousand families are\n now supplied from these mines with all the coal\n they use, and the timber on the mountains is fast\n being turned into building materials.\n</p>\n<p>\n You must have been asking, Why Devils Lake ?\n The truth is, there\u2019s a sea serpent in it. There\u2019s a\n phantom ship on it, and there are supernatural\n lights all around it. The Indians knew of these\n things long before the whites came here, and they\n named it M.innewaukon, that is, \u201c Spirit Waters.\u201d\n To this day no red man will ever venture on the\n Spirit Waters in a boat. When the lake is frozen\n hard and tight, and the evil spirit is shut under\n the ice, he 1 x 111 cross it. in numbers, but, rapacious-\n as he is, no money, no bauble, not even whiskey,\n could tempt him on it in a boat. There is an\n Indian reservation on the south side of the lake\n at Fort Totten, where 1,500 Sioux are corralled.\n They have no canoes. At the fort I made the\n acquaintance of an aged squaw, who will talk\n English for pic. She knows all the legends of the\n lake, and as long as you prod her with pie she\n will croon on and on. Shut off the pie, and\n straightway she shuts off the romance. \u201c They\n say that in her prime, ere the pruning-knife of\n time\u201d had dug into her cheeks and cut trails all\n over her withered body, most of which, when I\n saw her, the day being warm, was clothed with\n the zephyrs only\u2014 they say she was a cunning lit-\n tle thing, as playful as a fawn, and just as slender\n and graceful. They say her name was Tickle\n Toe-\n</p>\n<p>\n Under a tree near the agency buildings I led the\n now faded Tickle Toe. She carried the\n arm chair for me to sit in. I car-\n ried six pies for her to eat, carefully\n cut into quarters. She sat tailor-fashion ou the\n ground, grabbed a 6lice of pie and as it dis-\n appeared beyond her huge, toothless jaws, she\n toid me the wild, weird tales of the Minnewaukon.\n When she was a papoose, she said, the Sioux\n came east from the Missouri, the Muddy Water,\n to make war on the Chippewas. At about the\n same time the Chippewas came west from the\n Lake country to make war on the Sioux. The\n scouts of each party ascertained that the other\n party was advancing, though neither fancied the\n other knew that fact. They drew near each other\n in the vicinity of Devil s Lake, the Sioux on the\n south side, the Chippewas on the north. One\n night and at the same moment each party\n embarked in canoes, intending to cross the lake\n and surprise the other. They came together in\n the middle and the battle began. While it\n was at its fiercest, a great column of white light\n appeared over a little round mound a hundred\n yards or so from the shore on the south side.\n It was a wonderful illumination, and it made\n the lake as light as it ever was in the daytime.\n Terrified and amazed, the braves of both parties\n threw their weapons into the water and bowed\n down in worship of the light. The squaws, old\n men ancT children of both parties, attracted by\n the wonderful light, had come down to the shores\n of the lake and were gazing in dread and con-\n fusion at the strange appearance. Suddenly a\n hoarse, trumpeting sound was heard in the distance\n like the beating of many tom-toms. The mound\n over which the light was still shining began to\n throb like the heart of an angry brave. Peer-\n ing down the lake they all saw a huge monster\n advancing through the water by great leaps, '\n bis red jaws opened wider than the teepee\u2019s\n flap, his eyes throwing out sparks, and his\n tremendous tail lashing the water into a foam\n like tho foam at the foot of the great falls of\n the Muddy Water. On, on he came, while the\n waves of the lake rose higher and higher, and\n just\n</p>\n<p>\n She stopped.

There was not another pie on\n the reservation.\n</p>\n<p>\n These appearances on and about the lake have\n all been observed by white people. Mr. Palmer,\n the trader at Port Totten, saw the phantom\n vessel ten years ago. Half a dozen people were\n with him at the time and they all saw it. The\n evening was soft and balmy. They were cross-\n ing the lake in a skill and all at once some one\n called out, \u201c Look there 1\u201d Coming toward them\n in an oblique line was what appeared to be a\n steamboat, its lights all glowing and the smoke\n pouring from its smoke-stack. They all knew\n there was no steamboat plying on the lake and,\n moreover, it was possible to see clear through\n this one. It was a misty, shadowy appear-\n ance. It came on, crossed their bows, and\n suddenly faded away. They sailed ten miles\n out of their way to escape crossing the track of\n the phantom. Mr. Palme? has also seen the\n sea serpent, with which he had an adventure\n that quite eclipses any sea-serpent experience on\n record. An account of the affair was printed in\n a local paper at the time and may be accepted\n as authentic. It was in the winter, and Mr.\n Palmer was crossing the lake on the ice, in his\n sleigh drawn by a pair of ponies. Suddenly the\n ice broke, and he found himself floating in open\n water. While speculating how he might direet\n the course of his private iceberg, he ibserved\n an odious-looking head rearing itself above the\n water. Its little black eyes were fixed on him.\n He drew a knife, his only weapon, from his\n Scandinavian sock and as the serpent plunged ' ' at\n him he boldly struck out. The knife hit a head\n as hard as flint, but it un qu es ti onajblw}. saved the\n owner\u2019s life. The serpent\u2019s fangs, \\ifhed at Mr.\n Palmer\u2019s throat, were diverted and only caught\n the collar of his buffalo overcoat. TheA \" followed\n a hand-to-hand struggle with the monster. Luck-\n ily, the ice-floe drifted into shallow water, and\n the serpent found himself at a disadvantage.\n He endeavored to back water, a movement which\n Mr. Palmer utilized by making a quick turn of\n his body and sliding out of his overcoat. The\n serpent had the coat and has it yet for all that\n is known to the contrary, but he was where he\n could not pursue his malicious design on Mr.\n Palmer\u2019s life. The Devils Lake serpent draws\n about six feet of water and they had reached\n part of the north bay, where the bottom lay\n but four feet below them. To this happy fortune\n the valiant trader owes his life. The serpent\n withdrew into the depths beyond, and in a few\n moments more Mr. Palmer, his ponies, his horses\n and his sleigh had floated ashore. Marvellous\n to relate, when he reached dry land and turned\n around, to look back upon the scene of his peril-\n ous adventure, he found that the lake was again\n frozen over. The ice was solid everywhere, and\n not even a sign of an opening could be de-\n tected.\n</p>\n<p>\n A steamboat is now running on the lake, mak-\n ing daily trips between the city and the fort.\n Its captain has on three separate occasions wit-\n nessed the white light that the Indians saw. He\n and Major Cramsey, the Indian agent, saw it\n clearly on Wednesday, May 15, the day before\n I crossed with Him. It appeared just over the\n prairie about 100 yards from shore. It was a\n high column of white light and it made the day-\n light dim. The captain has also seen the phantom\n ship, but he has not yet run across the sea serpent.\n He is evidently a little jealous of Mr. Palmer in\n this particular, and has his heart set on an\n experience with the serpent. Th \" general impres-\n sion seems to be that he will sooner or later get\n what he wants.\n</p>\n<p>\n L. E.

Jamestown, or\n Jimtown, as you are permitted to call it so\n soon as you have established yourself on good\n terms with it, is as unlike Fargo as Fargo is\n unlike Sioux Falls. All the Southern cities share\n common appearances, but in the North, each looks\n as if it were started under circumstances peculiar\n to itself. Jamestown more nearly resembles an\n Eastern village than any other place I have seen.\n There are good reasons for this. Its growth has\n l > ,eep slow. It has never intoxicated itself with\n that fatal poison, the boom. It has never had\n a Federal laml office or any other artificial aid\n to s\\\\;ell its population and stimulate its com-\n mercb. It has come along to where it is by\n gradual jjtrpce^ses, more rapid in their movement\n at sure > w ^ en everything along the\n</p>\n<p>\n line fft the Northern Pacific was leaping into\n fortune, but never so violent as to produce a\n violent reaction. There has been a reaction.\n Jamestown isn\u2019t as noisy as it was four years\n ago. Property is by no means so high as it was\n then. N o perceptible growth has been made since\n 1884. The people have felt the chilling influence\n of hard times. When they had their last full\n crop, the price of wheat sank below profit point.\n Then there was a drouth. Then there were losses\n by hail. Last year an August frost blighted the\n ripened grain just as it was about to be harvested.\n These troubles hurt Jamestown, as they hurt all\n North Dakota. They rendered dollars dolefully\n scarce.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Northern Pacific land grant made the rail-\n road possible. The railroad made population pos-\n sible. But what was thus a blessing was in\n another respect a curse. As I have already\n remarked in the course of this correspondence, the\n early settlers of an agricultural region are never\n the permanent settlers, whether a railroad or a\n prairie schooner fetched them in. This fact, true\n everywhere, was particularly and deplorably true\n along the line of this road. It introduced into\n the country, in addition to the two classes that\n always lead the van of settlement, ne\u2019er-do-wells\n and rcughs, two other classes equally undesirable,\n speculators and tenderfoot theorists. When the\n Northern Pacific reached the Missouri, it failed,\n and its bonds sold by the pound. Those who\n held them, as it then appeared, had but one chance\n to get their money back, and that was by exchang-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0036/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0036/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0036/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0036/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0036/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0036.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 703797}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"36\">\n<p>\n 34\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n ing bonds for land, and then by selling the\n land. For thirteen cents\u2019 worth of bonds they could\n take an even dollar\u2019s worth of land, and in this\n way tens of thousands of acres, lying right along\n the railroad, were suddenly placed in the hands of\n men whose only object was to dispose of them as\n best they could. They rushed in all kinds of im-\n migration. They startled every poor man in the\n East with stories of the immense profits to he made\n In wheat farming. They offered all sorts of easy\n terms to purchasers. Thousands came flocking\n into the land-grant district who knew no more\n about a farm than a crow knows about a tene-\n ment-house. Speculators grabbed all the land they\n could and boomed it wildl\u00a3. For a time things\n went well. Crops prospered. The weather was sin-\n gularly benignant during the growing season. Th?re\n was plenty of rain, and everybody, tenderfeet,\n ne\u2019er-do-wells and all, made money hand over list.\n They were sanguine at first. Now they became\n crazy. They mortgaged everything they could get\n hold of to buy land. To possess a bonanza farm\n was everybody\u2019s dream. Property values rose to\n a ridiculous point. Everybody plunged eagerly\n into debt. Then came a drouth. The wheat crop\n failed, aDd wheat, in which there was the least ex-\n pense and greatest profit, was all anybody attempt-\n ed to raise. Then all was gone, and a considerable\n portion of them were utterly unable to resist mis-\n fortune. Many fled, disgusted. Another season\n came around, but the success that was attained\n did not enable those who had started wrong to\n get right. A third season came, and its results\n were but little better. They were good enough\n for the genuine farmers, the hard-grained fellows\n who had started in with a single yoke of oxen, a\n plough, a bag of seed and a good, earnest nerve.\n They made money every year, regardless of frost,\n hail or drouth. But it wore away all that re-\n mained of the nerve and patience of the \u201c gentle-\n man\u201d farmer. He abandoned the fight, returned\n to the East, and cursed Dakota. Meanwhile, the\n bottom had been knock\u2019d out of the \u201c boom\u201d every-\n where. Real estate men were loaded to their eyes\n with property taken under foreclosure. Lots of it\n they couldn\u2019t give away. The banks and the store-\n keepers were running the country, and they ran it\n is the main with much generosity. They have\n enabled all the farmers who are worth anything to\n tide over the dark past.\n</p>\n<p>\n But all over North Dakota the signs are clear of\n better times. Feelings of depression have given\n way to those of confidence and hope. The people\n know more than they did. They understand now\n that farming is a business and must be conducted\n on rigidly economical business principles ' . There\n is every prospect now of a splendid crop. Rain\n has fallen all over the State plentifully, and unless\n some accident intervenes the yield of 18S9 will\n reach in the two Dakotas at least 85,000,-\n 000 bushels. The people of the North have\n learned another lesson \u2014 not to depend\n wholly on their staple. They can raise\n corn, dax and barley, and they can\n grow stock readily. They are giving their at-\n tention to these diversifications of their product,\n</p>\n<p>\n and the result has already been felt. An idea\n exists in the East chat Dakota is /too cold and\n bleak for cattle in the winter, and that the period\n during which they must be housed and fed is\n too long to admit of profitable stock-raising.\n This notion is certainly mistaken ; on the con-\n trary, the time, season by season, during which\n stock are under cover here is shorter by a good\n deal than in Ohio or Illinois. And this is the\n reason all these natural prairie grasses that grow\n in such profusion here cure as they fall on the\n</p>\n<p>\n f ound. They don\u2019t dry or wither in the least.\n</p>\n<p>\n saw them six weeks ago, at the end of the cold\n season, square miles of them, as full of juice and\n nutrition as the greenest grass that grows. Their\n average height, when grown to hay, is nine inches,\n but in many regions they grow io the height of\n three and four feet, and the stalk is perfectly\n brittle and as rich as a peach. Sheep and cattle\n eat it, from the highest blade to the root. The\n winter weather here is sunny and dry, with very\n little snow. It is often the case that there are\n not seven cloudy days from December to March.\n The cattle are never housed so long as they can\n get at the grass. If a deep snow comes, they are\n taken in and fed. But last winter there was\n practically no snow at all, and in many cases\n herds of cattle roamed and grazed all winter long.\n Their hair grows heavy and thick, and they do\n not in the least mind the dry cold of this climate.\n Indeed, they like it, and come into the spring\n hardy and fat. This story may be difficult to\n believe in the East, but it is the fact. North\n Dakota, agriculturally, is all right. Those con-\n ditions that seem to bear against it have a fanci-\n ful, rather than an actual, existence. The ex-\n treme cold, the blizzard, the prairie fire, the\n drouth, the summer frost, and all that, do come,\n and they hurt when they come. Nobody claims\n that the land is a Canaan. But it has a soil with\n two feet of richness, and a clay subsoil beneath\n it that holds water like a gourd. Crops will\n mature to harvest in 100 days. Live stock thrive\n and fatten on the range. No industrious farmer\n who knows how to farm can fail, or ever has\n failed, to reap from 20 to 200 per cent profit on\n his investment, despite all the natural ills pos-\n sible to the climate. More than this\u2014 the country\n for 400 miles north of our border\n is all right. It is the same country as our own\n Dakota, It has the same soil, the same healthy\n cold, the same natural plants. If it is higher\n in latitude, it is lower in altitude, and the day\n is coming when North Dakota and the Canadian\n Northwest will grow the wheat crop of the\n world.\n</p>\n<p>\n The artesian water system is as powerful at\n Jamestown as elsewhere along the i alley of the\n Jim River. It is a peculiar fact that only along\n the strip of country, about 100 miles wide,\n through which the Jim crawls sleepily ' can this\n remarkable subterranean supply be obtained, and\n here, at all points, it is unfailingly found. Touch\n it, and it comes tearing forth in a stream that\n shoots fiercely into the air, with a power that\n needs only to be directed to serve an intelligent\n and profitable purpose. The pressure of the wells\n at Jamestown averages about 100 pounds to the\n square inch, developing enough power to run a\n roller-mill. The water is reached at a depth of\n about 1,600 feet. At Huron the pressure is\n Lighter, and the depth less. The depth and\n pressure grow less, in harmonious ratio, as you\n go south, until at Yankton the water is found\n at from 600 to 800 feet, and the pressure is about\n fifty pounds. Jamestown\u2019s elevation above the\n sea-level is said to be 1,500 feet. Yankton\u2019s is\n said to be 700 feet.

On the other hand, it exacts more or\n less from Jamestown and aims to know who runs\n the city\u2019s att ' airs. Its Dakotan headquarters are\n here, and it spends $16,000 a month with the\n local merchants. It receives about $350,000 a\n year in freights, a circumstance suggestive of the\n volume of business done ov the people. The\n county contains about 1,300,000 acres, and per-\n haps as many as 125,000 are under cultivation.\n From these a million bushels of wheat are raised\n and 20o,000 bushels of other grains. Financially,\n the county is well off. The way these people run\n their public ail airs, so lar as their credit is con-\n cerned, may well be imitated in the East. On a\n property valuation of $2,726,523, scarcely a third\n of the real valuation, their tax rate is 16 mills,\n and they owe but $63,500, representing bridges\n and public buildings. They have an insane asy-\n lum here, a State institution, which is composed\n of four large ward buildings, wherein 300\n patients can be accommodated; an office building,\n a boiler house, where steam for heating and elec-\n tricity for lighting, are generated ; an office build,\n ing and an amusement hall, and the whole out-\n lit built in the most substantial manner and\n equipped with every appliance necessary for a\n first-class hospital, cost only about $250,000. It\n is filled with patients, who appear to have every,\n thing done for them that medical skill can devise\n and who are under as little that resembles re-\n straint as is consonant with their safety. At-\n tached to the hospital is a farm, upon which all\n who can work are furnished with employment.\n The whole place is a model of cleanliness, and the\n fresh air runs through it with a commendable\n regard for health.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nothing speaks more eloquently for the char-\n acter of these Western people than their public\n institutions. They have $2,000,000 invested in\n educational and charitable establishments. These\n include an agricultural college, two universities,\n two normal schools, two penitentiaries, two iu-\n sane hospitals, a school for deaf mutes, a relorm pris-\n on, modelled after our own reformatory at Elmira,\n and a school of mines at Rapid City, in the Black\n Hills, which has been of the largest assistance in\n developing the resources of that remarkable re-\n gion. Eighty per cent of the children in Dakota\n of school age are in actual attendance in the publio\n schools, and the value of the publio\n school property reaches quite $3,500,000.\n This is astonishing when one considers\n over what an immense area these people\n are spread and how rapidly they\n have made their homes and built up their\n educational system. In addition to the facilities\n for mental training that have sprung from public\n generosity no less than twelve denominational\n colleges are in active operation. One of them,\n controlled by Presbyterians, is placed in this city.\n It is doing an excellent work, and it owes a part\n of its usefulness to the benclicence of Colonel\n Elliott F. Shepard. These Dakotans, in founding\n a State, began at the beginning, and gave their\n children schools even before they had built them-\n selves homes.

Its\n people are not numerous, but they have a great\n talent for pulling all together. Their social or-\n ganization is strong and compact. Incidentally\n they may be railroad or anti-railroad, ring or\n anti-ring, Republican or Democrat, farmers or\n corporation men, Methodists or Catholics, but\n primarily they are for Bismarck, and no other\n interest is allowed to come in where the interests\n of Bismarck are involved. This concentration of\n local forces, when sagaciously directed, never fails\n to make a city and to put it into prominence.\n Bismarck owes everything to the singleness of\n purpose and the unity of action which have\n characterized her people. They undertook to\n build a town before they had settled the country.\n Even yet the greatest area of untaken land in\n Dakota is around the capital city. Even yet two\n States, each larger than Massachuletts, could be\n made from tne public domain now awaiting entry\n in the Bismarck land office. Any reader who\n wishes to get a really accurate conception of the\n land question here should follow my description\n with a map. Any good atlas will do, but the\n Northern Pacific folder furnishes the best. This\n can be had at any large railway station, or by\n application to the company ' s office in St. PauL\n The seventh standard parallel divides the Da-\n kotas, leaving each of them 400 miles wide by\n 200 miles long. The Northern Pacific runs across\n North Dakota in a straight line from Fargo. Its\n land grant includes every other section, that is,\n every other block one mile square, for fifty miles\n on either side of its track. All the country west\n of the Missouri and below that grant in both\n Dakotas, except the Black Hills region lying\n within the two forks of the Cheyenne River, is\n Indian country, and is now the subject of ne-\n gotiation between the Sioux and the Gov-\n ernment. Very little of this reservation is in\n North Dakota, but that larger half of the State\n west from Jamestown is unsettled. The Mani-\n toba Railroad, with its central office in St. Paul,\n crosses the Territory from Grand Forks, along a\n line about 150 miles north from the line of the\n Northern Pacific. It passes through some of the\n finest wheat lands in Dakota, still untouched and\n subject to entry at ihe United States Land Office\n in Devil\u2019s Lake.

About twenty miles west from James-\n town is the long line of hills and ravines called\n the Coteaux du Missouri. These lands are sup-\n posed to be unavailable for farming, though I\n noticed as pretty lields of wheat there as else-\n where. The fact is. 1 fancy, that they have been\n depreciated simply because the land beyond them\n is everywhere level and more easily worked. In\n the valleys between the coteaux there are thou-\n sands of little lakes and ponds, and, as the coteaux\n grow thick, luxuriant grass, they furnish the\n best facilities for stock-farming.\n</p>\n<p>\n West of Bismarck and the river the country is\n geneially level until the Bad Lands are reached.\n They are not bad lands at ail, but wonderful\n lands. They constitute one of the most marvellous\n physical appearances to be observed on this con-\n tinent. They aie come upon suddenly, and with-\n out any suggestion that the prairie level is to be\n so strangely broken. All at once numberless\n peaks as sharp in their formation as the hngers\n on your hand, rise straight from the earth, an\n army of massive buttes. They are of all con-\n ceivable shapes, some are circular pyramids, per-\n fect in form. Others rise like quartz crystals,\n with sides as smooth as a board, and frequently\n from one of these straight and regular buttes\n the petrified stumps of enormous trees will pro-\n trude, silicitied by the action of the\n</p>\n<p>\n same waters that gave figure to the\n</p>\n<p>\n buttes themselves ages and ages ago. ihe Bad\n Lands begin about lOu miles west of Bismarck\n and follow the course, north and south, of the\n Little Missouri River. North of the railroad\n their finest scenic effects are on the eastern\n side of the Little Missouri, and no feat of pen\n or brush can give any fair conception of. the\n extravagant splendor of these fantastic lands.\n They assume not only every conceivable appear-\n ance, but all the appearances that might be at-\n tributed to the hand and the imagination of a\n race of mental freaks. They twist themselves\n into 10,000 different contortions. They show you\n devils, plunging horses, wolf-heads, old men, cut\n and moulded by wind and water in clay and\n sand and limestone, or in the firmer substance\n formed by petrification, shapes that seem oddly\n harmonious with the natural life that for so long\n a time made these wild places their habitation.\n At every turn your mind is ne.vly startled. You\n see devices not only in themselves grotesque, but\n standing, forth, shooting out, plunging down in\n such utterly novel and unnatural situations.\n Enormous masses of rock seem in the distance\n to be hanging by a single silken thread, poised\n over a plain on which a hundred figures dressed\n in white, blue, black, green, gray and yellow\n are dancing in gleeful and thoughtless sport,\n springing upwards, turning somersaults and per-\n forming all the tricks of a harlequin. The buttes\n themselves, with some part clad in the greenest\n verdure, elsewhere in the black weaving of a\n vegetation that has turned to coal, here in the\n pink trimmings of real terra cotki which lignite\n fires have been slowly baking, there in the creamy\n laces knitted by the winds through great deposits\n of alkali left upon the surface of the soil by\n waters that have long since been drained away,\u2014\n the buttes themselves, multiplied 1 0,00o times and\n chiselled into castles, domes, spires, towers and\n monuments, present each its separate picture of\n weird but magnificent disorder. Those wise fel-\n lows who know everything say that there was\n once a great lake here which was gradually\n drained away through the two Missouris, and\n that the waters, as they swept toward the sea,\n cut and modelled the Bad Lands. Their name\n is an Indian legacy.\n</p>\n<p>\n The white man, when he came, soon found a\n use to which the Bad Lands could profitably be\n put, and they are now supporting immense herds\n of sheep and cattle. The grass grown upon the\n buttes and on the level plains between them is\n the best there is on earth. In winter the cattle\n have plenty of protection, and they take care\n of themselves. There is a sufficiency of water.\n</p>\n<p>\n After turning the herds loose, nothing remains\n for men to uo but to bring them together again\n twice a year, that the young may be properly\n branded and the fat steers shipped to market.\n Some hay is put up so that there may be no\n scarcity of food in case of a heavy lall of snow.\n But heavy snows are unusual in the Bad Lands,\n and unless the grass on the ground is actually\n beyond reach the cattle much prefer it to hay.\n Many noted ranches are in the Bad Lands, and\n a few years ago\u2014 les- than five\u2014 the cowboys\n of this region were *\u2022 bad men from Bitter Greek.\u201d\n Their favorite amusement was to stop the rail-\n road train and make the conductor dance for\n them. Occasionally they would go through the\n cars and gather a few purses. How surely and\n quickly all that sort of thing flies before a tide\n of immigration. The cowboys keep lar away\n from the towns and depots now, and as you ride\n through the Bad Lands to-day you can see tennis\n courts chalked out on the lawns of the houses\n around depot sites and spruce young men and\n pretty girls loving away with rackets snd bright\n eyes in the most advanced Bar Harbor fashion.\n Four years ago, if a man with a silk hat had\n left the train at Medora the chances are even\n that neither he nor the hat would ever have\n been heard from again. Now, the English tourist\n wanders around and ogles through his eye-glass\n and wobbles his \u201c r : s\u201d and drawls his \u201c dawncher-\n knaws\u201d all unmolested. The avenger is gone.\n You must look elsewhere to find the old-time\n frontier.\n</p>\n<p>\n In some parts of Dakota the fuel question is a\n serious one. Within an area marked by a radius\n of 200 miles not a stick of natural timber rises\n above the plains. Not a suggestion of coal ap-\n pears under them. All fuel, of whatever nature,\n must be fetched in by the railroads, and the\n railroads don\u2019t give their services for nothing.\n With such long winter seasons, the cost of living\n is heavily increased by the freight charges on\n fuel. In the course of a few years this situation\n will be materially alleviated. North and west of\n Bismarck, on both sides of the river, are coal\n fields of such immense proportions as to be\n practically inexhaustible. They extend in all di-\n rections, running north almost to the international\n line, and west into the Bad Lands. They run\n deep into the earth. Several veins have been\n followed to a depth of r > ,0o0 feet without any\n indication that they intended to give out. In\n Bismarck and all along the line of the Northern\n Pacific this coal is used almost exclusively It is\n a lignite formation and appears to be the sub-\n structure of the country. Every farmer in that\n part of Dakota which is north and west of the\n capital possesses his own supply. When a lad\n is told by liis mother to fetch her some coal he\n goes into his mine, digs it out with one or two\n blows of his pick, and brings it back in a solid\n lump on his shoulder. Several mines have been\n opened for commercial purposes, and they are\n succeeding fairly well as business enterprises\u2014\n none too well, of course, thou eh that is no fault\n of the coal\u2019s. But where everybody can do his\n own mining there is not as large a demand as\n there might be for the results of corporate labor.\n The mines will have their rich opportunity as\n soon as Bismarck secures a railroad into South\n Dakota. There is where the coal is needed, and\n needed seriously. A road is now graded and lack-\n ing only the rails as far south as Aberdeen.\n It will be put in operation within another\n year, and then the mines can be worked\n to real advantage. With such an im.\n mense supply available, the price can never be\n forced to an extravagant figure. It, now ranges\n from one to two dollars a ten. The coal fs soft and\n slowly slacks when exposed to the air. so that\n larger quantities are needed than of harder and\n firmer coal. It is not mineral. It is lighter\n than the Town coal, has more water, more volatile\n morter. less carbon and less sulphur.

With this industry waiting to be\n turned lo profit, and with the great Missouri flow-\n ing at, her feet, Bismarck has no need to worry\n about her future.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Missouri at Bismarck is better behaved, on\n the whole, than elsewhere along its course. It\n rises 1,500 miles further north and west, and occa-\n sionally in the early spring when the Chinook\n winds, sweeping across Northern Montana, melt\n the ice and start a rapid flow of water, gorges are\n formed at and around Bismarck, where the ice\n remains solid, and a flood is brought on. But the\n city, securely protected behind enormous bluff ' s, re-\n gards this misdemeanor as venial. The headquar-\n ters of the Missouri River Transportation Company\n are here, and it has various establishments, shops,\n shipyards and freight-houses, down upon the \u201c first\n bench,\u201d as the lowest slope of land nearest the\n river is called. The company\u2019s freight-house is a\n singular structure, 45 feet wide and 600 feet long.\n To some people figures never convey much of an\n idea, and therefore I will add that, n building 45\n feet by 600 is about as big a building as is worth\n while making in all this world of human endeavor.\n Two winters ago, the river, apparently dissatisfied\n with the situation of the building, quietly got up\n one night and laid it on a bluff some 200 feet\n above its orieinal site and about 400 feet nearer\n the town. Then, having stowed some thousands\n of tons of ice against, the freight-house to keep it\n in place, the river lowered its back and swept\n amiably on as before. There is a personality\n about the Missouri and a mischievous motive\n about its rascally performances that are highly\n amusing. The huge, unsightly steamboats that\n ply between St. Louis and Bismarck, and then for\n another thousand miles onward to Fort Benton,\n carrying from sixty to two hundred tons\n of freight, draw only from two to four feet of\n water! This is hard to believe, but it is a fact.\n And even then, they will often get into trouble.\n They will be going placidly along when suddenly\n the river will toss a sandbar in their way, and they\n will be buried in mud and misery. But the in-\n genuity of man has not failed to provide for this\n emergency. Each steamer is equipped with two\n big poles. These are let down into the mud and\n water, and by means of ropps and pulleys the boat\n is hoisted upon the poles out of the stream. Then,\n when the current, to its undoubted regret and an-\n noyance, has washed away the sand, the steamboat\n Jauntily proceeds. Nothing is funnier than to see\n a great, big boat pulling itself on top of a couple\n of crutches to cheat the sandbar. It is an inter-\n esting fact that since the Northern Pacific\n bridge was constructed across the Missouri\n it has shifted twenty-two Inches. Its huge supports\n are buried below the river bottom upon bed-\n rock, but they have moved, and tons, I had almost\n said aei-s. of earth have been depcsite l around\n them to assist in breaking the force of the ice\n gorges.\n</p>\n<p>\n In closing, as I do herewith, the story that has\n been too fleetly told of the material condition and\n the wonderful achievements of the two Dakotas,\n it may be desirable to collect a few of the more\n eloquent facts in a single forceful group. The\n population of these sister States lias come up in\n eighteen years from 100,000 to 600,000. In\n twelve years the acreage acquired by actual settle-\n ment lias been 44,000.000. The first railroad\n track was laid in 1 872. To-day you can ride\n 5,000 miles over steel rails within the boundarv\n lines of North and South Dakota. You can start,\n for your newly taken homestead on a Monday and\n nan reach your final destination in three days\n without ever leaving your car. You will find\n your household sroods on a sidetrack waitinsr for\n you. and by the next Monday you can be breaking\n</p>\n<p>\n sod for your first crop. Conditions are not as\n they were in the days, still vividly clear in living\n men\u2019s memories, when the prairies were only to be\n crossed in wooden-wheeled carts, drawn by a yoke\n of oxen and furnished with a barrel of flour in\n one end and a barrel of water in the other! To-\n day there are in Dakota 250,000 horses, 250,000\n milch cows, \u00a900,000 cattle, 230,000 sheep, 600,000\n hogs. They are worth $50,000,000, and to this\n grand fortune a 10 per cent accretion must be\n added every year. At this moment a harvest is\n growing, with every promise of happy realization,\n of 35,000,000 bushels of corn. 70,000,000 of wheat,\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.000. 000 of flax, 10,000,000 of barley, 50,000,-\n 000 of oats and 5,000,000 of potatoes! And of\n the imperial domain stretching from a central point\n 200 miles north, east, south and west of the\n</p>\n<p>\n 06.000. 000 acres that constitute these States,\n</p>\n<p>\n barely 7,000,000\u2014 less than one-thirteenth\u2014 have\n felt the harrow\u2019s touch ! Everywhere, in social\n life, in religious life, in political life, a perfect\n and liberal organization exists. Wherever there\n is a settlement the spires of half a dozen churches\n rise and the bells of half a dozen schools sound\n out. Crime is scarcely heard of in Dakota.

Then\n he explained, and as I travelled further I found\n that sinch is the great Northwestern game of\n cards, a recent invention, and played everywhere\n and by everybody. You can see people playing\n sinch in the hotel parlors, in the barrooms, on the\n cars, in private houses, and its phrases are the\n slang of the day. It is a variation of High, Low,\n Jack. The counting cards are the high, the low,\n the jack, the ten-spot, or game, each of which\n counts one, and the pedro, or five of trumps,\n which counts five. You deal each player six\n cards, and one after another they bet; that\n is, offer to make so many points, as many as they\n think their hands are capable of making. The\n player who otters the highest bet is entitled to\n name the trump, and the great effort of every,\n body else is \u201c to get the sinch on him\u201d ; that is,\n to prevent him from making as many points as\n he has agreed to make. If he fails to make good\n his offer, he is \u201c sinched.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The politics of North Dakota has been one long\n game of sinch with South Dakota. It has been\n impossible to induce the two sections of the Ter-\n ritory to agree. The Northern people have\n claimed that they were paying far more than their\n share of the taxes without receiving any com-\n pensating benefits from the revenue raised. The\n Southern people, disputing these allegations, pre-\n sent others directly in contravention. They say\n the Northern men go into conventions and Legis-\n latures with them and want to run the entire\n show. The real trouble is that North and South\n are apart in interest. They have no common\n cause. They differ from each other in character,\n method and purpose, and they cannot see things\n in the same light. The first clash led to others\n and there was nothing to bring them together.\n There is not much doubt, I faiicy, that the North-\n ern men generally \u201c got the sinch on\u201d tre South.\n They are as crafty a lot of politicians as can be\n developed under a Territorial system. Being in\n the minority, their sole opportunity lay in or-\n ganization. They knew that. They understood\n that they could only accomplish what they want-\n ed by acting as a unit, by splitting the Southern\n men into factions and by joining hands with that\n faction which most wanted their support. Their\n leader, one of the most remarkable men in the\n Western country, and essentially a product of it,\n was and is the Hon. Alexander McKensie.\n</p>\n<p>\n They don\u2019t say \u201c the Honorable\u201d out here to\n anybody. Western people waste no time in super-\n fluous compliment. Many of their peculiarities\n are resultant in a measure from their earlier as-\n sociation with the Indians. Half the people you\n meet in Western Dakota and Eastern Montana\n will say, in greeting you, simply \u201c How ?\u201d \u201c How\u201d\n is the universal Indian salutation, and the only\n English word you can induce many of them to\n speak. There are dozens of young Indians who\n have received a complete English education at\n Carlisle or Hampton, who have gone back to their\n tribes, relapsed into barbarism, and who wouldn\u2019t\n now for a farm say another English word than\n \u201c How.\u201d White people have token it up, and its\n use illustrates the Western tendency to put every-\n thing into as few words as possible. I saw a\n man go into a Montana postoffice the other day\u2014\n a white man \u2014 and give his wrists a queer turn.\n The postmaster in reply handed him an envelope.\n The man wasn\u2019t deaf or dumb. He was only using\n the Injun sign language. It. was no trouble to\n turn his wrists, while valuable time and breath\n would have been spent in saying, \u201c Kind sir, will\n you be good enough to give me a 2-cent stamped\n envelope?\u201d Of course, not everybody emplovs\n these economical devices, but they are sufficiently\n</p>\n<p>\n in use to exert a moral influence on all conversa-\n tion. Mr. McKensie, great as he is (and nobody\n here is greater), is always addressed as \u201c Aleck,\u201d\n not wholly because he is a popular politician, but\n as well because \u201c Aleck\u201d is a short and direct\n method of reaching the desired result.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. McKensie\u2019s leadership in North Dakota poli-\n tics, so far as he cnooses to exert it, is command-\n ing. The secret of that lies, I suspect, in his-\n anility to perceive as well what he cannot uo as\n wnat he can. Bride is the rock on which most\n political leaders of the absolute type are wrecked,\n lo show how very big they are, tney attempt the\n particular enterprise they cannot succeed in. Mr.\n Mcivensie has not made that blunder yet. His\n personality is charming. He came to Dakota an\n ignorant young iScotcnman, without a friend in\n tne world or a penny. He peddled \u201c pop\u201d in the\n streets of Bismarck. He worked as a sectaon-\n hand, shovelling dirt on the Northern Pacilie Rail-\n road, and his first distinctive rise in society was\n when he became a section boss. He isn\u2019t ashamed\n of that past, and i met no one in North Dakota\n who was ashamed of it for him. But it is de-\n cidedly a past. He is a great big, good-natured-\n looking giant, with clear blue eyes that gaze\n straight into whatever they are directed at, and\n a particularly strong jawbone. That jawbone\n is the thing that illustrates Mr. McKensie. It\n will exert more influence on the organization of\n North Dakota\u2019s State Government than the entire\n anatomy of most other men.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is impossible to exaggerate the importance of\n Mr. McKensie\u2019s relation to the work now being,\n done la North Dakota. If you talk with him, you\n will observe that he never uses the personal pro-\n noun, that he never raises his voice above the con-\n versational tone, that he never tells you anything,\n you don\u2019t already know, and that, as a result of\n the talk, you have, somehow or another, a better-\n opinion of yourself than you had before. If, before\n seeing him, you have travelled through South Da-\n kota, you will wonder where the horns and the\n cloven foot are of which you heard so much.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nothing I have said about Mr. McKensie must\n lead to the inference that the people of North Da-\n kota are lacking in self-assertion. On the con-\n trary, it is the fidelity with which he has served\n their causes that has given him his paramount\n place. They find no fault with him for being pow-\n erful. From Yankton to Aberdeen in Soutli Da- \u25a0\n kota you hear him execrated as a tyrant and a.\n boss. From Pembina to Bismarck in North Da-\n kota you hear him glorified as a patriot. The\n people on whom he has so often \u201c got the sinch\u201d\n say ho is without a redeeming virtue. The people\n for whom the \u201c sinching\u201d was done say that noth-\n ing on earth is too good for him.\n</p>\n<p>\n North Dakota\u2019s experiment in constitution-mak-\n ing will be watched -with profound interest by\n thoughtful people. Of the seventy-five men who\n will compose the convention, forty are farmers.\n There are but five men among them all who can be\n called politicians. Only ten, I think, have ever\n held office. Only six have ever been in the Legis-\n lature. Only six are lawyers. It is decidedly an.\n of-the-people body. No class has attempted to\n control it, and no one can so much as guess how it >\n will stand on anything. The prevailing opinion is\n that it will prove to be a strong temperance body,\n but beyond this no one attempts to indulge in\n much prophecy. The Farmers\u2019 Alliance is strong\n in both Dakotas, and particularly strong i i the\n South. It includes nearly 800 local alliances,\n each containing from twenty-five to 200 members.\n Its general influence is undoubtedly excellent, and\n it has succeeded in securing for the farmers many\n important concessions from the railroads, from\n machinery manufacturers, and from other people\n with whom they have large aggregate dealings.\n As a defence against impositions and aggre-sions.\n against, faulty and hostile legislation, against\n everything, indeed, that menaced agricultural in-\n terests, which, of course, are the prime interests-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0041/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0041/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 537, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 868}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0041/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1075, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1736}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0041/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3473}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0041/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0041.jp2", "height": 3473, "width": 2151, "levels": 6, "size": 586286}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"41\">\n<p>\n NORTH DAKOTA.\n</p>\n<p>\n 39\n</p>\n<p>\n of the people, it has proved powerful. But latterly\n its officers have been taking a position in politics\n which portends trouble. ' The president of the Al-\n liance is a man named H. L. Houcks, said to be a\n Canadian. Mr. Houcks unquestionably possesses\n considerable executive ability, but he is rapidly\n steering the Alliance upon rocks. He argues that\n because the farmers constitute so large a propor-\n tion of the population of Dakota they should name\n all the State officials. He openly announces his\n intention to make the Alliance organization the\n controlling factor in politics. Every candidate\n must be an Alliance man, and no one is to be\n allowed to hold office except he be lranked by\n Mr. Houcks. On this principle there is no reason\n why the Masons or the Odd Fellows, the Cath-\n olics or the Baptists should not ligure up their re-\n spective strength and demand a proportional rec-\n ognition. If a man is to be Governor or Sen-\n ator, not because he possesses peculiar qualifica-\n tions as a public man, but because he is a farmer,\n no reason exists why any other class of citizens\n should not use the same argument, and politics\n would soon become a wrangle between classes of\n the community, each to serve its separate advan-\n tage rather than that of the whole people. The\n Republican majority in South Dakota is 20 , 000 .\n In North Dakota it is fully 10 , 000 . These are ma-\n jorities which Mr. Houcks cannot disturb, even\n should he attempt to sell the Alliance to the Dem-\n ocrats. An effort of this character was made a\n year ago, when Mr. Houcks induced his followers\n to bolt the Republican candidate for Congress.\n He hitched his team to the Democratic cart, but\n the team wouldn\u2019t go. He found himself unable\n to deliver the Alliance vote. The Republican can-\n didate\u2019s majority was greater than ever.\n</p>\n<p>\n Unwarned by this interesting experience, Mr.\n Loucks and his friends are talking energetically\n about nominating a full ticket against that sub-\n mitted by the Republican Convention in South\n Dakota, their scheme being to have the Demo-\n crats indorse it. They ha\\e actually called a\n convention of the Alliance at Huron on June\n 28 , when they undoubtedly hope to put through\n this ambitious undertaking. Their proceedings\n are exciting some interest, directed chiefly at\n Houcks himself. People are curious to know what\n he is after. That he must be after something is\n regarded as certain. The farmers of Dakota com-\n pose the Republican party. They and the party\n are equivalent terms. In supporting it they sup-\n port themselves. They could by no possibility\u2019\n hurt it without hurting themselves. They could\n serve no conceivable end of their own by\n giving the State to the Democrats, though they\n might serve an end of Mr. Houck\u2019s. Fortunately\n they understand the situation. They are not for\n</p>\n<p>\n sale. Neither will they allow their excellent or-\n ganization to be wrecked on the barren rock of\n anybody ' s ambition. Before the convention meets\n Mr. Houcks will probably realize the futility of\n the present plan. If he doesn\u2019t, he will in-\n evitably meet with disaster.\n</p>\n<p>\n In North Dakota the Alliance is under a wiser\n and safer leadership. No division into separate\n State organizations has yet taken place, nut the\n line has been drawn, and the arrangements are\n made for an early division. It is quite possible\n that an Alliance man will be nominated on the\n Republican ticket for Governor, and. in any\n event, the farmers\u2019 organization will be recog-\n nized. Thus far it has escaped many of the perils\n which so often overcome associations intended to\n further class interests. It has not spread over\n 60 much ground as the old Grange attempted to\n cover. It does not antagonize every other branch\n of industry. It runs an insurance company and\n a purchasing company, insuring against all kinds\n of natural catastrophes to crops, and purchasing\n the staple articles, such as twine and machinery,\n that farmero require. This policy keeps the Al-\n liance within reasonable bounds, and wards from\n it much of the prejudice usually aroused against\n such societies. As yet it is regarded throughout\n all Dakota with much sympathy. The only thing\n that can hurt it is crazy politics on the part of\n its leaders. Several of them are now badly\n touched with the swelled head.\n</p>\n<p>\n Senatorial timber in North Dakota is plenti-\n ful, and the people are busy discussing the par-\n ticular qualities of particular trees. Nobody\u2019s\n fortunes are very far advanced as yet, though\n the elect, on of ex-Governor Gilbert A. Pierce may\n be said to be more than foreshadowed. Gov-\n ernor Pierce was the successor of Governor Ord-\n way, and was displaced by Cleveland to make\n room for Governor Church. If the election were\n to take place now. Governor Pierce would almost\n certainly be chosen as one of the Senators. Who\n tl.e other would be is a purely speculative prob-\n lem. Governor Ordway is the man most talked\n about, but he and Pierce are both from Bismarck.\n The Red River Valley will claim one of the\n Senators, and already presents a score of more or\n less distinguished candidates, of whom the biggest,\n in more senses than one, is Major Edwards, of\n \u201c The Fargo Argus.\u201d The handsomest is General\n Harrison Allen, formerly of Pennsylvania, which\n is understood to be unanimously for him. 1 ' he\n homeliest is the Hon. Jud Ha Moure, who con-\n trols the half-breed counties on the border, and\n who is much better than he looks. The present\n Secretary of the Territory, Mr. Richardson, is a\n quiescent candidate, neither seeking nor reject-\n ing, and, \u2019f I were a prophet\u2014 but, then. I\u2019m not.\n</p>\n<p>\n H.

He comes upon another soil, an-\n other climate, another people and many another\n way of living. He enters the domain of the miner\n and the stock-raiser. He finds himself in a\n wonderland, where strange things never quit\n happening, where both accident and industry\n make men rich almost before they know it, and\n where mad-cap luck tosses favors about with a\n hand as prodigal as it is inconsiderate. Montana\n is an infant giant, which as yet knows nothing of\n its strength, and less than nothing about how to\n use it. Here and there are old towns, where\n custom has made a grade and laid grooved rails\n upon it; but, for its length and breadth, it is as\n strange even to its own people as were the new\n Indies to the European adventurers of the six-\n teenth century. Vast expanses of country are still\n unsurveyed. Fertile valleys, capable of produc-\n ing millions in crops, are as yet known only to\n wolves and the Indians. Mountains where the\n clearest indications of mineral wealth have been\n observed are as jet unscratched. The country is\n unsettled in all directions, and no one can look\n around him as he travels along lonely miles\n of untenanted prairie or over mountains, where\n no trails are to be found except those of mountain\n lions, bears and elk, without feeling that how-\n ever great the work of these Montana people has\n been in digging treasures and in growing grain,\n they have not yet recorded so much as the pref-\n ace to the book of their achievement.\n</p>\n<p>\n Eastern Montana, lying along the Y ' ellowstone\n and the Upper Missouri, is almost wholly an agri-\n cultural and stock-raising country. Its lands are\n \u201c bottoms,\u201d \u201c benches,\u201d \u201c hogs\u2019 backs,\u201d \u201c divides\u201d\n and mountains. The mountains have not been\n investigated. To understand the character of the\n country, it is necessary to know that it emerged\n 6lowly from former watery confines. It was all\n under water not so very long ago, but long enough\n to require the use of cycles in the measurement\n of time, and as the waters were drained off they\n first left mountain heights. Then they were parted\n by long ridges of high hills traversing miles of\n country. The land lies comparatively low on\n either side of these ridges, and they are called \u201c di-\n vides.\u201d Still falling away and seeking escape into\n</p>\n<p>\n the ocean, the waters left many big round mounds,\n nicknamed \" hogs\u2019 backs,\u201d many buttes, either in\n series or solitary. Then, for ages, the waters de-\n clined but slowly. Their beds lay between these\n hills and buttes, where they formed a succession\n of great lakes. What used to be lake bottoms are\n now the valleys of permanent rivers and creeks,\n eternally fed by mountain snow. These valleys\n constitute the arable lands of Montana and Wy-\n oming and their soil, being for a 6olid foot in\n depth a pure alluvial deposit, is necessarily rich\n and fertile. The lake waters as they fell formed\n a succession of prairie levels, each lower than the\n other, each thousands of acres in extent, called\n \u201c benches,\u201d and the last bench, the one nearest\n the rivers or creeks, is a \u201c bottom.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, then, you understand how this is at once\n a wonderful mineral country, a wonderful stock\n country and a wonderful agricultural country.\n The gold, silver, tin, iron and coal are in the\n mountains, and $30,000,000 is dug out every\n year. The cattle have an illimitable grazing field\n upon the hills and prairies with a thousand moun-\n tain streams, little and big, to afford them water,\n coulees tor ravines) innumerable in which to seek\n i-helter from storms, and hay two feet high td\n feed on. The prairie benches will grow anj ' thing\n that can be grown in a temperate climate, wheat,\n corn, oats, barley, rye, garden vegetables and\n fruits. You can come and see all these things\n growing, the people are hospitable, and will cheer-\n fully show what they possess. Production is de-\n pendent upon irrigation, which in man 3 r valleys is\n reduced to a perfect system. I shall presently de-\n scribe the practical operation of the system, but\n it is enough to say at this time that its success is\n beyond all question or dispute. Those who do\n dispute it, don\u2019t understand it. In Custer County,\n of which Miles City is the capital town, there are\n about 15,000,000 acres in crop to-day upon land\n which without irrigation would be as dry as dust.\n Thirty ditches, supplied from the Y ' ellowstone\n mainly, furnish the necessary water, and the farmer\n who understands his business knows ju-t when,\n where and in what amount to distribute his moist-\n ure. In the matter of irrigation Custer County is\n not a model. Its people are given over to stock\n raising and comparatively little ranching (or\n farming) is done. What the country needs most\n for 150 miles around Miles City are ranchmen.\n Not, even the home market for farm products is\n fully supplied.\n</p>\n<p>\n Miles City was an outcome of the Custer massa-\n cre. The Indians, in 1876, held the whole country\n from the Bad Lands, in Dakota, to the Big Horn\n River, in Montana. Their full strength was\n amassed along the Yellowstone. They escaped\n from General Terry and scampered into the Big\n Horn country, where Custer and his brave 300\n were mowed down. That event decided the Gov-\n ernment to take vigorous measures and to con-\n fine the Sioux within the limits of their present\n reservation, east of the Missouri. Two forts were\n established, one, named for Custer, within sight\n of the bluff on which he was killed, and one here\n at Miles City, which took its name from that of\n th \u25a0 pluckiest, and 6urel.v the luckiest, Indian flghte\n in the land. North of the Yellowstone the country\n was thrown open, and cattle-men soon possessed\n it. Enormous bands of Texan steers were driven\n north from the breeding lands, with Texan cow-\n boys attending them. The Texan cowboy of that\n day was usually a man with a record. He was\n \u201c bad,\u201d and \u201c badness\u201d -was his pride and glory.\n No material inducement could have made him\n virtuous. He settled the Indian question in short\n order. Cowboys new in the business took Indians\n as targets and learned to shoot by practising on a\n Crow buck. They were a ruffianly lot of knaves,\n but they quickly subjected the r\u00b0d ruffians and\n prepared the land for peaceful settlement. As the\n railroad drew onward toward the coast they dis-\n appeared. The herds they tended were owned by\n business men in the East who wanted to make\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0043/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0043/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 537, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 868}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0043/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1075, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1736}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0043/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3473}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0043/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0043.jp2", "height": 3473, "width": 2151, "levels": 6, "size": 743774}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"43\">\n<p>\n MONTANA.\n</p>\n<p>\n 41\n</p>\n<p>\n money, and who saw only financial disaster ahead\n of them so long as their interests were in the hands\n of desperadoes. Little by little new methods and\n new men made the country warm for dare-devils.\n Many were hung by \u201c vigilantes.\u201d Many were\n put in prison. Many escaped to South America\n and Canada. Such as were naturally des, toils of\n living decent, honest lives, and were \u201c bad\u201d only\n by reason of their association, turned over a new\n leaf and settled down. Gambling houses were\n \u2022suppressed. Fast women, the worst curse of early\n frontier life, were chased away.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then, from 1880 to 1883, came the era of the\n buffalo hunter. The hills aud plains at that time\n were covered with Buffaloes. Driven out of Min-\n nesota, Kansas, Iowa, Nebraska and Dakota, these\n noble animals had reached their last refuge ; but a\n refuge it soon ceased to be. They were literally\n butchered. Miles City became a depot for the\n miserable crew of lazy fellows, who, capable of\n no honest and useful employment, spent their time\n slaughtering the poor buffalo. Scores were killed\n where one was skinned. There was, of course! an\n industry in the buffalo hides, and carloads were\n shipped every day. But by far the greater num-\n ber of the cattle were shot down just for fun, and\n left to rot where they fell, untouched by the knife.\n In four years the end came, and in those four years\n millions of buffaloes were inexcusably, wickedly\n -slain. Few were left. In the Northwestern Can-\n adian country, and in the basin formed by the\n two lifts of the Big Horn Mountains a few small\n bands remain. There\u2019s a captive band in the Yel-\n lowstone, and a few little bunches here and there\n through the country, and these are all. They will\n not breed in captivity, and none of the various\n attempts to cross them with ordinary cattle has\n proved a clear success. The havoc wrought by\n the buffalo hunters of \u201980, \u201981, \u201982 and \u201983 cannot\n be made up for now.\n</p>\n<p>\n The frontier towns of Montana and Wyoming\n underwent now another distinct change. They\n had advanced a step or two when the cowboy gave\n way to the hunter. They came up many steps\n when the hunter, forced to starve, work or run\n away, preferred the last chance and began to drop\n off. The gin-mills quickly lost their old-time im-\n portance. Gambling ceased to be esteemed the\n -chief end of man. Runaway convicts ceased to be\n the greatest, men in a community. Murderers\n found murdering too risky a trade. In-coming\n capital demanded the calm reign of order. New\n immigrants turned their attention to ranching,\n banking and store-keeping. They were always\n ready to help the sheriff when he needed help and\n to stiffen his back when he need\u00b0d courage. Every-\n body was tired of wild life. Everybody wanted\n to be comfortable and happy. The refining influ-\n ence of woman, the most potent influence of all,\n whether for good or ill, was brought to bear upon\n all conditions of society, and within three years\n more, or by the end of 1886, the last vestige of\n dare-devil life in the Northwestern towns had been\n swept away. Six years ago Miles City was a\n veritable hell. To-day it is one of the quietest,\n busiest little places in the land. I have looked in\n vain to find a frontier town such as used to fur-\n nish stories of wholesale shooting matches. There\n is not even a frontier any longer. There is no\n place where civilized life, or even settlement, stops\n entirely. Just when you think you have reached\n such a place you see smoke ahead.\n</p>\n<p>\n The cattle district of which Miles City is the\n \u2022centre reaches to the north 100 miles, to the south\n another hundred, and to the east a hundred more.\n It embraces about 300 \u201c outfits,\u201d and each of these\n owns from 5 00 to 30,000 cattle. The winter of\n 1886 was a long, cold, bitter season, and it\n brought, heavy losses to the cattle men. Ordi-\n narily, and always until that season\u2019s unhappy\n experience had taught, a lesson, the cattle were\n left to shift for themselves all winter on the range.\n Montana winters are usually short. The first\n severe cold comes with Christmas, and the ice\n</p>\n<p>\n \u25a0 begins to melt in March. Little snow falls, and\n the percentage of loss among the cattle on account\n of the weather is altogether inconsiderable. They\n can easily paw away the snow and get at the\n grass. But early in the winter of 1 886 a monster\n storm came, and after it had laid a foot of snow on\n the ground it turned to sleet and froze a truck\n crust over the snow. Week after week, month\n after month, the. bitter cold continued, and from\n 60 to 75 per cent of the cattle in this country froze\n and starved to death. Many outfits were utterly\n ruined and forced out of the business. Those that\n recovered adopted a new policy. They generally\n stopped breeding, and spent their time fattening\n Southern cattle for the market. Vast herds of\n yearlings were brought North from Texas every\n spring, left on the range for a summer and a win-\n ter, an d sold for beef after the spring round-up.\n</p>\n<p>\n Fattening beef for the market is now the prin-\n cipal work of the Montana and Wyoming ranches.\n That can be done nowhere so cheaply as here.\n The risk is small, the prouts large. Large amounts\n of new capital have come in since the dread\n winter, and what was lost has been more than\n redeemed. The cattlemen are not as careless of\n their property as they were, however. They put\n away a good deal of hay, enough to save their\n cattle from any such general destruction as be-\n fell them in \u201986. Another effect of that calamity\n was to give an impetus to horse aud sheep raising.\n The old-time Texans had done much to bring\n sheep-raising into contempt. Their adage was\n that no white man should herd sheep, and for\n several years they would not allow any sheep in\n the country. They would stampede their cattle\n through a herd of sheep with no more conscience\n than the Dakota small-boy exhibits chasing\n gophers. But the sheep outlived the Texans, and\n they are menacing the cattle business. Cattle\n can\u2019t graze where sheep have been before them.\n Nothing is left to graze on. The sheep-men have\n two sources of revenue\u2014 wool and mutton \u2014 to the\n cattle-men ' s one. Their herds require vastly more\n attention than the cattle ask, but theft - profits\n are larger. The cattle business is not increasing\n to-day, but the sheep business grows steadily.\n The wool market is never overstocked, or, if it\n is, the mutton market isn\u2019t. If worst should ever\n come to worst, the spring lamb market happily\n remains, and they tell me that no belter spring\n lamb was ever tasted than is furnished by twenty-\n vear-old rams fattened on the hogs\u2019 backs of the\n Yellowstone. These three stock-raising industries,\n horses, cattle and sheep, have built up Miles\n City, until it is now a large and strong munici-\n pality. Its principal population is furnished by\n Eastern and Southern Americans, but the China-\n man and the negro, the Mexican an I the half-\n breed, are all represented. It was formerly sup-\n posed that this arid region was incapable of sus-\n taining even cattle. That disproved, its utter\n uselessness as an agricultural country was urged\n against it. It is now impossible to present this\n indictment, and people are beginning to believe,\n what is the fact, that industry and common sense\n can do anything here that that they can do else-\n where. The country invites every kind of human\n occupation. There is room for all. All are\n needed, and all will surely pay. I have not heard\n of a single manuiactunng establislunent founded\n by practical men which has stopped its engine or\n its wheel a single working day since its doors\n were first thrown open. Almost everything the\n people are buying from abroad might just as well\n be made here. The East needs to remodel its\n ideas of this country. It is to-day a dead-in-\n earnest country. It is not so proud of its past\n as confident of its future. The grand old ro-\n mances ol the days when prospecting parties\n 1 ought Indians at every step they took, when\n heavy-bearded cowboys, covered wi.h buttons,\n fringe and six-shooters, made pie of tenderfeet,\n when miners gambled fortunes between nightfall\n and sunrise, and when whole communities were\n *\u2022 held up ' \u2019 by single-armed desperadoes\u2014 these are\n fast becoming legends and fairy tales.

Those who entertain such no-\n tions as this should make a trip out to the arid\n belt just to study the actual operation of inducted\n water, the processes by which it is distributed,\n its effect upon the soil and the results in crops\n taken from land which is naturally a sterile,\n barren desert. They would have their eyes\n opened and their minds improved. There are\n farmers\u2014 or ranchers, as farmers are called here-\n in Montana and Wyoming who would no more\n exchange the 640 acres which they have reclaimed\n by irrigation under the Desert Land law, and for\n which they have paid SI 25 per acre, for the\n best farm in New-England, than the owner of a\n Fifth-ave. house and lot would exchange his prop-\n erty for a Jersey marsh ! There are ranchers here\n who seriously declare that they would not farm\n anywhere, no matter what the rainfall might be,\n without digging a ditch and running the -water\n wherever they might have use for it. They prove\n their sincerity by showing you ears of corn eight\n and ten inches long, of which they have grown\n a hundred bushels to the aore. They show you\n oats weighing forty pounds to the bushel, which\n they have grown in quantities from seventy to\n eighty-five bushels to the acre. They show you\n wheat, not as yet of the first Dakota grade, but\n certainly excellent wheat, of which they take\n forty or forty-five bushels from every acre sown.\n They show you hay richer, longer and far better\n than is produced on any Eastern farm, and garden\n vegetables and small fruits that are not to be\n called second to any, no matter where they may\n be grown. They take you over farms thoroughly\n equipped with machinery, buildings and live stock,\n and they tell you that when they came West they\n had less than SI 00, and that all that is to be\n 6een is the product of that ranch, the unbroken\n fielcs of which, still as dry as chips, grow nothing\n but sage-bushes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Montana is a dry country only in the sense\n</p>\n<p>\n that the rainfall is uncertain and insufficient.\n There are flowing streams in plenty. The Yel-\n lowstone is a river of some magnitude, and it is\n led by a hundred little mountain creeks. _ It con-\n tains all the water necessary to irrigate the whole\n region it drains, and so long as moisture makes\n clouds and the mountain summits retain snow its\n flow will be steady. The valleys of the Yellow-\n stone supply themselves with water from tliat-\n river, ind the \u201c bottoms\u201d of each separate creek,\n so far as they have been settled, draw upon the\n flow nearest them. The ranchers of each par-\n ticular neighborhood usually act in concert\n in building the big ditch, the one\n that, flowing for twenty, thirty or even sixty\n miles, incloses all their ranches and draws enough\n from the river to irrigate the entire country it\n travels through. The ditch at Billings is thirty-\n seven miles long, six feet wide, and usually has a\n depth of at least a foot. Its carrying capacity is\n 10,000 inches of water, enough to irrigate an area\n of 25,000 acres. Each rancher digs his own sys-\n tem of ditches for his own place, with a main\n ditch leading from the big or general ditch\n through which his supply comes. He pays for\n the water by the square inch taken for the season,\n the price varying from SI to $2, and he estimates\n that a square inch of water will be needed for\n every acre of ground put in crops. His ditches\n lead to each field, and there he uses the water as\n his experience and judgment show to be best for\n the kind of crop he is raising. Fields of wheat*\n oats and other grasses are usually flooded. The\n ditches around them are dammed, and the water is\n allowed to overflow. For corn, vegetables and\n crops that grow in rows lateral ditches are em-\n ployed, running between the planted rows, and the\n water, sent gently along, is made to soak into the\n ground. If a farmer knows when his crops n \" ed\n water and how much they need, it certainly does\n seem as if this were the happiest possible soluti n of\n the moisture problem. If they get what they want,\n get it when they want it, and get all they want of\n it, what more could be desired ? It will not do to\n contend that the form in which the water is given\n them is not good, for you are answered by pump-\n kins as big as a dog-house, strawberries sweet and\n delicious, grain of every description and hay two\n feet high, and these constitute an answer that\n does all the answering one can grapple with. The\n water of all these streams comes from the moun-\n tains, and when it has reached the bottom level it\n has travelled far enough to become impregnated\n with a great deal of rich vegetable matter. Its\n service to the soil as a fertilizer is undoubted and\n important.\n</p>\n<p>\n Billings was a product of the sagacious fore-\n sight of Mr. Heman Clark, the aqueduct con-\n tractor. Mr. Clark built that portion of the\n Northern Pacific which runs along the Yellow-\n stone, and when his eyes fell upon this beautiful\n valley, inclosed by rocky, sandy cliffs that stand\n as straight and high above the plain as the High-\n lands stand above the waves of the Hudson, he\n thought he detected a great opportunity to swell\n his material resources. He formed a company\n through which he bought all the land in the valley\n that was included in the railroad grant. That was\n half the valley, every other block a mile square,\n or about 60,000 acres. He got it at the bottom\n price, lie selected a town-site, plotted it, got it\n approved by the railroad people, and advertised\n its lots for sale upon a given day. Mr. Clark\u2019s\n scheme was big\u2014 on paper. He made many prom-\n ises on behalf of the Northern Pacific and himself\n as to improvements that would surely be made,\n and when the auction sale of lots occurred he had\n a crowd of settlers and speculators camped in\n tents on the prairie all ready to buy his lots. The\n impression prevails that Mr. Clark got a great\n deal out of Billings, though what Billings got\n out of Mr. Clark is by no mow s so w\n tained.

It has become one of the\n foremost towns of Eastern Montana. Its valley\n lands have proved to be among the most fertile\n portions of the new State, and are rapidly being\n taken up by ranchmen, whose cultivated fields are\n stretching further and wider every year. At one\n time it was the centre of a great cattle country,\n and large herds still roam upon the range tribu-\n tary to Billings. But, as the range has become\n contracted by the influx of new settlers, the sheep\n industry has grown in importance, until it is to-\n day more profitable and larger than the cattle\n industry. As many as 1,400,000 pounds of wool\n were shipped from Billings in 1888, and the ship-\n ments for this year promise to reach nearly\n 2,000,000. The mutton market was supplied\n with 63,200 head of sheep, and the beef market\n with 8,160 head of cattle, though these figures\n by no means represent the full measure of the\n sheep and cattle business done in the country sur-\n rounding Billings. In forwarding their beef and\n mutton to market growers usually avoid the big\n towns. They ship lrom the nearest small station,\n where their cowboys and herders will be subjected\n to as few temptations as possible. A fairer idea\n of the business done by the 1,500 people who\n compose the population of this brisk little town\n will be obtained from the freight statistics of\n the railroad. These show a flow of trade of 101,-\n 000,000 pounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n Little has yet been done to ascertain the mineral\n resources of this region. Prospectors tell inter-\n esting stories of what they have seen in the Yel-\n lowstone Mountains, and in the country that ad-\n joins the big Crow Indian Reservation, south of\n the Yellowstone River, lead and silver ore, rather\n low in grade, but immense in quantity, has been\n found. Sixteen silver mines are in operation\n around Cooke City, and it is not to be doubted\n that the mineral deposit of that entire neighbor-\n hood will in time show large returns. The trouble\n in developing such interests is the lack of rail-\n road facilities. The ore cannot be disposed of\n quickly enough to make mining profitable. A\n road is now being constructed from Billings to the\n mo th of \u2022..lark ' s Fork, and thonre along the Fork\n to Cooke City, with a spur at Bear ' s Creek lead-\n ing to the Red Lodge coal fields. So soon as this\n enterprise is completed a country known to be\n full of good ore, in which mining claims in-\n numerable have been staked out, will be put in\n communication with the world. The coal fields\n around Red Lodge have been thoroughly investi-\n gated. They insure another abundant supply of\n good carbon coal, not comparable with the coal\n of Western Pennsylvania, but still of a sufficient\n quality to set people\u2019s minds easy about fuel.\n</p>\n<p>\n South of Billings, and extending for 120 miles\n along the Yellowstone, is the big Crow Indian\n Reservation, where 2,300 of the most objectionable\n Indians hold 5,500,000 acres of the best land in\n Montana. There are over 2,000 acres to every\n man, woman and child in the tribe, and scarcely\n 100 acres in crop throughout the length and\n breadth of the reservation. The Government is\n already moving in the right direction with regard\n to these redskins. They are being placed on lands\n of their own, and when this work is completed the\n untaken part of the reservation will be thrown\n open to settlers. This plan proceeds -very slowly,\n and the people are exceedingly restless. There\n are a host of white people making money out of\n the Indians, or, rather, out of the Government\n policy which supports them in utter idleness. The\n contractors who furnish Indian sunplies, the trad-\n ers, the cattle-men, who use the Indian lands for\n practically nothing as a range, and all such people,\n always exert their utmost influence to delay meas-\n ures looking to the red man\u2019s improvement.\n They don\u2019t want to see him estabk ' shed on a farm\n of his own, engaged in earning his own living.\n They prefer to continue to make money in Gov-\n</p>\n<p>\n ernment contracts. Nearly a third of the tribe\n has been placed, and considerable progress will be\n made with the rest this summer.\n</p>\n<p>\n A small part of the reservation was thrown\n open recently, and settlers went quickly upon it.\n Several filed on the odd-numbered sections within\n forty miles of the railroad. The Northern Pa-\n cific Company sought to have them ejected on the\n contention that their grant included every odd\n section through the whole reservation within the\n forty-mile limit. They claimed that the Gov-\n ernment had given the land to them in fee, hut\n subject to the Indian right of occupation, and\n that so soon as the Indians were removed the\n land was theirs to do with as they pleased. The\n Supreme Court had previously refused to permit\n the company to select from the additional two-\n mile strip\u2014 that is, the strip two miles in width\n beyond the forty-mile limit of their grant\u2014 cer-\n tain indemnity sections in place of other sections\n temporarily in u e by the Indians. The court\n held that the company had accepted their grant\n subject to the right of the Indians to hold such\n lands as were within their reservations so long as\n the reservations were closed, and that when they\n were opened the railroad could possess itself of its\n appropriate sections. This decision was cited to\n sustain the company\u2019s claim that settlers could not\n file on the odd-numbered sections in the Crow\n lands. The Land Commissioner decided for the\n company. He saw no escape in view of the\n earlier holdings of the Supreme Court. He is\n certainly right. The Supreme Court was right.\n But, all the same, there is trouble ahead. This\n ruling holds that every odd section in the Crow\n lands belongs to the railroad. But the Govern-\n ment has been alloting odd sections to the Indians\n right along. It can\u2019t give away the same land\n twice. It gave one fee to the railroad thirty years\n ago. It has given another to Indians in repeated\n instances during the last two years. It looks as\n if all that part of the allotment work would have\n to be done again L. E.

It is in\n the centre of the Crow country, forty miles south\n of the Yellowstone, directly upon the Big Horn\n River and within a few miles of the dreadiul spot\n where Custer and his devoted band of 300 met\n death, hhe 25th day of this month will be the\n th.rteenth anniversary of that horrible massacre,\n and it is said that a party of Sioux are coming\n over to celebrate what all Indians consider tne\n most glorious event of their history by a war\n dance on the plain below the hill where Custer\n fell. This should not be tolerated for an instant.\n Nothing was done to punish the Sioux for the\n atrocities of 1376, and their wild and warlike\n character to-day is due in a great degree to the\n immunity they secured then. It enabled Gall,\n Rain-In-The-Face, John Grass, and Sitting Bull to\n encourage the spirit of hostility, to argue that the\n white man was afraid of them, and to strut around\n in feathers and paint ever since. It is true, in-\n deed, that the fiendish tribe w ' hich committed this\n massacre, which scalped and cut to mincemeat\n and ate the entrails of Custer\u2019s command, have\n been treated with vastly more consideration than\n the peaceable Indians, and their chiefs very\n naturally make much of this. They say to\n their young men : \u201c Stay with us. See what\n</p>\n<p>\n we did for you. We whipped the Great Father\u2019s\n soldiers and forced him to give us lands and\n cattle and clothing and ponies and rations\n every week. If you go near the white men, they\n will send your children off to school, take away\n all but one of your wives, settle you on a farm\n and make you work like a mule. Shajl the In-\n dian work? Do you want to be squaws? Is\n the Sioux a cowardly Omaha or a Ponca dog?\n Let the Ponca work. Look at him. Look at the\n dirty Crow. They were friends with the white\n man. They dared not light the Great Father.\n Well, what now? They are on farms. They\n work. They w r ear coats. They have no such\n country as ours. If you would be a Ponca or a\n Crow, go with the white man.\u201d This is the way\n they talk all the time, and they keep their young\n braves savage and defiant.\n</p>\n<p>\n The older chiefs know perfectly well that a war\n now would mean the destruction of their nation.\n They only seek to maintain their position and to\n bully tlie white man into continuing to support\n them. The danger is, if they are allowed to go\n on as they have been going (and every tendency of\n the Government\u2019s policy to-day is to encourage\n them), that the young bucks will grow restive\n and demand a fight. They are already ugly.\n Some voung chief might spring up at any time,\n anxious to make a great reputation, and create\n a large-sized trouble. Such an incident actually\n occurred right here among these lazy Cro \" -s only\n two years ago, when Hangs-Up-ITis-Tail, claiming\n that he could make a medicine which would wipe\n the white man out of existence, collected a party\n of braves and brought on a fight with the Fort\n Custer troops. If he had not been killed at the\n first fire, or if his bucks had been S : oux instead\n of Crows a bloody war would probably have\n arisen. The Western people express no little an-\n noyance that, their position and their vi \" ws ar \" so\n little appreciated and respected in th\u00b0 East,. Tim\n various \u201cIndian Rights\u201d and \u201cIndian Defence\u201d\n associations of the East come in for a grem- deal\n of criticism. Tt is not- conceded that Western\n people are one whit less kindly disnes^d toward the\n red man nor one wh\u2019t less concerned fnr his wel-\n fare than those of Boston and Philadelphia, and\n</p>\n<p>\n it is argued that before people undertake to con-\n trol measures and policies so important to West-\n ern development and safety, they ought to know\n what they are about. There is only one sentiment\n in this country, and that demands the opening of\n ail reservations ; the establishment of the Indian\n on land of his own, giving him every facility for\n its cultivation; the destruction of tribes and the\n gradual enlistment of the red race in the common\n duties and affairs of citizenship. This is held\n to be easily possible, hut not while those who\n hate the Indian, those who love him and those\n who are growing rich by selling the Government\n the supplies that now support him, are all labor-\n ing to keep him a beggar and a barbarian.\n</p>\n<p>\n You reach Fort Custer by a stage which runs\n from Custer Station on the Northern Pacific to\n Rock Creek on the Union Pacific, a distance of\n 430 miles. This is one of the few important stage\n lines that have managed to survive the locomotive\u2019s\n raids. Its route takes in the mountainous district\n of Northern Wyoming, where there are several\n large towns to which the railroads have not yet\n penetrated. It runs through the Crow country,\n the richest agricultural region of all Montana.\n There are a dozen \u201c bottoms\u201d along the Big Horn\n and the Little Big Horn rivers of from 60,000\n to 100,000 acres in extent, rank with prairie veg-\n etation, where the grain of a nation might be\n grown, now all vacant and useless. Every one\n of them could be irrigated at an expense of less\n than 50 cents an acre. The stage drivers say that\n there are just such fertile bottoms along the Yel-\n lowstone and along all the mountain streams that\n course through the reservation in all directions.\n These drivers are odd Dicks. They are the old\n fellows who used to drive the Deadwood and\n Overland stages in the early days, and they keenly\n feel the humiliation of their present position.\n To he compelled after such a glorious past, after\n having driven six and eight, horse coaches through\n a land filled with gallant road agents, chivalrous\n horse-thieves and valiant Indians, after having\n been \u201c held up\u201d a dozen times, after having been\n through \u201c mnssacrees,\u201d lynchings. cowboy fights\n and all that,\u2014 now, in their old age, to come down\n to a miserable two-horse route through a settled\n country, is almost more than they can hear. They\n sit on their lofty seats gloomy and taciturn. They\n rarely smile or talk. You must, work hard if you\n hope to secure, their favor or engage them in con-\n versation. The only glimpse of sunlight they ever\n catch through the dun clouds that paper their\n sky is when a dude, an Englishman or a fussy old\n lady becomes their passenger. Then something\n like a smile touches up their darkly burned faces,\n and by the time such a passenger, or what, is left\n of him, lias reached his destination, they are\n almost cheerful. The stages have no springs.\n The cushions are stuffed with flint. The trail is\n st ony and crossed continually with sullies and deep\n buffalo trails. To one of these melancholy drivers,\n drawing his career to a disappointing close, noth-\n ing is so comforting as to shoot, a dudisli \u201c tender-\n foot\u201d through the stage window upon a jag of\n rocks below.\n</p>\n<p>\n Observing that my driver was in a pensive\n humor, I said nothing more to him than was\n recessary to procure permission to sit \u201c up there\u201d\n with him. We rode for twenty miles in dead\n silence, and at last when we neared the station\n at, which we were to obtain dinner and a change\n of horses, he turned to me and said : \u201c Pardner, I\n</p>\n<p>\n like you. When I first, see you I thort I didn\u2019t.\n But I do. You\u2019re the fust man that ever rid on\n the top o\u2019 my coach that didn\u2019t start fer to tell\n me that gol-derned story about \u2018Hank\u2019 Monk an\u2019\n Horace Greeley !\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The ice was broken, and we continued fast\n friends to the end of the ride. At, the station we\n took in an elderly lady with crossed eyes, a purple\n parasol and a passion for telling the price of every-\n thing she had on. We had proceeded a scant mile\n on our journey when she stuck her head out of the\n window and screamed to the driver not to go so\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0047/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0047/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 537, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 868}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0047/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1075, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1736}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0047/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3473}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0047/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0047.jp2", "height": 3473, "width": 2151, "levels": 6, "size": 701574}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"47\">\n<p>\n MONTANA,\n</p>\n<p>\n last, \u2019cause it slioolt the teeth \u201c right outen\u201d her\n mouth, \" and they cost ten shilling in Omaha.\u201d\n When the Indian agency was reached the old lady\n and her teeth were in a great state of perturbation.\n Several hundred teepees covered the plain, for the\n Indians had gathered from all over the reservation\n to receive their rations, and they were having a\n grand dance and powwow. The Crow is an ex-\n ceedingly dressy Indian. lie wears the gaudiest\n of blankets, the widest fringes, the highest feath-\n ers. He paints profusely, and in many cases he\n is dressed richly in bears\u2019 claws and elks\u2019 teeth.\n The teeth of the elk are Indian money. Twenty-\n five will buy a pony. In their wildest toggery,\n all blazing with color, with circlets of brass, ivory,\n claws and lava around their necks arms and\n ankles, beating their tom toms furiously, and\n moaning a monotonous song, the dancers vaulted,\n ran, leaped and jumped in a weird and crazy\n ecstacy. Groups of Indians were squatted on the\n ground in a circle around them, nodding their\n heads solemnly, and occasionally giving vent to a\n crooning sound or a fierce yell. The greater chiefs\n sat at a distance from the dance, surrounded by\n their squaws and a few chosen followers, maintain-\n ing their dignity. Here and there fires were burn-\n ing furiously, heating a lot of stones upon which\n the medicine bowls were placed. None dared ap-\n proach these sacred spots save only the medicine\n men, in whose supernatural powers the Indians\n still firmly believe. On our route through the\n reservation we passed a number of trees, willows\n and cottonwoods, from almost every twig of which\n bits of gaudy cloth and ribbon were hanging.\n These are the medicine trees from whose leaves\n the medicine men are supposed to derive their\n high attributes. Each of the bowls was filled\n with herbs and leaves, and over them the most\n absurd incantations were being performed.\n</p>\n<p>\n An incident which shows how thoroughly super-\n stitious the Indians are even yet was furnished\n by our old lady passenger and her ten-shilling\n teeth. Having concluded her supper, she was\n standing at the door of the agency building, wait-\n ing for the stage. A score of Indians, bucks and\n squaws, were grouped around staring at her. Sud-\n denly she made a distressing grimace and dropped\n her teeth into her hands. The Indians gave a few\n startled grunts and flew. They ran like antelopes\n to their camp, and presently a great crowd of them\n advanced cautiously toward the agency. Halting\n at a respectful distance from the old lady, they\n regarded her -with, looks of wonder and alarm.\n They told the driver as he came up to beware of\n her, as she had \u201c heap medicine.\u201d The Indian\n agents should be especially instructed from Wash-\n ington to do all in their power to correct this j\n \u201c medicine\u201d superstition. The medicine men and\n the bad whites are at the bottom of all Indian\n troubles. They are incessantly at work, the one\n inflaming, the other provoldng. Agents should\n have the amplest powers to suppress and punish\n both.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is not much excitement about Army life\n on Western posts. Desertions on the part of\n soldiers occur every day. They complain bitterly\n against being employed as laborers. The most\n considerable part of their duty is to take care of\n the post property, to serve the officers as valets,\n to clean the parade grounds, to build new quarters\n and to perform menial work. They claim that\n this is not what they enlist for. Senator Plumb\u2019s\n letter to the President, desiring the issuance of\n an amnesty proclamation in favor of deserters, is\n received by Army officers with some irritation.\n They say that Senator Plumb makes statements\n he cannot substantiate, a point probably well\n taken. His charge that the men are abused and\n not properly fed is certainly incorrect. _ On the\n contrary, they live well and are considerately\n treated. There is undoubted force in the claim,\n preferred by the men themselves, that they should\n not be called upon to perform acts of personal\n service to the officers and their families, though\n their other complaint against having to work as\n day laborers is open to discussion. To make de-\n</p>\n<p>\n 45\n</p>\n<p>\n sertion easier and less perilous than it is now\n can hardly be the way to prevent it, however.\n The men ought to be relieved of those features\n of their work which are degrading to them as\n soldiers, the teim of enhstment should be shortened\n from live years to three, and a plan should be\n devised by which discontented spirits could reim-\n burse the Government for whatever expense it\n has incurred oa their account, and thus purchase\n their release. Those conditions provided, deser-\n tions should be heavily and swiftly punished, and\n a good round price be set on every deserter\u2019s head.\n</p>\n<p>\n One great difficulty in enforcing disci pline in\n the Army, a difficulty that is especially felt on\n these Western posts, arises from the fact that the\n Articles of War, under which justice is admin-\n istered, are antiquated and inappropriate. They\n were formulated a century ago from the English\n articles and they need revision. They were made\n for the days when it was a great part of an of-\n ficer\u2019s duty to be a tyrant, and when public\n opinion had no control of him. It is his highest\n duty now to be a gentleman, and, while there are\n prigs and snobs in the Army, as everywhere else,\n they are not dangerous. It still remains the rule\n that no soldier can be punished for any act what-\n ever except by the verdict of a court-martial.\n This makes an immense amount of fuss and red\n tape over breaches of discipline which are utterly\n petty, and yet necessary to be corrected if the\n army is to be an army. There were 25,000 of-\n fences against the military laws last year, and\n every one had to be tried by a court-martial.\n This rule, seemingly in the men\u2019s interest, really\n tended against them, for thousands finally ad-\n judged innocent were subjected to long confine-\n ments, awaiting the action of the cumbersome\n machinery by which only they could be tried.\n Congress ought to arrange so that the command-\n ing officer at each post might have jurisdiction\n over trivial < . ff enccs. That is the rule everywhere\n except in our Army, and it appeals to common-\n sense. It would have a good effect upon the\n men. Its tendency would be to prevent many of\n those acts which render them so often a nuisance\n to the Western towns near which their p; sts lie.\n The Army will be needed in the West for mauy\n years, and, as the country becomes more and more\n thickly settled, its opportunities to annoy civilians\n will increase. There is a considerable friction\n now, and complaints against the soldiers are\n numerous. Since they can easily misbehave and\n escape the civil authorities, it should be made\n possible for their oflicers to keep them under con-\n trol.

In considering the cattle business\n and the present stage of its evolution, it is not\n possible to overlook the country within the boun-\n daries of which it is rapidly being confined. The\n relation of Northern Wyoming to Eastern Montana\n is, and ever must be, intimate, but it is particularly\n close to-day, when the range of the great herds\n is becoming contracted to the region watered by\n the Little Missouri, the Yellowstone and the\n streams that find their source in the Big Horn\n Mountains.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is conceded, even by the cattle men them-\n selves, that the day of the big herd is nearly over.\n The influx of settlers, thousands every year, has\n already contracted the range so seriously as to\n \u25a0cause much anxiety to the cattle \u201c outfite, lest\n the forage prove insufficient In South Dakota,\n where there are no great herds, one travels for\n hundreds of miles without seeing the first sug-\n gestion of a fence, even around the grain fields.\n But in this country the ranchmen sling barbed\n wire around their farms in order that the cattle\n may be kept upon the hills and unused land.\n Some part of the range will never be fit for agri-\n cultural purposes unless the rain belt moves this\n way, as many contend it is moving; but it will\n always grow buffalo grass and will always sup-\n port \" cattle. It by no means follows, because\n of the change the cattle business is undergoing,\n that the supply of beef is diminishing. On the\n contrary, more cattle are owned and bred and\n fattened in the West than ever before ; but they\n are coming to be owned in small bunches by the\n ranchmen, and fed on the property of their indi-\n vidual owners, not by great \u201c outfits,\u201d fattened\n on the range. Six years ago. during the \u201c round-\n up\u201d season, from two to ten thousand cattle were\n \u201c rounded up\u201d everyday. Now, 2,500 cattle make\n a large \u201c round-up,\u201d and the usual number brought\n in day by day is less than 1,200.\n</p>\n<p>\n Northern Wyoming, however, will ever remain\n a cattle country. The people will always find\n the preparation of beef for the Eastern market\n one of their principal sources of wealth. They\n have just the sort of territory upon which two-year\n old steers can obtain the choicest living, just the\n climate suited to their perfect development. From\n the Montana line south for 100 miles and across\n the length and breadth of the Territory there is\n one unbroken succession of hills. Nowhere in the\n United States is there a region so continuously\n magnificent. It seems as if Nature\u2019s wilder forces,\n after having played awhile on all the borders of\n Wyoming, after having engaged in frantic sport\n along the Little Missouri, after having run a mad\n chase up and down the Yellowstone, had here\n grown grandly passionate, and with more of\n motion and design than had before inspired them,\n it seems as if they had hurled themselves upon the\n resisting, but too feeble, earth and thrown it\n whither their fancy minded. Here and there they\n piled enormous mountain ranges, chiselling each\n particular peak so cleanly, but so fantastically,\n that it cuts its own startling figure against the\n sky. and shows in its formation an odder con-\n glomeration of figures than any human imagination\n can suggest. Between each of these great chains\n are thousands of acres of monster hills, with one,\n bigger than the rest, extending north and south\n on a line parallel with the course of the moun-\n tains. This is the \u201c divide,\u201d srparating the waters\n that rise in one chain of mountains from those\n that rise in the other. There are hundreds of\n these beautiful mountain streams, and they are\n the salvation of the land. Every winter leaves\n the mountains deeply under snow, which, indeed,\n never leaves the highest of the Big Horn peaks.\n A great deal of moisture, enough to insure a\n yearly growth of grass, is left by the snow upon\n the hills, so that they need but little rain in\n the summer time to render the forage rich and\n abundant. The streams flow swiftly with a fall\n of twenty feet to the mile, and with\n a never-failing supply; for whenever there\n are clouds in the heavens, they accumulate over\n</p>\n<p>\n the mountains and deposit new burdens of snow\n every day or two, winter and summer. The\n valleys capable of bearing crops are numerous but\n small, for the rivers and creeks wind around the\n hills in every direction, forming rich pastures\n wherever they make a turn.\n</p>\n<p>\n This northern country is as yet to be reached\n only by stages travelling south from the Northern\n Pacific and north from the Union Pacific. Within\n the last four years settlers have come in rapidly\n and are filling all the little valleys and producing\n large crops of grain. Thousands of valuable\n ranches are still to be acquired under the Desert\n Land Act, and, of course, with mountain streams\n running everywhere and falling twenty feet to\n the mile, every one of the valleys, and not a few\n of the hills, may be readily irrigated and re-\n deemed. Buffalo is a city of nearly 2,000 in-\n habitants. It is 1 60 miles from the railroad, and\n is said to be the largest town in America at such\n a distance from connections. Everything the\n people wear, every article that furnishes their\n houses, and much that they eat. must be dragged\n by mule and bull teams all the way from Custer.\n The stages, going night and day, occupy thirty-\n six hours in the trip. Freight trains, of three or\n four wagons, drawn by horses and mules, consume\n from seven to ten days, and those drawn by oxen\n are often a full month on the way. Sheridan,\n a town nearly as large as Buffalo, lies on their\n route. That a railroad along these valleys would\n be profitable is well understood, and a company\n has been organized to build it. Its stock is owned\n principally in New-York City, and. there is no\n doubt that those having the enterprise in hand\n intend to put it through. They have done some\n surveying, and they hint that their rails will be\n laid as far along the Big Horn River as Fort\n Custer before winter closes in upon them. They\n are waiting, I suppose, to have the people sub-\n sidize them. That is the necessary preliminary\n to almost all enterprises, public and private, that\n require a considerable capital. It has been al-\n ready worked to death. It. has become an in-\n tolerable nuisance. All these new towns are, of\n course, anxious to get hold of business institutions\n that promise to employ labor anil become per-\n manent sources of wealth. Fully alive to this,\n when a man concludes to start something, no\n matter what, a brewery, a canning factory, an\n electric lighting plant, or anything else, he goes\n around among the various towns within the region\n where he contemplates settling, and asks the\n townspeople what bonus they will g-ive him if he\n stops with them. They don\u2019t have to give him\n anything if they don\u2019t want to. but they know\n perfectly well that some other town wilL if they\n refuse, and the other town will secure a new\n industry. So, as the thing works, each town\n makes its bid, then there is more or less raising,\n and finally the enterprise goes to the place which\n pays the most to get it. The man who haggles\n shrewdly can often secure as much as 25 per cent\n of the cost of his plant.\n</p>\n<p>\n Northern Wyoming has been only superficially\n surveyed. Until within ten years practically\n nothing was known of it. Since then prospectors\n and surveyors have given some little attention\n to its rivers and hills, and they have discovered\n enough to convince those who understand natural\n signs and marks that its mineral wealth is\n enormous. For fifty miles on either side of\n Powder River the soil covers a bed of coal that\n ages can scarcely make an impression upon. It\n has been carefully investigated at various points\n and a mine is in operation here. The coal is\n hard and firm, of the so-called lignite variety, but\n superior in quality to that found in Northwestern\n Dakota. Iron, copper, silver and gold have been\n found in the Big Horn Mountains and along the\n Continental Divide. Directly across the State,\n running northeast and southwest, an oil belt has\n been discovered which yields petroleum almost\n as surely and plentifully ' as the Jim River Valley\n of Dakota yields water. In a score of places\n large areas are found where the oil comes un-\n failingly. What can be shown when first-class\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0049/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0049/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 537, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 868}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0049/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1075, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1736}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0049/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3473}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0049/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0049.jp2", "height": 3473, "width": 2151, "levels": 6, "size": 606472}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"49\">\n<p>\n MONTANA.\n</p>\n<p>\n 47\n</p>\n<p>\n machinery is put at work in these mountains can\n only be surmised now.

If\n anything can be said to be peculiar to the country\n in which it occurs, the round-up is that sort of\n thing. If you have never seen it. you have never\n seen anything like it. There is nothing with which\n I can compare a spectacle made up of a great herd\n of cattle, dazed and bewildered, massed together\n in one big bunch, bellowing and moaning, beseech-\n ing and defying, incessantly moving, but nerer\n progressing; of smaller herds, cut out from among\n the great one, tranquilly grazing, as if they under-\n stood that they were now, at least, to have rest, a\n dream too soon dispelled; of herds of horses,\n white, black, spotted, kind, surly, vicious, hand-\n some and mean, corralled here, at liberty there\n and bunched yonder; of men mounted on flyers\n dashing in among the cattle and chasing this\n one in tLat direction and that one in this, or\n tearing at a bieakneclc speed over the prairie after\n a st raj ' steer or heifer, hooting and howling, and\n suddenly lurching forward while a rope cuts the\n air and the runaway falls captive to the ground ;\n of a horseman, quicker and surer than the others,\n darting this way and that, and fetching to the\n camp-fire, near by, a poor little calf caught by its\n neck or its leg and dragged over the ground at\n the end of the lasso, while its mother, sometimes\n forlorn, sometimes bewildered, but always crying\n piteously, follows in helpless misery; of a group\n of men, armed with knives and branding-irons,\n who snatch the poor little creature, toss it heavily,\n but not always without a bard struggle, to the\n ground, cut it with one quick stroke of the\n knife, and press upon its skin the heated iron.\n These are a few of the many curious features of\n a scene which, for animation and picturesque-\n ness, probablj r lias no parallel. It begins with\n the first pencil of the morning sun that appears\n over the mountain. It ends when the last pencil\n is withdrawn and the dark envelope of night is\n sealed.\n</p>\n<p>\n The cow-punchers\u2014 you call them cowboys in\n the East, but that is an expression long since\n abandoned here \u2014 are a fine and vigorous lot of\n young fellows. Some are educated men, bachelors\n of arts, who have been attracted hither by a spirit\n</p>\n<p>\n of adventure, a liking for the open air, or a\n desire to occupy themselves better than by lolling\n around home. Some are men with a record and\n a variety of names, who did something somewhere\n that rendered their then surroundings disagreeably\n warm for them. They say their name is Smith, or\n Jones, or Biown, and Smith, or Jones, or Brown, is\n the name you want to be particularly careful to\n call them by. If you should happen to have come\n from their former neighborhood, and should fancy\n their name was Robinson, or Thompson, or\n Wiggins, and should call them so, they wouldn\u2019t\n like it. Smaller incidents than that have brought\n about grave misunderstandings. Some are dare-\n devils, who wouldn\u2019t do any particular harm to\n themselves or anybody else, but who like to be\n just on the edge of peril. And some are the same\n old humdrum, commonplace fellows you see every-\n where, who are \u201c punching\u201d cows largely because\n they are not doing something else. They are\n I all young, all full of strength and resolution,\n all ready to fight if you are really anxious for a\n fight, all hearty, generous and brave. Cow-\n punching is no business for a sneak, or a coward\n or a stingy soul. Those kinds are not attracted\n to it. No man can live and do in the open air,\n with a wilderness for his workshop, the stars for\n his coverlet, the wild flowers for his pillow, and\n be a dastard. But if exceptions occur to prove\n the rule, something always happens to them.\n They leave, or get lost, or\u2014 something. What?\n Oh, don\u2019t ask questions!\n</p>\n<p>\n I have already said many a time that the\n reign of disorder is over in the West, and I want\n to impress that fact on everybody\u2019s mind. But\n still, the man who keeps his pistol on the half-\n cock can always find as big a gun as his just\n as much disposed to go off. The tiger is under\n cover. But if you want to stroke him, you can\n easily get the cover removed. There is a host of\n men in these parts who are leading quiet, respect-\n able lives who did not use to be so respectable\n and quiet. They came to the West when it was\n the fashion to shoot a man if you didn ' t like the\n cut of his coat or thought his grammar too good.\n Being at Rome they did as the Romans did. But\n as custom changed they have considerably changed\n with it. Their blood still runs briskly^, however,\n and you don\u2019t want to swear at them unnecessarily.\n Though they rarely talk about it, they are quite\n proud of their earlier career, and like to have\n it understood that once upon a time they were\n ba-ad men. One day last week a big, rough-\n looking fellow entered a Pullman car and began\n to smoke and sing vulgar songs. The colored\n porter begged him to desist, but he shouted back\n that he would smoke where he pleased and sing\n what he pleased, and no blamed nigger could\n stop him. An elderly gentleman sitting near\n called the porter aside and asked him if he knew\n the express agent in the forward car.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Yes. *ah,\u201d answered the porter, \u201c I dous, sah;\n name o\u2019 Marshall, sah.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Well, you give him this card, and tell him\n to come here immediately.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The porter went off, and presently a robust,\n heavy, thick-set fellow entered, glanced about\n the car, perceived the elderly man, and came\n forward.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0050/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0050/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0050/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0050/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0050/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0050.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 706763}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"50\">\n<p>\n 48\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTH WES ' ] ' .\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Do you remember me ?\u201d said the elderly man.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c I guess so,\u201d was the rather hesitating asswer.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Aren\u2019t you sure ?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Yes.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Do you see that fellow yonder, yelling and\n smoking ?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Yes.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Can you get, away wi th him ?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c I ain\u2019t fearful to try.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Put him in the smoking car.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The robust fellow promptly went over to where\n the rough was sitting, and said : \u201c Pardner, you\u2019ve\n got to get out of here.

Take care of yourself: that\u2019s all.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Marshall retired. Another traveller, speaking\n to the elderly man, observed that the express\n agent, looked like a good fighter.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Good ? I should say so. I knew him in the\n Black Hills, years ago, when I was sheriff there.\n He was punching cows. He has killed his man\n several times. Didu\u2019t it tickle him when I told\n him he hadn\u2019t lost his nerve ?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Nerve is one of the first qualities in the cowboy\n composition. It takes nerve to ride a horse as\n they ride. A trained cow-pony adapts his move-\n ments to those of the beast he is chasing. When\n the steer stops, he stops. And he stops so sud-\n denly that his rider is in great danger of going on.\n When the steer turns, turns. He does whatever\n the steer does until he sees the rope encircling\n the neck or the ankle of tlm fugitive beast, and\n then he plants his hoofs in the ground and holds\n fast. Many a brave rider has lost his life in\n this exciting chase, for a Texan steer can do\n a variety of unpleasant, things with those long,\n curved horns of his, things that only a bold\n hand and a quick mind ca\u2018n escape.\n</p>\n<p>\n The round-up is a moving tournament. It pro-\n ceeds, day by day, through the country, collecting\n the cattle from mountain and gulch, from canon\n and valley, from plain and plateau into a given\n retreat. The cattle country is divided into dis-\n tricts, and the round-up goes on simultaneously\n in each district. Each of the cattle establishments,\n or \u201c outfits,\u201d has a representative at the round-up\n to look after its interests, to see that its calves\n are properly branded, and to sort out its fat\n steers for the market. The cowboys start upon\n their hunt at about 3 o\u2019clock in the morning,\n parcelling among themselves the country to be\n searched, and by 9 or 10 o\u2019clock they have com-\n pleted their travels, and have come together\n in the spot appointed for the round-up, driving\n before them all the cattle they have found. The\n percentage that escapes them is very small. Their\n eyes are trained to sweep mountains and explore\n gulches. They lmow just where the cattle go.\n When all have come in and the cattle are bunched,\n the \u201c cutting out\u201d begins. Riders go into the\n herd and chva.se out, the cows and calves belonging\n to their outfit. These are herded in small groups\n here and there on the prairie, closely guarded\n by cowboys. When none but, steers remain in\n the big bunch, those ready to be sold for beef\n are cut, out, and the rest, turned loose into the\n hills again. Then the branding process is begun\n upon the calves, and that accomplished, tlm\n round-up is over. The same routine is repeated\n until the entire range has be^u thoroughlv searehed\n and each outfit has dealt with its cattle according\n to i+s owm plans and purposes.\n</p>\n<p>\n It. must be said for the cattle men that they\n</p>\n<p>\n use a country well. They have brought much\n wealth into Montana and Wyoming, and it seems\n hard to see them slowly driven from the land\n they have made great and prosperous. But every\n day contracts their domain, and if the business\n is to be continued at all there must soon be a\n complete pooling of interests on the part oi the\n principal outfits. In no other way can they profit-\n ably avail themselves even of the comparatively\n limited range they have left.\n</p>\n<p>\n We shall soon have another new State in Wy-\n oming. The people now number 75,000, and they\n think their chance lies with a Republican Admin-\n istration. The President has acted with great\n wisdom in the appointments he has made. Gov-\n ernor Warren is an old resident, a man of high\n character, some wealth and great popularity. He\n is talcing hold of the Statehood movement with\n vigor, and as he knows the country thoroughly, he\n is sure to make progress in that ambition. There\n are 62,500,000 acres in the Territory.

So long as the Mills bill\n hung over them, like a cloud on the mountains,\n they drew in their investments and prepared, in\n the event of Cleveland\u2019s re-election, to quit busi-\n ness.

Wages\n are remarkably high. This is due to two cir-\n cumstances particularly. Originally it was due\n solely to the fact that the country was new.\n Living was expensive. Ordinary table board\u2014\n the most ordinary indeed\u2014 could not be had for\n less than \u00a712 a week. Everything else was\n proportionately extravagant in price. Laboring\n men had to be brought from comfortable homes\n in the East, where their children were ottered\n school advantages, to endure the privations and\n the heavy expenses of the wilderness, and men\n who wanted them had to make it worth their\n while to come. But this is a situation common\n to all new countries, and usually it does not\n continue after the locomotive\u2019s approach. In\n Montana, however, wages are nearly as high \u00abts\n they ever were, while the cost of living has fallen\n almost to the Eastern level. The reasons are\n these : There is no distinct body of laborers here,\n in the first place, upon which employers can draw\n as they find occasion, and, in the second, the\n miners set the standard of wages, and are able\n by their numerical strength to control the situa-\n tion. They are well organized, and being in a\n land where everybody is doing reasonably well,\n and where their employers are generally rich, they\n have the sympathy of the people m their demands.\n They receive $3 50 a day, and will not work for\n less. Nobody wants to see them work for less,\n except possibly those who employ them, and\n popular sentiment avows that men who are\n making millions by hiring other men to dig\n a hole in the ground ought to be willing to pay\n well for the digging. The reprehensible methods\n which are frequently employed by the Miners\u2019\n Union to enforce their demand that no one shall\n work for less than S3 50 are therefore regarded\n with a tolerant spirit. I was visiting a mine\n the other day where $3 25 was being paid, and\n while the superintendent was showing me around\n he was summoned to appear above ground by a\n crowd of nearly 100 men. They do not use the\n walking delegate and the grand master workman\n out here. The men do their own bossing and run\n their own machine. They informed the superin-\n tendent that they knew he was paying his men\n less money than was allowable under the rules\n of the camp. He tried to parley, but they said\n he might as well \u201c break to them,\u201d by which they\n meant confess and atone. He finally said he took\n his orders from the company, which was unwilling\n to pay more than $3 25, but the men were free\n agents, and didn\u2019t have to work for that if they\n didn\u2019t want to. How free the agents were was\n presently made manifest. They were all called |\n</p>\n<p>\n above ground and were told that the camp would\n not allow them to work for less than the regular\n rate. The men yielded and abandoned their job\n promptly, ' they had no particular objection to\n receive the higher rate. They knew the company\n would be compelled to re-engage them at the\n higher rate, and they knew that a summary cow-\n hiding and persecutions innumerable thereafter\n would be the inevitable consequence of their\n opposing the union.\n</p>\n<p>\n The moral effect of these conditions is to keep\n up all lands of wages. The lowest rate paid\n for day labor is \u00a72 25. As much as $3 is paid\n to intelligent workmen, while skilled mechanics,\n men who have learned a trade and are competent\n receive from \u00a74 50 to \u00a710 per day. It seems odd\n under these circumstances that there should bo\n so few artisans among the permanent population.\n If a man wants to start a mill or other manu-\n factory he has to run off to Chicago or New-York\n to get his men. A surplus of labor is easily\n created, and I would not give the impression that\n every dissatisfied workingman in the East can\n come out here and straightway grow rich, but,\n on the other hand, there are unquestionably ex-\n cellent opportunities in Montana for skilled labor-\n ers, and the demand as yet is far Irom satisfied.\n The best plan for persons to pursue who think of\n migrating hitherward, but are unable to come out\n and look around for themselves, is to write to\n the mayor or the postmaster of such towns as\n their fancy favors, stating their situation, what\n they have and what they want. They may feel\n sure of a sympathetic reply.\n</p>\n<p>\n Perhaps the demand for domestic servants is as\n generally unsatisfied in the Northwest as any\n other. I have yet to visit the happy, happy land\n where the servant-girl problem does not exist as\n the principal source of domestic gloom, but here\n it is certainly to be found at its worst. It is\n utterly impossible to keep a girl.\u201d The female\n half of the population, while large and growing,\n is still in a considerable measure the smaller half,\n and young women of every degree arc quoted\n at far more than they would fetch east of tho\n Alleghanies. This remark may not be gallant,\n and yet it ought to be valuable to such young\n women in the East as feel themselves un-\n appreciated. The cases are counted in hundreds\n where a girl has entered a family as a cook or\n chambermaid and has thereafter remained as a\u00bb\n daughter-in-law. It is highly unprofitable to\n fetch girls from Eastern cities. If they are worth\n their salt they go off and get married often beforo\n they have earned the price of their railway fare.\n Servants\u2019 wages are 100 per cent higher in Mon-\n tana than in New-York. The cooks on the rail-\n way dining cars receive \u00a760 a month. In private\n families $30 is the lowest wages offered, and\n some are paid as much as $100. The girl experi-\n ment is so generally unsatisfactory that many\n families employ negro men and Chinamen. Tho\n way to get a Chinaman is to tell another China-\n man you want one. He will spare you all the\n trouble and expense of dealing with an employ-\n ment agency. An officer at Fort Custer who had\n imported girl after girl only to have them come\n to him within a month or two and simper out\n that they were going to get married, was at last\n advised by a friend to procure a Mongolian.\n \u201c I have one,\u201d said the friend, \u201c and he is a perfect\n jewel. If you like, I\u2019ll tell him to find one for\n you.\u201d The officer gladly consented, and in tho\n course of a day or two, when his wife went to\n the kitchen to prepare dinner, she found a China-\n man, cue-ed and white-vested, already at work\n among the pots and pans. She cheerfully retired\n in his favor. About a week later, when the officer\n and his wife sat down to dinner, they observed\n that the heathen in attendance upon them was\n not the heathen who had been serving them for\n the past week, but an entirely new and different\n one. They also observed that the dinner before\n them was much superior to the dinners their late\n heathen had supplied. They presently inquired\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0052/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0052/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0052/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0052/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0052/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0052.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 744582}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"52\">\n<p>\n 50\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n of their new heathen what had become of their\n old one.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c He no good,\u201d answered John. \u201c He some\n washee, but he no cookee.

The town was started, indeed, to facili-\n tate the journeyings of tourists. But it soon\n came to have a higher purpose than that. The\n country about Livingston is not a firsLclass\n farming country. There are a number of \u201c bot-\n toms\u201d along the Yellowstone and Shields Rivers\n where ranchmen are growing substantial crop-,\n but, for the most part, the land is too grand and\n imposing to submit to ploughs and harrows.\n When one gets within seventy-five miles of the\n Parle, no matter from what side or angle his ap-\n proach is made, he begins to see sights. The\n mountains grow higher, haughtier, bolder. They\n throw their noble heads aloft -with a distinctly\n aristocratic manner, as if they belonged to a family\n of natural wonders which held itself in much\n esteem. The rivers flow with a quicker motion,\n and the waters that grow so muddy and dis-\n reputable as they near the Missouri are here all\n bright and pellucid, and they sparkle gayly as\n they spin and whirl and dash and jump along.\n The rocks, too, have a rugged aspect. They\n lift themselves in gigantic columns directly up-\n wards from the plain. They form grottoes and\n parks, fortresses and cathedrals.\n</p>\n<p>\n Farming is thus rendered neither easy nor\n profitable, but within the last six years, pros-\n pectors and miners have found what promises to\n make Livingston one of the largest, wealthiest\n and busiest towns in Montana. If its founders\n had foreseen its destiny they could not have\n laced it more fortunately. It stands on a\n eautifully sloping plain. Mountains rise north\n of it. Mountains rise south of it. Mountains\n rise east and west, l ' ou see their snow-crowneif\n heights whichever way you look. They seem to\n be just a step or two away, just the proper dis-\n tance for a little walk before breakfast, but in\n this country you mustn\u2019t measure distance or\n define shape by your eyes. Nothing is really as\n it looks to be. If it seems near, make sure it is\n far. If it seems far. calculate that it, is farther\n still. If it seems level, look out for heights and\n depths, coteaux and coulees. If it seems round,\n conclude it is an octagon. They tell of an Eng-\n lish tourist who, with his guide, came upon a\n little irrigating ditch. He sat down, pulled off his\n shoes and 6tocldngs and began to roll up his\n trousers. To the astonished guide\u2019s inquiry what\n he was doing, the Englishman replied he was\n malting ready to wade the river. The guide as-\n sured him he could jump it. \u201c Aw, yes said the\n cautious tourist, contemplating the ditch with the\n air of a man whom experience had made wise,\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c it looks so, but the blawsted thing may be three\n miles wide for all I Imowl\u201d This is not such an\n exaggerated illustration of the fact that your\n eyes are not to be depended on as one might\n think.\n</p>\n<p>\n Through a canon, just south of Livingston, the\n Yellowstone springs from its mountain buttress.\n</p>\n<p>\n It has been running north from the glittering lake\n that supplies its rare and curious waters, waters\n that makes agates of dull stones and adamant of\n wood. Now it heads to the east and rushes on,\n eager and impetuous, through a valley that fur-\n nishes the finest examples of natural terraces to\n be found in any continent. At first, the rivpr,\n locked by mountain walls, with little room for\n action, has simply cut deep channels, but once\n unrestrained it has spread over miles of prairie\n which, as the ages drew along, it formed into\n bench after bench, leaving on them all. but more\n especially on the highest ones, rich deposits of\n</p>\n<p>\n fossil-bearing rocks. Between Glendive and Miles\n City the hills and buttes for twenty miles on\n either side the river are filled with fossilifsrous\n stones. Leaf impressions, fish impressions, and all\n the ancient forms of shell fish are found in profu-\n sion. The fossils retain their painty rainbow hues\n and show their cellular construction as perfectly as\n they did when they swam about in the Yellow-\n stone a million years ago, the Yellowstone that\n then stretched across the country from five to\n twenty miles.\n</p>\n<p>\n If any faith is to be put in signs, Livingston,\n thus picturesquely placed, will soon be one of the\n greatest ore markets in the woild, and a centre\n for the most extensive smelting and reduction\n operations. About 100 miles southeast of the\n city is a chain of hills 8,000 feet in e.evation, a\n spur of the Rockies, where mineral wealth of\n startling proportions has been found. The min-\n ing camp is called Cooke City, and as many as\n 2,000 claims have been staked out within an area\n of fifteen miles. The promoters of mining com-\n panies are not always the most trustworthy sort of\n people, and yet the evidence is abundant and\n reasonably credible that this camp is full of gold,\n silver, lead and iron, and many disinterested per-\n sons believe it destined to become a greater camp\n than Butte. Why not? Nothing that can be\n claimed for the mountains of Montana is unbe-\n lievable after one examines the record of what\n has been achieved in them. The mineral\n product of last year amounted to 342.000,000\n It has increased steadily year by year\n</p>\n<p>\n since gold was first found at Virginia City. Thou-\n sands of claims well known to be rich are lying\n idle to-day only because they are too far from the\n railroads to be profitably worked. That is the\n trouble with Cooke City. Its mines were discov-\n ered fifteen years ago, but their development has\n occurred only within the last eight months, and\n the only thing that can now be done is to pile up\n the ore and wait for the railroad. I examined\n some thirty or forty assays, made by the United\n States assayers, of specimen tons of ore irom these\n mines, and they ran in value all the way from\n 335 to S600. One sample contained S448. 80 in\n silver, 3192 in gold and 321 56 in lead. The poorest\n sample from that mine was worth $329. The mines\n are so situated physically as to be exceedingly diffi-\n cult of approach. The chief engineer of the\n Northern Pacific is now making a personal exam-\n ination of three routes, but ho has small hop\u2019s of\n being able to surmount the difficulties that lie in\n the way of railroad construction over two of them.\n The other one. which is undoubtedly feasible/ lies\n along the east fork of the Yellowstone, but ' it\n passes tlnough the northern limit of the Yellow stone\n Park. An effort was made last year, and wifi be\n renewed this winter, to induce Congress to render\n the development of these mines possible bv making\n the Yellowstone and Soda Butte Creek the north-\n ern boundaries of the Park. This would cut from\n the Park a strip six miles wide, said to contain no\n geological or topographical formations of interest.\n How far these representations are accurate. I do\n not know, but the matter is now being investi-\n gated by a Government surveying party.\n</p>\n<p>\n The mountains around Livingston are full of\n coal. An immense field of bituminous coal at Red\n Lodge is reached hy a branch line of the Northern\n Pacific, and is being profitably operated on a large\n scale. Near Cinnabar a coal has been found which\n cokes readily, and similar mines are now in opera-\n tion a few miles west of this city. The output\n here already reaches 200 tons a day. The discov-\n ery of this coking coal has been of incalculable\n value to Montana. The smelters at Helena and\n Butte, which formerly had to bring their coke all\n the way from Pennsylvania, are now supplied from\n this city. They use the Livingston coke entirely.\n The railroad uses the coal, so that every ton mined\n has an immediate market.

Y EXPLORERS\u2014 THE THREE\n FORKS OF THE MISSOURI\u2014 A PROBLEM\n FOR THE GOVERNMENT.\n</p>\n<p>\n Bozeman, Montana, June 24.\n</p>\n<p>\n When Lewis and Clarke, the great Missouri\n River explorers, whom President Jefferson in 1803\n sent out to examine his new Louisiana purchase,\n had followed the Missouri from St. Louis to\n a point about thirty miles northwest of this city,\n they found themselves confronted by a diffi-\n cult problem. The main river spread in three\n different directions, forming three forks equal in\n width, in depth, in force of current, and in flow\n of water. Which was the real Missouri they were\n wholly unable to say, though many days were\n spent in tracing each fork and no effort spared to\n reach a sound conclusion. It was plain that all\n three were pure mountain streams, deriving their\n waters from the snows and springs of the Rockies.\n They flowed swiftly over shallow, pebbly bottoms\n through a valley country of surprising beauty and\n fertility. To the west of the westernmost fork\n rose the mighty peaks of the main Rocky range.\n To the east of the easternmost fork rose a collat-\n eral chain crowned with snows that have never\n disappeared. And between each fork ran other\n hills, lower than the bounding ones, but formid-\n able still, giving to each its separate valley and its\n separate mountain sources. The explorers could\n see but one possible way out of their difficulty.\n They decided that amy of these forks was as\n much entitled as the others to be called the Mis-\n souri, and that they were equally the source of\n that splendid river. So they named the west fork\n after the President, the middle one after the Secre-\n tary of State, Mr. Madison, and the east fork after\n the Secretary of the Treasury, Mr. Gallatin.\n</p>\n<p>\n As usual, the exploiters were correct in their\n judgment. It is remarkable how sagacious and\n accurate were the conclusions of these men who\n first gave actual form to the map of the North-\n west. They travelled through 5,000 miles of\n territory known, so far as the white race was con-\n cerned, to scarcely more than a dozen traders and\n hunters. They endured indescribable hardships,\n but they never lost heart or purpose. Their de-\n scription of the country is almost as clear and\n correct as if it had been written in the light of all\n that is known to-day, and scarcely any essential\n correction has needed to be made in the chart they\n \u2022drew.\n</p>\n<p>\n In many respects the little area drained by the\n three forks has proved the richest and most valua-\n</p>\n<p>\n ble portion of the entire region that came under\n their observation. It contains the gulch from\n which the first teaspoomful of golden particles\n ever found in Montana was washed, and the far\n more famous gulch that added sixty millions in\n six years to the world\u2019s currency. It contains\n other mineral lands that have been and are yet\n of vast importance to the country, supplying im-\n mense quantities of silver, iron, lead and copper.\n Its eastern section along the Gallatin River, from\n which I now write, has been quite fitly styled the\n granary of Montana. The Gallatin Valley is\n thirty-five miles long and twelve wide, and is\n devoted to agriculture more generally and with\n more system than any other valley in the Terri-\n tory Being close by the great mining camps, to\n which everything that was eaten had to be sup-\n plied, it was afforded a sure market for all it\n could produce, and farmers undertook to redeem\n the land at an early period. Their success was\n phenomenal from the start. It has been phenom-\n enal ever since. The Gallatin itself and all its\n tributary creeks and branches came scampering\n down the mountains with such force that the task\n of irrigating the valley was reduced to simple pro-\n portions. It was necessary only to run a plough\n furrow from the river across the bench-lands into\n the valley anywhere you chose, and the water\n would get there as soon as the plough. There is\n claimed to tie a difference in the soil here from\n that, along the Yellowstone, the Missoula or the\n Milk rivers, and certainly more closely than the\n soil elsewhere it resembles the black loam\n of the Dakotas. But it has been suffi-\n ciently proved that the valley lands any-\n where in Montana are susceptible of satisfaetory\n cultivation, if only they can be irrigated. There\n is no physical difficulty that cannot be easily over-\n come. The whok State is cut up into valleys,\n each distinct, each with its own streams. But\n to get water from these streams wherever farming\n could be profitably employed would require so\n extensive an artificial waterway that no private\n firm or corporation could possibly within the\n present generation construct it. It is generally\n estimated that two-fifths of the surface of Mon-\n tana is agricultural land, but scarcely one-\n twentieth can be handled to any profit by such a\n diversion of mountain creeks as the ordinary\n rancher can himself undertake, and even if he\n were able to turn the w ater wherever he wanted\n it, the flow is insufficient during the irrigating\n season, which continues only about ninety days\n during the year, to supply any considerable part\n of the country. The water begins to flow about\n March 1, and! it runs till late in December, but\n from May till August, while irrigation is needed,\n not more than a tenth of the annual supply is\n flowing.\n</p>\n<p>\n The difficulties in the way of general irriga-\n tion, then, are these : First, the water cannot be\n got by ordinary methods and contrivances, such\n as farmers of limited means can apply, upon at\n least nine-tenths of the good land ; and, second,\n even if it could be got there, the flow during the\n irrigating season is insufficient to supply the\n requisite moisture. And yet there are means by\n which the water could be got there and means\n by which the flow could be made adequate. What\n is needed is a general system of canals and\n reservoirs. The agricultural possibilities of the\n lands I have seen can scarcely be comprehended,\n much less reduced to figures, if only such a\n judicious system of storage to hold in reserve the\n full annual flow and of canals to pour it through\n during the irrigating season were in operation.\n</p>\n<p>\n Local funds have been to a considerable ex-\n tent employed in the construction of such canals.\n I told you of one that encircles the Yellow ' stone\n Valley at Billings. Another is being completed\n here, and will be in use next year. But the\n undertaking when applied to the entire territory\n is so huge and costly that even if there were\n people with sufficient courage and capital to put\n it through, its completion would necessarily be\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0054/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0054/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0054/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0054/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0054/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0054.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 700449}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"54\">\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n at a period too remote for us and ours to feel\n much interest in it. If the development of this\n country is to continue as it has recently been\n going on, and as its resources demand, the inter-\n vention of some greater and stronger agency must\n be afforded.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Montana people urge that the general Gov-\n ernment should do this work in its own interest.\n Under the Enabling Act, by which this Territory\n is converted into a State, the Government cedes\n to State control only that part of its domain\n which has been taken by settlers. The untaken\n portion still belongs to the United States, and is\n still subject to the rule of the Land Office at\n Washington. But, say the Montana people, no-\n body will buy it as things are. Nobody wants\n land he can\u2019t use. It is all a desert till you can\n get water on it. Put the water there, and it will\n sell as fast as the Land Office can issue patents.\n Moreover, the Government can easily repay itself\n for the investment. It could add to the purchase\n price of each piece of land thus reclaimed its ap-\n propriate share of the general expenditure.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are many arguments in support of this\n proposition. Congress is now endeavoring to get\n at the facts in the case. A committee of the\n Senate is now journeying through the desert\n belt, listening to wliat people have to say on the\n subject, examining the whole territory that would\n be involved in the scheme, studying the practical\n results obtained thus far from irrigation, and en-\n deavoring to get at the probable cost of the\n enterprise. A survey is now being conducted in\n Montana by competent engineers employed by\n the Government, which is intended to furnish\n the same sort of information. As to the general\n</p>\n<p>\n S osition that lands utterly worthless have been\n e of the highest value, I have seen\n and reported convincing proofs, and these lands\n are said by trustworthy people to be really in-\n ferior to much of the soil that\n</p>\n<p>\n cannot now be reached by water. E or\n</p>\n<p>\n instance, it is claimed that the \u201c first bottoms\n that is, the lands directly bordering on the\n streams, though usually, are not always the most\n fertile. The vast plateaus that stretch away\n from the rivers are claimed to be of the highest\n productive quality and far less liable to frost in\n the early fall. Experience has shown that the\n irrigated district will produce far richer and\n more abundant crops than the soil of any of the\n States where rainfall is depended on for moisture.\n Upon one-eightli of this valley \u2014 30.000 acres \u2014 the\n yield of grain last year was 1,600,000 bushels.\n Bunch grass and cactus are all it would have\n grown without water. Fifty-five bushels to the\n acre is a splendid average. In many instances\n 105 bushels were obtained. When a country not\n worth a continental in its original condition can\n be made by the expenditure of a trifling sum of\n money to yield $1,300,000 per year in addition\n to the support of its inhabitants, a powerful argu-\n ment is afforded in favor of making the effort\n which will reclaim lands 50,000 times as great\n and just as good.\n</p>\n<p>\n Supposing that the evidence now being collected\n shall be found to enforce this argument; sup-\n posing that what these people claim is true as\n to the character of their desert soil, as to the re-\n sults that would be secured from the proposed\n canal and storage system, and as to its actual\n feasibility and comparative cheapness, there is\n only one argument that now occurs to me against\n the policy of having the general Government en-\n gage in the work. That is the argument of\n which Holman and Blount and their class are the\n especial champions. I don\u2019t know what name to\n apply to this argument unless Anti-Paternal fits\n it. They say, you know, that it is no function of\n a Government to go into business with the people,\n and there is no right in Congress to spend the\n money contributed by Indiana and Georgia for\n the benefit of Montana and Colorado. Well, now,\n that is one way of putting it, but if the real act\n of the Government is to go into business with it-\n</p>\n<p>\n self, and if the effect of its use of the money\n contributed by Indiana and Georgia is to reduce\n the taxes which Indiana and Georgia would other-\n wise have to pay, another face is put upon the\n matter. If a man has a beef to sell, and the\n beef is lean and bony and generally no good, and\n if he cannot find a butcher who will buy it, he\n thinks it good policy to let the beef graze a while\n and grow fat, doesn\u2019t he? The Government has\n lands to sell, but the lands are valueless. If it\n can get its price for them by doing that which\n will make them valuable, and thereby make\n money and save itself expenses which it would\n in the other event have to bear, the question of\n policy certainly seems to be a simple one. There\n are Treasury watch-dogs who watch the Treasury\n so viciously that they prevent the inflow far\n more than the outflow. L. E.

In one shape or another mineral man.\n ifestations are written in the rocks o r on the\n ground, wherever the earth lifts and tumbles.\n To the average eye they will not be very sig-\n nificant manifestations. The average man who\n comes out here to see how metals are discovered\n and converted from black dirt and white rock\n into gold and silver, will find himself powerfully\n impressed with the wisdom of that feature of\n the Providential plan which gave to different men\n different mental qualities and tastes and tenden.\n cies, for, after going through a mine, he can but\n reflect how little gold and silver there would\n be in the world if it were left to him to find\n it and render it of value. The little brown-stained\n stones here and there on the mountain side that\n give so quick an impulse to the prospector\u2019s heart\n are utterly commonplace and meaningless to the\n untrained eye. It has seen little brown rocks\n many a time, and it cannot readily perceive, even\n after a succession of lectures, wherein these little\n brown rocks differ from the little brown rocks\n it has come across heretofore.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Montana mining district covers an immense\n territory, nearly a fifth of the new State\u2019s acreage.\n The district has not been, as yet, more than super-\n ficially prospected, and only the merest beginning\n has been made toward the actual development\n of its wealth. As you roam around in the moun.\n tains you will see thousands of little earthen\n mounds piled up by the side of a pine shack\n and a black hole in the ground. Each of these is\n a claim upon which mining experts have deemed\n it worth while to do several hundred dollars\n worth of work. Each contains minerals, in what\n quantity nobody knows or can know until mod.\n ern machinery has burrowed in and up and down.\n</p>\n<p>\n In Montana, as in California, the earliest min.\n ing was the simplest.

The\n miners who came to Virginia City and Helena\n when the Alder and Last Chance gulches were\n discovered were from the older mining States,\n and they knew that free gold among the sand\n and pebbles in the bottom of a creek proved\n gold m confinement in the rocks above the creek.\n They knew that the gold in particles and nuggets\n must have come from somewhere and have gone\n through a process in order to reach the free state\n i mt0 v ?Cleys. That lesson they\n</p>\n<p>\n had learned in California and Nevada, and many\n of them were soon at work in the hills hunting\n for familiar signs. Little else than the staking\n out of claims was done while the placer gold\n lasted. The earliest discovery of gold in Mon-\n tana is attributed to a Scotch half-breed from the\n Canadian Bed River Valley. Being a half-breed,\n he was naturally a rover, and he came into Mon-\n tana to trade with the Indians. Being a Scotch,\n man, he naturally struck a spot where gold hap-\n pened to exist. He lived at Deer Lodge, on the\n west side of the Main Rockies, and he noticed\n</p>\n<p>\n tlie s , and at tiie bottom of\n the creek that flowed past his dugout. He washed\n 7 1852 and collected a spoonful of\n dust, w Rich he sent to Fort Benton. It was nro-\n nounced to be \u201c sure-enough\u201d gold, and\n from time to time he collected\n more. Several years later he bought\n some goods from a trader, and induced him to\n accept an ounce of dust in payment. The trader\n ^ i? t0 an a ? en , \u00b01 the American Fur Com-\n pany, who ascertained its value to be $15. This\n incident led many persons to look around in the\n ?o e cl r bottoms and gulches, and from 1858 to\n nn profitable washing was done.\n</p>\n<p>\n The first discoveries of decided importance were\n made on Grasshopper Creek, a branch of the\n Jefferson River, the northwesterly fork of the\n BLssouri. Here in 1862, the city of Bannack\n was founded, and it quickly grew into a large\n mining camp. In the summer of that year two\n prospecting parties started to search the Big Horn\n Mountains. One of these, led by James Stuart,\n was organized in Bannack. The other, led bv\n wPliMi ^.fhes was an Idaho party. Hughes\n left Elk City, Idaho, and reached Deer Lodge\n Montana, in March, 1863, having been nine months\n on the road. It was his intention to join Stuart\n and he directed his expedition to a point on the\n Stmlungwater Creek, where he believed Stuart\n to lie encamped. He reached that delectable\n region only to find his friend gone. The remains\n of a deserted camp were visible, and he took up\n Stuart\u2019s trail toward the Big Horn country. In\n May he arrived at the spot in the Yellowstone\n Valley where the city of Billings now stands, and\n here he was captured by a party of Crow Indians\n They robbed him of his horses and let him go,\n but upon his proceeding toward the Big Horn,\n they dispatched an Indian runner after him with\n the information that they would not allow him\n to do any prospecting whatever in their mountains.\n Hughes turned back dispirded and con-\n cluded to make the best of his\n</p>\n<p>\n way to Bannack, meeting as he pro-\n ceeded with a number of animating experiences\n with hostile savages. He was sufficiently a\n</p>\n<p>\n strategist, however, to issue safely from them\n all, and, having crossed the Gallatin and Madison\n Rivers, he came at last into a deep and narrow\n gulch which contained the head-waters of the\n Alder Creek, a branch of the Jefferson River,\n about 100 miles due south from this city. Here,\n on the evening of May 22, 1863, he went into\n camp, having travelled 700 miles in a circuit\n since leaving Deer Lodge.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of his party, named Fairweather, while\n the others were preparing the supper, wandered\n down into the gulch. The mountains on either\n side were steep and rugged, and he noticed several\n points of bare bed-rock jutting front their sides.\n This indicated the action of water washing the\n</p>\n<p>\n mountains, and induced him to fetch out his\n pan and examine the bed of the gulch. He took\n up at random a panful of dirt, and became abun-\n dantly happy at discovering a yield of about 33\n cents. He communicated this agreeable circum-\n stance to his companions, and they sank a hole\n immediately. The first panful taken from the\n bottom produced $5 10 in dust, and each suc-\n cessive washing gave convincing proof that they\n had come upon a placer digging of unwonted\n richness. Their provisions, however, were ex-\n hausted, and they concluded to make a bee-line for\n Bannack, secure a proper equipment and return.\n They lost no time in making their journey, and,\n of course, their leverish anxiety to buy the whole\n city at once excited remarks. They at length\n acknowledged they had made a rich find,\u201d and,\n to their dismay, when they started upon their\n return trip they found the larger halt of Bannack\n at their heels. Several attempts were made to\n shake off and escape from their unwelcome fol-\n lowers, but every movement they made was\n watched. At last, as they approached the golden\n gulch, they halted. They told their tormenting\n pursuers that unless it was agreed to give each\n of them his choice of 200 leet across the gulch,\n from rim to rim. they would turn back and never\n go near their Eldorado. If, on the other hand,\n that guarantee should be given, they might all\n proceed in harmony together. The faith of the\n miners was pledged upon this basis of agreement,\n duly recorded and signed. In two days more\n the richest placer diggings ever found in the\n world were penetrated, and Virginia City was\n established. At the most critical period of the\n Nation\u2019s financial history this gulch added sixty\n millions to the gold product of America.\n</p>\n<p>\n Equally interesting are the circumstances at-\n tending the birth of Helena. Four young miners,\n whose names arc not associated with\n the city\u2019s later history, in May, 166i, were wander-\n ing along the main range prospecting. They\n had been unable to obtain claims in Alder Gulch,\n and their objective point, in ease they should fail\n to strike a rich field of their own. was Kootenai, in\n British Columbia, where common report had locat-\n ed valuable diggings. They camped one night in\n the gulch where Helena stands to-day, but tnough\n they found \u201c color\u201d they were not particularly\n pleased. They doubted if gold was there ia any-\n thing like paying quantities. They pushed ahead,\n therefore, crossed the range, and had gone as many\n as thirty miles northward when they encountered\n a man who dispelled their dreams of Kootenai. He\n said the good claims were all goiae, and the best\n of them were poor, anyhow. This news was a\n great discouragement to the party. They held a\n rather dismal council, and concluded that the\n gulch they had lately left was their only hope.\n Accordingly, the next morning they turned around\n aiud came back to the spot upon which they had\n previously encamped. They grimly named the\n valley \u201c Last Chance Gulch,\u201d and Last Chance\n Gulch it is to-day. They sank two holes to bed-\n rock, and their hearts leaped high when they\n counted $3 60 in dust in their first pan. Each of\n these four adventurers made a fortune from his\n claim, and soon a big camp was drawn together.\n One of the miners who had been impressed with\n the fascinations of Homer\u2019s heroine gallantly\n urged the name of Helena as most appropriate for\n the name of the new city, and Helena it became.\n</p>\n<p>\n It stands to-day in the very bottom where the\n Last Chance pilgrims made their first discoveries.\n A more absurd and yet a more picturesque situa-\n tion would be difficult to fancy. Its chief busi-\n ness thoroughfare lies directly in the bottom of\n the Last Chance Gulch, at the further end of\n which the patient Chinaman is still washing his\n pan of dirt and realizing a fortune larger than in\n his own country he had ever dreamed of achiev-\n ing. Thirty millions were taken from Last Chance\n Gulch before it was abandoned to merchants and\n shopkeepers, and even now the builder of a new\n house can find laborers willing to dig his cellar\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0056/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0056/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0056/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0056/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0056/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0056.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 684785}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"56\">\n<p>\n 54\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n for the dirt they take from it.

The three grand divisions\n of geological time are said to be represented in\n the rocks of the Montana mountains more equally\n than in any other part of this continent. Azoic\n rocks, secondary limestones and tertiary deposits\n lie side by side, the granite gneiss being generally\n on the mountain summits, the secondary rocks\n on the slopes and the tertiary deposits in the val-\n leys. It is not always that the azoic formations\n crown the range, but that is so generally the\n case as to imply continuity of action along the\n entire uplift, and when the exceptions occur\n and secondary rocks cover slope to summit, the\n granite ridge is almost invariably to be found be-\n neath them. The mineral veins lie in the gran-\n ite and in the secondary rocks accompanying it.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is upon these heights that the prospector looks\n to find the tell-tale outcroppings of quartz. He\n may 6ee them first in the valley, where, displaced\n and often decomposing, they have tumbled. He\n pursues them till they grow more numerous and\n he strikes the ledge which originally bore them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then he knows he is at a surface point, which\n ought to lead to a lode. He digs his tunnel\n straight through or down into the hill, according\n as he fancies from the direction of the ledge, that\n the vein must run. If he does not find it one\n way, he turns and tries another. Soon, if he\n knows his business, he sees the vein of talc and\n the quartz that holds what he is after. It may\n not be a big vein. It may not hold the mineral\n in paying quantities. It may be only a little\n pocket. In these events his labor is all for\n nothing. But he does not stop digging tall\n the vein stops, or until from its width and char-\n acter it shows what he thinks to be a valuable\n claim. In that event he stakes out his 600 by\n 1,500 feet, posts his notice to all it may concern\n that he has found a lode, and makes his entry |\n under the mineral law. He takes out a specimen\n ton here and there and has it, assayed. To be j\n worth developing there should be at least, $20 of\n metal in each ton of ore. _ Large com-\n panies owning their own reduction mills and\n smelting works could profitably take out one of\n an even lower grade, but the ordinary man could\n not. The expense of mining, freighting and re-\n ducing would consume about $18 or $ 20 .\n</p>\n<p>\n If his investigations prove that between the\n two walls of rock which mark the limits of his\n lode lies a considerable body of paying ore, the\n prospector usually looks around for a purchaser.\n He knows the costliness of mining machinery,\n the possibility of inadequate returns, the diffi-\n culty of placing the stock of a mining company*\n and his own financial incompetence. ' He may\n have millions under his feet, but without the\n means to turn the ore into metal, they might as\n well be at the bottom of the sea. He usually\n goes to some rich mining operator, of whom there\n are fifteen or twenty available, and tries to sell\n his claim. The great man sends somebody to\n look at it > and if his report is favorable he sets\n his wits to work to get it for nothing. The\n average price for a claim at this stage of its de-\n velopment is perhaps- SI, 500. Some mining\n companies have thus acquired a score or more of\n valuable mines which they operate or not. as their\n convenience is pleased. Hundreds of men in\n Montana have grown rich in a way that rather\n shakes one\u2019s faith in the good old adages about\n thrift and industry and temperance, and all those\n wholesome qualities. They took an abandoned\n claim or two for the price of a pony, held it as\n dead weight till somebody else with an adjacent\n claim revealed its true value, and now they play\n poker in a game where $5 is the price of the\n white chips. Some of them whose sons lead the\n swell germans and drive blooded horses, and\n whose daughters pronounce calf with an \u201c a\u201d as\n broad as their feet and carry feather fans that\n look like fire-screens, came first into prominence\n as occupants of the high chair behind a faro table.\n They gamble for a living still, I fancy, if the\n truth were known ; but when you gamble in\n millions, and gamble well, you are just as respect-\n able in Helena as you would be in Boston or\n New- York.

All the desperadoes who had reached the\n end of their tether in California and Nevada col-\n lected around Bannack, Helena and Virginia.\n They gave themselves new names and, for a time,\n new manners. In almost every case they had\n some pretended occupation. Some were miners,\n some were ranchers. Everything in and about\n a mining camp was. of course, in the crudest state\n imaginable. Virginia\u2019s nearest points of supply\n were Fort Benton and Salt Lake City. All that\n the people wore, and pretty much all that they\n ate, came across the plains in wagons from Salt\n Lake cr up the Missouri to Benton and then 200\n miles overland. The miners lived in tents and\n dug-outs. Such as were capitalists owned log\n cabins of greater or less dimensions. These were\n grouped together on the precipitous mountain sides\n above the gulch in which they worked. Every\n other cabin was a gin-mill or a \u201c hurdy-gurdy.\u201d\n Women of the \u201c toughest\u201d type had flocked in\n from the brothels of San Francisco and Chicago.\n The gamblers were the aristocrats of the place.\n</p>\n<p>\n For a long while there was no such thing as\n law, nor any machinery through which law could\n be administerea. Everybody had to depend on\n everybody else\u2019s sense of justice and on liis own\n six-shooter. Pistols and knives hung numerously\n from every man\u2019s belt, and were resorted to upon\n the slightest provocation. No attention was paid\n to ordinary duels brought about by a sense of\n wrong between the involved parties, retaliation\n was considered not only natural, but the only\n thing possible. Affairs of this kind went on con-\n stantly and scarcely excited remark. The victor\n was congratulated, the victim buried and the thing\n promptly forgotten. It was only when a cold-\n blooded and unprovoked murder was\n committed, or when a mau was shot\n down without a fair chance to defend\n himself, that anything like a shock was given to\n the community. Flagrant outrage became so fre-\n quent that a miners\u2019 court was finally established.\n A sheriff was elected, whose duty was to arrest\n and hold alleged offenders, and a judge was chosen\n to preside at trials. But small respect was paid\n to these feeble efforts at law and order. It was\n only when the community was fully aroused and\n the criminal easily caught that, punishment fol-\n lowed even the darkest crimes.\n</p>\n<p>\n And dark crimes many of them were, too ;\n crimes so lurid and causeless that one wonders\n how people could have been willing to live where\n the hidden pistol and the unseen knife were liable\n at any moment to do their deadly work. The\n robbery of stage-coaches was a nightly occurrence.\n Men known to be carrying money started away\n and were never heard of again. Everybody was\n in danger, for everybody possessed more or less\n gold. It, was nothing for SI, 000 in gold dust to\n be washed out at a day ' s work. Gold dust stood\n around on cabin floors in milk pans. It was\n shipped out by the ton. The price of everything\n was an ounce of dust\u2014 $18 in gold--and the\n poorest man in the camp carried with him his\n bao 1 of dust, worth from $500 to $2,000. It\n \u25a0was hard to tell who was a robber and who\n wasn\u2019t. Everybody drank, almost everybody\n gambled, everybody swore like a Texan; and yet\n the vast majority were men of honor, as honor\n was measured there and then.\n</p>\n<p>\n Certain characters soon came to be marked by\n the miners generally. They were the fellows who\n got drunk and bullied, who called themselves\n 8 the chief\u201d and boasted how many men they had\n killed. These fellows were oontinuallv in scrapes.\n One of them shot a man who dunned him for a\n debt Another, meeting a person against whom\n he cherished a grievance, coolly observed, \u201c Bill.\n I don\u2019t like you very well.\u201d and put a bullet\n through the object cf his malignity. Some others.\n</p>\n<p>\n endeavoring to capture an Indian squaw whom\n one of the party had bought, and who, being\n cruelly treated, had returned to her tribe, opened\n a fusillade on the \" Indians, Wiling several of them\n and two or three white people, too. They were\n remonstrated with for killing the whites, and\n they cheerfully replied, \u201c Damn \u2019em. they didn\u2019t\n have no business to be in the tepees!\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n They fought among themselves more or less.\n Wiling each other with the utmost complacency.\n That these fellows were connected witli the secret\n murders and robberies became a settled\n conviction in the camps, but deep-sighted\n men were by no means satisfied that they were\n the worst or the most dangerous of the gang.\n There was a gang\u2014 that was evident\u2014 a regularly\n organized band of desperadoes, with spies in every\n camp. They always seemed to know when and\n where to strike, and such faltering and fearful\n efforts as were made to discover them amounted\n to nothing. Men who dared to eDgage in that\n enterprise would find significant warnings in their\n paths, a sheath-knife stuck in their front door-\n posts, or other cheerful, suggestive marks and\n signs placed where they could not fail to be seen.\n If any man was supposed to know too much, ac-\n quired however accidentally and preserved how-\n ever sacredly, he was almost sure to disappear.\n There was a method and an efficiency in the opera-\n tions of the gang which showed it to be under\n the direction of a highly superior devil.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the crisis came the people were ready\n for it. A feeling had been growing up among\n them for months that a battle to the death\n between them and the desperadoes was unavoid-\n able, and the sooner it was over the better for all.\n As to the guilt of any one man with relation\n to an act for which he could be condemned ac-\n cording to the code of the mountains, there was\n doubt. It was too difficult to get a jury of\n mountaineers to discriminate .between murder\n and justifiable homicide to make it worth while\n getting up a trial over an ordinary \u201c shootin\u2019\n match.\u201d An old man living in Nevada City, a\n mining camp two or three miles below here, had\n some horses ranging on a ranch a few miles out\n of town. He sent a man called \u201c Dutchy\u201d after\n the horses. \u201c Dutchy\u201d gathered them in a bunch\n and vlent to the ranch house to pay for the\n keeping of them. Half a dozen men were in the\n cabin, and they all saw Dutchy\u2019s pile of dush-\n a large-sized bag of it. Having settled his em-\n ployer\u2019s bill, \u201c Dutchy\u201d went away, and the\n crowd shook dice as to who should fellow him,\n and capture the dust. George Ives was the man\n upon whom chance imposed this duty. Ives was\n a tall, handsome, blue-eyed fellow, highly agree-\n able in his manner and conversation, said to be\n of an excellent family in \u201c The States,\u201d and a\n graduate from an Eastern college. Ives accepted\n the task, sprang on his horse and started off in\n put suit of \u201c Dutchy.\u201d Soon he returned with the\n horses and the gold-dust.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Did you wing him ?\u201d asked one of the party. '\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Guess I did,\u201d said Ives. \u201c I hate to shoot\n a fellow in the back, so I called out to him,\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018 Hello. Dutchy,\u2019 and when he turned, I let her\n drive I\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The plunder was divided, and so far as tho\n robbers were concerned, the incident was forgotten.\n But the man who owned the hors s, becoming\n alarmed for the safety of \u201c Dutchy,\u201d sent out ai\n second messenger, and he, riding through the\n bushes as he neared the ranch, came upon\n \u201c Dutchy\u2019s\u201d dead body lying just wh re Ives\n had left it. He placed it on his horse and brought\n it into Nevada, On the way ho stopped at the\n ranch and asked Ives, \u201c Long John.\u201d and a man\n named Hilderman. the only three men in the\n cabin, if th n y knew how \u201c Dutchy\u201d \u201c had got\n hurt,\u201d They said no, that people were always\n being killed nowadays, and they never bothered\n their brains over such things.

They\n had done their work so quickly that the party\n inside, of which there were a dozen members\n lying around on the floor, scarcely had time\n to awaken.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c The man who stirs now will never stir again P\n said the leader, sharply and grimly. \u201cLong John I\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Long John called out \u201c Here!\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Wc want you, Long John. \" 1\n</p>\n<p>\n Issuing from a corner. Long John passed from\n the cabin into the yard, where it had been ar-\n ranged that a sub-committee should question him.\n They gave him to understand that he had to die\n on general principles for the murder of \u201c Dutchy,\u201d\n and if he wanted to say anything they would\n hear it. He broke down instantly and confessed I\n the whole story. He tcld much more than what\n related to the particular crime for which he was\n taken, and promised if they would spare his life\n and get him out of the country, to reveal the\n true history of the \u201c road agents.\u201d No promises\n were then made, but his story concerning\n \u201c Dutchy\u2019s\u201d case was fully looked into. He said\n Ives did it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Meanwhile Ives and Hilderman were in custody.\n The method of arrest was simple. The accused\n men were deprived of their weapons with the\n understanding that they would be shot down if\n they played any pranks. Ives was no ordinary\n knave. His mind acted with promptness and\n decision, and he had a nerve unshakable. Withal,\n his handsome young face and ingenuous manner\n were in themselves resources of \" no mean value.\n He took his arrest ns if it were some odd mistake\n Il ' ich would be cleared up in good time, and\n called for no particular concern on his part.\n He laughed and joked about it with his captors,\n occasionally growing serious, protesting his inno-\n cence, and asking what had led them to suspect\n him. He kept all the while a sharn and curious eye\n nxed on Long John, and undoubtedly concluded\n from the cowardly miscreant\u2019s abashed and down-\n cast. expression that he had told the tale. As the\n cavalcade rode fleetly homeward. Iv\u00b0s mounted\n on his own cayuse. a pony of speed and endurance\n managed to get slightly in the lead, so that his\n horse regulated the gait of the others. As they\n came up on him, he lot, out a little more rein, and\n soon the party were in a racing humor. Cayuses\n always want, to race, and little by little Ives\n and two of the \u201c vigilantes\u201d distanced the rest.\n</p>\n<p>\n When safely away ' from the main party Ives\n gave a sudden yell. His pony answered with a\n desperate bound, and ears flat, nostrils distended,\n he totre over the trail like lightning. The\n only cayuse able to follow him was ridden by a\n man of whose character many members of the\n committee were in grave doubt. His name was\n Burtchey. He had got into their secret meeting,\n nobody knew just how, and when the party\n saw Ives plunging wildly up hills and down\n ravines, with Burtchey at his heels, they concluded\n they had been \u201c played.\u201d Several, however, went\n forward in pursuit. Mountains were between them\n and their game. Presently they came upon the\n two ponies which Ives and Burtchey had been\n riding, blown and abandoned. Their fears were\n confirmed, but they 7c new at least that the outlaw\n could not be far away. The chance of finding him\n in such fastnesses was scarcely one in ten. Sud-\n denly they heard a shout sounding faint and afar.\n They replied, and again it sounded, clearer than\n</p>\n<p>\n before. They rode briskly forward, and as they\n turned a ledge of rock they came upon Burtchey\n with Ives at bay. The murderer was stand-\n ing, dark and defiant, within a rocky closet where\n Burtchey, ride in hand, had driven him. There\n were no further suggestions in doubt of Burtchey\u2019 s\n loyalty, and the rest of the journey to Nevada was\n made with Ives stoutly pinioned in his saddle and\n another man holding his pony\u2019s bridle.\n</p>\n<p>\n The news of the capture had preceded them, and\n a great crowd of miners was assembled as the ca-\n valcade rode into the camp. Not all of the multi-\n tude were in sympathy with the \u201c vigilantes.\u201d\n Ives, especially, had many friends, and they were\n not confined to the ruffianly element, either. He\n was a liberal, generous knave, and, like Mr. Gil-\n bert\u2019s burglar, had his amiable qualities. In every\n community there is always a certain thin-skinned\n and dull-witted contingent who will make heroes\n of scoundrels, and who, because it wasn\u2019t their\n throat or their son John\u2019s throat that was cut, will\n always plead something in extenuation of the\n throat-cutter. Ives knew just how to work on\n the silly sympathies of that sort of people. He\n loudly protested his innocence. He wanted to\n know if his life was going to be taken merely on\n suspicion and without a trial. If that was what\n they were up to, whose life would be safe ? He\n ! begged to be conveyed to Virginia City and turned\n over to what he called the \u201c civil authorities.\u201d By\n this he meant to a certain sheriff, whose name was\n Plummer. This was exactly what the wiser mem-\n bers of the committee had determined should not\n be done. They had long entertained a deep dis-\n trust of Plummer. They knew him to be a reck-\n less, devilish fellow, and thing- had recently come\n out which led them to believe that he was\n the leader and arch-fiend of the band of maraud-\n ers, robbers and murderers. Plummer was a man\n of real ability. He had come early into Bannack,\n had quickly impressed himself favorably upon\n the miners, and had induced them to elect him\n sheriff. Then, coming to Alder Gulch, which was\n first settled by people from Bannack, he had ob-\n tained the same office here, so that when Ives\n was arrested, Plummer was the sole officer of\n State in all Montana. His conduct at first was\n apparently above reproach, though he kept a\n \u201c tough\u201d crowd of so-called deputies around him.\n In the course of six or eight months ugly stories\n got around about Plummer\u2019s record outside of\n Montana. It was said ne had killed several men\n in Nevada and California, from which States he\n was a fugitive, and that his murders had been\n committed in aid erf big gold robberies. His be-\n havior when drunk tended to confirm these tales.\n Amazingly quick, adroit and accurate in his use\n of a pistol, he had wounded two or three men in\n Bannack, and had done a good deal of that partic-\n ular Rocky Mountain boasting which characterized\n the full-fledged ruffian-terror of those days. But\n when he sobered up he would always smooth over\n these little affairs, and it cannot be said that they\n had thrown him into any great prejudice with the\n miners. It had been observed and quietly com-\n mented upon after the occurrence of some par-\n ticularly big and atrocious outrage, that Plummer\n was away from Bannack just at the fateful\n hour; but that, of course, did not go far toward\n proving anything.\n</p>\n<p>\n Where Ives should be tried and how were\n troublesome questions. The committee did not\n feel strong enough to proceed without reference\n to the miners around them. They were afraid of\n a rescue. Their number was only twenty-five.\n They knew Ives could muster at least 200 friends.\n Their plain course, therefore, was to win over the\n great body of the miners to their side.

It was\n a bright, clear winter morning. The mountains\n were bare and gaunt, and their rocky heights\n lent majesty to a scene that did not lack solem-\n nity of its own. The uncovered sun sent down\n a glare of warming light and the atmosphere was\n still and peaceful. Children played in the gulch,\n for there were some children even there. All\n work in the diggings was suspended. Crowds of\n people came down from Virginia. Fringing the\n border of the great group there were little clus-\n ters of women, mostly courtesans, dressed in\n gaudy skirts and blouses and intensely sympa-\n thetic for the prisoners. The miners themselves\n were generally severe of aspect. They were in\n the humor for the business before them. Knives\n and pistols hung from everv oelt, and many re-\n marks were made, not too loudly, for every man\n felt that he took his life in his own hands by\n dooming Ives to the gallows, but made silently\n and grimly, indicating that they were going to\n give the accused simple justice, no more and no less.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was discovered while the preliminaries were\n being arranged that the prisoners\u2019 friends had em-\n ployed every lawyer living in the two camps,\n and for a time the committee were at a loss to\n know how or by whom their case should be pre-\n sented. Some one happened to remember that\n Colonel Wilbur F. Sanders, a prominent lawyer of\n Binnacle, was visiting Virginia on business, and\n the_ Colonel was sent for. He had already been\n offered a retainer on behalf of Ives, but had de-\n clined it, and when found was just about step-\n ping into the coach to go home. Being informed\n of the committee\u2019s predicament he willingly con-\n sented to serve them. He was then, as he is now,\n a tall, sharp-featured, clear-headed man, utterly\n fearless and audacious. He had served two years\n in the army and was used to leadership. Ho\n quickly possessed himself of the facts in the case\n and took his place in a wagon-box, where judge,\n prisoner and lawyers were accommodated in full\n view of the multitude.\n</p>\n<p>\n At once a discussion arose about tlie lawyers.\n Many of the miners protested against lawyers in\n general and against Ives\u2019s lawyers in particular.\n They said he had killed the Dutchman or he\n hadn\u2019t. If he had, he must hang. If he hadn\u2019t,\n nobody wanted to hurt him. They didn\u2019t\n want any Lawyers to quibble and talk,\n and quote from books that nobody cared\n about. The lawyers were there to keep back the\n facts and to bother and confuse the people, and\n they \u201c didn\u2019t want no nonsense.\u201d This view\n seemed to he highly popular, and the more Ives ' s\n lawyers and friends talked against it, the more it\n gained in popularity. At last Colonel Sanders\u2019s\n opinion was called for. He said he was personally\n indifferent to the decision they rendered. He\n was willing to represent the people if they wanted\n him : but if they didn\u2019t he was more than content.\n He thought they ought to decide the question in\n view of what would be their feeling when the\n case was ended. If Ives were found guilty and\n hanged would they feel satisfied at having denied\n him the benefit of counsel ? Wouldn\u2019t it be for-\n ever urged against them that they had lynched\n a man without giving him a fair chance to prove\n his innocence? If, on the other hand, he was\n shown to be without guilt, wouldn\u2019t they feel\n better that they had had the case presented ac-\n cording to the law of the land ? This temper-\n ate speech had an immediate effect. Ives was\n allowed his lawyers. Then the question arose\n as to the jury. It, too. was settled upon Colonel\n \u25a0Sanders\u2019s suggestion. The case was likely to be\n a long one, and he doubted if the whole camp\n would have the patience to sit by and hear it\n through. He proposed a jury of twenty-four\n men, to be regularly drawn, but open to exam-\n ination and challenge, who should hear all the\n evidence, listen to the speeches and make a re-\n port to the camp as to the prisoner\u2019s guilt or in-\n nocence and the appropriate punishment if guilty,\n the camp reserving final judgment to itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n The case then began. Colonel Sanaers called\n the man who had found \u201c Dutchy\u2019s\u201d body. He\n told his story fully and well ; how he came to\n find it ; how he knew the body to be \u201c Dutchy\u2019s\u201d ;\n how it had been lully identified; where the bullet-\n hole was ; how he saw the marks of a fine lasso\n around \u201c Dutchy\u2019s\u201d neck, and saw the trail along\n which he had been dragged, still bleeding from his\n wounds, into the bushes that had marked his\n muddy tomb. The employer of \u201c Dutchy\u201d was\n brought forward to tell about bis errand to the\n ranch. Then \u201c Long John\u201d told the main story.\n \" Long John\u2019s\u201d confession was made in fear of\n punishment and in hope of reward. He had been\n promised a free rope to death if he did not tell\n and a free horse to Utah if he did. Perhaps the\n Court of Appeals of a civilized State would never\n have permitted a murderous outlaw to be hanged\n in such shocking violation of the rules. But\n these hard-headed miners were not disturbed\n about rules, and \u201c Long John ' s\u201d story \u201c went.\u201d\n They actually permitted evidence to be given\n proving that Ives was guilty of other crimes than\n the one for which he was being tried. His law-\n yers raged and panted, got wind and raged again.\n They said Ives was being \u201crailroaded,\u201d a phrase\n frequently heard, I believe, during the famous\n \" boodle\u201d trials in New-York. They quoted at\n great length from big books, but Colonel Sanders\n went placidly on and showed that Ives had lulled\n four other men, that he had once tied a man to\n a post and killed him with bird-shot, taking drinks\n between each lire and slowly torturing his vie\n tim to death. He proved robbery after robbery,\n the crowd growing sterner and fiercer as each\n foul crime was unfolded.\n</p>\n<p>\n There was no defence. Ives attempted the\n alibi game, but it failed, and the jury brought in\n a verdict signed by twenty-three of the twenty,\n four declaring him guilty of murder and deserv-\n ing of death. His friends, anticipating this, had\n gathered in full strength and were now pleading\n his cause in little groups among the miners.\n But Colonel Sanders gave them little time,\n ' the sound of the foreman\u2019s voice had not died\n away before he was on his feet moving that the\n verdict be confirmed. There was a dreadful hush,\n and then a miner stood up and said it must be clear\n to all that the verdict was just, lie seconded the\n Colonel\u2019s motion. A hoarse murmur arose from\n Ives\u2019s friends, and the miner-marshal in charge of\n the prisoner bade him stand.\n</p>\n<p>\n Clicking his revolver, the marshal said to the\n crowds : \u201c You oan\u2019t come no \u2018funny business\u2019 here,\n if this man\u2019s friends wants him to die dead sure,\n they\u2019d better try to git him away from me 1\u201d Then\n he ordered his guard, 100 strong, to surround the\n prisoner. The guard, their riues in hand, took\n their places.\n</p>\n<p>\n The judge put the motion, and a loud chorus of\n responding \u201cayes!\u201d was heard. To the negative\n only a few of the hardier ruffians dared answer.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c The motion is carried, and the verdict con-\n firmed!\u201d said the judge.\n</p>\n<p>\n Colonel Sanders again arose. \u201c I move.\u201d he\n said, \u201c that the marshal be directed immediately\n to construct his gallows, and that George Ives be\n hanged by the neck thereon until he is dead!\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Although this motion was the necessary comple-\n ment of the one that had just prevailed, it was\n unexpected, and fell with a shock upon the crowd.\n The darkness was fast gathering, and it had been\n generally assumed that the execution would be\n delayed until the morrow, and yet it seemed to\n strike everybody that the sooner it was over the\n better. The motion was put and carried with\n scarcely a negative vote, and then the murmurs\n from Ives\u2019s friends swelled into a roar. Several\n attempted to make speeches, when, above the\n noise, Ives\u2019s own voice was heard calling Colonel\n Sanders\u2019s name. The Colonel turned to him.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Well ?\u201d he said.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c I want to say a word to you.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Go on.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Ives turned away from the marshal ana\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0060/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0060/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0060/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0060/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0060/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0060.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 692139}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"60\">\n<p>\n 58 '\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n clambered into the wagon where the\n Colonel was standing. His handsome face,\n flushed with excitement, was handsomer than ever,\n and as he reached forth his hand and grasped that\n of the lawyer t-o whom in an especial degree he\n owed his present dreadful situation, the excite-\n ment became intense, and a solemn silence fell\n upon the crowd.\n</p>\n<p>\n He was a good speaker, and he said his last\n words well. He began with a renewal of his\n protestations of innocence, lie acknowledged that\n he had led a wicked lile, but claimed that this\n crime was not upon his heart and hands. He was\n born, he said, of good parents, and his old mother\n and two sisters were living yet. He begged for\n time to write them a letter. His voice grew\n broken, and tears came to bis eyes. If lie must\n die. at least give him a chance to make liis will\n and beg forgiveness of the sorrowing old mother\n whose closing years he had embittered. He prom-\n ised he would not seek to escape, and on behalf\n #1 his friends that no attempt should be made at\n his rescue, but as the last request of a man who\n knew he would soon have to face a God against\n whom h ' s life had been a standing crime, he begged\n that the execution should be delayed until the\n morning.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was a most adroit and telling speech, and for\n a moment Colonel Sanders hesitated. Not that\n he thought of granting the request, but that he\n might formulate such a reply as would satisfy the\n crowd. During the moment\u2019s pause a voice called\n out: \u201c Colonel, ask him how long he give poor\n Dutchy I\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n That was enough. The crowd\u2019s sympathies\n deserted Ives, and when the Colonel suggested\n that Ives write his letter and make his will im-\n mediately, there were a multitude of responses,\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Good!\u201d \u201c That\u2019s right!\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Brief and simple were the marshal\u2019s prepara-\n tions. He planted a pole by the side of an un-\n finished cabin, ran a beam across, and fixed a\n dangling noose to the beam. The platform was a\n dry-goods box, and in thirty minutes the prisoner\n was standing on the box with a guard 200 strong\n around him. As the marshal grasped the box to\n pull it away, he cried to the guard : \u201c Company!\n</p>\n<p>\n Attention! Take aim!\u201d\u201d Instantly 200 guns\n were levelled at the crowd in front and 200\n \u2018 clicks\u201d were heard sharply on the night air. In\n another instant Ives had fallen. \u201c He\u2019s broke his\n neck,\u201d cried the marshal. \u201c He is dead !\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Ihe execution of Ives was followed by the or-\n ganization of that famous band, the Montana\n Vigilantes. It was seen that a body of men brave\n enough and resolute enough and strong enough\n to enforce the death penalty upon the desperadoes\n of whom Long John had given information must\n be found, and that until society had been freed of\n the villains who now held men\u2019s courage in bond-\n age, they must take the law in their own hands.\n Long John had relinquished the secrets of the\n entire robber band. He told who they were and\n where they were posted, what they did in aid of the\n general enterprise and by whom they were di-\n rected. Hilderman was tried immediately, found\n guilty and sentenced to be banished. He, too,\n made a confession, corroborating Long John\u2019s upon\n every vital point. It appeared that no less than\n 108 men had been murdered in one year by these\n bloody miscreants, while robberies innumerable\n had been perpetrated. Long John\u2019s story was in\n many respects imperfect, a circumstance due to the\n fact that he was but imperfectly trusted by the\n robber chiefs. What he knew, however, he knew\n well. He knew the actual perpetrators of many\n crimes and foremost in all the greater ones was\n Plummer, the sheriff. He was the captain of the\n band, and his authority was undisputed. Ives\n held the second rank : and below them were thirty-\n six others. They were in every camp in Montana\n and at ranches along the coach-roads. They had\n a system of signs by which coaches and even\n solitary travellers were marked for plunder! No\n</p>\n<p>\n detail was wanting to render their methods surely\n destructive.\n</p>\n<p>\n ' Ihe honest men of Virginia City saw that no\n ordinary machinery within their possible reach\n could break up so firmly linked a body as this,\n ' they summoned a council, s udied the situation,\n and ordered the capture and death of about a\n dozen men. They agreed that business and\n pleasure should be subordinated to the work before\n them. No more trials were to be allowed, no\n risk of escape taken. Every man there knew the\n course decided upon to be the righteous ' one, the\n only one by which the robbers could be punished\n and like-minded men held in terror. Their first\n captive, on his way to the gallows, completed the\n revelations Long John had begun. His story of\n incredible crime would fill a volume, and a\n wierder, bloodier volume never was written:\n Branches of the Vigilance Committee were rapidly\n formed in every emp, end execution after exe-\n cution occurred in rapid succession. Plummer\n was among the first to go. None was spared.\n Many confessed in fear of their souls, but whether\n they confessed or stood defiant, they were hanged.\n Oniy three or four were successful in efforts to\n escape for the clutch of th > \u201c Vigilantes\u201d reached\n far and wide and descended with dread certainty.\n In another year Montana was purged. Lawless\n men kept out of a Territory where so swift and\n deadly a reception awaited them. Coaches came\n and went in safety. Men travelled when and\n where they pleased without fear of trouble. The\n dreams of every \" guilty soul were haunted with\n the spectral pictur\u00b0 of a midnieht group of\n shadowy horsemen clust\u00b0red about, his door, a line\n of glimmering rifles directed at his crouching\n form, and a light rope damrling from the gaunt\n and naked limb of the nearest tree.

Everybody was his own best\n friend and occupied himself administering to his\n own happiness.\n</p>\n<p>\n But in a few years the. gold was gone. It had\n created several large fortunes. Speculators and\n gamblers had contrived to capture the greater\n part of it, and when dull times came they bore\n heaviest upon those whose industry had created\n the city. For ten years after 1868, the Territory\n stood still, and Helena stood with it\u2014 declined\n with it, possibly. The Northern Pacific Railroad\n lay stranded on the Missouri at Bismarck, and\n great walls of rock stood between Montana and\n the railway lines below. It was almost impossible\n to get a road into the Territory, and without\n freighting facilities the country\u2019s resources were\n only stone and dirt. Still, there were plucky\n people who hung on. There were others who hung\n on because they couldn\u2019t let go, and between\n them they contrived at last to get what went for a\n railroad. It was a little narrow-gauge line from\n Ogden and the Mormon country into Montana,\n connecting with the Union Pacific and controlled\n by it. This little road did great things for the\n miners. It was put into Butte, and business\n started with a rush. Shortly afterward, in 1881,\n the Northern Pacific, revived by Mr. Billings,\n came to the eastern frontier of the Territory, and\n two years later Mr. Villard ran it into Helena.\n</p>\n<p>\n From that moment Montana moved grandly\n forward. Helena had been twenty years getting\n 5,000 inhabitants. In five years more it had\n 20,000. From a log camp it has become a city\n of granite and marble. Right there on the foot-\n hills of the Rocky Mountains, where but a little\n while ago deer and bear were hunted, stand\n splendid houses that would look well in upper\n Fifth-ave. It is a modern town, with all the\n modern virtues and all the modern vices. The\n Salvation Army and the \u201c Theatre Comique\u201d con-\n duct their hostile services side by side, and call\n striking attention to the eternal warfare between\n the hosts of Gabriel and the hosts of Belial. The\n flat-chested Salvation sirens stand in front of\n their building and howl, \u201c We are the children of\n the Lar-ar-ard,\u201d while directly across the street\n a brass band shrieks and snorts in dreadful\n harmony, summoning the gay and the giddy to\n the refreshing performances of \u201c Light-footed\n Lilly\u201d and the divine artist, Meggv Muldoon.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It is a mistake to suppose that Helena depends\n on mining exclusively or her support. There are\n no mines of any great account within twenty-five\n miles of the city. In some measure, greater or\n less, every mine in the Territory pays tribute to\n the capital city. The rich men of\n Helena have interests everywhere, and they draw\n as they can to the town where their principal\n affairs are placed. Each of the heavy millionaires\n controls some big financial institution to which\n every other enterprise he owns is made to con-\n tribute. This policy is uniform with them all.\n They have their jealousies and rivalries, but\n they pull true and together for Helena, and have\n succeeded in giving it an enviable reputation for\n wealth. It is said to be the richest city of its\n size in the world, and statistics are quoted by\n the yard to support tin ' s claim. Its largest bank,\n for instance, holds an average of four millions\n of deposits. If the money lying idle in the vaults\n of Helena were apportioned per capita to the\n people of the city, each man, woman and child\n would own $1,250.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is accepted, in Helena and out. that the\n city will stav. Its neople have forced this im-\n pression by their audacity. They have invested\n</p>\n<p>\n many millions in houses of the most substantial\n kind. Many of the finest business establishments\n in the city were erected at a time when it required\n either a remarkable nerve or a vast degree of\n penetration to make such investments. But one\n such building led to the construction of another\n until an enduring city has been made. The city\n was not built, however, uutil the country de-\n manded it. Much of it has gone up since the\n Manitoba railway system, starting from St. Paul\n on its way to the Pacific Coast, came along to\n receive abundant cargoes of Northern-grown grain.\n The products of the Territory, swelling enor-\n mously every year, have rendered a town like\n Helena necessary. The first coal mine in Montana\n began to do business two years ago. In 1888 the\n product of the mines reached 117,800 tons. It\n will reach 350,000 before 1889 is ended. Tho\n assessed value of property liable to taxation is\n $67,430,533. The actual value of all property\n cannot be less than 200,000,000. From 26,155\n acres sown in wheat, 770,200 bushels wero\n harvested. A production of 70,072 bushels of\n corn came from 2,425 acres planted, and corn\n is not considered more than a possibility in this\n climate. The yield of oats and potatoes was of\n itself a fortune to the Territory. From 84,978\n acres sown in oats came 3,026,572 bushels of\n harvested grain, nearly forty bushels to the acre,\n while 3,688 acres of potatoes supplied 842,648\n bushels in the yield. From 725,668 sheep sheared\n (and I don\u2019t believe half the number of sheep\n and cattle in Montana are reported to the\n assessors) 4,422,030 pounds of wool were taken.\n These are a few of the figures, and only a few.\n and a shrunken few at that, which show why\n Helena is making such incredible strides toward\n metropolitan greatness.\n</p>\n<p>\n At the risk of burdening my story with figures,\n I will venture to repeat some mining statistics\n which will surely be strange to most people. No\n account of the present condition of this city and\n Territory would be more than suggestive without\n them. Montana has now become the greatest\n mining region in the known world, and its mines\n are all within 150 miles of Helena. Here more\n wages are paid to miners bv two and three hundred\n per cent than arc paid in Mexico, Spain, Africa\n or Australia, and yet larger profits are realized,\n larger production is reached and larger individual\n enterprises are in operation than can be found\n nnY ' where pise on earth. Mr. Marcus Daly, . for\n instance, can mine copper against the combined\n capital of Europe, can pay his men $3 50 a day\n a\u00b0ainst 80 cents a day in Spain, and land the\n product of his smelter in London for one cent\n a pound less than the Spanish mines can land\n theirs. It may be doubted if any other man\n than Daly could have performed so amazing ft\n miracle, hut he did it. and in doing it. he knocked\n to flinders the great French syndicate. Tliev de-\n clined his advice. They thought their millions\n stronger than his ingenuity: hut when he hurled\n his copper at them, 2,500 tons a day. they htul\n to give mi. In the first, place, they had no suck\n mines as his. In the n\u00b0xt place, they had no suen\n machinery. His genius and the genius or\n those he called around him had provided methods\n and machines to which they were strangers, an r\n they couldn\u2019t fight, a man who was able to pay an\n his expenses with the silver in his ore and produce\n its principal metal for nothing. This incident is\n on\u00bb of several whieh have placed Montana m the\n lead of all mineral-producing countries, and the\n actual figures showing what it is deng are\n naturally of the richest value and interest.\n</p>\n<p>\n The production of gold and silver in the united\n States from 1792 to 1888, inclusive, lias been\n $2,668,706,769, a contribution to the worlds\n durable monetary wealth that is hard to realize.\n The richest years, happily enough, were those im-\n mediately succeeding the Rebellion, from 1865\n to tlie date of the Resumption $885,000^000 was\n vi\u00b0ldcd bv the mines of this country.

The two Territories of Idaho and Utah\n are now beginning to produce in a large measure,\n and the end is as yet nowhere in sight.\n</p>\n<p>\n The forms in which gold manifests itself are\n curious and beautiful. Sometimes in placer dig-\n gings great lumps are found of absolutely pure\n metal. One collection of nuggets owned in\n Helena numbers oveT 600 pieces, ranging from\n the size of a marble to that of a baseball. One\n lump, especially pure, weighs 4 7.7 troy ounces\n and is worth $945 80. Others are worth over\n $500.

It has no type. It is of\n itself, and by itself. When you see Butte, you\n 6ee what you never saw before and never can see\n</p>\n<p>\n [ again. You may not like Butte, you may think\n you wouldn\u2019t care to live there, you may object\n to its manners, or its morals, but you will certainly\n admit that it is the most remarkable place \u201c on\n the fool stool.\u201d Fancy a lot of frame-houses,\n</p>\n<p>\n mostly one-storied, enough of them to accommo-\n date 25,000 people, squatted on the side of the\n mountains, miles af board walk stretching up and\n down two or three dozen streets: fancy a great\n throng of human beings plunging along every\n thoroughfare at all hours of the day and night,\n for, apparently, only a ' small proportion of the\n people of Butte waste time in sleep ; fancy men in\n plug hats and fluted shirts, men in blue blouses\n and panamas, men in black, slouched hats and\n trousers that time has forgotten to recall, men in\n other things I don\u2019t know the names of and never\n saw except in Butte ; fancy Americans, fancy Ger-\n mans, fancy Swedes, fancy negroes, fancy Indians,\n fancy Ch ' namen, fancy Castle Garden, fancy the\n Bowery, fancy Shanty Town, fancy Beacon-st.,\n fancy a Methodist camp-ground\u2014 jumble them all\n together, and you will have something that is in\n a measure suggestive of Butte.\n</p>\n<p>\n Butte has a delightful society, capable of satis-\n fying everybody\u2019s taste. If you prefer refined\n and cultivated people, college-bred and broadened\n by travel, they are there and happy to know you.\n If you like plain, common, everyday folk, whose\n hearts are better than their manners, they are\n numerous, apt to be rich and sure to be friendly.\n If you enjoy gamblers and thieves, prize-fighters\n and sporting-men generally, they are as available\n as ticks in a pine forest. There are people who\n say that Butte is the wickedest place in the\n world. I doubt it. I doubt if anything happens\n in Butte that doesn\u2019t happen contemporaneously\n in Boston. The only difference is that they are\n more candid in Butte than in Boston.\n The gambling-houses of Butte have their\n doors wide open, without even so much as\n a wicker screen to shield their careless players.\n Over their doors is a sign-board, with the words\n conspicuously lettered, \u201c Licensed Gambling Sa-\n loon,\u201d which means that they are sure of being\n let alone in the orderly conduct of their swindles\n without paying blackmail money at police head-\n quarters. Enter such a place and you see every-\n body. Mr. Jones, lawyer; Mr. Smith, banker;\n Mr. Biown, minei, a street fakir \u201c dropping\u201d on\n black and white the proceeds of his night\u2019s wrestle\n with the community\u2019s pains and aches on the\n street corner beyond; two or three women, likely\n to be French or African; a heathen or so, silent,\n patient, but usually lucky, all huddled in a lump\n watching the mechanical movements of the long-\n bearded, elderly chap as he slides this card that\n way, and that this. There are no \u201c side doors,\u201d\n no alley entrances in Butte. The sun is permitted\n to shine through clear glass windows upon the\n unjust as well as the just. A mining camp\n (and when one sees Butte he sees the greatest\n mining camp on earth) is a place where everybody\n makes money fast, where prices are high, profits\n large and gold in plentiful circulation. Naturally\n enough, the loose and the vicious are attracted\n to such a place.

The people of Butte are proud\n of everything they possess. They are proud of\n their mines, of their stores (they have a store in\n Butte almost as big as Macy\u2019sj, of their clubs, of\n their beer-halls, and why not of their churches?\n Not only those who go to the churches, but thou-\n sands who never saw the inside of them nor heard\n a Te Deum in their lives, arc proud. Butte is a\n liberal community, and it is a matter of profound\n satisfaction to the entire town that its outfit of\n churches is equal to the demand. And do not\n fear. Butte will raise the money for another\n church in ten minutes if it appears to be needed.\n She will raise it anyhow, needed or not, so soon\n as Helena starts to build a new one. Butte would\n never consent to be outstripped by Helena in\n churches or anything else, and she will have her\n steeples sweeping as high a cloud as ever Helena\n dares aspire to.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sunday, however, is not a very quiet day in\n Butte. It is the miner\u2019s play-day. They hunt,\n fish and go on picnics. The bands parade on\n Sundays. The saloons esteem it their best and\n busiest opportunity. The \u201c hurdy-gurdies\u201d are\n open, and dances run on incessantly. All the\n stores do business, all the mills and smelters\n run. Many people work harder on Sundays than\n on any other day. The chief evil of this whole\n Northwestern country is the tendency of every-\n body to work himself to death. You must keep\n going as the crowd goes. You can\u2019t lag behind\n while those around you, competing with you, are\n hurling themselves forward. Everybody aclcn owl-\n edges that this is a foolish mistake. Everybody\n would infinitely prefer not to make it. But no-\n body feels able to check the current. It moves\n and you must go along, too, or find yourself left.\n Butte is 5,878 feet above the level of the sea,\n and the air is all oxygen. It keeps one\u2019s heart\n thumping away at a great rate. One does as\n much living in ten years in Butte as he can do\n in twenty in the East.\n</p>\n<p>\n The city takes its name from a lofty solitary\n hill which stands apart from the main range of\n the Rockies. It is a picturesque hill, but not\n a productive one. The great mines of Butte\n are in another lower hill, and upon and between\n these two eminences stands the town. Usually\n camps are at a considerable distance from the\n mines, and even then they are apt to lie upon\n such rugged heights as to require of their inhabi-\n tants the greatest possible amount of climbing\n for the least- possible amount of \u201c getting\n there.\u201d But Butte possesses a sight altogether\n remarkable. Its mines lie only a rifle shot away,\n and its hills are low and gentle in their slope.\n It is not an old camp. Its population has been\n almost wholly acquired since 1880. Only a little\n more than $1,000,000 was recovered from the\n ores of Butte in 1881. The product now, eight\n years later, has reached the enormous total of\n $ 22 , 000 , 000 .\n</p>\n<p>\n To enumerate the mines of Butte would be\n profitable only as a means of showing how remark-\n able a concentration of silver and copper veins\n has been made in this spot. Before claim can\n be laid to a new mine the prospector must show\n the discovery of a new vein, and the hundreds of\n mines here are testimony of just as many separate\n lodes as there are claims on file. The mining\n companies are not so very numerous, and the effort\n is to keep them down. All that enormous capital,\n lodged in a few hands, can do to discourage\n new mining enterprises is naturally done. Pros-\n</p>\n<p>\n pect claims are bought up as quickly as they are\n \" town to be wortn buying. One company in\n Butte is said to be operating no less than twenty-\n two mines, and it owns even mote. Individual\n miners conceal their holdings under different com-\n pany names, though they possess controlling\n interests in each company. So far as the country\n is concern d, this is an excell nt scheme. It brings\n about a far greater production than would other-\n wise be possible. The investment of the Anaconda\n company, the largest of all mining associations,\n is said to exceed $20,000,000. They ' own a score\n of mines, milling and smelting plants of capacities\n almost incredibly 1 - great, and all they do is upon\n a grand scale. There are a full dozen of other\n companies, smaller than the Anaconda, but still\n representing millions of expended capital, and\n they are pulling the ore from under Butte\u2019s moun-\n tains at the rate of 18,000 tons a day. The out-\n side of a mine is not, of itself, especially impres-\n sive. Seen in its best shape, it shows only\n a machine shop, a pair of engines supplying power\n for the drills, another pair running the elevators,\n a lumber mill, a supply store and an office build-\n ing. It is noticeable that everything is always\n the best of its kind, and when the spectacle is\n presented of a number of these establishments, each\n with a gigantic chimney lifted into the clouds,\n each with its buzz-saws tearing huge Oregon tim-\n bers into logs and planks, each puffing and blow-\n ing frantically, and all grouped upon and around\n a single hill, it does look animated and busy. The\n element of power in mining machinery appeals more\n than anything else to the eye. The pumps that pull\n the water from the tunnels far underground, the\n great, thick dynamos that, illuminate the mines\u2019\n remotest corners ; the long, heavy engines that\n drive bars of steel into solid rock a thousand feet\n below the spot where they stand and swiftly,\n silently revolve : the tall, thick engines built high\n into the air, with enigmatical adjustments that\n show where every car is and what those at work\n half a mile away and 800 feet below the surface are\n doing\u2014 these are all splendid machines, magnifi-\n cently masculine. They do their work easily,\n quietly, gracefully, lifting masses of timber and\n ore and driving a hundred drills with as little\n seeming effort as a draught stallion would exhibit\n pulling a sulky. But it is only when one gets\n down into the mine and then off at the smelter\n that he begins to realize what a stupendous work\n is involved in getting metals from the earth. He\n goes down, down, down until his heart seems to\n be thumping in his ears. The descent is made in\n utter darkness, save for the sudden flashes of light\n that for an instant break in and are in another\n instant shut off, marking the various \u201c levels\u201d or\n floors. At last,\u2014 it seems an hour, but it has been\n only eighty seconds since he started\u2014 the elevator\n stops, and he alights in a room with timbered\n walls and ceilings. He finds hallways leading here;\n there, everywhere, all brilliantly illuminated.\n In a first-class American mine there is no groping\n around in damn and filthy gloom, elad in a ' musty\n oilskin and holding a sad and feeble tallow dip.\n You walk erect through halls and chambers\n brightly lighted by incandescent wires, on\n cleani board floors, with an atmos-\n phere around you as cool and pure\n as that you left on the mountains above. There\n is no more chance for fatal accidents in the mines\n around Butte than on the streets of New-York\u2014\n less, in fact. In such matters the managements\n are faultless. The timber necessary to render a\n big mine safe is cne of the heaviest, items of\n expense. In one of the mines at Butte no less\n than 50.000 feet of timber are deposited every\n day. That mine contains already a great forest.\n Every room is supported with ceilings and floors\n of logs, and the miners work in chambers as light\n and well ventilated as a ball-room. Tire entries\n run wherever the vein runs, and rooms are opened\n as occasion for them is presented. It is bv no\n means always possible to tell the exact position\n 1 or direction of the valuable lode from surface\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0064/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0064/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0064/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0064/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0064/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0064.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 713563}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"64\">\n<p>\n 62\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n indications.

If it is a \u201c free milling ore,\u201d that is,\n an ore which contains no sulphate or other\n substance that prevents quicksilver from talcing\n up the mineral, it is simply washed and crushed\n and subjected to a dose of quicksilver. 1 he ores\n of Alaska are generally easy to treat, lhey\n submit quietly to the free milling process. Rut\n the Butte ores contain refractory elements in an\n unusual degree. Their reduction has been at-\n tained in its present perfection only as the result\n of many long and costly experiments. One of the\n copper companies has charged $2,000,000 to its\n profit and loss account in the last three years\n for machinery that failed of its purpose. Only\n within a year or so has it been known ]ust how\n to secure the fullest returns of metal from these\n ores. Enough is certainly done to them to get\n out whatever may he in them. They are first\n put under heavy cast-iron stamps and reduced\n to dust and powder. The din raised by fifty\n or sixty of these monster stamps as they pound\n and hammer the rock is almost as magnificent\n an uproar as the falls of Niagara produce. The\n pulverized ore having been concentrated is \u201c cal-\n cined,\u201d that is, the sulphur is burned out of it\n in a revolving oven. Sulphur is an annoying\n and troublesome ingredient, and when it has been\n finally disposed of the metal producer Reis much\n nearer the end of his journey. From the\n calcine ovens, the ore takes a short-cut _ to the\n smelter, where raging fires melt, it into fluids, the\n metallic fluid escaping and becoming \u201c matte,\u201d\n and the waste, or \u201c slag,\u201d escaping to b\u00b0oome an\n element of street paving. It is all very simple\n when some one goes around with you and tells\n you what everything means, hut it seems to re-\n quire an amazing number of huge and hot and\n noisy machines to get at the object in ouest.\n Butte is the only mining camp where all the\n processes are undertaken that are necessary to\n bring the metal from the rock and the dirt.\n Butte depends on no other place. It is its own\n Leadville and its own Denver.\n</p>\n<p>\n The life of a mining camp is always uncer-\n tain. We no longer hear of Bannack, rarely of\n Virginia City. Whether or not Butte possesses\n in its sPnatmn that, strength and vital\u2019t.v which\n will enable it to survive the dav \u2014 far distant, it\n is true, but sure to come\u2014 when the wealth in its\n hills will have disappeared, is a question I should\n like to feel able to answer affirmatively. It\n is decidedly a city to-dav. It ha\u00ab manufactories,\n wholesale houses, schools and many things that\n distinguish a permanent town. When its people\n begin to build substantial houses of brick and\n granite, when they cens\u00b0 constructing litHe frame\n shanties, when, in brief, thev show confidence\n enough in their future t.o prove that thw them-\n selves intend to spend tlimr lives ther < \\ they will\n encourage others in the belief that their march\n will never decline.\n</p>\n<p>\n XXIX.\n</p>\n<p>\n GREAT FALLS.\n</p>\n<p>\n A THRIVING TOWN OF ONLY THREE YEARS\u2019\n GROWTH.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE HEAD-WATERS OF THE MISSOURI\u2014 A PICT:\n</p>\n<p>\n URESQUE AND FERTILE REGION JUST\n BEING OPENED UP.\n</p>\n<p>\n Great Falls, Mont., July 14.\n</p>\n<p>\n At Great Falls the Missouri River becomes\n magnificent. A vastly entertaining volume might\n be written concerning the moods and humors, the\n tricks and the manners of this incomprehensible\n stream. Now it is bright, sparkling and shallow,\n bouncing and skipping over pebbles and rocks as\n gayly as a mountain brook. Now it is swift,\n dark and deep, like a mill-race moving into action.\n Now it is utterly sleepy and dull, and looks and\n behaves for all the world like a weary beauty\n when the hall is over and the damp night air has\n straightened out her bang. Now it is filthy,\n odorous of marsh, aud despicably muddy. Now\n it is meaner and more treacherous than an army\n mule, and given over to low tricks and deliberate\n schemes to ground everything that floats upon it.\n The like of this river is not elsewhere to be found,\n and some of its qualities are certainly unworthy of\n emulation. But when it becomes magnificent, it\n does so \u201c in great shape,\u201d and in this respect as\n in others it has no parallel. Niagara is more\n awfully grand, the Yellowstone is sublimer, the\n Yosemite takes its long leap with a dainty grace\n and a serene confidence that give it a solitary\n place among the waterfalls ; but the Missouri rages\n and frets and battles with its environment with\n that peculiar individuality which characterizes all\n its many movements. It seems to have the human\n quality of thought and motive.\n</p>\n<p>\n From the point at which the three\n forks of the Missouri meet, the stream\n runs rapidly. Its course is through a mountain\n and prairie region of great beauty, and, as it\n bends, stretches of open country and rocky moun-\n tain heights are suddenly developed, affording\n constantly many novel and delightful surprises.\n As it approaches the new town of Great Falls, a\n city scarcely three years old, the river bottom\n declines precipitately, and for ten miles there\n is a steady and rapid fall. In those ten miles\n the river drops 500 feet, with a movement of vast\n spirit and power. There are three distinct\n cataracts, one of 26 feet, another, about n mile\n further, of 48 feet, and a third of 9? feet. Lewis\n and Clark discovered the Falls of the Missouri\n when they journeyed under President Jefferson\u2019s\n orders overland from Louisville to the Pacific\n Coast. They named each of the cataracts, calling\n the first one they approached\u2014 for they travelled\n up the stream and had reached that confusing\n region where you say \u201c down North\u201d and \u201c up\n South\u201d\u2014 calling the first one Great Falls, the\n second Rainbow Falls, and the third Black Eagle\n Falls. Three years ago the country was just as\n Lewis aud Clark saw it in 1804. The savage\n Blackfeet still prowled over mountain and prairie\n and scarcely a sign of civilization anpeared above\n the earth. Three years I Only think of it ! Now\n upon three railroads daily trains arc running into\n a city of nearly 3.000 people, and the country\n for a hundred miles around is taken op by farm-\n ers whose golden grain nods and glistens upon\n 20.000 acres. The three years\u2019 historv of Great\n Palls is one of the most marvellous tales that\n Western settlement can boast of.\n</p>\n<p>\n L. E.

All such representations are\n mistaken. This is a subject to which I have\n given especial attention. My trip through tlies \u25a0\n Territories has been limited only by their bound-\n ary r lines, and has taken me into every settled\n region from St. Paul to the Pacific Coast. Con-\n cerning the character of the population I am not\n in the least afraid to anticipate the census. The\n great bulk of the people are American-born.\n The largest element came from the older Western\n States, particularly Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Mis-\n souri, and Michigan. The second element, in\n respect of size, came from the South. You hear\n constant expressions of surprise from Northwestern\n travellers at the number of South-\n ern men who have settled here,\n particularly in Montana and Washington,\n arad yet it need surprise no one. After the war\n enterprising Southern men could not be satisfied\n at home. Their country was laid fearfully low.\n They had nothing to do and nothing to get. They\n were compelled to migrate somewhere, and natu-\n rally they came West. Thousands flocked direct\n into Montana, where gold had just been discov-\n ered. They came from St. Louis up the Missouri\n river to Benton, and then across the country to\n Bannaclc. Deer Lodge, Virginia City and Helena.\n Another host went out to Nevada and California,\n a ' ntl of these a considerable party worked their\n way northward along the coast into Oregon and\n Washington. The third element is composed of\n young people from Pennsylvania, New-York and\n New- bin gland, who came in with the Northern\n Pacific Railroad. Fully half of these are college-\n bred men. It will interest you to learn that there\n is a Harvard Association in Montana and Wash,\n ington. Actually ' there are enough young men\n out here who have been graduated from this one\n university to justify the formation of an exclusive\n society. It would be safe to bet that as large a\n proportion of the population of Washington Ter-\n ritory are college graduates as of the State of\n Pennsylvania. In every one of these Western\n towns there is a society as serasitive of the refine-\n ments of life as any society in the East. A shrug\n of the shoulders is the politest reply that can be\n made to the person who would venture to deny '\n this proposition.\n</p>\n<p>\n Foreigners will be bound to occupy the fourth\n place in the stratification of Northwestern society ' .\n But if they occupied the second, or the first; if.\n indeed, they constituted a clear majority of the\n people, as they actually do in certain communi-\n ties, there would be no cause whatever for alarm.\n Castle Garden receives a large body of ignorant\n and vicious creatures from the semi-barbaric regions\n of Central Europe, but that is not the class of\n foreigners who come into the Far West and\n 6et about digging and planting and raising wheat\n and making themselves homes. The bad and\n worthless and dangerous foreigner doesn\u2019t plough.\n He stays in New-Y T ork City, or moves into the con-\n genial atmosphere of Chicago and drinks beer. He\n has no use for the activity of new countries.\n There are thousands of Scandinavians, Germans,\n Russians and Swiss in the two Dakotas, and a\n large number in Mod tana and Washington. If\n more of the same sort want to come, they will\n receive a cheerful welcome. They bring wealth\n and industry with them, and you may make sure\n they are willing enough to leave behind all that\n is offensive to our republican methods and ways\n of thinking. They have had their abundant full\n of kings and standing armies and hard times.\n</p>\n<p>\n Trust them for knowing when they are well off, '\n and for reaching an accurate conclusion as to why\n they are well off in free America.

Nature has created\n tew spots more obviously designed for the site of\n a , populous town. The river is there with all\n that a great river means. The water power is\n there, available easily and to an extent altogether\n without precedent. The agricultural country is\n there, millions of acres, much of which is bein < -\n cultivated without irrigation. The mineral lands\n are there, full of gold, silver, lead and copper\n The timber and the coal are there, and what else\n could he required to make a city great and\n wealthy? The two upper falls are, of course\n far too great for any practical use. Their scenic\n attractiveness will be their chief service to the\n town. But the lower falls and the rapids will\n furnish at least a million horse-power, and it can\n be utilized for twenty miles along both sides of\n the river. Plans have already matured, and will\n soon be put into effect for the construction of a\n series of locks and dams intended to restrain the\n water and turn it to commercial account. A\n wonderful natural curiosity which may hereafter\n prove of the highest material advantage is a\n giant spring of the clearest, purest water rising\n among the rocks on the hank of the river just\n below the Black Eagle Falls. The spring is higher\n than the river, and well surrounded by a natural\n wall of roclv, over which at various points its\n waters tumble into the Missouri. It is believed\n to be the mouth of a vast subterranean river, and\n engineers estimate the flow to he equal to that of at\n stream a foot, deep and 200 feet wide. The time\n will come when this crystal spring, which is loss\n Than two miles from the city, will furnish thd\n municipal water supply.\n</p>\n<p>\n The farming region surrounding Great Falls\n extends for many miles toward every point of\n the compass. West of the Missouri is the Sun\n River Valley, a well-watered prairie country,\n where the soil is unbroken by rocks and the land\n unconfined by hills until the Rocky range, sixty\n miles distant, is reached. Within the basin formed\n by the Sun River on the south and Teton River\n oh the north lie 275,000 acres of excellent farming\n lands.

Lakes have been secured tor storage\n purposes, and ditches are being run up and\n down, around and across the whole valley.\n To the east of the city lies the famous Judith\n basin, a semi-circular valley extending in long*\n smooth slopes from the Rig Snowy Mountains,\n which afford it a score ot little creeks that teed\n its main river. The soil ot this valley is already\n distinguished for its productiveness, and it has\n become a grain-raising section ot much importance\n in the agricultural assets ot Montana. North of\n Great Fails is the immense prairie country until\n recently held as an Indian reservation. Two years\n ago it was thrown open lor settlement, and. im-\n mediately the Manitoba Railroad, searching for a\n route to the western coast, pushed its line tlirough\n the heart of the country, from the Devils Lake\n region ot Lakota to Great Falls. A considerable\n portion of the land was promptly taken up by\n settlers, but millions ot acres, largely unsurveyeu,\n are still awaiting entry. This country is in all\n respects similar to that lying north ot it in the\n British possessions, where the No- 1 hard wheat,\n the wheat ot the Red River Valley, is being surely\n and steadily grown. The raintall comes along\n in that portion ot the spring and summer when\n it is needed to mature the crops, and undoubtedly\n this vast country will soon be converted into a\n grainiield.\n</p>\n<p>\n Already the coalfields around Great Falls are\n being developed. They extend along the base of\n the Belt Mountains tor sixty miles or more, and\n reach westward tor thirty miles, tlirough what\n is curiously misnamed the band Coulee, almost\n into the city limits of Great Falls. The coal is\n an excellent bituminous product, and it runs in\n a vertical vein of from six to nine feet in thick-\n ness between two shale bands. About 300 tons\n a day are being taken from one mine owned by\n the Manitoba Railroad people, and their locomotives\n use it entirely. Some of it is said to possess the\n coking quality, and it this be true the smelters\n at Great Falls will find their chief dilliculty\n surmounted. The smelting plant is a complete\n and extensive institution, capable of taking the\n ores directly from the mines and reducing them\n to matte. It is supplied with all the work it\n can do, running, albeit, day and night, by the\n rich mines of Neihart and the Coeur d\u2019Alenes.\n</p>\n<p>\n L. E.

They\n assure themselves that Montana will organize as\n a Democratic State, will elect a Democratic Gov-\n ernor and Congressman, and a Democratic Legis-\n lature which will send two Democratic Senators to\n Washington. After carefully studying the politi-\n cal situation here, historically as well as with\n relation to the temper of the people upon the\n current topics, I do not believe they will do any\n one of those things. Nothing that has occurred\n since the election of 1838 has proved that the\n</p>\n<p>\n Democrats have any more votes than they had\n then, when their candidate for Congress was buried\n under a majority of more than 5,000. It is true\n that Montana theretofore had always been a Demo-\n cratic Territory, and for twenty-five years had\n been sending Democratic delegates to Washington.\n Its first settlers were mostly Democrats. Flocks\n of them from Missouri came up the river with\n every Fort Benton boat as the war was closing, and\n won for themselves in the very first Congressional\n contest that occurred after the Territory was\n organized a description which has clung to them\n ever since. Colonel Wilbur F. Sanders was lead-\n ing the Republican forlorn hope, and he created\n much amusement by protesting on the stump\n against the invasion of Montana \u201c by the left wing\n of Price\u2019s army.\u201d The Democratic paity is still\n known as \u201c Price\u2019s left wing,\u201d and, seeing that\n many of its members were actually engaged in tho\n Rebel army, it is surprising how they chafe under\n that allegation, and beg to know if the bloody\n shirt is ever to be waved. Treason played a large\n part in the early politics of Montana. The Stars\n and Stripes, long after the war was ended, were\n hooted at the Democratic mas -meetings and trailed\n in the dust at their parades. The miners in\n Alder Gulch actually voted to call their new\n setttlement Varina in honor of the wife of the\n Rebel President, and Varina it would have been\n but that the only notary in the camp was a Re-\n publican. He declined utterly to write it Varina,\n and at last Virginia City was accepted as a com-\n promise. When the murderous demon Ives was\n captured at Nevada City and summoned before\n the whole town to answer the charges of murder\n and robbery, the most important feature of his\n defence was the charge that Colonel Sanders,\n who was acting as prosecutor, had served in the\n Yankee Army. This was adroitly urged by Ives\u2019s\n friends, moving around among the crowd, in\n complete justification of his crimes.\n</p>\n<p>\n From the earliest days of Montana\u2019s settlement\n until 1883, migration into the Territory came from\n a southerly direction. The Missouri River fur-\n nished the only means of entry for many years,\n and when a second was finally obtained it was a\n railroad from Utah and the Union Pacific country.\n Not until the completion of the Northern Pacific\n line was the population of Montana increased by\n any considerable number of people in sympathy\n with Republican ideas. After that event, a new\n impulse was lent to everything, settlers came in\n from the Eastern States and from the great Re-\n publican commonwealths of Wisconsin, Minne-\n sota and Michigan. The valleys were filled up\n with an agricultural population. The cities and\n mining camps doubled and redoubled in size, and\n at one swoop the Democratic party was cut down.\n The Democratic leaders had foreseen this fatal\n blow.

That cir-\n cumstance did not in the least affect the Demo-\n cratic plans of an \" anti-corporation \" campaign.\n The Democrats were quite willing to prolit by the\n Northern Pacific ' s favor, and, at the same time to\n train their mock guns on capitalists. They shook\n their lists at AD. Oakes, at Henry Villard, at\n Charles Prancis Adams and at everybody else\n supposed to represent corporate strength. They\n made love to the Knights of Labor, and they\n elected their man by something like an old-time\n majority.\n</p>\n<p>\n Their happiness endured but for a season. The\n Republican leaders concluded that if the Demo-\n crats wanted a labor issue they should have it in\n dead earnest. Invents at Washington proceeded\n most fortunately for the Republican plan. The\n effect of the proposed A Li 11s bill upon Montana\n products, wool and lead, the course of the Ad-\n ministration with regard to local affairs, the pub-\n lic domain and the timber laws, together with the\n wise and liberal policy of the National Republican\n leaders, all combined to give the Montana Demo-\n crats all the labor issues they wanted. They\n chose for their candidate the successful chairman\n of their last campaign committee, W. A. Clarke,\n of Butte, justly esteemed their strongest and most\n available man. Mr. Clarke was an \u201c old-timer,\u201d\n a phrase of much significance here. The \u201c old-\n timers\u201d are those who came here before 1865, who\n organized the Territory and have consistently\n abided with it since. They have a social organ-\n ization of their own, and one of its functions is to\n protect the \u201c old-timers\u201d from the \u201c pilgrims\u201d and\n the tende ' rfeet. Mr. Clarke had come to Montana\n a day laborer and had dug millions from the\n mountains. He had educated himself. From an\n illiterate miner, he had become a cultivated\n millionaire, spealdng the modern languages and\n reading the ancient ones. He was a great em-\n ployer of labor, and in putting him forward the\n Democrats did their best. The Republican can-\n didate, Thomas H. Carter, was a lawyer. He had\n never been in politics. His residence in the\n Territory had endured for only eight\n years, and to thousands of voters he\n was a stranger. But for the begin-\n ning he made a powerful impression on the people.\n He refused to talk anything but principles. The\n Democrats, he said, had invited a labor campaign,\n and a labor campaign he meant to give them.\n It was a brilliant and exciting struggle, rendered\n all the more so by the great battle that was going\n on throughout the country. If the Republican\n tariff leaders in Congress had laid their plans\n with especial view to the capture of Alontana, if\n the platform adopted at Chicago and the Letter\n of Acceptance of General Harrison had both been\n framed with this o.ne purpose, they could not\n have been more wisely shaped and expressed.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lead and wool were among the leading products\n of Montana. Tariff legislation affecting them\n touched ranchmen and miners both. The Mills\n bill put wool on the free list, and reduced the\n tariff on lead ore and lead dross from 1 1-2 cents\n a pound to 3-4 of a cent, and on lead bar from\n 2 cents to 1 1-4 cents. It did not take the ranch-\n men and their herders long to figure out where\n they would be left by the reduction of wool to\n the free list. Sheep husbandry would be at once\n destroyed\u2014 blotted out! No possible way could\n be found of admsting the wages of herders to the\n scale that would be necessary if the business were\n pursued in competition with the wool-grower of\n Australia and South America, Herders in Mon-\n tana were intelligent Americans earning from\n $30 to $40 a month and their board. Herders in\n South America were either slaves or semi-bar-\n barians, for whoso labor SI o a month was a high\n price. In Australia the price of that labor did\n not go above SI 0, while in both countries it\n went as low as $2 50, and averaged less than\n $7. Moreover, in both those favored lan^s. o\u2122n t .\n ing obtained the year around, while in Montana\n it was necessary to store hay for the winter\n</p>\n<p>\n season, and to corral the sheep when the weather\n became severe. The question with the Montana\n wool-growers, then, was whether they should\n vote in favor of Mr. Clarice and help to ruin,\n an industry wherein they had $4o, 000,000 in-\n vested, or in favor of Air. Carter and in aid of\n their business interests. They had seen their\n business suffering since the Alills bijl was pro-\n posed. Woollen goods manufacturers were waiting\n the outcome of the election before purchasing\n supplies. Every ranchman in Aioutana felt that\n Democratic success meant personal disaster.\n</p>\n<p>\n The miners, too, were equally alarmed. Not\n only those engaged in producing lead, but all others\n as well, recognized that the Democratic plan struck\n directly at their incomes. Their principal com-\n petitors in mineral production were the miners of\n Spain and Mexico, where labor was worth only\n from 30 to 60 cents a day. The Alontana miner\n commanded S3 50 a day. His earnings enabled\n him to possess his own home, to dress his family\n neatly and well, to supply his table with good\n things and plenty of them, and to send his children\n to school. As one walks about the streets of\n Butte City he is quickly impressed with the\n respectable appearance of the thousands of miners\n he meets. They look like men, men of intelli-\n gence and independence, who know \u2022where their next\n meal is to come from and where they will find a\n bed to sleep in. They understood the situation\n perfectly. Whether they mined in gold at. Marys-\n ville or m copper at Butte, they knew that the lead\n men could not suffer without their suffering too.\n They saw that if the lead men were thrown\n out ot employment, the thousands of lead miners\n would at once be drawn into competition with\n the gold, silver and copper miners, and that the\n inevitable effect would be a reduction of wages\n all around. There could not be a surplus of\n labor without a fall in the price of labor. These\n tariff considerations changed many votes. The\n Democratic leaders had enough perception to see\n that such a result was sure to befall them, but\n what could they do ? They cursed the Adminis-\n tration and poor Mr. Mills, but curses could not\n make votes. They could only run away from the\n fight, or stand up and justify free trade. Some\n of them did run away, but for the most part they\n put on a bold face and tooted the free-trade\n bugle.\n</p>\n<p>\n Quite as embarrassing as this controversy was\n that into which they were forced by the course of\n Sparks. Mr. Cleveland\u2019s personal treatment of\n Western men and Western affairs was enough to\n insure his defeat from the Alissouri River to the\n Pacific Ocean. Even before he took office he felt\n called upon to issue a bull anathematizing silver,\n and thereafter with a consistency too steadfast to\n be the result of ignorance or of anything less ob-\n jectionable than a set purpose, he played directly\n into foreign hands. When he took office silver\n was worth $110 an ounce. When he left office it\n was worth but 94 cents. A silver dollar had\n been depreciated even further. If he had acted\n under contract with the British Cabinet he could\n not have served it better. England fixed the price\n of the Montana product and sold it to her Indian\n Government, making a profit on both transactions.\n She bought a dollar\u2019s worth of silver for less than\n a dollar and sold it to India for more than a dol-\n lar. She made millions out of Mr. Cleveland\u2019s\n silver policy, at the same time deprecating the use\n of silver as money and demoralizing its value even\n in our own bi-metallic system. There was nothing\n particularly clever about this on England\u2019s part.\n She simply took advantage of the opportunities\n Mi. Cleveland presented to her. His silver\n position, as I said before, was enough to defeat,\n him. hut what would have been efficient was made\n doubly sufficient by Sparks and his Land Office.\n If Sparks and Jonah had got. into the whale\u2019s belly\n together, no further demonstration against Nineveh\n would have heeu necessary. The whale\u2019s convulsion\n would have done the business.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sparks began his crusade by announcing through\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0068/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0068/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0068/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0068/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0068/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0068.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 706742}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"68\">\n<p>\n 66\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n all the Democratic and Mugwump newspapers that\n the Republicans had been villanously extrava-\n gant, and had been employing at least twice as\n many clerks in the Land Office as were needed.\n Without waiting till he had become acquainted\n with the business oi ' his bureau, he began to make\n sweeping discharges. He turned out half of tbe\n force in the mineral department, and at once there\n was trouble. Sales ol land and mining claims wert\n all the while increasing in volume, but the force\n was not ahle to keep up with the work. Parties\n who made proof in full compliance with the law\n three years ago are only now beginningto get their\n patents. These delays caused an amount of anuoy-\n once and financial loss difficult for Eastern people\n to appreciate. But it was in his timber rulings\n that Sparks created the greatest havoc. The law\n ot Congress protides that timber may be cut and\n used from the mineral lands ot the public domain\n for mining and other necessary purposes. The\n minerals are, of course, in the mountains. The\n mountains are covered with trees. To render\n the mines safe for men to work in they must\n be carefully protected by substantial roofs ana\n walls of wood, and an enormous amount of timber\n is required for that purpose. The timber on\n the mountains, of course, is the timber everybody\n uses, and that is the only use to which such\n timlier could possibly be put. It had been held\n by the Arthur Administration that all mountain\n lands in Montana were mineral lands, and that\n left the miners and settlers free to take the\n wood wherever they found it. It gave them a\n plentiful supply, and still left the mountains\n black witb pine trees. Sparks, however, reversed\n all this. He took a view of tbe law first\n promulgated by Carl Schurz when he was Mr.\n Hayes ' s Secretary of the Interior, a view that\n led to a quarrel with Sir. Blaine, to Schurz\u2019s\n defeat by Mr. Blaine, to the undying love of all\n Montanans for Mr. Blaine and Schurz\u2019s hatred\n of Sir. Blaine. Schurz. in the spirit of a prince-\n ling dealing with his peasants, made the Govern-\n ment a hucksterer of wood. He held that mineral\n lands were only those particular spots in which\n minerals had actually been feund, and that\n any one who took timber from other places with-\n out paying the Government for it should be prose-\n cuted as a thief. Sir. Blaine subjected this ruling\n to merited ridicule and contempt. The miners\n and settlers, he held, who were out here at the\n peril of their lives reducing the wilderness and\n adding wealth to the Nation, ought to be helped\n in every possible 1 way and not harrassed by such\n eilly annoyances. He showed that the\n United States surveys and maps pre-\n pared by sin lied surveyors and engineers\n who had studied the country classified all moun-\n tainous regions in tbe far West as mineral land.\n Mineral land, said Mr. Blaine, is all land that is\n more valuable for mining than for agricultural\n purposes. This is without question the true\n view to take. The mountains are rocky and\n rugged, and of no value whatever save for the\n minerals they contain and the timber upon them.\n The best use to which the timber can he put is\n in getting the minerals out. Law and reason both\n support and justify the demand of the miners and\n settlers that they be permitted to take the timber\n as they need it. and Mr. Blaine secured the pass-\n age of an amendment to the Interior Department\u2019s\n Appropriation hill providing that none of the\n money granted should be used to prosecute actions\n based on the cutting of timber by actual set-\n tlers.\n</p>\n<p>\n This action threw Mr. Schurz upon the side\n track, as it were, and furnished him convinc-\n ing proof of Mr. Blaine\u2019s desperate wickedness.\n IBut when Sparks started again upon the same\n petty policy, Mr. Blaine was in private life and\n he had a free rein. Spies weTe sent out to prowl\n around the mountains for evidence against all\n persons who had cut a stick of wood except upon\n their own claims, and hundreds of suits were\n brought against poor fellows whom a\n</p>\n<p>\n lawyer\u2019s fee would have beggared. A single one\n of these cases will illustrate them all. A man\n named Clegg, who had been a farm laborer m\n Hlinois, having saved about $50, came out into\n this country with his wife and children ana\n started a little farm under the shadow of the Big\n Horn Mountains. The country around him was\n an utter wilderness, the abomination of desolation\n spoken of by the Prophet. His nearest neighbor\n was twenty-five miles away. The nearest lawyer\n was ninety miles away, but Indians and mountain\n hons, wolves and bears he had ever with him. So\n far as his untutored mind knew, he was doing a\n laudable act. He thought he was carrying the\n banner of his country into the for-\n bidden wilderness and making the wild\n places tame, saying with Tennyson,\n \u201c More life and fuller, tiiat I want.\u201d He saw for\n 10,000 leet above him and for 3o0 miles around\n him nothing but pine trees and stones. He took a\n few of the rocks and a few of the trees from the\n mountain slopes and built him a cabin and a\n stable, a place to hold his grain and his\n roots. , , ,\n</p>\n<p>\n Well, one fine morning a spruce young fellow, with\n a long cigar, came by on horseback and stopped,\n as he said, for rest. Air. Clegg and Mrs. Clegg and\n all the little Cleggs, overjoyed at the sight of a\n white face, bade him come in, cooked liim a din-\n ner, spread for him their whitest sheets and gave\n him welcome. He asked many questions, and\n pressed Clegg particularly to know where he had\n got the timber with which to build his cabin aud\n nis little outhouses. Clegg told him, ol course.\n Why not? Whereupon tUe spruce young man,\n suddenly becoming awful, informed Mi-. Clegg that\n he was a desperate thief, that he had robbed the\n poor Government, of whose avenging power he, the\n spruce young man, was the mighty and terrible\n impersonation. Mr. Clegg was thoroughly fright-\n ened, and Mrs. Clegg and the little Cleggs began\n to cry. They implored the spruce young man, in\n whom the oh ended majesty of the United States\n was vested, to forgive them. They said they\n didn\u2019t know it was wicked to cut two or three out\n of ten million trees. He said he would take down\n their statement in writing and see what he could\n do for them. They said they couldn\u2019t write, but\n the young man was a gifted young man and\n he could. He put down it all iii his own words,\n That 1, John Clegg, had feloniously taken from the\n non-mineral lands of the United ' States so many\n feet of timber, and then he told Clegg he\n was a notary, and bade him swear to\n</p>\n<p>\n the affidavit. So Mrs. Clegg brought\n</p>\n<p>\n in the lamilv Bible, and Clegg tremblingly made\n oath to what the clerkly young man had written.\n In ike course ol time, the United States Govern-\n ment made Clegg defendant in a suit for damages,\n and dragged him ninety miies from his mountain\n home before an avenging court. Heaven only\n knows bow often he had to make the journey, or\n what solicitude and tears witnessed his goings and\n comings. But when at last it came to trial and\n his lawyer, having had him swear to a statement\n claiming that the mountain slopes from which he\n took the timber were mineral lands, and therefore\n open to the settler\u2019s axe, put that statement in\n evidence, up jumps the sardonic young man with\n Clegg\u2019s former affidavit, the one his own deft finger ' -\n had constructed, and proves poor Clegg not only\n an atrocious robber, but a barefaced perjurer!\n Of course, that was all the good it did him, for\n the jury\u2019s verdict in this, as in every other case\n Sparks and his followers had the nerve to bring\n to trial, was a disdainful rebuke to the Govern-\n ment.\n</p>\n<p>\n The incident I have narrated, which was one of\n hundreds, serves to throw light upon the wonderful\n change that took place in public sentiment in Mon.\n tana during the four years of Democratic ascend-\n ancy.

They\n have already seen the material wisdom of the\n course they then pursued, and the difference be-\n tween the two parties in their respect for plighted\n words. The Democratic platform of 1884 promised\n ..home rule to the Territories, a promise which\n Mr. Cleveland repeated and emphasized in his\n letter of acceptance.

President Harrison has kept religiously to\n his party\u2019s promise. Every Montana commission\n thus far issued has been made out to a Montana\n man. The attitude of the party and of the Presi-\n dent, as indicated in the Chicago platform and in\n the letter of acceptance, with regard to the silver\n question, is a source of great satisfaction to the\n entire West. Undoubtedly this is the most\n troublesome question standing between the two\n sections of our country. The West is not un-\n reasonable.

In their endeavor\n to bring their sure majorities where they would\n be mcst effective and useful, an exceeding\n crooked lot of district boundary lines were made\n The peril in which their scheme stood was a rel\n versal at the hands of Governor White and his\n Republican co-officers. To prevent this, Con-\n troller Durham of the Treasury Department at\n Washington, a holding-over Democrat who was\n ev idently permitted to hold over too long, issued\n an order to the Democratic Secretary in Helena\n directing that he should retain his office until\n his successor\u2019s bond had been approved by Dur\n ham. On the whole, they managed their game\n well. It required a peremptory order from the\n President himself to get out the Democratic\n Secretary, and when that was accomplished the\n time had gone by within which it was possible\n under the law to reform the Territorial districts\n</p>\n<p>\n The Republicans, though considerably annoyed\n at finding themselves the victims of a contemptible\n piece of sharp practice, were naturally the less\n disposed to fight about it because in the last\n election they had carried twenty-three of the\n twenty-five districts in which the Democrats had\n shaped the State, and they had no doubt of their\n ability to do it again. They did not think it\n possible for the Democrats so to fix the State\n as to prevent a Republican majority in the Con-\n vention. This feeling of over-confidence was\n the thing that really defeated the Republicans.\n Despite the fact that Springer\u2019s dishonestly partisan\n bill gave the Democrats outright twenty-five\n seats in the convention, and despite the trickery\n by which the Territory was divided, the Repub-\n licans would still have won had they got out\n their votes. They did not work while their\n adversaries exerted all possible effort. Only fifty\n per cent of the November vote was cast in May,\n and the result gave the Democrats a majority of\n five. No serious consequences are apprehended\n by the Republicans by reason of tin ' s situation.\n It is unfortunate just at this particular time, but\n by no means should it alarm the Republicans\n of the country. Its worst effect will be the\n maintenance of the obnoxious principle of\n minority representation. The Democracy will\n hang oh to that like grim death, for it affords\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0070/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0070/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0070/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0070/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0070/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0070.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 735037}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"70\">\n<p>\n 68\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n them their only hope of securing a majority in the\n first Legislature.

Ex-Governor Hauser, Colonel Broad-\n water, .Marcus Daly, W. A. Clarke, Dr. Mitchell,\n \u201c Sam\u201d Wood-all prominent candidates for the\n United States Senate\u2014 are all men of great wealth.\n The millionaire bankers and miners of . Montana\n are Democrats, and their method, whether in\n politics or in business, is the simple method of\n how-much-does-it-take ? They are all large\n employers of labor, and they have never allowed\n any delicate sensibility to stand in the way of\n their knowing how their men vote. Mindful of this\n Democratic proclivity, the last Territorial Legisla-\n ture adopted a registration law and the\n Australian system of voting, and it is under this\n system that the election in October will be con-\n ducted. There is a vein of intellectuality and\n independence among the miners of Montana which\n will be a potent factor in the contest, especially\n when it is thus protested against the warping in-\n fluence of rich and selfish employers.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Democratic leaders are not, it must be said,\n on very good terms with each other. They are all\n rivals in business and in politics. Several of\n them do not speak as they pass by. They are\n divided by geography as well as sentiment. They\n all live either in Helena or in Butt.e. Helena is\n on the east side of the main Rocky range, Butte\n on the west. It has been the policy of the\n Helena millionaires to minimize and humiliate\n Butte, to circulate the impression that it is a\n suburb of Helena and a mere mining camp,\n whereas it is no more a suburb of Helena than\n Philadelphia is a suburb of New-York. This\n business jealousy between the rich men of the\n two cities has jaundiced all their other relations,\n and they fuss and fight like a parcel of tomcats.\n In either town the situation is no better. The\n two greatest great men in Helena are Governor\n Hauser and Colonel Broadwater. Tim two\n greatest great men in Butte are Dalv and Clarke.\n The only time Hauser and Broadwater join hands\n is when they are raiding Daly and Clarke. The\n only time Daly and Clarke exchange soft glances\n is when they are thumping Hauser and Broad-\n water. The situation is. therefore, highly inter-\n esting. Mr. Hauser and Mr. Broadwater have\n each his lesser light. Ex-Delegate McGinnis, who\n has served in several Congresses, is fathered bv\n Broadwater. Mr. McGinnis calculates upon being\n the Democratic candidate for Governor and hones\n thence to be lifted into the Senate. The trouble\n with that is. he will come in conflict with the\n Colonel himself a\u00ab well as with every other promi-\n nent man in his party. Ex-Delegate Toole is Mr.\n Hauser\u2019s vounger partner in politics, and he. too,\n esteems himself the most available candidate for\n the Governorship, and, of course, for later and\n higher honors. At the recent election for members\n of the Constitutional Convention, Mr. Toole and\n Mr. McGinnis ran on the same ticket. The feeling\n between them was not improved bv that experi-\n ence. It is openly and hotly charged by the\n friends of McGinnis that he was cut bv the\n Hauser-Toole following, so that it might appear\n that Toole was the more popular man. and. ergo,\n the safer candidate for Governor. The returns\n certainly show that McGinnis ran far behind\n Toole in a district where he would\n naturally have led the ticket. Mr.\n Hauser, though appointed Governor for a brief\n term by Cleveland, distinguished himself by rising\n in open rebellion against the Administration as\n to its free -trade policy, and even more particularly\n as to S paries. This renders him all the more\n</p>\n<p>\n popular, however, and gives him a handle upon\n which Mr- Broadwater will have difficulty to\n break his grip.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another great Democrat on the east side of the\n range is the Hon. Sam. Wood, whose fame is\n chiefly identified with a place called Camos Prairie.\n When Chief Joseph, undoubtedly the greatest\n Indian warrior-general that ever lived, whose\n famous fighting retreat over 1,500 miles of wilder-\n ness rivals the march of Caesar through Gaul,\n had reached the mountains of Montana, a volunteer\n troop was formed in .Virginia City to co-operate\n with General Howard in opposing the Indians.\n Sir. Wood was a prominent member of this troop.\n One night the Indians made a break, and came\n with wildly resounding war-whoops pell-mell upon\n the volunteers. It is said there was a great\n scattering of amateur soldiery. In the campaign\n of 1888 Mr. Wood made a number of ferocious\n speeches, in one of which he brought charges\n against Mr. Carter, the Republican candidate.\n When anybody says rude things about Montana\n Republican it is always left to Colonel Sanders\n to reply. And in this instance the Colonel replied\n so heartily that Mr. Wood was moved to challenge\n him to mortal combat. The Colonel accepted the\n challenge publicly and announced the place of\n meeting and the weapons. \u201c We will fight,\u201d he\n said. \u201c on Camos Prairie, and my weapon shall\n be an Indian war-whoop.\u201d It is feared by Mr.\n Wood\u2019s friends that Camos Prairie and the war-\n whoop stand grimly between him and the Senate.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the west side of the range Mr. Clarke is un.\n doubtedly a powerful leader of the Democratic!\n host, and the most likely candidate for the Senate.\n His friends were sadly mortified at his defeat\n for Congress in 1888, and they will work the\n more zealously on that account to secure for him\n what he is said often to have declared to be the\n summit, of his ambition. His rivals include Dr.\n Mitchell, Washburne Stapleton, whose greatest\n drawback is his eminent respectability, and Mr.\n W. W. Dixon, frequently styled \u201c the frigid bar-\n rister of Butte.\u201d Dr. Mitchell is a strong man\n in his party. He is the sort of man who could\n go into a saloon in the earliest and rudest days\n without fear of insult,. A considerable part of\n his wealth has been derived as the keeper of a\n Territorial lunatic asylum, in which enterprise he\n has been continuously subsidized by public con-\n tracts. These westside tempters of political fort-\n une all stand as trembling supplicants for sym-\n pathy, support and favor in the presence of Mar-\n cus Daly. Mr. Daly is the manager and one of the\n four proprietors of the Anaconda mining inter-\n prise. The Anaconda Company owns the greatest\n and most, profitable mining plant in the world,\n and Mr. Daly, a big-brained Irishman, who began\n life in the West as a S3 miner, is the life of it\n all. He made the mine what it is, he established\n a smelting plant that is the wonder and admira-\n tion of mining experts, he founded a city, and is\n to-day the head and front of a business that\n employs 5,000 men. Daly has been charged with\n unalterable fealty and treacherous conduct by\n prominent Democrats on both sides of the range,\n according as his indifference and aggressive sup-\n port happened from one election to another to\n affect their individual fortunes. In the present\n situation he keeps his own counsel and beyond\n announcing that he is not himself a candidate\n for the Senate or anything else, which is believed\n or not just as people prefer, he maintains an\n attitude of inscrutable reserve.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Republicans are not, troubled with ambitious\n and warring leaders. They are united, and in\n dead, aggressive earnest. The talk about Russell\n Harrison having compromised the situation by\n interferences of one kind or another is a ridiculous\n lie. As a lie it has utterly failed of its purpose.\n It was so persistently repeated, and with such\n particularity, that not knowing Mr. Harrison I\n at, first supposed there must be something in it.\n But the people \\ec\u00ab know him and they know\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0071/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0071/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 537, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 868}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0071/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1075, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1736}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0071/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3473}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0071/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0071.jp2", "height": 3473, "width": 2151, "levels": 6, "size": 384790}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"71\">\n<p>\n MONTANA.\n</p>\n<p>\n 69\n</p>\n<p>\n tbe etory to be absurdly false.

T\u201e July 26.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is conceded by geologists that all of our\n country west of the Rockies is comparatively new.\n The Pacific Ocean, some few ages ago, washed\n the western side of this mighty uplift. The\n Sierras of California and the Cascades of Wash-\n ington and Oregon attained their present eleva-\n tion after a series of subterranean struggles, and\n with them the vast areas now constituting our\n Pacific States were brought forth from watery\n confines. It has not been many years since the\n great volcanoes of the Cascade Range ceased to\n Bhow signs of internal agitation. There are\n people now living in Portland who claim to have\n seen smoke issuing from the crater of Mount Hood\n at one time or another within the last ten years.\n But these lofty peaks are practically extinct.\n They are responsible, actively or passively, for\n almost all the physical conditions of the new\n State of Washington. In shape Washington is a\n parallelogram, its longer axis running east and\n west from the coast to the Idaho boundary. The\n Cascades cut it in twain. Maine does not more\n widely differ from California than do the sections\n thus created. They are different in soil, in\n climate, in vegetation and in the resources offered\n to human endeavor. The mountains condense the\n atmospheric moisture on their windward, or west-\n ern, side, producing for more than half the year\n a constant succession of rainfalls and a mighty\n forest that covers the country from the mountains\n to the sea, while the leeward land, deprived of\n moisture, is for many miles, or until relieved of\n its mountain blanket, a forlorn and dreary desert.\n West of the mountains the soil is a deep vegetable\n mould, produced by the decay of fallen timbers,\n with a top-dressing of alluvial deposit on the tide-\n lands of the coast. East of the mountains the\n soil is basaltic, while the desert area is one vast\n lava bed. West of the mountains the climate is\n mild, and the seasons are described with relation\n to the rainfall. East of the mountains the climate\n is colder, almost exactly like that of New-York,\n for, though higher in latitude, its natural severity\n is tempered by the warm Pacific winds.\n</p>\n<p>\n These differences between East Washington and\n West Washington need to be emphasized, for they\n affect the people in all their affairs. The in-\n terests of one section are rarely the interests of\n the other. All through this immense country I\n have been deeply impressed with the wonderful\n elasticity of our political system. From the 95th\n meridian to each of the boundary oceans is about\n</p>\n<p>\n j the same distance. A line drawn from that\n meridian, near the Dakotas, to the Pacific would\n j pass through four States. Drawn to the At-\n lantic it would pass through nine. In the matters\n } of climate and topography there are as many rea-\n sons for dividing the Western States into small com-\n monwealths as for so dividing the Eastern ones\n It is remarkable how harmoniously communities\n thus remotely placed from each other live under\n the same local government, and especially re-\n markable because every individual town is steadily\n and fiercely struggling in. furtherance of the\n common ambition to be the business centre of\n the State. Two great Western Cities, Denver and\n St. Paul, btand out as brilliant examples of what\n industry and sagacity can do, and every little\n liamiet burns witn the spirit of emulation, ibey\n ail have somebody in them who knew Denver and\n St. Paul when their only tenants were jack-\n rabbits and rattlers. Somebody is always talk-\n ing about the time when he was offered a third\n oi Denver or a half of St. Paul for the price of a\n bulialu robe. Somebody, as he lounges iu the\n hotel of an evening, is sure to be reminiscent of\n the days when be ranged his cattle in what ia\n now Kansas City, or sold the whole of Omaha\n lor a couple of cuyuses. These tales of wondrous\n chances to grow rich, had the tellers cl them but\n possessed the divine faculty of foreknowledge, are\n told by the million, and it must\n j be owned they are more or less disturbing.\n</p>\n<p>\n | When you look around and see from every pin-\n point of the compass a hundred large and thriv-\n ing cities that have grown up from a sagebrush\n prairie or a pine thicket within the last ten\n years it makes you wonder not a little whether\n the spot you happen to be standing on may not\n be an embryo metropolis, where the land you can\n buy to-day for $10 an sere might be sold to-mor-\n row lor $1,000 a front foot.\n</p>\n<p>\n Foi tunes have been made in Spokane Falls}\n are yet being made, upon just that scale of vajues.\n Spokane\u2019s history\u2014 oh, by the way, call it Spo-k-n,\n if you please, as though it rhymed with ban or\n tan, not with gain or lane, and put the accent\n on the last syllable\u2014 Spokane\u2019s history, as I was\n saying, is almost incredible. When Mr. Hayes\n was inaugurated it was a blank wilderness. Not\n 1 a single civilized being lived within a hundred\n 1 miles of it. One day in 1878 a white man came\n along in a \u201c bull team,\u201d saw the wild rapids and\n j the mighty falls of the Spokane River, reflected\n on the history of St. Paul and Minneapolis with\n their little Falls of St. Anthony, looked at the\n tide of immigration just turning toward the fur-\n ther Northwest, and concluded he would sit right\n down where he was and wait for a city to grow\n around him. This far-sighted pioneer is still liv-\n ing within earshot of those rumbling falls, and\n they make a cheerful music to him. The city is\n there with him, 22,000 people, and he can draw a\n check to-day good for $1,000,000. For several\n years his eyes fell on nothing but gravel beds and\n foamy waters. Now as he looks around he sees\n mills and factories, railroad lines to the north,\n south, east and west, churches, theatres, school-\n houses, costly dwellings and stores, paved streets,\n and all that makes living easy and comfortable.\n The greater part of this has come within his\n vision since 1883, when the Northern Pacific blew\n its first whistle in Spokane. But even\n then there was quite a village. After\n this earliest pioneer had spent a lonely\n year or two on his homestead two other men\n came along. They were friends who, upon an\n outing, had chanced to meet.

They soon had their reward. It came\n with the railroad. Into Spokane, as into every\n other town along this route, great or small, the\n Northern Pacific has introduced a stream of settle-\n ment. It was well taken care of. The mer-\n chants were quickly provided with store-houses,\n rental values were kept low, every inducement\n was offered that could possibly stimulate building\n activity, and in three years the farming country\n was made to perceive that, Spokane was its natural\n point of entry and of shipment. The turbulent\n waters of the Spokane River, a clear and beauti-\n ful mountain stream, were caught above the falls\n and directed wherever the factories and mills\n that had been established above them required\n their services. Four large flouring mills quickly\n took advantage of the rich opportunity growing\n out of this unique situation. From two enormous\n agricultural areas they are enabled to draw their\n supplies of grain, flour, therefore, beinjr manu-\n factured for the farmers more cheaply at Spokane\n than anywhere else. This circumstance alone ex-\n ercised a large influence in giving the new town a\n hold upon the country districts. These consti-\n tute more than a region\u2014 they are really a grand\n division of the State, and form what is known as\n the Great Plain of the Columbia River. Grim and\n unpromising as is the aspect presented by this\n high plateau, it is really one of the chief agri-\n cultural districts of the Pacific States. It ex-\n tends from Walla Walla northward along the\n Spokane River to the Idaho line, and is bounded\n on the south by the Oregon line. Its southern\n portion, known as the Palouse Valley, was par-\n tially settled many years ago. but the northern,\n or Great Bend country, has only known the touch\n of the plomrh and harro\u2019w since the arrival of the\n Northern Pacific Railroad. This great plateau to-\n day contains a population of not less than 60,000,\n scattered over an area of 20,000 square miles.\n</p>\n<p>\n Every kind of crop is grown upon the plain,\n though its greatest staple is wheat. A moderate\n estimate of the yield is twenty-five bushels to the\n acre. The cost of producing it certainly cannot\n exceed twenty-five cents a bushel. Farmers who\n hire all their labor, whose personal relation to\n their agricultural enterprises is merely that of\n overseer, show me their books, wherein it\n appears that they realize an average\n profit, of five dollars an acre for all the\n wheat they grow. Fertility is present here in as\n many phases as in other countries, and some of the\n land is quite arid: but on the whole there is a\n sufficient rainfall for the production of wheat\n over practically the entire plateau. Irrigation,\n which would be exceedingly difficult anyhow, ow-\n ing to the high altitude of the country above the\n water levels, is not deemed at all necessary. In\n a constantly growing measure the yield of this\n vast country is finding its best and largest market\n in Spokane. And now that the people of that\n town, by virtue of financial sacrifices which com-\n ment\u2019 most creditably upon their local patriotism\n and their courage, have secured a number of rail-\n road lines penetrating into the richer portions of\n the plain and connecting it with the two great\n Pacific trunk lines, they will have full control\n of all that is produced.\n</p>\n<p>\n Much sagacity has been shown by the people of\n Spokane in the ' railroad relations they have been\n enabled to establish. It would not be too much\n to say that to obtain these connections they have\n yielded up the entire profits of the last two years.\n A line is now rapidly being built directly across\n the State, connecting Spokane with Seattle and\n Seattle with the Canadian Pacific. Another line\n penetrating into Canada runs from Spokane along\n the Columbia River, through a valley rich in\n agricultural products, in minerals, in coal, and in\n timber, through to the Kootenai mining district\n in British Columbia. Another line extending\n southward, connects Spokane with the Union\n</p>\n<p>\n Pacific, and gives the city all the advantages\n that will proceed from intimate business relations\n with Denver and Salt Lake. Still a fourth line\n runs along the witching Coeur d\u2019Alene into the lead,\n and silver mines that have reached such a high\n and profitable state of development. These mines\n extend over a comparatively limited area. They\n are close together, and their ores, producing gold,\n silver and lead, are all similar. Their output\n for the last three years has been quite remarkable,\n and has placed the Coeur d\u2019Alene district among\n the foremost lead producing regions in the couu.\n try. Gold, associated with iron, and treated by\n the free-milling process, is largely found in the\n northern part of the district, but the greatest\n amount of tonnage is derived from, the southern\n country, where the galena silver mines, a dozen\n or more in number, have been discovered. That\n minerals in large quantity existed in this country\n has been known for years. But the want of\n railroad facilities for a long while prevented\n any serious effort to get at them. The matter\n of transportation is now laid at rest, and within\n the last three years a million dollars has been\n spent in development. The returns have already\n more than justified the investment.\n</p>\n<p>\n Tributary to Spokane and reached by the vari-\n ous railroads now in operation are five other min-\n ing districts, at Colville, Okanagan, Kootenai,\n Metaline, and Pend d\u2019Oreille. They are in various\n stages of development, but their wealth and avail,\n ability have been clearly ascertained. Spo-\n kane\u2019s population, in a degree greater than\n that of most all these new cities, consists^ of\n young men and young women from the New-Eng-\n land and Middle States. They have enjoyed a\n remarkable and wholly uninterrupted period of\n prosperity. Some of them have grown quickly\n and immensely rich from real estate operations,\n but the great majority have yet to realize on their\n investments because of the large sacrifices they\n have made in building up the city. They are to-\n day in an admirable position. As they have made\n money they have spent it; spent it in street rail-\n roads, in the laying-out of drives, in the building of\n comfortable h -uses, in the establishment of elec-\n trical plants, and in a large number of local im-\n provements, every one of which has borne its part\n in making the city attractive. I suppose that the\n pecnle of Spokane own a larger part of the taxable\n property in the city than is the case with the\n residents of any other town in the Northwest ex-\n cept Helena. Tuey are by no means unmindful\n of the advantages afforded them by foreign capi-\n tal, but they have not waited for it. They have\n gone right ah\u201c- > d and done for themselves. _ Their\n needs as to the city are still great and conspicuous. 1\n They need hotels; they need manufactories; they\n need wholesale houses, and. if one can judge from\n superficial appearances, a great variety of enter-\n piises might to-day be profitably established in this\n new community. Such of them as the people\n actually feel in need of they are willing to do much\n to obtain. In New-York, Boston and Philadelphia\n one hears a great many complaints about the want\n of opportunity for the safe and profitable invest-\n ment of capital. If the people who have capital\n only realized what they could do with it out here\n by wise and sensible operations, there would bo\n very little of that sort of complaint.\n</p>\n<p>\n Eastern Washington is going to be of itself a\n great State. It possesses in the ground and in the\n spirit of its people all the resources that are nec-\n essary to make a powerful and useful Common-\n wealth. Beyond the sea that washes its western\n shore it has a limitless market. Already its grain\n is being shipped to the Oriental countries, and the\n time is not far distant when Asia -will have been\n wrested as to its trade from the exclusive grasp of\n England, and when every single grain of wheat,\n corn and barley that is not needed for the home\n consumption of these people themselves will be\n sent from Puget Sound into the great markets of\n China and Japan.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0074/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0074/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0074/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0074/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0074/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0074.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 701367}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"74\">\n<p>\n 72\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n XXXHI.\n</p>\n<p>\n .

T., August 8.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is something the matter with the atmos-\n phere out here this season. For breathing pur-\n poses it is splendid, dry, cool and inspiring, but\n it seems to set everything on fire. Don\u2019t you re-\n member after the burning of Chicago how the\n scientific people used to figure up the abnormal\n percentage of electricity in the atmosphere on the\n plains of Hlinois; how they used to allege that\n spontaneous combustion was almost inevitable\n when such an extraordinary charge of electricity\n existed in the air ? There must be a condition\n similar to that in this country at the present time.\n Not only have three large, thriving cities been\n destroyed by fire, but it is estimated that more\n timber has been burned from the mountains during\n the past two months than has been cut by miners\n and settlers since the discovery of Alder Gulch\n and the settlement of Montana and Washington.\n The sun has not been clearly visible on account\n of the smoke in the air since the first of July,\n and on some days, though not a single cloud ob-\n scured the sky, the only appearance presented by\n the sun was that of a little red, round ball. How\n many million feet of timber have been destroyed\n it is impossible to calculate, but it has certainly\n been enough to supply the whole United States\n with firewood for the entire winter.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are many theories as to how forest fires\n begin, and all of them are probably correct. That\n is to say, the fires are started in a variety of ways.\n The Indians are criminally careless. During this\n season of the year they -js pend a great deal of time\n in the woods, and it is nothing to them whether\n the forests burn down or not. When they break\n camp they leave their fires burning on the ground\n and go heedlessly away. White men, in many in-\n stances, do the same thing. Sparks from engines,\n too, are the frequent agencies by which\n great and ruinous fires are started. Once well\n started, and under a good brisk wind, there is\n no way of stopping them. Vast quan-\n tities of timber grow upon the moun-\n tains between the rocks, where their opportunity\n to secure a good hold in the earth is poor and in-\n sufficient, and after they have attained a certain\n growth they fall. They rarely rot because the\n atmosphere is so dry, and, full of rosin, they lie\n there and become as dry as chips\u2014 just the fuel\n for which the advancing flames are looking. In\n their spectacular phase, forest fires are magnifi-\n cent. It almost seems as if they took deliberate\n aim at the monster trees and selected their victims\n as the sharpshooter, perched upon an eminence,\n selects his. They run along the ground and at-\n tack the trees from the bottom, soaring upward.\n They spring from branch to branch, consuming\n everything in their way, running in as many\n directions and with as many caprices as an elec-\n tric current. They produce a terrific heat which\n</p>\n<p>\n nothing can withstand, and against which it would\n require an army of men to conduct a successful\n battle.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the forests around Puget Sound extraordi-\n nary efforts are put forth, first to prevent and\n then to control the flames. A system of espionage\n is attempted whereby it is hoped to ascertain when\n fires break out, and gangs of men are sent into\n the burning district. They take positions in front\n of the fire at a considerable distance away, and\n as rapidly as possible they clear off the timber.\n Sometimes they burn it off. They employ every\n possible method to create or clear a space in the\n path of the advancing fire, so that when it\n reaches the clearing it will have nothing to feed\n on. This is a plan pursued in the forests of Ger-\n many and Switzerland ; but there men are abund-\n ant, and compared with these, the forests are\n small. Here it is impossible to procure a suffi-\n cient number of men to deal effectually with the\n catastrophe, and often before they are arrived and\n prepared to do anything thousands of the largest\n and finest trees in the Sound country are reduced\n to charred and useless masses. Memorials have\n been sent to Congress frequently in the hope that\n some Federal action would be taken under the di-\n rection of the Secretary of the Interior to protect\n the timber of the public lands from destruction,\n but they have not been accompanied by any use-\n ful suggestions. It has not been shown what\n Congress ceald do, or in wisdom should at-\n tempt to do. The forests are, however, the Na-\n tion ' s. They do not belong to these people out\n here, and certainly men cannot be expected to\n spend their fortunes protecting the property\n that belongs to somebody else. That something\n shjnld be done is plain enough.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Puget Sound country is old and well known.\n Its earliest settlers came to it from California,\n making their way northward along the Pacific\n Coast. They investigated the resources of the\n whole Territory west of the Cascade Mountains\n and have long known of its mineral deposits and\n its wonderful lumbering opportunities. Until the\n railroads came in, however, few people attempted\n to live and do business so many miles from mar-\n ket. Considerable coastwise trade in logs, boards\n and shingles had been created and several mills\n had been started along the Sound. To-day their\n name is legion. They are already doing a re-\n markable trade with China, Japan and Corea, and\n it is in the direction of the setting sun that the\n Teople of this country are looking for their future\n wealth. They exrect soon to monopolize the Rus-\n sian. Janane-e. Chinese and Indian trade that goes\n to the British and the Dutch. The importations\n of the Asiatic coast amount to about $300,000,000,\n the greater part of which is absorbed by England.\n The tendency cf this trade is already toward our\n Pacific Stages, and, with proner oceanic connec-\n tions, we should soon secure practically the whole\n of it. The saving in distance would of itself be\n decisive in our favor. The nature of Asiatic com-\n mercial demands is also in onr interest. It in-\n cludes such staples as canned goods, cheap cotton,\n flour, meats, lumber, agricultural implements and\n other mechanical devices. These are the things\n the Asiatics are buying, and these are the things\n in which Enclnnd cannot, comncte with us. All\n that is needed to bring the bulk of this trade to\n Puget, Sound is a sufficiently large fleet to handle\n it. The sentiment in Washington Territory in\n favor of protective shipping laws is therefore over-\n whelming. All the reonle ask is that, since Eng-\n tand gives such enormous bounties to her trans-\n pacific fleets, the United States shall at least make\n conditions even and equal, so far as to render it\n difficult for English shins to secure American\n goods as their freight. ITiey ask. in other words,\n that the transportation of American manufactures\n end produce shall he reserved for American bottoms\n by shipping laws that will place foreign vessels\n at a disadvantage.\n</p>\n<p>\n As ranidly ns the forests around Seattle are\n being cleared away the farmers are flocking in to\n improve the land.

Western Wash-\n ington is not, nor will it soon be, a crop-growing\n country. The timber that covers it, lor at least\n a century yet, must furnish to its people their\n chief means of support. The logging camps arc\n frequent throughout the timuer chstrict, anu they\n present a scene of strange activity. Monster logs,\n shot through a sort of trough down the mountain\n sides to a convenient point, are borne by bull teams\n to the camps, dressed and hurried oft to the mins\n on the bound. The logman\u2019s axe is a discriminat-\n ing tool, it does not take ordinary timber ; it\n looks lor trees only of the iinest quality, of the\n rarest straightness and of tne greatest power.\n These, shipped under the common name of Oregon\n pine, are sent into every part of the habitable\n world. They furnish masts to the shipbuilders of\n England, of Trance, of Northern Af rica, and even of\n Spanish and Southern America. They are shipped\n in great numbers to Chili, and hundreds are sent\n every year straight across the Pacific into the\n lands of the Orient. The substructure of this\n country is a coal formation, which in many places\n has been profitably worked. And the coal mines\n of West Washington to-day afford a large part of\n the people\u2019s revenues. They spread over a consider-\n able territory, within which from fifteen to twenty\n workable mines have been found. Some of them\n are line and hard, with a sufficient surplus of car-\n bon to entitle them to be called anthracite. Some\n -of them are fair bituminous coals, while others\n must be classed, for want of a better term, as lig-\n nite. A few of them will coke admirably. The\n value of this discovery is not easily appreciated\n unless one lives in a mining country, where the\n great smelters eat up coal and coke at so fearful\n a rate. The heaviest expense of a smelter is for\n coke, and when a coal is found that can be con-\n verted into a good, fair coke it is as much prized\n as a new gold mine. The depth of the coal seams\n intc the earth is known in many cases to be as\n much as 15,000 feet, and as there are no less than\n eight large coal groups, or coal fields, in Washing-\n ton, the people feel comparatively safe as to the\n extent of their fuel supply. Large bodies of iron\n ore, one of them possessing a magnetic quality, are\n ound in the Cascade Mountains, and several of then\n are already being worked at an elaborate profit.\n That large bodies of iron suitable to the manu-\n facture of steel are in existence in the Cascade\n Mountains, and require merely a test of the pro-\n cesses by which the ore can be saved with little\n waste of tailings, is an undoubted and a very com-\n forting fact. It is not thought that any consid-\n erable quantity of the more precious metals he\n in paying quantities in the Cascades, but a con-\n tinual and unfailing fortune is assured to the State\n by the discoveries already made of iron and coal.\n</p>\n<p>\n Washington is rich in natural resources, is\n fortunate in climate, and is particularly fortunate\n in situation. This American Mediterranean on\n which Seattle and Tacoma stand, of itself offers\n advantages of commerce too great and far-reach-\n ing to be estimated yet. Seattle was the first of\n the Puget Sound cities to appreciate what might\n be accomplished in foreign commerce, and she still\n holds a commanding position in the great struggle\n after Oriental wealth. The disaster she met with\n a few months ago, while it dealt a cruel blow to\n her people, has not been felt as any great obstacle\n to their progress. Rapidly the city is being built\n anew. No appreciable fraction of her population\n has been lost. Money has been plentifully sup-\n plied from New-York and other Eastern cities\n with which to rebuild the town, and it will rise\n within another year to a commercial, a social, a\n political and a municipal eminence that it has\n never held before. But for the fire, some people\n sav, the census of 1890 would have shown 35,000\n inhabitants in the city limits of Seattle. It will\n</p>\n<p>\n probably not show less than that anyhow, and at\n the rate of growth possible to a town containing so\n much energy and self-confidence and surrounded\n by so many natural opportunities, Seattle will\n prove herself before the present generation has\n passed away to be a second San Francisco.\n</p>\n<p>\n L.

Only upon the mountains, in-\n deed, and along the river courses does he find\n natural timbers of any kind, and these are con-\n fined to a few cottonwoods and scrub willows\n where the water flows, and upon the mountains\n to gnarled and knotty pines. Few realize how\n fond they are of the natural charms that beautify\n their homes until they visit distant places where\n those charms are denied them. Then they are\n astonished to discover away down in their hearts\n a variety of sweet and tender sentiments, of the\n existence of which they had scarcely a suspicion.\n Then they begin to realize what Paine meant when\n he sang of his lowly thatched cottage and of the\n birds singing sweetly that came at his call. They\n 6ee lots of lowly thatched cottages, but the\n vegetation around them is strange. It lacks the\n bright green that so greatly beautifies and adorns\n their own lowly thatched cottages.

Hut until i saw Olympia I had\n never seen the honeysuckle growing, tne apple\n trees in blossom, biren trees sweeping the suy,\n oaks spreading their delightful shade over la.vn\n and held. Wnen at last r came upon this de-\n lightful little village, with its verdure-dressed\n trees, quaint homes with their whitewashed fronts\n and their green shutters, i saw something tnat\n had long been missed.\n</p>\n<p>\n Olympia is a type of the older cities of Wash-\n ington. it has a graveyard, and while graveyards\n may not seem to be the most desirable feature of\n a community, and while it may not be reckoned\n worth while to undergo any considerable sacrifice\n in order to acquire a graveyard, yet there was\n something about this home of the dead that seemed\n to lend age and respectability to the town, and\n that seemed to entitle it to that reverence which\n no other place I had visited had inspired. Its\n little churches wore the stains of age anti were\n overgrown with ivy vines, and their bells had a\n mellow sound and lacked the ciangy newness that\n characterizes the tones of the bells in other cities.\n</p>\n<p>\n Olympia has grown during the last twenty\n years, but it has grown slowly, and to-day con-\n tains scarcely more than 5,000 people. The\n scenery around it is beautiful. The arm of that\n exquisite water, blue and green with the ocean\u2019s\n brine, and yet as clear and pellucid as a mountain\n stream, comes inward from the Sound as if on\n purpose to wash the shores around which Olympia\n clusters. You can look far down into the depths\n of this glassy water and see the starlisli clinging\n to the rocks and moving their red-mottled arms\n slowly here and slowly there as they creep up and\n down and into the Sound\u2019s soft bed. You can see\n mallards, tame and fearless, riding on the water\n almost within reach of the fishermen as they sit\n in their boats. You can see tbe lofty tops of the\n Olympic Mountains, the light clouds circling\n round them, hugged about with snowy shawls,\n ranging far to the north and far to the south be-\n tween the Soundland and the coast. Back from\n the town you can see the waterfall tumbling over\n rocky steps, and still further back, the mighty pine\n thickets with their timbers rising two hundred\n feet in a straight line skywards.\n</p>\n<p>\n Olympia is a city of homes. Its people do not\n claim to be a great commercial community. It\n is the capital, and but little else. I liave been\n much surprised to find how slightly the Western\n eople are impressed with the lesson invariably to\n e drawn from the history of capital cities. In\n the four new States every town with a thousand\n inhabitants wants to be the capital, and offers to\n mortgage itself up to its ears in order to secure\n that honor. None of them seems to understand\n how the possession of a capitol is really a curse to\n the community; how it almost invariably stifles\n commercial activity: how it produces an atmos-\n phere surcharged with all the moral poisons dis-\n seminated by certain varieties of politics that\n always cluster around capitols. They forget to\n compare Albany with New-York, Harrisburg with\n Philadelphia, Dover with Wilmington, Springfield\n with Chicago, Columbus with Cincinnati, Lincoln\n with Omaha, Lansing with Detroit, Madison with\n Milwaukee, Sacramento with San Francisco, Jef-\n ferson City with St. Louis. They forget that in\n no instance in which the capital city of the State\n is also its leading commercial city is that effect in\n the slightest degree due to its possession of a\n capitol.\n</p>\n<p>\n Olympia, like all other capitals, possesses a\n charming official society and all those aristocratic\n elements which belong to official life. As a com-\n munity it exerts a powerful influence upon the\n Territory; an influence of which it is exceedingly\n jealous. It is partaking in a considerable degree\n of the remarkable prosperity which Washington,\n both east and we-t of the Cascades, is now enjoy-\n ing. This prosperity is well illustrated by the\n increase of the taxable property during the last\n</p>\n<p>\n two years. The aggregate valuation in 1888\n reached $85, 000,000, more than $23,000,000 in\n excess of the valuation of 1887. It had increased\n 4 00 per cent in ten years, and will undoubtedly;\n reach at the close of tne present year $125,000,000.\n ibis wonderful movement forward has character-\n ized every county throughout the length and\n breadth of the Territory. Washington has been\n much favored by the Northern Pacific Railroad.\n The officials of that great corporation have made\n exception ' ll efforts to induce immigration into the\n country, and into Eastern YV asking-ton especially.\n T\u2019ney nave practically lilled up the surveyed part\n or me State.\n</p>\n<p>\n Washington has not been entirely grateful to\n the railroad. A railroad war has been in progress\n lor a series of years, and has done mucii to dis-\n courage tbe settlement of certain parts of the\n country where public feeling was inimical to the\n load, lbe trouoie arose, as it arises everywhere\n along the line of a subsidized road, from the laud\n grant, the railroad company endeavored to make\n all the money it could out of the sale of its lands.\n It laid cud town sites just beyoud the present site\n of an already organized municipality and en-\n dea\\ored to build up a new city to its own profit-,\n ft aiso made rates lor passenger and freight!\n traffic favorable to the towns of its own cr eation\n and discriminating against those that had been\n in existence beiore its arrival. ' This was un-\n doubtedly a bad policy, but it was hardly an un-\n natural one. It was not pursued, either, to any\n considerable extent. Though it bore heavily upon\n a lew communities, it by no means justified the\n widespread popular resentment which was awak-\n ened in Washington. The feeling for or against the\n railroad entered into politics, into business, really\n into social life. The man who permitted himself to\n be branded as a friend of the Northern Pacific could\n not run for public office, and was with the greatest\n difficulty elected to the position of vestryman.\n The larger-minded and further-sighted people\n were inclined to overlook the sins of the railroad,\n knowing as they did, that the State depended abso-\n lutely upon the Northern Pacific and its success\n for every element of prosperity. They suggested\n compromises; they sought to allay public feeling;\n they made themselves a go-between and sought to\n smooth over the ruffled feathers of the offended\n populace on the one hand, and to draw in the\n menacing horns of the railroad on the other.\n This, of course, was the right policy, and after\n a term of years it has succeeded. The railroad is\n to-day on much better terms -with the people than\n it was, and the Constitutional Convention, which\n has just adjourned at Olympia, managed to com-\n plete its work without engaging in open conflict\n with the corporations\n</p>\n<p>\n The great railroad problem along all the sub-\n sidized routes concerns taxation. Under their\n charters lands granted to railroad corporations\n are exempted from territorial taxation. Many\n people say this is unjust; so soon as we buy the\n lands of the railroad we are taxed for them ; why\n should this corporation be spared burdens which\n we must bear ? I shall undertake to furnish no\n other answer to this question than may be con-\n tained in the suggestion that tremendous com-\n mercial chances were taken by the people who\n furnished the capital wherewith to build these\n roads. They sunk hundreds of millions before\n they realized a penny, and they are realizing\n only pennies to-day. They have made the West\n pretty much all that it is, and they are entitled to\n make some money.\n</p>\n<p>\n Washington\u2019s population to-day must be close\n rnion 400,000. Its interests are widely diversified.\n It is a producing State in every sense of the term.\n Its land yields minerals, grain, building stones,\n coal, and all the crude materials with which\n mechanical arts, so far as the needs of this coun-\n try are concerned, have occasion to deal. These\n crude materials are being worked up into form\n and fabric by these people themselves.

T., September 1.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many stories are told of the dark ways and\n vain tricks to which resort was had by capitalists,\n speculators, town-site owners and other fore-\n runners of Western development to induce the\n Northern Pacific Railroad to run its line to this\n point, through that valley and over yonder bench\n land. Unless its projecting engineers were very,\n very good, they ought to be very, very rich, for\n there was nothing they could not have had if\n they would only bring the railroad to suitable\n places. It is quite astonishing how many towns\n and individuals fancy themselves possessed of a\n grievance against the railroad because it did not\n come their way. Tacoma is an interesting ex-\n ception to this almost general proposition. The\n railroad did come Tacoma ' s way. The elevated\n promontory upon which Tacoma is built, slowly\n but grandly falling away into the pearly waters\n of Puget Sound, contained, when the railroad de-\n cided to come Tacoma\u2019s way, a vast and mighty\n forest of pine trees, a sawmill and a few log\n shanties in which the employes of the mill lodged.\n That was Tacoma. Indians, hoarsely jabbering\n their strange Chinook, a medley of every known\n language spoken on two continents, hunted and\n fished through and about this wilderness Twenty-\n four hours after the Board of Directors of the\n Northern Pacific Railroad passed their resolution\n fixing Tacoma as the Western terminus of their\n road, a thousand trees were being felled, their\n stumps were being slashed and burned away,\n town-lots were being laid out five and ten miles\n distant from the proposed site of the railroad\n depot and money could not buy an acre of prop-\n erty at any point on the whole promontory.\n</p>\n<p>\n Events have fully justified the faith shown by\n the adventurers who thought tins a golden op-\n portunity, and the sagacity of the railroad com-\n pany in deciding upon this point as their terminus\n may not be questioned. This promontory lies\n between the main waters of the Sound and a\n beautiful bay. The eminent John Randolph, of\n Roanoke, who bore no love for the first of the\n Bayard family, used to speak of the honorable\n Senator \u201c who represented three counties at low\n tide and one at high.\u201d The action of the waters\n of Pugel Sound with regard to Tacoma suggest\n the tidal conditions impuled by Mr. Randolph to\n Delaware. At\u2019 high tide Commencement Bay is\n almost a sound of itself, but a few hours later\n whole acres of tide-land are laid bare, and the\n bay has almost disappeared beyond two jutting\n peaks in the distance. This and other physical\n arrangements have made Tacoma, for all practical\n purposes, the head of Puget Sound navigation.\n Vessels cannot wisely go further up the Sound\n</p>\n<p>\n lest they come to trouble among its strong currents\n and tortuous channels. This fact alone gives an\n assurance of future greatness to Tacoma. The\n other fact, that it is the terminus of a railroad\n system that begins at Cnicago, and may soon be-\n gin at New-Yom and stretch from ocean to ocean,\n as even now it stretches from the JLakes to the\n Pacific, completes the pledge that within another\n generation Tacoma must become one of the gieatest\n of American cities. Already 2o,0uu people are\n making of it a wonderfully busy mart. Already\n forty miles of graded saeeis and avenues are\n woven up and down and across its rugged, hand-\n some site. Already magnificent blocas of iron\n and granite and brick have been reared, not here\n and there, but in unbroken continuity along entire\n avenues. Street-cars bowl along in every direc-\n tion. Electric lights glare and flare from every\n corner at night and almost from every window.\n Already large manufactories have been estab-\n lished, and wholesale business houses, supplying\n a large area of growing country, have gi\\en an\n important and permanent character to its trade.\n Already it has become a great shipbuilding ' centre.\n Its people, indeed, own more shipping than the\n people of any other city of the Western coast, ex-\n cepting San Francisco. Its vessels carry lumber\n and the preserved fruits of Olympia and the\n Columbian plateau, wheat and other grains, to the\n ports of Asia and the fciouth Sea. This great ex-\n port trade, immense of volume, but still in its\n very infancy, grows with every hour.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of the most interesting facts in connection\n with this country is the retention of the early\n Indian names that were originally applied to its\n rivers and valleys. The Indians of Washington\n are related by many ties ol blood and association\n to all the tribes of the Canadian Northwest. Each\n tribe has its own peculiar language and customs,\n but they all speak Chinook. Tradition says that\n Chinook was invented a century ago by a\n Canadian-Scotch half-breed, in whose veins ran so\n many different strains of Indian blood, affording\n him such a variety of red relations, that he\n was, forsooth, compelled to get up a language of\n his own that they ail might be able to understand.\n So he took a little Blackfoot, mixed it with a\n trifle of Crow, seasoned it with bad French, worked\n in a Dundee accent, and called it \" Chinook.\u201d\n He provided that the male Indian should be\n known as a Siwash and the female Indian as a\n Klootchman. and as the Siwashes and Klootch-\n men worked themselves westward and over the\n country they carried this invented language with\n them and established it throughout the Northwest.\n There are hunters and trappers and lumbermen\n who can make themselves well understood through\n Chinook everywhere they . go. In the distant\n baokwoods there are squaw-men\u2014 that is, white\n men who have taken Indian wives\u2014 who have\n really forgotten their mother-tongue, and can now\n speak nothing but Chinook. The Indian proper\n names scattered so plentifully over Washington\n Territory are all Chinook names, and originally\n possessed some peculiar significance. Snowqunlmie,\n for instance, meant \u201c crowned with snow.\u201d Skagit\n was the name of the wildcat. Stillaquamish sig-\n nified \u201c quiet water.\u201d Nooksaclc meant \u201c north\n of the mountain.\u201d Nesqually meant \u201c south of\n the mountain.\u201d These and many other names,\n some of them picturesque in their significance\n and beautiful in their sound, are now preserved\n as the names of particular geographical features.\n Okinagane, \u201c soft and deep,\u201d is the name of a\n lake. Yakima, \u201c white pebbles\u201d : Wenatchie,\n swiftly running,\u201d are names of mountain\n streams.\n</p>\n<p>\n Almost all the counties of the State are called\n by names derived from Indian stories. Tacoma\n was the name of a tribe, Seattle that of a great\n chief and when the white people determined to\n call their town after him his tribe came in a body\n to the Common Council and begged them to re-\n frain. Their request involved a long explanation\n of their religious beliefs, from which it appeared\n that they were worshippers of their ancestors and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0078/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0078/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0078/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0078/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0078/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0078.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 857990}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"78\">\n<p>\n 76\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n that the dead.

Puget\n Sound, with its long miles of water front, alfords\n about 200,00b acres of tide-land susceptible of cul-\n tivation. Some 30,000 acres have already been\n reclaimed, and are yielding in many instances\n enormous crops of grass and grain. An even\n hundred bushels of oats and three or four tons of\n hay are the average yield to the acre. The great\n value of these lands under the most ordinary cir-\n umstances is obvious. They are everywhere worth\n two or three times as much as the land around\n them, and when they lie in front of a great city, as\n they do at Olympia, Tacoma and Seattle, and may\n lie at a great variety of other places, soon to be\n made the water front of great export cities, their\n value is counted by thousands of dollars to the foot.\n A picturesque appearance is presented by the tide-\n lands around Tacoma and Seattle. You can see\n fences built out into the water, over which the\n Sound rises at high tide, but which are left deeply\n planted in the mud when the tide goes out,\n marking claims that have been entered in the\n United States Land Office by persons who have\n \u201c squatted\u201d on these tide-lands. Several serio-\n comic incidents have already occurred indicating\n the determination of the \u201c squatters\u201d to defend\n with their lives the property they have seized.\n The new Constitution of Washington affirms the\n title of the State to all these lands, and a scries of\n conflicts between the public and individuals is\n sure to result. A problem analogous to this is\n being confronted by the people of the arid States.\n It concerns public versus private rights to the\n great unnavigable waterways, which must in time,\n under the colossal schemes of irrigation soon to be\n undertaken, be depended upon to supply the nec-\n essary water. If every one can tap these streams\n at will, the land-owners nearest their elevated\n sources (for they are all mountain streams) will\n hold a great advantage over the property-owners\n lying lower along their courses. In many cases,\n indeed, these unfortunates will be crowded out\n entirely, as the flow during the irrigating season\n will not be sufficient to supply the ranches all\n along these narrow, shallow and very lone rivers.\n</p>\n<p>\n Tacoma\u2019s trade, except in so far as it becomes\n in time a manufacturing city, will be composed\n of timber, minerals and agricultural products.\n The timber belt includes the whole division of\n land from the Cascade Mountains to the ocean\n and from the Columbia River to the British line.\n It is about as large as the State of Iowa, and is\n densely covered with trees that will cut from\n 25,000 to 60,000 feet to the acre. Estimates have\n been made which show that the entire timbered\n district contains 1 75,000,000,000 feet. Their\n use is being confined as much as possible to ship\n spars and heavy building and bridge timber,\n though a tremendous amount of soft lumber is\n being sent every week into every continent.\n Something like 3,000,000 feet a day is the cut of\n the Washington mills, and while, of course, the\n time must come when this magnificent belt will\n be cleared and bare, that time will not arrive\n during the next century.\n</p>\n<p>\n I have already spoken at some length in this\n correspondence of the remarkable coal and mineral\n deposits to be found all along th\u00bb line of the\n Cascades. They are rapidly being developed and\n the coal taken from this district is already super-\n</p>\n<p>\n seding the Pennsylvania coals that have been for\n 60 long and at such a fearful expense depended\n upon for the supply of this Northwestern country.\n The soil and climate of Washington are for many\n particular reasons adapted excellently well to the\n raising of hops, grain, grass and vegetables. And\n even the recital of every shipment that is made\n from Puget Sound of agricultural products would\n but tamely express the possibilities of the country.\n Tacoma is making every possible use of these great\n resources. The business interests of her popula-\n tion are as varied as the resources they can com-\n mand, and the growth of the city from 9,000 in\n 1887 to at least 25, 000. to-day is the result of the\n opportunities derived from purely natural condi-\n tions. The exports of the Sound for 1889 will\n amount to twenty millions and will consist almost\n entirely of the products of Washington Territory.\n They will include 500,000,000 feet of lumber,\n 30,000 centals of wheat, 300,000 tons of coal,\n 1,500 tons of Sour and 20,000 tons of manu-\n factured goods, and in this startling aggregate of\n trade Tacoma\u2019s individual share will not be less\n than one-third.

T., September 9.\n</p>\n<p>\n As in the Dakotas, as in Montana, so in the new\n State of Washington, the Democracy enters into\n the contest for State supremacy with a discredit-\n able past and a hopeless future. Eastern people\n are often heard to wonder why it is so nearly\n impossible for the Democracy to obtain a foot-\n hold in the Western States. The reason lies in\n the mherent character of the party not less than\n in the specific acts of a kind offensive to the West\n of which it has been guilty. Its general tone and\n character have rendered it objectionable to a peo-\n ple upon whom the burden has fallen of creating\n great things out of little or nothing. If there is\n any one policy more thoroughly Democratic than\n another, it is the policy of demanding that every\n one shall take care of himself. This policy lay,\n I take it, at the bottom of the party\u2019s early State\u2019s\n rights theories. It certainly lies at the bottom of\n those Congressional policies by which it always\n seeks to prevent Federal legislation intended to\n build up and assist new and struggling sections\n of the country. The Dakotas, Montana and\n Washington are all of them going to come into\n the Union as Republican States. They will elect\n Republican Congressmen and Republican Legis-\n latures, which will in turn elect Republican\n United States Senators. The only one of these\n States in which the Democracy hopes to make any-\n thing like a substantial fight is Montana, and\n their strength there is simply the tail-end of an\n old-time Democratic party built up in the early\n days of the Territory when it was settled by Mis-\n sourians. As I explained some time ago, its\n strength in Montana has diminished in a regularly\n increasing ratio every year since the Northern\n Pacific Railroad came into Montana, until to-day it\n is the party of the minority, though the margin\n between the parties is concededly small.\n</p>\n<p>\n The people of the country ought to understand\n the philosophy of the Democracy\u2019s failure in the\n West. Its position here is the logical result of\n substantial and easily recognized causes.

A lew weeks ago a committee of the\n United Srates Senate, composed of Senator Stewart,\n of Nevada; Senator Piumo, of Kansas; and Sena-\n tor .Reagan, of Texas, came all through the arid\n West and over the Northern Pacific into this\n State, clear through to the coast. They were in-\n vestigating a subject concerning which i have\n written you freely\u2014 that of National irrigation, the\n construction through this entire arid belt of great\n canals and reservoirs intended to supply the farmer\n hereafter to settle upon the millions of acres of\n public land now lying idle and tenantless, from\n which the Government now derives no revenue,\n but which are claimed by the Western people and\n by Major Powell, of the Geological Survey, to bo\n capable of magnificent production, with the water\n necessary to make the crops grow. The Senate\n instructed its committee to inquire into this mat-\n ter and to see for itself what the possibilities\n were, whether or not the claims of the people\n were true, what the cost of such great waterworks\n would probably be, and whether it would be the\n part of wisdom for the Federal Government to in-\n terest itself in the matter. At various points\n along the course taken by the committee the\n Senators made addresses to the people, and in every\n one of these addresses Mr. Reagan took occasion\n to say that he did not believe it was right or\n proper for the general Government to go into ad-\n ventures of this kind : that they were in their na-\n ture affairs of the State, and that each State\n ought to provide for its own interests. If ihere\n ever was a typical Democrat he is Senator Reagan,\n and his words upon the subject of National irriga-\n tion furnish a clear explanation of the reasons\n why the West distrusts the Democratic party.\n The people here do not insist that the Government\n shall undertake to irrigate the arid belt. They\n only a.sk that the subject shall be fairly and fully\n considered. But they know that the Democracy\n enters upon the consideration of it and of all\n other helpful policies with a strong and inherent\n prejudice against them. In a word, it is not a\n helpful party, and they, being a poor people en-\n gaged in a mighty struggle with a new country,\n which, however full of magnificent opportunities,\n however rich in raw materials, nevertheless re-\n quires of them the most herculean labors for its\n development, want to he helped. They need\n help. They know that the future will justify all\n their applications for help. They know they can\n pay 100, yes 500, per cent interest on all the help\n they get, but the time when they must be helped,\n if at all. is to-day, and they know that the\n Democratic party stands between them and all\n helpful enterprises on the part of the Government.\n That is the reason why they have no use for the\n</p>\n<p>\n Democracy.\n</p>\n<p>\n You have heard time and again that the people\n of the West were opposed to a protective tariff.\n Every election upon that issue has, of course,\n afforded a clear demonstration to the contrary,\n but nevertheless the Free-traders keep up the\n cry that the West is a farming country, that it\n wants cheap goods, that it feels the protective\n tariff to be merely an Eastern conspiracy by which\n the manufacturers of New-England and the Mid-\n dle States are enriched at the expense of the con-\n suming Western country. This story you will\n find in almost every issue of almost every free-\n trade journal in America. There never was a\n falser ' claim. Tf the Mills bill and the Senate\n substitute hill that were before the last Congress,\n if they and they only were before the people of\n the West as alternatives, an election upon them\n would be carried by the Senate substitute bill\n fifty to one. No intelligent man can come out\n here and study this question and arrive at any\n other conclusion. A Democratic delegate\n has represented this Territory m the\n Congress at Washington for two full terms\n and until the election of 1888, lie was elected\n in each instance upon a proposition dealing with\n the Northern Pacific Railroad. The people of\n Washington felt, that they had numerous griev-\n ances against this corporation. I dare say they\n</p>\n<p>\n had. It is a magnificent corporation. It runs\n wonderful railroad trains over a wonderful line.\n It attorns the Northwest a railroad service that\n fully justifies the use of the word excellent, liut\n it is a cold-blooded corporation, and it aims to\n extract ail the money it can from the people, ft\n intends to realize from its land grant every penny\n of the incalculable fortune there is in it. For\n several years the railroad has been in politics\n here. Certain people undertook to drag it m, and\n in fighting them it drew itself in. A widespread\n sentiment was aroused in favor of de during its\n grant forfeit. Now, the company had earned a\n iarge part of the grant. As to another large\n pare, its title, while clouded, was by no means\n easy of denial. The Republicans deprecated a\n campaign directed against the railroad. They\n were conscious of the State\u2019s dependency upon it.\n They knew how intimately interwoven was the\n people\u2019s prosperity with the good fortune of the\n railroad, and they thought that good policy made\n it advisable for the Territory to get along har-\n moniously with the company. \u2019They advocated a\n compromise. They wanted justice for the State,\n but were disposed to give justice to the railroad.\n</p>\n<p>\n This situation afforded, as you can easily see, a\n splendid chance for demagogy. Senator Voorhees,\n of Indiana, that interesting Anarchist who re-\n cently proposed to hang Mr. Carnegie, had a son\n out here, somewhat past Ids majority, loung\n Voorhees was in many respects a second edition of\n old Voorhees. He, too, had the hanging pro-\n pensity. He wanted to be an Anarchist like his\n papa. He wanted to hang Mr. Villard and Mr.\n Oakes and all the other hard-hearted oppressors\n of the people. So he got himself nominated by\n the Democratic party and went before the people\n upon the practical issue that dreadful things ought\n to be done to the Northern Pacific Railroad. He\n and his supporters made a vast number of wild\n and silly speeches, intended to inflame people\n against the Northern Pacific. As is usual in such\n cases, there was just enough of a tangible griev-\n ance to give opportunity for this kind of a cam-\n paign, and it succeeded. Voorhees was elected.\n He went to Washington and put in his anti-cor-\n poration bills. The last campaign was attempted\n to be fought upon this same issue, but in the\n meantime Cleveland had written Ins tariff mes-\n sage. Mills had introduced and passed his Free-\n Trade bill, and the Republicans of Washington\n talked tariff. Their candidate was a popular\n young man from Walla-Walla, who explained ta\n the people that the Democratic party had wiped\n out the tariff on wool, and by that action, though\n it had not yet gone into effect, had reduced the\n price of their clip from 25 cents a pound to 12\n cents, ire explained that sheep could be grown\n in South America and Australia by labor that,\n felt itself richly paid at 20 cents a day, while\n Washington herders were receiving $1 a day and\n their keep. He explained that the Mills bill had re-\n duced the tariff on lead 50 per cent, and that\n under the construction of the present tariff law\n by the Democratic Secretary of the Treasury Mex-\n ican lead ores had been admitted into the United\n States absolutely free of duty, to the vast injury\n of the lead mines at the Coeur d\u2019Alenes. owned\n and operated by Washington people and Washing-\n ton capital. Tie explained that the Mills bill had\n put lumber on the free list, seeking to bring into\n the United States the large outpourings\n of Canadian forests in competition with\n i he one great staple of Washington.\n These facts were clearly got before\n the people and Mr. Voorhees found hiimself de-\n feated bv a majority of 7,371. This faot. shows\n where Washington stands on the subiect. of the\n tariff, just, as the election of Mr. Carter in Montana\n by more than 5.000 major fly, upon the same issue,\u2019\n shows where Montana stands.\n</p>\n<p>\n Both parties are now in the field in Washington, '\n and the lines of battle are already drawn.

If ever a region\n was made for the purpose of exciting strange and\n uncamny emotions, it is that so appropriately\n named the \u201c Black Hills.\u201d In the first place,\n geologists discover no reason growing out of the\n character of the surrounding country why there\n should have been hills here at all. They came as\n the result of an upheaval which was purely local\n both in origin and effect. There seems to be a\n vast central mass of granite which serves as the\n core of the mountains, and around it in concen-\n tric ribbons, so to speak, are the upturned edges\n of an infinite variety of formations. The first\n upheaval was Archaean, and the traces of it are\n exceedingly distinct and frequent. The land\n originally thrown up must have been acted upon\n by erosion and carried away by the early waters.\n It must finally have become the bed of the sea,\n receiving sediments of its own, again and during\n the same period to be thrown higher in the air\n than ever. Again it must have sunk, and to a\n very considerable depth for fhe sediments and\n fossils of the Potsdam group are to be discovered\n at a depth of 250 feet. Again it rose above the\n Paleozoic ocean, and the limestone and sandstone\n began to accumulate. Upon these the Triasslc\n</p>\n<p>\n beds were deposited, and above them were laid the\n Jurassic ruen, ana nnaiiy, alter the cretaceous\n period, the mountains as tney appear to-uay were\n upiieaved. au tnese rormaiions are discernible\n in Circular bands surrounding tne granite nucleus,\n showing that the dual expulsion must have oc-\n curred with greatest iorce directly in the centre\n of the country. Centuries oi erosive action have\n served to lay bare the edges of these origmai\n Archaean rocits.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is this peculiar geological formation, unit ren-\n ders the lilack Hills so strange and weird in their\n scenic effects. They are called black because of\n the appearance presented at a distance by the pine\n trees which cover them. The pines of the Rock-\n ies, the Cascades and the Sierras are exceedingly\n green and bright, but the pines of the Black Hills\n ! are dark, gloomy and produce rather a disagree-\n able Impression upon the mind. There is nothing\n in the nature of a range of mountains rolling along\n up and down or over and across the country, but\n each particular hill seems to have been formed of\n itself. It towers aloft in its own way. The\n mountains, indeed, do not even seem to have a\n neighborly relation to each other, and the further\n j you go among them the more strange and fearful\n become the sensations produced by their curious\n and ominous appearances. They only need the\n grim ruins of a few castles, of a few stone cathe-\n drals, together with a dozen darksome legends of\n wicked lords and unhappy ladies, a few murdered\n princes, a few imperious priests, a few slaughtered\n armies, a few Robin Hoods, a few Rob Roys and a\n few Roderick Dim,-, to render them quite as worth\n while as the Highlands or the Hartz. It is known\n that the Sioux Indians, who used to own the hills,\n entertained a great many strong objections to cer-\n tain especially dismal spots among them. They\n loved the beautiful valleys where the sun ever\n shines, where the silvery waters of half a dozen\n mountain streams glide and spring and dance\n along. They loved the mountain peaks from\n which they could look out upon a great continent\n and see the rolling prairie far away meeting the\n horizon at every point, but there were certain\n gulches, certain canons, certain dark ravines and\n certain tumbling torrents which only the bravest\n of them or those under the protection of the Man-\n ! itou ever visited. Thes\u2019 spots, however, exerted\n a great influence upon the Indian. One of ihem\n contains a stone whereon the feet of the Great\n Spirit are imprinted, leaving the eternal trace of\n his presence when he formed the great Dacotah\n Tribe. In another spot is the gushing spring out\n of which he took the water wherewith he modelled\n from the pipestone the mother of the whole red\n race. In certain places are great rocks jutting\n from the mountains in such positions as to inspire\n among the superstitious Indians strange and dread-\n ful ideas of the Deity, about which they used to\n gather before they went to war or before they\n negotiated peace.\n</p>\n<p>\n Naturally then, this country, sacred in their\n eyes, was most stubbornly protected when the\n white man demanded it. In the breast of the\n meanest and vilest Indian there is yet to be found\n a certain beautiful sentiment associated with the\n love of nature. In the Sioux tribe this feeling\n is particularly strong. The Sioux is in all ways\n the noblest, bravest and cleverest of the Indian\n family. His love for these hills had grown up\n through marv centuries, and when his claim to\n them was disputed he took the war path at\n once. Every mountain was fought over: in every\n valley he left his blood; every gay rivulet bore\n in it ' s crimson tint the record of his valor and\n devotion. ' When at last he was forced away,\n when the truth came clearly upon him that he\n must surrender this storehouse of his best and\n fines*- imagination, the spirit of the Sioux was\n nearly broken. Since the return of the Indians\n fT\u2019om their Canadian exile they have been a\n different people, savage as ever, ugly as ever,\n malicious, hateful and sinister as ever, but the\n fire of deviltry burns far less brightly in their\n eyes, and, though the knife and the rifle are ever\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0081/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0081/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 537, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 868}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0081/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1075, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1736}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0081/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3473}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0081/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0081.jp2", "height": 3473, "width": 2151, "levels": 6, "size": 681847}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"81\">\n<p>\n SOUTH DAKOTA.\n</p>\n<p>\n 70\n</p>\n<p>\n ready at their belt and shoulder, their nerveless\n fingers hang palsied at their sides.

Inexhaustible\n stores of limestone, sandstohe, granite, gypsum\n and marble, clay for the potter, clay for the brick-\n maker, are among the treasures that have fallen\n to the fortunate lot of the Black Hills resident.\n Here is to be found the largest gold mine in the\n world, directly and indirectly supporting as many\n as 12,000 people. Here are the largest known\n deposits of tin ore, covering a country forty miles\n in length by eight or ten in width. It is by\n many believed that the recently discovered tin\n ores of the Black Hills are to furnish by far their\n most permanent source of wealth. As many as\n 3,000 claims are recorded in the land district to\n tin mines in and surrounding Harney Peak. The\n discovery of tin dates back only six years, and\n as yet but little has been done to show the work-\n able quality of the ore. Scientific people, who\n admit that there is a vast amount of tin spread\n over a vast amount of country, still deny that\n any process is in existence by which it can be\n profitably got at. A company is now building a\n mill which is to have a capacity of 500 tons a\n day, and the problem will be promptly and de-\n cisively solved.\n</p>\n<p>\n Notwithstanding the fact that a gold mine has\n been found in Dakota and is to-day being operated\n upon the most extensive and magnificent scale,\n producing $1,500,000 annually from ores which\n do not average more than $3 50 to the ton, it is\n probably a fact that more money has been spent\n in the Black Hills than in any other mining region\n to absolutely no advantage. The hills contain\n everything of a mineral nature that cam possibly\n be packed into a region of its area, and yet there\n is very little concentration of the ores in certain\n and specific spots. You cannot dig up a cart-\n load of earth anywhere without finding color, but\n the problem is tc-day, as it has ever been since\n the discovery of gold here, how to secure a process\n cheap enough and thorough enough to save the\n minerals. Little by little the Ilomestake Com-\n pany is solving this question. Its losses in gold\n carried off in the tailings, although enormous, are\n less to-day than ever before, and little appliances\n are continually being added here and there in its\n vast machinery- by which the gold is being more\n thoroughly caught. But there are many mines\n containing ores that carry as much as $15 or $20\n to the ton which cannot be worked at all. The\n gold is found in such peculiar combinations that\n any effort to extract it upon a large scale is ut-\n terly futile. There is certainly no field in which\n the practical inventor of mining machinery can\n work to better advantage than in the Black Hills.\n</p>\n<p>\n Comparatively nothing has been dome toward tak-\n ing out the minerals of the region, An output of\n $3,ouu,0ou a year is ail that can be claimed;\n whereas il they only knew just how to do it, if\n they only had the chemiftal combinations or the\n mechanical appliances which would effectually\n take hold of the minerals and save them, the\n output might very easily reach $15,000,000, and\n might go on for scores of years at that vast aggre-\n gate.\n</p>\n<p>\n It cannot be said that the experiments which\n have been made bere with the peculiar materials\n furnished by this soil have been in the highest\n sense practical. A great many very wise scien-\n tific persons have done a great many wise and\n scientific things. Some of these have proved\n utter failures and none is a substantial success.\n Processes have been invented which do well\n enough when operated in a crucible, but which\n have proved utter failures when adapted to large\n machines. The practical mining men of the West\n have not yet invaded the Hills. They are still\n working in California, Nevada, Colorado and\n Montana. Mr. Hearst and Mr. Haggin are the\n only ones who have come into this country, and\n their mine is the only one that has proved to be\n an unqualified success. There is a vast difference\n between the way in which Eastern men and\n Western men go into mining adventures. The\n Western man undertakes it slowly. He studies his\n mine. He digs here and bores there. He makes\n entries running wherever he sees the vein, and\n when he finally undertakes the work of develop-\n ment he is so well satisfied of what his mine con-\n tains that he is prepared to put into it the neces-\n sary thousands or millions as the case may be,\n and as the case often is, to get its contents out.\n But the Eastern man always wants to take away\n ten dollars for every one he invests and to take\n it immediately. He does not come out and make\n a careful study of the country, going into its\n geological history, examining it everywhere,\n studying the geological structure of similar por-\n tions of the country, studying other mines with a\n view to the institution of proper geological com-\n parisons. He is unwilling to spend the time and\n the money necessary to accomplish this primary\n work. Instead, he sends out a mining engineer\n who knows but little except wbat the books have\n told him and upon the report of this usually in-\n competent person he makes his investment. He\n usually spends what money he does spend as fool-\n ishly as possible, and when he has sunk $10,000\n or $20,000 to no avail he becomes disgusted, curses\n wildcat mines, and wherever he goes he damns\n the country generally. There are thousands of\n cases in which mines thus abandoned by Eastern\n men and sold for a song after they have sunk in\n them a moderate fortune have been bought by\n Western men, men who understand the country\n and who have made mining a life-work, and\n profitably developed. So soon as the time comes,\n and it soon will come, when the practical Western\n miner takes hold of the Black Hills their immense\n mineral resources will respond quickly to his\n knotting touch and their output will be^ quad-\n rupled.

or\n</p>\n<p>\n head of family, can eater 160 acres of Burveyed\n lanu.\n</p>\n<p>\n After having selected a tract and ascertained\n its description, the settler should go to the local\n land office and sign an application and subscribe\n to the required affidavit. The application de-\n scribes the land, and the affidavit sets forth facts\n respecting his age, citizenship, etc. He will then\n be required to pay to the register and receiver\n of the land office the Government fee and that\n part of the commission which is payable when\n the entrv is made according to the amount of\n land entered, as follows: 160 acres\u2014 fee $10,\n commission $4, total $14; eighty acres\u2014 fee $5,\n commission $2, total $7.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the applicant is settled on the land he\n ddsites to enter, but is prevented by bodily infirm-\n ity, distance, or other good cause from visiting\n the land office in parson. the affidavit may be\n made before the clerk of the court for the county\n within which the land is situated; and the\n affidavit, together with the application and money,\n can be forwarded to the register and receiver.\n</p>\n<p>\n Having selected and entered the land he will be\n required to establish an actual residence thereon\n within six months from the date of the entry,\n and that residence must be continued, without\n abatement for more than six months at any one\n time, for five years. If he has a family, his\n family must also reside on the land. While the\n law allows a temporary absence (of not more than\n six months at any one time) it requires that the\n residence and improvement of the land shall be\n actual. The settler cannot sleep on the land on*\n \u25a0night every six months and call it a residence,\n</p>\n<p>\n neither can he pile a few logs or poles together\n and call it a cabin. At the end of five years from\n date of entry, or within two years thereafter, he\n can submit to the land officers proof of his residence,\n cultivation, etc. This proof can either be made\n before those officers or before the judge of a\n court of record of the county in which the land is\n situated. He will then be required to pay the\n balance of the commission (being same amount as\n the commission paid when entry was made), when\n the patent certificate will be issued on which the\n Government patent or deed is executed. He\n need not necessarily make his proof (or as it is\n commonly termed *\u2022 prove up\u201d) at the end of five\n years, though he must do so within seven years\n from date of entry.\n</p>\n<p>\n If the settler does not wish to remain upon the\n land the full period required, he can, after six\n months\u2019 residence, prove up. but he will then be\n required to pay for the land at the Government\n price. This is called commuting an entry. This\n price is uniformly $1 25 per acre. Every soldier\n or sailor who served in the Army or Navy of the\n United States for ninety dnvs during the late\n Rebellion, and was honorably discharged, is en-\n titled to receive, on the period of residence re-\n quired on his homestead, the time of his service\n in the Army or Navy, providing such service\n did not exceed four years. One year\u2019s residence\n on the land is invariably required. Single women\n over the age of twenty-one. and married women\n whose husbands have deserted them, come within\n the provisions of the law, and can take home-\n steads; and the wiaow (if unmarried, or, in case\n of her marriage, the orphan children) of a soldier\n can have the ..ame privileges and benefits that the\n soldier would Lave were he alive.\n</p>\n<p>\n PRE-EMPTIONS.\n</p>\n<p>\n The pre-emption law requires, in addition to\n residence and cultivation, that payment for th\u00b0\n land at the Government price ($i 25 per acre)\n shall be made. The pre-emption privilege is re-\n stricted to heads of families, widows, or single\n persons over the age of twenty-one years, who are\n citizens, or who have declared their intention to\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0086/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0086/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0086/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0086/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0086/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0086.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 596620}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"86\">\n<p>\n 84\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW EMPIRES IN THE NORTHWEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n become citizens. It also excludes persons who\n own 3 20 acres of land in any State or Territory,\n and those who leave their own land in the same\n State or Territory lor Government lands. The\n right of a settler attaches from the time settle-\n ment is made, and when he files his declaratory\n statement the date of such settlement must be\n given. The declaratory statement is a preliminary\n caper that must be filed with the land officers,\n and the fee required to be paid is $2; it is re-\n quired to be filed ' within three months from date\n of settlement, if the land was surveyed, or within\n three months after survey, if the land was unsur-\n veyed at the time of settlemmt. Thirty months\n ' \u25a0hereafter are allowed in which to prove up and\n pay for the land. Actual residence for a period\n of six months at least is required, with cultivation\n and improvement of the land, and the proof sub-\n mitted must be similar to that required under the\n homestead law.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is not expected that a settler will break and\n cultivate every acre of his claim, nor is there any\n established amount of labor that is required to be\n performed. The sufficiency of residence and im-\n provement is a question of fact to be decided from\n the circumstances of each case; and the Govern-\n ment only requires satisfactory proof that the\n claimant has acted in good faith and done what\n he was reasonably expected to do. This is so\n under both the homestead and pre-emption laws.\n</p>\n<p>\n Any person who is the head of a family, or, if\n single, twenty-one years of age, a citizen of the\n United States, or who has declared his intention\n of becoming a citizen, may make an entry under\n the timber-culture, or, as it is commonly termed,\n \u201c tree-claim\u201d law. The claimant is required to\n take out preliminary papers, as in a homestead,\n and this is done by signing an application setting\n forth the land selected, and making affidavit\n that the tract applied for is prairie land, and is\n taken for the purpose of cultivating timber. The\n fees required to be paid are 310, if the tract\n entered lie more than eighty acres, and $5 if\n eighty acres or less. The commission also re-\n quired to be paid is $4 at the date of entry, and\n a like sum when the claim is \u201c proved up.\u201d\n Entries under this law are restricted to 100 acres.\n</p>\n<p>\n The claimant (if he enters 100 acres) is then\n required to break or plough five acres during\n the first year, and five acres more during the\n second year. The five acres ploughed the first\n year are required to be cultivated by raising a\n crop during the second year, and to be planted in\n timber, seeds or cuttings during the third year.\n</p>\n<p>\n | The live acres broken during the second year are\n ! required to be cultivated during the third year,\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 and to be planted in timber, seeds or cuttings\n during the fourth year. The tracts embraced in\n entries of a less quantity than one quarter section\n (160 acres) are required to be ploughed or broken,\n cultivated and planted in trees, tree-seeds, or\n cuttings, during the same period, and to the same\n extent, in proportion to their total areas, as is\n provided for in entries of a quarter section.\n</p>\n<p>\n No final certificate will be given or patent\n issued for the \u201c tree-claim\u201d land until the ex-\n piration of eight years from the date of entry.\n At the expiration of that time, or at any time\n within five years thereafter, it must be shown that\n the claimant has planted, and for not less than\n eight years has cultivated and protected, the re-\n quired quantity of trees. The number required\n to have been planted is 2,700 trees to the acre,\n and at the time of proving up there must be grow-\n ing at least. 675 living and thrifty trees to each\n acre. In other words, at. the end of the time al-\n lowed, the settler must have, on a 1 60-acre tract\n 6,750 trees, or on an eighty-acre tract, 3,375\n trees, and 1.688 on a forty. \u2022 The requirements of\n law pertaining to an entry of 120 acres are the\n same as for an eighty-acre tract and a forty-acre\n tract combined. Trees, seeds and cuttings can be\n obtained in the Territory at reasonable cost. No\n residence on the land, nor in fact in the Territory,\n is required under the timber-culture laws.\n</p>\n<p>\n When a homestead settler dies before the con-\n summation of his claim, the widow, or, in case\n of her death, the heirs, may continue settlement\n or cultivation and obtain title If both parents\n die, leaving infant children, the homestead may\n be sold for cash [or the benefit of such children :\n or the children may continue settlement or culti-\n vation and receive title. If a pre-emptor dies\n before completing his claim, the title may be\n perfected by the executor, administrator, or one\n of the heirs, and the title will pass to \u201c the\n heirs\u201d of the deceased claimant. Under the tim-\n ber-cultuie laws the land passes \u201c to the heirs\n or legal representatives\u201d in case of the death of\n the original claimant.\n</p>\n<p>\n Under the laws referred to any person coming\n within their provisions can become the owner of\n 480 acres of land. Should the settler not feel\n able to \u201c pre-empt,\u201d he can secure 320 acres under\n the homestead and timber-culture laws. Claims\n taken under these laws are exempt from taxation\n until patents are issued, and are not liable for\n 1 debts contracted prior to that time.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0087/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 434}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0087/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 537, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 868}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0087/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1075, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1736}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0087/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2151, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3473}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0087/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0087.jp2", "height": 3473, "width": 2151, "levels": 6, "size": 290552}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"87\">\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0088/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 431}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0088/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 529, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 863}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0088/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1059, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1726}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0088/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2118, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3452}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:we:mp:ir:es:in:no:rt:00:ne:wy:newempiresinnort00newy:newempiresinnort00newy_0088/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/we/mp/ir/es/in/no/rt/00/ne/wy/newempiresinnort00newy/newempiresinnort00newy_0088.jp2", "height": 3452, "width": 2118, "levels": 6, "size": 356744}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"88\">\n<p>\n LIBRARY OFTRiBUNEEXTR\n</p>\n<p>\n TWELVE COPIES A YEAR\n</p>\n<p>\n THE TRIBUNE daily, with its from seventy-six to nim\n great folio pages a week, contains from time to time feature!*\n permanent value and interest which many readers would\n glad to preserve for future reference in some more convenii\n form than that of a bulky newspaper.
