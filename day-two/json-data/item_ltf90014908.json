He was an Irishman, who settled in\n New Hampshire in the infancy of thaf country. Bis fourth son, Joel,\n was ever a wild, headstrong undutiful boy, whose self-willed propensi-\n ties, and ungoverned passions, led him into so many difficulties, that\n his parents often expressed their apprehensions of his dying an untime-\n ly death. As he advanced tpwards maturity, his father died, and his\n mother: unable to controul him, left him to pursue his own course, till\n she was reduced to ralher embarrassed circumstances, when an elder\n son interfered, and secured their aged parent from being further injured\n by Joel. He then embarked on the world\u2019s vast tide, to sink or swim\n alone. But the variations of his fortune would be tiresome io the\n reader, and uninteresting to society : suffice it to /-ay, he has ' seeu all\n the variety of life incident to dissipated men, withou Irieuds or fortune.\n The school system of New England early insured him the rudiments\n of a genteel education. He In-d a fine ear for music, and the winter\n singing-schools had given him \u00ab slight knowledge o! the scientific part\n of that art. A short time past io youth, with a stone mason, had in-\n structed him in the rougher parts of that trade, and it is represented that\n lie worked at it in the interior of New* York state. How Mr. Mallery\n had influance sufficient to recommend him to so trustworthy a situa-\n tion as be had on the Morris Canal, is enigmatical, as his situation in the\n city ol ' New-Y ' ork was at best ralher equivocal, and his resources lor\n living scant and unknowu. Few who stood forward as his friends\n seemed to know more of him than his boyhood and his residence\n at Mrs, Longstreth\u2019s, after his engagements at the canal had given\n him some claim to respectability. \u201c His language,\u2019\u2019 says a gentleman who\n conversed with him in M. H., \u201cwas coarse. His ideas low, and profane,\n and such as might be expected from a man whose habits had been formed\n amidst brethels, gambling-houses, and taverns.\u201d Such was the society he\n</p>\n<p>\n was connected with, till recommended by a Mr. M ,to the Canal\n</p>\n<p>\n Committee. From that period, his ideas soared to genteelity and polished\n society : to this, his residence in the respectable house of Mrs. Longstreth\n seemed a prelude. Could he have rnairied Mrs. Hamilton, her standing in\n society, combined with his name, might have brought him forward, and he\n might have become a valuable member, but her cultivated mind, pure heart\u2019\n and unsophisticated manners, was disgusted by his pretences, and her judg\n ment assured her, that in such a union misery would be her fate. Heuce her\n informed mind and heart recoiled from him with trembling disgust. \u201c f\n could not, mother, dear mother, 1 could not marry him.\u201d \u2014 These were her\n dying words, aod the sentiments of her pure heart -yet for this he slew\n her.\n</p>\n<p>\n During his contract on the rail road, suspicion marked his course. His\n coadjutor, Mr. Shippen, was not easily duped, and detection would soon\n have followed, had Mr, S have persevered.

In reference to the crime, for\n which he has suffered, he made some disclosures, which place the subject in\n a different light from that in which it has been heretofore viewed. He states,\n (after appealing to that God before whom he was to appear, for the sincerity\n of his story,) that Mrs. Hamilton had made an engagement of marriage with\n him She subsequently manifested a change, and eventually declared it im-\n possible for her to fulfil her promise, and in various ways showed that her\n affections had cooled He was exceedingly hurt and irritated by her conduct,\n and declares that his object in visiting New-York, was to withdraw himself\n from her society ; that after havmg been, while there, led into some dis-\n creditable scenes, which he looked upon as completing his disgrace, he re-\n turned to Bordentown, saw Mss. Hamilton, and informed her of his misfor-\n tunes. On learning that he had lost his money, she offered to give him all\n the money she had in her possession, and in addition to give him her gold\n watch. These offers he declined, but renewed the subject of their engage-\n ment, and told her that if she would consent to be his wife, al 1 would be well,\n and they should be happy. She refused.be says, to give him any encourage-\n ment. and in a manner calculated to wound his feelings.\n</p>\n<p>\n From that time, he observes, the idea of destroying her entered his mind.\n He acknowledges t h it her death was premeditated ; that his intention was\n to destroy her, and then to commit suicide. From the declarations which\n he had made to Mrs. Hamilton, she had reason to suppose that he intended\n to destroy himself; and it was from a feeling of anxiety, arising from her\n appiehenstons on his account, that she ' probably entered his room on the day\n of the fatal murder. He says he did uot call her. She same in of her own\n accord\n</p>\n<p>\n When he saw her, he advised her, fot her own safety to leave the room.\n She did so, but immediately returned. K)n her second entrance, he had left\n the bed on which he had been lying, and was on the opposite side of the\n room Ht was faint, and she observing he looked ill, went to him and offer-\n ed to assist him to the bed. While doing this, and while his left hand rested\n upon her shoulder, he drew the daggar, which was concealed about his per-\n son, and gave her a severe stab. At this instant, consciousness forsook him,\n and he repeated the stabs with great violence. He was actuated by jealousy,\n pride a id revenge.\n</p>\n<p>\n I* vvas his determination that if she would not be his, she should never be\n anothers.
