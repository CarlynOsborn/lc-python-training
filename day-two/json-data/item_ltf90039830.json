I desire to trespass as\n short a. time as possible upon the attention\n of the Senate, and I have a special reason\n for not wishing to extend the time further\n than I possibly can. I also have many facts\n to state in support of the propositions which\n I shall advance, and I desire to present my\n argument, such as it is, as a coherent and\n connected whole and not be diverted from It.\n After I have concluded, if Senators desire to\n ask any questions I shall be only too glad to\n answer them so far as I may be able to do it.\n \u201e \u201cMr. President, I think there has been a\n marked improvement in this debate over the\n last debate which was held upon the ques-\n tion of Philippine affairs, because in this\n debate, so far as It has proceeded, there has\n been more or less said about the pending\n measure. I am aware that we devoted one\n afternoon to a discussion of politics and\n election methods in North Carolina, but pos-\n sibly It v/as not amiss to consider the quality\n of mercy exhibited in certain parts of our\n common country as well as in the Philip-\n pines. It is true also that we devoted one\n afternoon to trying to decide the question\n whether Aguinaldo caused the assassination\n of General Luna, whether he had him as-\n sassinated in self defense, or whether Luna\n was merely killed by the guard because the\n guard did not like his manners. But all these\n things, Mr. President, have more connection\n with the matter before us than the discus-\n sions about the revolutionary history and the\n character of a judge at Nome, in which we\n before indulged. I think, Mr. President, I\n am not too optimistic, therefore, if I express\n the hope and the belief that the time will\n come and come before long when we shall\n discuss measures in regard to the Philippines\n as we discussed the Chinese exclusion bill,\n with a view to getting the best legislation\n possible in the interests of the people of the\n islands and ' the people of the United States,\n and when we shall cease to make the affairs\n</p>\n<p>\n of the Philippine Islands a field for the In-\n vestment of political capital by a party whose\n ventures in other directions have not of late\n been very successful.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Car-\n mack), with the grace of phrase character-\n istic of his eloquence, asked if any one would\n have the effrontery to defend the pending\n bill. In all humility, Mr. President, I will\n say that I have the effrontery not only to\n defend the bill, but in my feeble way to ad-\n vocate it. I believe it to be a well-consid-\n ered measure, dealing with subjects of great\n difficulty, to which the committee has given\n careful attention, over which they have la-\n bored assiduously, and to parts of which\n the minority of the committee have made\n valuable contribution, for which I am happy\n to make acknowledgment.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mining Law for Philippines.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe mining provisions of this bill\n occupy twenty-eight pages. The mining\n law on which the provisions of the bill are\n founded was prepared by the Philippine Com-\n mission with great labor and attention. It\n has been revised by a sub-committee of the\n Committee on the Philippines, consisting of\n the Senator from Maryland (Mr. McComas),\n the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Dietrich),\n and the Senator from Utah (Mr. Rawlins),\n and I believe as a layman in regard to min-\n ing laws that we have embodied in this bill\n as excellent a mining law as stands on any\n statute book. I think the obligation, for it\n is due to the sub-committee of the Commit-\n tee on the Philippines, and in a great meas-\n ure to .the Senator from Utah, who brought\n to the work an expert knowledge which was\n of great value. I shall not detain the Senate\n by discussing the details of those mining\n provisions. That is a task which I leave\n to the better instructed members who pre-\n pared it.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe coinage provisions of the bill occupy\n six pages, and provide for coinage in the\n Philippine Islands. I will only say in regard\n to the coinage provisions that the commit-\n tee were satisfied, after a careful investiga-\n tion of the subject, unanimously, with one\n possible exception, that no greater mistake\n could be made than to change the system of\n currency now in existence in those islands\n</p>\n<p>\n and to alter the standard to which the peo-\n ple have been accustomed for many years.\n It is always a dangerous thing to change the\n money standard of a people, and it seemed\n to the committee that at this time it would\n be exceedingly perilous. They are now, and\n have long been, upon the single silver\n standard, with the free coinage of Mexican\n dollars as the unit value and the current\n coin of the island. We make no change in\n the standard; we simply substitute for the\n Mexican dollar an American Filipino dollar,\n to be coined at the mint of Manila and at\n the mints in the United States, following in\n that respect the example of Great Britain in\n Hongko ng, Singapore and the Straits Settle-\n ments, for which she has coined what is\n known as the Bombay dollar, which has been\n of very great advantage to her and to her\n trade in the commerce of the East. I shall\n not go further into this question. The sec-\n tions were prepared by the Senator from\n Iowa (Mr. Allison), and I shall leave him,\n abler and more skilled than any other man\n in public life to deal with such a question\n as this, to explain these provisions fully and\n in detail to the Senate.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Commission and the Courts.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe remainder of the bill occupies nine-\n teen pages. We begin by continuing the\n present Philippine Commission. The only\n change we make in the existing state of af-\n fairs is to require that the Commissioners\n shall be appointed by the President and con-\n firmed by the Senate, and we apply the con-\n firmation of the Senate also to the judges of\n the Supreme Court. That, Mr. President, is\n necessarily a temporary and tentative ar-\n rangement, It is designed to leave the gov-\n ernment of the islands in the hands of the\n present Commission until the provisions of\n the succeeding sections may be carried into\n effect. Those sections provide for taking a\n census of the islands, getting not only the\n numbers of the people, but all the informa-\n tion that can possibly be desired. In order to\n enable us to establish there permanent, pop-\n ular, representative government.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt will require, in the nature of things,\n some time to take such a census, and it is\n impossible, as it seemed to the committee, to\n enter suddenly upon the establishment of\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0006/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0006/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0006/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0006/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0006/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0006.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 859103}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"6\">\n<p>\n 4\n</p>\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n representative government until we know the\n numbers of the people, until we have differ-\n entiated the wild tribes, who are said to\n number nearly a million, from the Christian-\n ized Filipinos, and also to determine our re-\n lations with the Mohammedan tribes of the\n south. The object of the census sections is\n to enable Congress to legislate intelligently\n with a view to giving those people a popular\n representative government; in the mean-\n time to take the census to which I refer; to\n instruct the Commission to continue, and to\n extend as far as possible the municipal and\n provincial governments to be chosen by the\n people, with the suffrage to be enlarged as\n rapidly as they think it safe; and to con-\n tinue to build up in that way the self-gov-\n ernment of the people of the islands.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe provide also for the public lands.\n That again is a temporary provision. There\n is a vast body of public land in the Philip-\n pine Islands. The total area of the islands\n is estimated at 72,000,000 acres, and it is be-\n lieved that not more than 5,000,000 of those\n</p>\n<p>\n 72.000. 000 acres are now in private owner-\n ship. That leaves in the hands of the\n United States, as the heir of Spain, some\n</p>\n<p>\n 67.000. 000 acres of public land. The commit-\n tee felt that it was necessary to have a\n proper land law \u2014 one adapted to the condi-\n tions of the islands. It has been left to the\n commission to prepare such a law, to be\n transmitted to Congress for its consideration\n and approval. Until that land law is enacted\n we give to the commission power only to\n make leases of the public lands.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe also provide that they shall give good\n titles to the occupiers of public lands, of\n whom there are a great many among the\n natives, who have never been able to secure\n from Spain any title to the little homesteads\n or farms which they lived on and cultivated\n for generations. I think that that is one of\n the most necessary and beneficent provisions\n of the bill.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" There are a number of sections which\n provide and give authority for the issuance\n of municipal loans, intended for municipal\n improvements, which are greatly needed, es-\n pecially in the city of Manila.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe also have provisions in the bill in re-\n gard to timber lands, and we have followed\n the same careful policy in regard to those\n lands that we have pursued in regard to the\n public lands generally. We permit the\n commission only to issue licenses to cut\n timber, and not to sell any more land than\n is necessary for the establishment of a saw-\n mill or the opening of a road to give access\n to the forests.\n</p>\n<p>\n Purchasing the Friars\u2019 Lands.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe have also made provision for the pur-\n chase of the friars\u2019 lands, as they are called.\n That is a difficult and unusual question. We\n authorize the commission to buy the lands\n of the friars for the purpose of selling them\n Immediately to the people who now occupy\n them. However witnesses or experts may\n differ in regard to the affairs in the Philip-\n pine Islands, there is but one opinion as to\n the necessity of taking those friars\u2019 lands\n and giving them over to the people who\n actually live upon them and cultivate them.\n The possession of the lands by the friars was\n one of the bitterest grievances of the Fili-\n pino people against Spain. The testimony\n is universal as to their desire to have those\n lands restored to them. The sections in re-\n gard to these lands, of course, in the nature\n of things, give a large power to the commis-\n sion, but there is no other way that I have\n seen suggested to get those lands out of the\n ka*4a a t these religious corporations and\n</p>\n<p>\n back into the hands of the people who culti-\n vate them.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe have also clauses in the bill provid-\n ing for franchises. They are guarded with\n the utmost care. I cannot now undertake to\n read, and I shall not detain the Senate by\n reading these franchise clauses, but I invite\n Senators to examine them with the utmost\n care. They are guarded in every possible\n way compatible with giving any reasonable\n opening to capital to enter into the islands\n with the hope of profitable investment.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe main object of the bill, Mr. President,\n is, in a word, to replace military by civil\n government \u2014 to advance self-government;\n and yet it is delayed in this chamber and op-\n posed by those who proclaim themselves\n the special foes of military rule.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe second object of the bill is to help\n the development of the islands, and yet, as\n the committee felt, to help that develop-\n ment only by taking the utmost pains that\n there should be no opportunity given for\n undue or selfish exploitation. The opponents\n of this legislation have dwelt almost continu-\n ously, when they have spoken on this bill,\n on the point that it is intended to open the\n islands to exploiters, to syndicates, and\n to carpetbaggers. Why, Mr. President, if\n we go on the proposition that it is a crime\n for an American to make money, undoubted-\n ly there is opportunity in this bill for men\n or associations of men to enter into the\n islands and to make money in a legitimate\n way. I am aware, after many years of ex-\n perience, of the hostility of the Democratic\n party to any man who has made money or to\n any man making money, and it was that one\n of their principles, the only one, I think,\n which was carried out with complete success\n during their last term of power. Few, if any,\n Americans at that time made money. But\n these exploiters, these syndicates, these car-\n petbaggers march back and forth through the\n speeches of Democratic Senators like the\n sceneshifters\u2019 army, and they have as little\n reality as the air-drawn dagger of Macbeth.\n It is continually reiterated that they are to\n be brought into the Philippines by this bill;\n and while Senators in opposition are de-\n claiming against this bill as throwing the\n islands open to improper exploitation and\n speculation I have had many gentlemen come\n to me who desire to invest money in the\n Philippine Islands, and who say that the bill\n is so drawn that it is impossible for capital\n to go in there to any laree amount. When\n gentlemen who desire ta invest take that\n view and the Democratic party takes the\n view that the bill is simply for purposes of\n exploitation my own conclusion is that we\n have got a pretty good bill.\n</p>\n<p>\n An Absurd Proposition.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe are also told that the Chinese are to\n be poured in there. Mr. President, as we\n have excluded the Chinese from the Philip-\n pines by legislation already passed, how ab-\n surd that proposition it. The dismal picture\n is then drawn of what will happen to the\n islands if we do not let the Chinese- in. The\n testimony is very clear to my mind that the\n Filipino people, if they have an oppor-\n tunity to earn good wages and to have them\n regularly paid \u2014 something which has never\n happened to them under Spanish rule \u2014 will\n be found quite capable of doing all the work\n that is needed in the islands. They are\n skillful workers in the factories they have\n there, such as the cigarette factories; they\n are noted as good machinists; they are deft\n and ingenious with their hands; they work\n in the rice fields under a sun which is even\n too much for Chinamen, and they carry on\n</p>\n<p>\n all the cultivation of the islands. If we once\n give them an opportunity to perform this\n work and receive regular wages and be prop-\n erly paid, I am sure we shall find that the\n labor is there, so that the Filipino people\n can develop their own territory. It may be\n slower than if we should throw the islands\n open now to sudden exploitation in large\n masses of territory and with great bodies of\n capital and with Chinese labor; but that it\n is simple justice to the people of those\n islands and that it is infinitely better to\n give them the arangement that we have\n given them, is, to my mind, too clear for\n argument.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIn connection with these exploiters and\n syndicates and carpetbaggers we have been\n told on the other side of the chamber that\n the Moro war was started in order to open\n the southern islands to exploitation. The\n Senator from Utah (Mr. Rawlins) criticised\n us with the utmost severity on that ground,\n whereas the Senator from Tennessee (Mr.\n Carmack) reproached us because the war\n with the Moros was not being pushed with\n sufficient vigor, they being brave, wild Mo-\n hammedans, instead of peaceful. Christian-\n ized Filipinos.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 Which I did not do at all.\n Mr. Lodge \u2014 I so understood the Senator,\n and if I misquote him I shall be glad to\n correct it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Facts About the Moros.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe facts are very simple. The Moros\n seized and put to death some American sol-\n diers. Indemnity was demanded and the de-\n livery of the murderers. The President\n warned our generals there to avoid a gen-\n eral war if it could possibly be done. The\n Moros, as I understand, declined, and en-\n gaged in continued hostilities. The news of\n events there is in the newspapers to-day.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMr. President, what we have done in the\n islands so far in three years is to establish\n schools, to establish courts where there can\n be quick justice instead of long denial, to\n establish the writ of habeas corpus, to erect\n civil governments throughout all the pacified\n provinces, and in this bill we propose to re-\n store to the Filipinos the friars ' lands and to\n give them title to those portions of the pub-\n lic land which they now occupy. All those\n things are great and beneficent measures \u2014\n measures which we ought to enact no matter\n what our opinion may be as to the ultimate\n disposition of the islands.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe charge has been made, and has been\n made as frequently as the charge about ex-\n ploitation, that we are intrusting these\n islands to a commission \u2014 a commission of\n foreigners, of outsiders, as it is called. Mr.\n President, it is well enough to say \u2018com-\n mission,\u2019 as if it were some kind of a vague,\n ill-defined monster; but a commission is\n made of men; and when we discuss the com-\n mission we ought to look at the men -who\n compose it, to whom we intrust this great\n work until a popular and representative\n government can be established. It would\n not be right for us to say that until a census\n was taken and all the arrangements, which\n may occupy many months, possibly years,\n are completed for the establishment of a\n representative government \u2014 that during all\n that time no city shall borrow money; the\n friars\u2019 lands shall not be returned; no rail-\n road shall be built; no street lighted; no\n electric roads put in; that we should hold\n the islands back from all progress, when\n we have there a commission perfectly suited\n to deal with - all those matters.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWhat is that commission, Mr. President?\n The head of it is Judge Taft, known through-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0007/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0007/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0007/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0007/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0007/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0007.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 876791}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"7\">\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5\n</p>\n<p>\n out the United States.

He regards\n himself as their guardian and their trustee.\n No man ever acted from better motives; no\n man ever labored more disinterestedly than\n he has done or with greater industry and in-\n telligence.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cJudge Taft Is a Northern man and a Re-\n publican. The acting governor, Luke E.\n Wright, is a Southern man, an ex-Con-\n federate and a Democrat. All that I have\n said of Judge Taft, I believe, from every-\n thing I have ever heard, I can also say of\n Governor Wright. Those are the two men\n at the head of the commission to whom we\n propose to give this great trust in the years\n to intervene between this time and the day\n when we can establish a general represent-\n ative government in the Philippines. It is\n not a mere name \u2014 the Philippine Commis-\n sion\u2014 it is just those two American gentle-\n men whom I have named and their asso-\n ciates \u2014 associates in every way worthy to\n be with them. Are they not honorable men?\n Do they not stand high in this community?\n Is there one who knows them who would not\n be glad to make them trustees for his wife\n or his child? Are they not eminently men\n \u2018secundis temporibus dubiisque recti\u2019? They\n stand high before the people of this country;\n there is not one of them we would not trust\n with our own affairs; and is it to be sup-\n posed that we cannot trust them with this\n great public duty? If we cannot trust them\n there is no man in the length and breadth of\n the United States fit to be trusted, and I\n have not yet reached the point when I am\n ready to admit that there are not Americans\n fit to be trusted with the interests of other\n people in the sure faith that they will ad-\n minister them with an eye single to the\n benefit of their wards and the honor of their\n country. (Manifestations of applause in the\n galleries.)\n</p>\n<p>\n Real Attack on the Army.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMr. President, I have stated the pro-\n visions of the bill. I have tried to speak in\n regard to some of the points of attack upon\n it; but the real attack which has gone on in\n this chamber for the last ten days has not\n been upon the bill. So far as the civil gov-\n ernment goes, with any one who has read\n the testimony and knows the facts and has\n considered the bill the attack upon it has\n broken down. The real attack here has been\n directed against the Army of the United\n States by those who are delaying this bill,\n which seeks to replace military with civil\n government.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWhy this attack upon the Army? Be-\n cause, It is said, it has been guilty of cruelty\n</p>\n<p>\n and torture to natives of the Philippine\n Islands. Ah, yes, Mr. President, perhaps so,\n but it has been guilty of a greater crime\n than that. It has been guilty of a crime not\n yet brought against it upon this floor, but\n which rankles deeper than all the tortures\n and all the cruelties laid to its charge \u2014 it\n has been guilty of the crime of success. It\n has been a victorious army; it has put down\n insurrections, and It meets now, as it met\n after Appomattox, abuse and attack. The\n days have dropped into history when Grant,\n too, was called a \u2018butcher,\u2019 but they are not\n forgotten. This charge has been brought\n against the Army of the United States be-\n cause they have been victorious, because\n they have crushed the Insurrection and dis-\n appointed those who sympathize with the\n insurgents. That is one reason for the as-\n sault upon our soldiers, and that is a sin for\n which in some quarters no forgiveness is\n possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBut I am not going to deal with the\n crime of victory. I am going to deal with\n the cruelty and the torture of the natives\n with -which the Army has been charged. The\n Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Carmack) said\n that he thought no exaggeration was possi-\n ble. I think he wronged himself. The\n charges can be, for they have been, greatly\n exaggerated. Why, Mr. President, the Ameri-\n can Army has been held up here as guilty\n of greater atrocities than all history can\n show. The Senator from Utah (Mr. Raw-\n lins) said:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018My God, Senators, will any one rise and\n tell me when and where among the most\n barbaric peoples you ever read such an act\n of brutality as that? When was anything\n like that disclosed elsewhere upon the face\n of the earth?\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMr. President, I cannot suppose that the\n Senator, with his wide reading, has forgot-\n ten such a notorious fact as the Neronian\n persecution of the Christians, when they were\n tied to pillars and burned to give light in the\n streets of Rome. I have heard of nothing of\n that sort in the Philippines. Is it not true,\n and does not history show, to take another\n familiar example, how the Tartar hordes\n swept over Russia; that they impaled the\n people in the villages, and that those they\n did not impale they tied to stakes with their\n hands above their heads and dipped them in\n tar and lighted them and left them there\n to burn, so that affrighted Europe called\n them Tartar candles? I have heard of noth-\n ing of that sort irom the Philippine Islands,\n and yet we are told that the atrocities there\n are worse than anything that even the most\n barbaric nations in history can show.\n</p>\n<p>\n All Torturers of History Recalled.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIndeed, Mr. President, the wide knowledge\n of the Senator from Utah was exhausted in\n finding comparisons to portray the infamy of\n the American Army. Not only have the con-\n ventional torturers of history, Philip II, Alva\n and Torquemada, flitted across the debate,\n but Quintus Cicero, the nephew of the great\n orator, has been brought in here, and has\n had his piteous story told. We have been in-\n formed also that Julius Caesar in all his\n campaigns never was guilty of such cruelties\n as the American Army has been guilty of in\n the Philippine Islands. I am afraid for the\n moment the Senator\u2019s classical learning be-\n trayed him. He has forgotten that it was\n Julius Caesar, in truth, the most merciful as\n he was the greatest Roman, who, neverthe-\n less, in his early days, when he captured\n pirates in the Mediterranean, crucified them\n at Pergamus, and so gave them over to one\n</p>\n<p>\n of the most cruel and agonizing forms of\n death that men have ever known.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBut not content with this, Mr. President,\n not content with what history furnished, the\n Senator from Utah in his zeal for compari-\n sons made some contributions to history\n himself.\u2019\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Rawlins\u2014 Mr. President, the Senator\n has alluded to an instance in my. speech\n where I asked if there had been anything\n in history comparable to the particular mat-\n ter to which I was then referring, and that\n reference was to the order of General Bell,\n which I quoted. \"\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Lodge \u2014 I am not misquoting the Sena-\n tor. I am reading his own words.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" The Senator, I said, not content with ex-\n hausting history, made some contributions\n to it himself. He said;\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018While in that situation the interpreter,\n doubtless compelled to perform this in-\n famous service, stooped over him and said,\n \u201cConfess, confess.\u201d It makes us think of\n Copernicus when he was subjected to the\n tortures and thrown down. They wanted\n him to announce that the world did not re-\n volve upon its axis, and was promised if he\n would say so that they would let him go, or\n else they would take his life, and, he re-\n fusing to say so, they took his life.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMr. President, the great astronomer and\n mathematician Copernicus died at the age of\n 70, in his bed, a canon of the church, in the\n bosom of the church, and his great work\n about the revolution of the celestial orbs\n was only published to the world as he lay\n dying. He was never tortured. It is po\u00bb-\n sible \u2014 \"\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Rawlins \u2014 Mr. President \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Lodge\u2014 It is possible, Mr. President,\n that the Senator was thinking of Galileo,\n but Galileo recanted, and lived ten year*\n longer. (Laughter.) So that, as the story\n applies neither to Corpernicus nor Galileo,\n it must be some other tortured astronomer\n the Senator has in mind. (Laughter.) Ah,\n Mr. President, if the Senator had only told\n the right story of the right man. If he had\n only described Galileo reciting his recanta-\n tion and then as he arose from his knees\n muttering under his breath the famous\n words which have come down to posterity\n the Senator might have taken that golden\n opportunity to teach the party to which he\n belongs the lesson, which they seem to be as\n slow in learning as the Roman curia in the\n sixteenth century, that the world moves.\n (Laughter.)\n</p>\n<p>\n Some Regrettable Instances.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cNow, Mr. President, to pass from these\n fascinating historical studies to the facts of\n to-day. The American Army is accused of\n atrocities in the Philippine Islands. Some\n cases, far too many, have been proved of\n cruelties to native prisoners and to hostile\n natives, and more, I fear, will be proved. To\n me It is a source of bitter, bitter regret that\n any American, whether soldier abroad or\n civilian at home, should ever have tortured\n any one, or that any order should ever have\n been issued by an American general which,\n on its face, and without knowledge of the\n conditions, seems, as I said the other day in\n the Senate, revolting. But we as Senators,\n representatives of great states of this great\n Union, are not here to indulge in frothy de-\n nunciation, but to get at the truth, to punish\n the guilty when they are proved guilty, to\n mete out judgment upon proved offenses, and\n thereby in strict Justice to clear our honor\n and good name and keep the fame of our\n Army without spot or blemish.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThere has been an ingenious effort mads\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0008/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0008/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0008/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0008/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0008/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0008.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 853880}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"8\">\n<p>\n 6\n</p>\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n here from time to time to separate soldiers\n from officers. Soldiers are more numerous\n than officers. They have more votes. They\n have larger connections, more friends who\n vote, because there are 100,000 of them and\n only a few officers, comparatively. But, Mr.\n President, this separation cannot be made.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThere was brought before our committee,\n on the demand of a philanthropist \u2014 one of\n the kind evidently who never feels that his\n philanthropy is well exercised unless it in-\n volves in its exercise some shame to his\n country and some discredit and disgrace to\n his fellow citizens \u2014 there was brought before\n us a young officer of the Thirty-fifth Regi-\n ment, named Grover Flint. He testified that\n at Candaba, in the Island of Luzon, Maca-\n bebe scouts tortured a number of Filipinos \u2014\n twenty or more \u2014 with the water cure in or-\n der to make them reveal the places where\n their arms were concealed. He said that in\n the morning of the day after the town was\n taken, while this was going on, soldiers vol-\n unteered to go down to the well where it\n was being done; that there were no orders\n given; that he said to the major commanding\n \u2014 Major Geary\u2014 \u2018I think I had better go down\n there and see whether excesses are being\n committed,\u2019 and that he went down there.\n He was asked if he interfered. He said that\n he did in two or three cases where he\n thought excesses were being committed. I\n asked him, as was my duty\u2014 it was a painful\n question to ask and I disliked to put it\u2014 as\n to other cases where he did not interfere,\n \u2018Did you approve at the time what was be-\n ing done or did you not?\u2019 He answered that\n question with a fearless truth, painful as it\n was to him to do it, that he did approve it\n at the time, and I honored him for his brave,\n true answer.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some of the Filipinos\u2019 Acts.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMr. President, there were our own sol-\n diers and the young officer all engaged to-\n gether. You cannot part officers from men.\n Mr. Flint himself comes of a family eminent\n for three generations in the practice of one\n of the noblest of professions. He is a gradu-\n ate of Harvard College; he is an honorable\n man; he is a brave soldier; he has been\n wounded in battle\u2014 battle for the Republic.\n There must be some reason for these things,\n and presently I shall try to state it.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLet me give another example to show that\n you cannot separate the soldiers from the\n officers. Only last night I heard from a young\n officer who commanded a company that at\n the first skirmish in which they were engaged\n they drove back the insurgents and took the\n town. The insurgents in retreating carried\n off three of our men, carried them to a neigh-\n boring town, stripped them naked, and said\n that if they would cry \u2018Long live the Filipino\n Republic!\u2019 they might run away into the bush\n as they were. One man refused, and stood\n up there, naked, in the midst of that hostile\n crowd, and cried, \u2018Long live America!\u2019 They\n tied him to a tree, and the women and chil-\n dren stoned him to death. The other two,\n who lost heart and cried, \u2018Long live the\n Filipino Republic!\u2019 were cut to death with\n bolos; and the young officer said when they\n next went into battle the men cried out as\n they charged the enemy, \u2018Remember Parnay!\u2019\n Do you wonder that they did? I do not. I\n am not here to excuse torture or cruelty to\n any man, but I cannot forget that there is\n and ought to be, human nature, in an Amer-\n ican soldier under such circumstances as\n those.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe effort has been continued to separate\n tha officers from the commander. Listen to\n</p>\n<p>\n what the Senator from Utah (Mr. Rawlings)\n said about General Chaffee:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018Mr. President. I do not believe that\n Bell himself ever conceived this iniquity,\n this outline of policy. Perhaps it may have\n been Chaffee, who received his education in\n savagery \u2014 \u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMark the words, \u2018Who received his edu-\n cation in savagery\u2019 \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018and in cruelty and in barbarity over in\n China, where we are informed the allied\n forces took little children and brained them\n upon posts, threw them into rivers, and\n slaughtered and persecuted without mercy,\n and without limit helpless women. After he\n had received that training he superseded\n the more humane officer, General MacArthur.\n Then it was that this diabolical programme\n seems to have been adopted and carried out\n in all its hideousness and rigor.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAgainst those cruel words I set the rec-\n ord of General Chaffee.

After the\n war he passed into the regular Army. He\n gave the best twenty-five years of his life to\n service on the plains as a captain, with\n slight hope of promotion, serving with small\n pay in beat, in cold, at remote frontier posts,\n helping to guard those Western communi-\n ties against the shock of Indian warfare. He\n was doing this when the Senator from Utah\n was making those legal and historical\n studies and cultivating those gifts w ' hich\n have enabled him to delight a listening\n Senate. Ah, Mr. President, there are some\n things to be said for the man who gave\n his life in silence to that thankless work!\n From there he went into the war in Cuba,\n and then the long delayed promotions came\n to him.\n</p>\n<p>\n A Word of British Testimony.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Let me read you one word of description\n as to Chaffee in the Cuban campaign, not by\n an American witness, but by the British\n military attache. Colonel Lee, who was down\n there:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018The strong post \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018That is El Cai^ey \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \" \u2018The strong post had been carefully re-\n connoitered by Brigadier General Chaffee in\n person on June 28 and 29, and he had sub-\n mitted a plan of attack which was afterward\n carried out almost to the letter.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018I feel it only just at this point to men-\n tion that, however novel the absence of re-\n connolssance in other directions, nothing\n could have been more enterprising or sys-\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n tematic than General Chaffee\u2019s exploration\n of his own theater of operations. I had the\n pleasure of accompanying him on more than\n one occasion, and derived much profit from\n a study of his methods.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018Leaving his staff behind he would push\n far to the front, and, finally dismounting,\n slip through the brush with the rapidity and\n noiselessness of an Indian. My efforts to fol-\n low him were like the progress of a band\n wagon in comparison, but I gradually ac-\n quired a fairy like tread and a stumbling\n facility in sign language, which enabled me\n to follow the general without too loudly ad-\n vertising our presence to the Spaniards. On\n one occasion we approached so clo-se to the\n Spanish pickets that we could hear the men\n talking over their suppers, and until I began\n to speculate on the probable efficacy of the\n British passport, that was my sole defensive\n weapon. In this silent Indian fashion Gen-\n eral Chaffee explored the entire district, and\n was the only man in the Army to whom the\n network of bridle paths around El Caney was\n in any sense familiar.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAgain, I will read a word about him in\n battle:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018Wishing to see how they were faring, I\n crawled through the hedge into the field be;\n yond, and incidentally into such a hot cor-\n ner that I readily complied with General\n Chaffee\u2019s abrupt injunction, \u201cGet down on\n your stomach, sir.\u201d Indeed, I was distinctly\n grateful for his advice, but could not fail to\n notice that he was regardless of. it him-\n self. Wherever the fire was thickest he\n strolled about unconcernedly, a half smoked\n cigar between his teeth and an expression\n of exceeding grimness on his face. The sit-\n uation was a trying one for the nerves of\n the oldest soldier, and some of the younger\n hands fell buck from the firing line and\n crept toward the road. In a moment the\n General pounced upon them, inquiring their\n destination in low, unhoneyed accents, and\n then, taking them persuasively by the elbow,\n led them back to the extreme front, and,\n having deposited them in the firing line,\n stood over them while he distributed a few\n last words of pungent and sulphurous advice.\n Throughout the day he set the most inspir-\n ing example to his men, and that he escaped\n unhurt was a miracle. One bullet clipped a\n breast button off his coat, another passed\n under his shoulder strap, but neither touched\n him, and there must be some truth in the\n old adage that \u2018fortune favors the brave.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cSuch, Mr. President, is the description\n of an eye witnc ss of his conduct at El Caney.\n From there he went to China. The entire\n world bore witness to the conduct of the\n American troops in that campaign. No one,\n not the most jealous or the most envious\n among the foreigners, ever charged that the\n American troops were guilty of any of the\n cruelties or atrocities with which that cam-\n paign may have been smirched. It has been\n left to have the imputation made for the\n first time in the American Senate.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMr. President, those troops went there to\n save the legations, and when the allied com-\n manders were debating as to whether they\n should wait a month before starting \u2014 watt\n until the Germans arrived \u2014 it was Chaffee\n who stood up in the meeting after they had\n been talking and talking, and said, \u2018Gentle-\n men, whatever you may do, I march at once,\u2019\n and the Japanese general arose and said he\n trusted that the American general would\n permit him to go with him. Then they all\n went, and history tells the rest. Here is\n what General Chaffee himself says in his re-\n port for the year ended June 30, 1901:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" \u2018The unusual conditions which have sur-\n</p>\n<p>\n rounded the command, while offering many\n temptations and inducements to wrongdoing,\n cannot be permitted to excuse soldiers of\n our Army who, as citizens and soldiers, have\n been accorded instruction, through example\n in communities where living, that respect\n for law, protection of personal and public\n property and the maintenance of order are\n special requirements imposed upon all United\n States soldiers, never to be broken, under\n any circumstances. (Report of operations in\n Chirfa from November 30, 1900, to May 19,\n 1901, by Major General Adna R. Chaffee, U.\n S. A., from Report of the Lieutenant General\n commanding the Army for year ended June\n 30, 1901; Part IV, page 505.)\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThat is the order he issued to his men.\n That is the policy he pursued throughout the\n Chinese campaign. It was he who inter-\n fered, and attracted the attention of Europe\n by his interference, to prevent the loot of\n the great Chinese observatory. Mr. Presi-\n dent, after those brilliant services in China\n they are referred to here only that w-e may\n be told that it was there that he received his\n education in savagery.\n</p>\n<p>\n Attack on the President.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMr. President, not content with the at-\n tack upon General Chaffee, the effort has\n been made by implication to carry it still\n further. The source of military command in\n this country is the White House. All the\n world knows what was the attitude of Presi-\n dent McKinley. A soldier himself, the most\n humane and generous of men, we know his\n one word from the beginning to the end\n was to be merciful and kind, to uphold the\n authority of the United States, to carry on\n the war firmly and vigorously, because that\n was most merciful and most humane, but to\n show the greatest kindness and consideration\n to the people of the islands. From that pol-\n icy his successor has not deviated. No or-\n ders can be found issuing from the White\n House of which any American may not be\n proud. It is only the other day that the\n order went out from there to investigate and\n probe to the bottom, and that whoever had\n done wrong, to bring him to speedy and\n prompt justice.\n</p>\n<p>\n ' Then, passing from the Presidents, the\n effort has been made to lay the blame upon\n the Secretary of War. Mr. President, as he\n has been attacked I desire here in my place\n to say one word in regard to him. In all\n the long list of able men of all parties who\n have held the great post of Secretary of War\n I think there ha3 been no abler, no more\n public-spirited man than the one wh* now\n holds it. He took it at a time of great trial\n \u2014 with difficulties in China, with difficulties\n In Cuba, with difficulties in the Philippines,\n and lie has borne that burden with strength,\n with honesty, with courage. He has wrought\n for improvements in the Army, many of\n w-hich have b^en attained, which will stand\n in our history as great advances In the im-\n provement of o*r military organization. He\n set himself to -Bfre defects which the Span-\n ish War disclosed\u201d and his labors in great part\n have been crowned with success. He is a\n man of high ability, of irreproachable honor,\n and of quite as great humanity as any who\n rail at him. He has been especially at-\n tacked in regard to the Major Gardener re-\n port and charged with deliberate suppres-\n sion, because he did exactly what the Senate\n is doing to-day \u2014 leave it to the board there,\n where the witnesses and the accused are to\n make the first inquiry. When those charges,\n sweeping, nameless, without date or specifi-\n cation, were laid before him he felt that It\n was his duty not only to probe the matter t*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0010/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0010/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0010/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0010/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0010/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0010.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 875007}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"10\">\n<p>\n 8\n</p>\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n the bottom, but also to see that the officers\n of the Army committed to his. charge had\n fair play and exact justice; that the accuser\n and his witnesses should be in the same\n place where the accused and their witnesses\n were gathered.

They fall\n upon the entire organization. Senators who\n have listened, as I have listened, to the\n speeches which have been made upon the\n other side will realize the truth of what I\n say. Senators who listened to or who have\n read the course of the questioning pursued\n with witnesses before the Philippine com-\n mittee will realize the truth of what I say\n when I assert that these attacks are leveled\n at the entire American Army, from the com-\n mander to the private. I would not do any\n one an injustice, but let me read as an ex-\n ample a single question that was asked on\n Saturday of a witness before the committee\n by the Senator from Texas (Mr. Culberson):\n</p>\n<p>\n \" \u2018By Senator Culberson:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018Q. You have testified, I believe, that five\n or six of these men were killed in attempting\n to escape?\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018A. Yes, sir.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018Q. Do you know whether or not their ef-\n fort to escape was encouraged by the Amer-\n ican officers and soldiers?\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018A I do not know, sir.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018Q. What I want to find out was whether\n It was a bona fide effort on their part to es-\n cape or whether they were ever encouraged\n to make the effort tor the purpose or afford-\n ing an opportunity to shoot them. How was\n that?\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018A. All that I know is that it was re-\n ported that they were killed while trying to\n escape.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMr. President, that seems to me a terrible\n imputation upon American officers and sol-\n diers. What is proved?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Culberson \u2014 I have just come into the\n chamber and I heard the last portion of the\n remark of the Senator from Massachusetts.\n</p>\n<p>\n I desire to say that before propounding\n that question to the witness I spoke to one\n of my associates beside me on the committee\n and said that I intended to ask the question\n so that the real truth might be known and\n that there should be left nothing undone, so\n far as the committee was concerned, to es-\n</p>\n<p>\n tablish clearly the fact that there had been\n no connivance upon the part of American\n troops with reference to that attempted es-\n cape.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Lodge \u2014 If the question w ' as asked in\n order to vindicate and defend the honor of\n American officers and soldiers, it certainly\n meets with my cordial approbation; but as\n it reads it seems to me open to miscon-\n struction. t \u00bb- *4\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Now, what is proved? No case of cruelly\n has been proved before our committee less\n than a year old, some eighteen months old,\n and some two years. All the witnesses,\n without exception, have testified to the kind-\n ness of our troops toward the peaceful\n Filipino natives. They all have testified t#\n the good care and treatment of the wounded\n in our own hospitals by our own doctor^\n and nurses. No case of cruelty has been\n proved that did not occur while guerrilla\n warfare existed and where war was flagrant.\n</p>\n<p>\n Burning of Towns a Military Necessity.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cTowns, it is true, have been burned, and\n before this towns have been burned in war.\n Towns were burned where insurgents were\n sheltered, or where it was believed they had\n ^ielp, or where attacks were made upon our\n troops after occupancy. It was a militarfl\n necessity. Towns have been burned before\n in war. They were burned in our Civil War\n by troops of bot ' i sides, and the towns then\n burned were not composed of nipa huts.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMr. President, there was the case of\n young Meiggs, who was shot by bushw ' hack-\n ers in the Shenandoah Valley. General\n Sheridan sent his staff officers around to\n the neighboring houses, from one of w r hicb\n this boy had been killed, and gave orders to\n the inhabitants to leave, and then he burned\n them to the ground. Let me go outside oi\n our own record. I read from a book, en-\n titled, \u2018With an Ambulance During the\n Franco-Prussian War,\u2019 an account of the\n burning of Bazeilles:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018The French inhabitants had fired upon\n the Bavarians; they had set their bedding\n and furniture alight and thrown them on\n the heads of the Germans, who were packed\n close in the streets, and after the first re-\n pulse of the invaders (Germans), several\n wounded Prussians had been barbarously\n butchered; some even had had their throats\n cut with razors.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018Upon retaking the village, when the Ger-\n mans discovered what had been done, they\n retaliated by shooting them and bayoneting\n all before them; nor in some instances did\n the women and children escape this cruel\n fate. So exasperated, indeed, were the Ger-\n mans that not a life did they spare nor a\n house did they leave intact in that miserable\n town.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cFrom the same book, chapter 12, page\n 136:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018On coming to Mantes we put up for the\n night at the Hotel de France. Much con-\n sternation had been caused the day before\n by five Uhlans coming into the market place\n with a train of wagons and carrying off all\n the corn and fodder they wanted. Then the\n Uhlans proceeded to set the station house on\n fire, as also to saw down the telegraph\n posts. \u201cWhat pluck these five men must\n have had!\u201d will be the reader\u2019s exclamation.\n But the feat was not so daring. Every one\n knew that if the inhabitants interfered with\n these Uhlans the place would be visited the\n day after and reduced to ashes.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cSo the Germans treated guerrilla war-\n fare, and the Germans are a kindly prople,\n highly civilized, and were carrying of^war\n against another civilized people under the\n</p>\n<p>\n rules of war recognized by all nations. The\n burning of towns which shelter guerrillas in\n a guerrilla warfare Is a common incident of\n war. War is horrible, but it is by such\n methods that guerrilla warfare Is put down\n and stopped. Now, take the evidence as to\n a single town, the town of Igbaras. It ap-\n pears from the testimony of witnesses t\u00a3at\n the people were warned. The witnesses were\n asked repeatedly whether women or children\n were burned in the fire, but they knew of\n none; and that, I suppose, is a fair instance\n of the towns which have been burned in the\n course of the war.\n</p>\n<p>\n No Proven Case of Killing Women oi\n Children.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThat reminds me of women and children.\n They have been slaughtered by myriads, in\n the speeches made on the other side, but, as\n far as I am aware, there has not been a case\n proved of the intentional killing of a woman\n or child by an American soldier or officer iD\n the Philippines. Now, what remains? A\n certain number of proved cases of water\n oure, of menaces of shooting, unless infor-\n mation was given up; of rough and cruel\n treatment applied to secure Information.\n That such cases have occured in different\n parts of the islands is incontestable, and we\n all deeply regret it. We all wish to see jus-\n tice done upon those who are guilty. We do\n not like to think of any American soldier or\n officer torturing a prisoner or a helpless\n man. But as soon as it was known that this\n had been done every effort was made to stop\n it. Most stringent orders went out from\n Washington not only to stop such practices\n where they existed, but to bring to punish-\n ment those who were guilty of them. They\n appear to have stopped, but, as I have said,\n there ha3 not yet been a case shown, that is\n not at least a year old. What concerns us\n is to know \u2014 \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 I will say to the Senator\n that it is practically impossible, under the\n rules of the committee, to prove anything\n that is going on there now. We can only\n prove the incidents that have occurred by\n soldiers who have returned from the Phil-\n ippine Islands. We cannot bring anybody\n from there at this time to prove what is be-\n ing done now.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Lodge: \u201cMr. President, I shall let my\n statement stand, for it states the evidence,\n as I believe correctly. What concerns ub\n and it concerns us very deeply, is to know\n why these things ever happened at all at\n any time, near or remote. Whatever has\n been done has been done by the American\n Army. What is the American Army? One\n would suppose from what has been said here\n in debate that it was an army of aliens and\n mercenaries; that we had out there in the\n Philippine Islands some strange foreign force\n which we had let loose upon that helpless\n people.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWhy, Mr. President, those soldiers are\n our own. They are our flesh and blood,\n bone of our bone, flesh of our flesh. They\n are volunteers, all of them. There is no\n conscription in this country. The men in\n the regular Army are in it as the result of\n volunteer enlistment. Thirty-five thousand\n of the men out there jvere United States\n volunteers. They are men drawn from our\n American communities, from all ranks and\n conditions of life \u2014 graduates of West Point,\n graduates of Harvard and of Yale, young\n men who were in the Spanish War and went\n from thence to the \u2019Philippines, graduates of\n our high schools and our common schools.\n Amid that great body of men there were no\n doubt some black sheep.

That, Mr.\n President, is what I want now to explain.\n</p>\n<p>\n I think I know why these things have hap-\n pened. I think they have grown out of the\n conditions of warfare, of the war that was\n waged by the Filipinos themselves, a semi-\n civilized people, with all the tendencies and\n characteristics of Asiatics, with the Asiatic\n Indifference to life, with the Asiatic treach-\n ery and the Asiatic cruelty, all tinctured by\n three hundred years of subjection to Spain.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHalf the story has been told on this floor.\n</p>\n<p>\n I want to tell the other half, and I invite\n attention to it. It may be dry In places, but\n It deserves attention, for the honor of the\n American name is concerned in knowing why\n these things have happened as they have\n happened.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLet me take the first case, which has\n been so much talked about \u2014 the case of the\n presidente to whom was given the water\n cure at Igbaras. He was the presidente of\n the village. He pretended that he was our\n friend; that he was favorable to us. He\n was really a captain of the insurgents, and\n his police force were men belonging to the\n Insurgent ranks. He was living within our\n lines. He did not wear his uniform. He\n came within the technical definition of a\n spy. He could have been taken out and shot\n after a drumhead court-martial with the\n same justice that Andre was hanged. Our\n men discovered him and believed that he\n was treacherous. They administered the\n water cure to him and to two or three of\n the policemen, in order to get information\n as to where the insurgents had gone. It was\n administered to him twice. It was not ad-\n ministered in retaliation; it was not admin-\n istered as a punishment. It was adminis-\n tered to get information, and when they got\n the information he mounted his horse and\n rode with them across the mountains to\n \u25a0how them where the insurgents had gone,\n and they then took him to prison at Iloilo.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cNow, those are the facts, told without\n any reduction. Igbaras is situated a little\n north of Iloilo. In its neighborhood is the\n town of Dumangas. I ask attention to these\n towns and distances. In its neighborhood is\n Dumangas, lying off to the eastward. Du-\n mangas is forty miles distant. To the south\n and east Leganes and Mina and Barota, re-\n spectively, twenty-four, twenty-eight and\n thirty-two miles. Up to the northeast is\n Calinog, twenty-eight miles; Dingle, twenty-\n four miles; Pototan, twenty-four miles, and\n Loon, nine miles. Those are the towns and\n the distances I have mentioned. The far-\n thest city is only as distant as Baltimore is\n from Washington. They are a part of the\n towns of the Province of Iloilo, not far from\n the capital. I now read from an official re-\n port:\n</p>\n<p>\n Dead Body Dug Up, Burned and Muti-\n lated.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAt Dumangas the body of Corporal Don-\n elly of Company D was dug up, burned and\n mutilated. Colonel Dickman says details\n can be furnished of the butcheries at Le-\n ganes and Mina, and of the burial alive near\n</p>\n<p>\n Barotac Neuvo. There has been no demand\n from the opposition for those details. At\n Calinog, Privates Dugan, Hayes and Tracy\n of Company F were murdered by the town\n authorities. Private Nolan, at Dingle, was\n tied up while in a stupor; the insurgents\n were sent for and cut his throat with a san-\n gut. Lieutenant Max Wagner was assassi-\n nated on the road to Pototan. I happened to\n know that young officer; he came from my\n state. *\n</p>\n<p>\n \" I knew him first as a Signal Service ser-\n geant at Nantucket in charge of the govern-\n ment cable. He went into the Spanish war.\n He served well in Porto Rico. He then got\n a commission as lieutenant and went out to\n the Philippines. He was murdered on the\n road, by Filipinos dressed in American uni-\n form. I have heard no word of sympathy for\n him. I feel sympathy for him because I\n knew him. His widow and three little chil-\n dren are in the town of Nantucket, and there\n is a bill on your calendar to give her a pen-\n sion.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cPrivate O\u2019Hearn was captured by appar-\n ently friendly people near Leon, was tied\n to a tree, burned for four hours with a slow\n fire, and finally slashed up. We had a wit-\n ness who told about the water cure as ad-\n ministered at Leon. It was administered to\n the men who had seized O\u2019Hearn, burned him\n for four hours, and slashed him up with\n bolos. They confessed to it under the water\n cure. Information was brought by another\n native w r ho had previously confessed. It was\n not denied afterward. His bones are buried\n out there. He did not get on a horse that\n afternoon and ride away. It is only Private\n O\u2019 Hearn; that is all. It is an American sol-\n dier; that is all. I have not heard of any\n sympathy from the opposition or from phil-\n anthropists for him. I have not heard that\n atrocity denounced in this debate. And yet\n there it is, and those are the cases occur-\n ring around that town of Igbaras alone.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI read from another official report: \u2018On\n January 10 five bodies of native scouts, who,\n with one soldier of the Fifth Infantry, were\n taken prisoners in a barrio off Batac Janu-\n ary 1, were found east of Batac. The heads,\n legs and arms had been cut off and the\n bodies otherwise mutilated. One white sol-\n dier named Lyons, Company K, Fifth Infan-\n try, after having been taken prisoner, was\n cut with bolos and was left for dead on the\n field. He revived, and was able to crawl to\n a shack when night came on. Information\n was given to a local leader, and he was again\n taken prisoner and murdered.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI now read from some of the court reports\n cases where men were captured, regularly\n tried, and these cases proved by witnesses.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018The accused (Marciliano Bergara) and\n his semi-soldiers wore no uniform, continued\n in their peaceful occupations, and came to-\n gether only upon special call. In this man-\n ner it is evident that they had no special\n difficulty in concealing their identification\n as banded men; but it is plain from the evi-\n dence the accused found his prisoners a great\n embarrassment, as the near presence of the\n American forces threatened to make it im-\n practicable for him to successfully conceal\n them and at the same time keep concealed\n his own status of guerrilla. Hence his reso-\n lution to murder his prisoners. Five of his\n followers agree in their testimony that, in\n obedience to the orders of the accused, they\n came together at an appointed place, and,\n with bolos in their hands, hacked to death\n these two men, the accused standing by to\n witness the execution of his orders. Cover-\n</p>\n<p>\n ing the dead bodies with grass the band thea\n dispersed, each man going his own way.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Another case:\n</p>\n<p>\n Plain Case of Assassination.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" In the foregoing case it appears that this\n accused, Damascio Biating, native, about\n August 17, 1900, with one or more compan-\n ions, assassinated with daggers, Private T.\n Burgey, Company C, Twenty-sixth Infantry,\n United States Volunteers, while the latter\n was acting as a guard of prisoners hauling\n water for the garrison stationed at Baratoo\n Neuvo, Panay. It also appears that the ac-\n cused participated in similar assassinations\n of a native, Gervacio Besas, August 29, 1900.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" To the first charge accused pleaded guilty '\n and the evidence fully sustains the charge,\n and also the second charge.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAccused claims to have been a regular\n insurgent soldier, operating against United\n States troops, of which Private Burgey was\n one, and to have been acting under the or-\n ders of his superiors. Opposed to this plea\n is the fact that he was within the American\n lines, uniformed and disguised as a pacific\u00a9.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" I read only here and there:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018In the foregoing case it appears tnat\n the accused. Juan Biron, an alleged lieuten-\n ant of the insurgent army, captured at Bas-\n caran, Albay, one Felix Losedo, a scout in\n the employ of the United States, bound him\n to a tree and then with a razor cut off an\n ear and slashed his eyes with the intent to\n blind him, with the result that the sight of\n one was totally destroyed and that of th\u00ab\n other permanently impaired.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAgain:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018In the foregoing case it appears that th*\n accused, Julian Confesor, native, while hold-\n ing the respective offices of presidente and\n vice presidente of the Pueblo of Cabatuan,\n during a portion of which time he was under\n oath of allegiance to the government, syste-\n matically exerted his individual energies and\n official functions to the aid and assistance\n of the insurgents by supplying them with\n information, money and needed supplies. Gen-\n eral orders were issued by him to the police\n to abstract arms from the American soldiers\n where opportunity presented itself; to kill\n American soldiers where they could be indi-\n vidually isolated from their companions, and\n specifically it is shown that he caused two of\n the policemen of his pueblo to assassinate\n Private George O. Hill, Eighteenth United\n States Infantry, and then sent the rifle of the\n dead soldier to the insurgents.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAnother case:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" \u2018Rosario Espiritu, a Filipino and resident\n of Bacoor, Island of Luzon, P. I., did, on or\n about the 15th day of November, 1899, then,\n as now, a time of insurrection, at Bacoor,\n Island of Luzon, P. I., then, as now, a place\n under the United States military occupation\n and government, feloniously, -willfully ani\n with malice aforethought, kill and murder\n one Private George A.

I could multiply them. I have pages\n of them here which I will print as an appen-\n dix. Here is another:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018At or near the rancheria of Sabed,\n Union, Luzon, during tho month of March,\n 1900, this accused ordered a squad of his\n command to kill these prisoners with bayo-\n nets at a preconcerted signal.

He was after the\n smugglers who bring arms to the insurgents\n from Leyte. The great gale had blown the\n yawl out into the Pacific, and when it sub-\n sided little Noah and his six men were ex-\n hausted. Their water had given out, and they\n tried to make Basay, Admiral Rogers having\n ordered them not to land except at an armed\n post. The wind died away while Basay was\n still two miles off.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018Two of his men were delirious with\n thirst, and there was the little village of\n Nipa Nipa only a few hundred yards away\n flying the white flag of peace and friendship.\n Noah, as he floated near the shore, lifted up\n his empty water jar, and the kindly people on\n the beach understood. They lifted up water\n jars overflowing with the precious fluid and\n pointed at the white flag to reassure him. He\n pushed his boat into the surf, and, telling\n his men to wait in the boat, advanced some\n fifty yards up the beach, where the good\n Samaritans were awaiting him with their\n water jars. As he drank the first deep draft\n two of the natives, one a woman, crept be-\n hind him and burled their knives in his\n back.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThat little midshipman comes from Chat-\n taDOOga, Tenn., I believe, and he lies buried\n there in the Philippines, the victim of as\n foul a murder as ever was done. We do not\n whine as a people over our men who die in\n battle with their face to the foe. Our grief\n is proud, and we lift them up and bury them\n with the silent sorrow of a nation. But that\n boy was murdered, and if justice is sought I\n want it on his murderers as well as on\n American soldiers. (Applause in the gal-\n leries.)\n</p>\n<p>\n Treatment of an American Sailor.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMr. President, one more case and I have\n done. The man was an American sailor, and\n I ask the attention of the Senate to this\n case:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018With respect to the first specification, it\n is made plain by the testimony that after\n the fight had by Lieutenant Gilmore of the\n Navy, near Baler, four American sailors lay\n on the bank of the Sabali River, and that the\n accused and a detachment of insurgent\n soldiers were detailed as a burial party.\n This party, accompanied by one Quicoy, a\n staff officer of the insurgent chief who com-\n manded the district wherein Baler is sit-\n uated and the forces serving therein, pro-\n ceeded to where the American lay and found\n two dead and two wounded. Four unarmed\n natives had been compelled to go along to\n act as gravediggers, and these were put to\n work preparing a grave sufficiently large\n to hold four bodies. The grave being com-\n pleted the two dead sailors were placed in\n it, and the party then waited for the wound-\n ed to die.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018One of the latter was shot through the\n thigh; the other was shot in the chest as\n well as in the leg, and was near the point\n of death. The wounded men asked for water,\n and it was given them from the river, but\n beyond this no relief or assistance appears\n .to have been given. When the third man\n died he was placed beside the other in the\n grave and the party again waited for the\n fourth man to die. His w\u2019ound, however,\n w ' as of a kind not necessarily fatal,\n death was slow in coming, so that the\n party became impatient. The grave dig-\n gers had begun about 9 A. M. and it was\n now past noon. The dying man asked for\n water and was able to drink when it was\n given to him- Shortly afterward he was\n placed in the grave beside his three com-\n</p>\n<p>\n ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n rades, and the native who was standing in\n the hole began covering him slowly from the\n feet, so as to give him time to die. In this\n way the body was covered to the neck, and\n then the grave digger called out, \" What\n about this man; he is alive yet\u201d; to which\n the accused replied, \u201cGo on burying him,\n and it was done.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAh, Mr. President, I think when we read\n cases like that, and I have read only a very\n few out of many, we can understand at least\n why the incidents that we all so deplore have\n arisen.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBut, Mr. President. I have read thus far\n only what has been done to American sol-\n diers and sailors. I have here, and I am\n going to print as an appendix, the proved\n cases in regard to friendly natives. I shall\n confine myself in speaking of the natives to\n seme statistics. I will not weary the Senate\n by reading case after case. I will print\n them, with the permission of the Senate, as\n an appsndix to my remarks. They well de-\n serve reading and consideration, but they\n would consume more time than I can give\n them now.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe actual number of natives returned by\n the officers in the different districts who have\n been assassinated for sympathizing with\n Americans is three hundred and fifty. The\n number of natives who have been assaulted\n and mutilated for sympathizing with Amer-\n icans is four hundred and forty-two. The\n number of municipal officers friendly to\n Americans who have been assassinated is\n sixty-seven, and the number of municipal\n officers who have been assaulted and muti-\n lated is forty.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe are told, Mr. President, that we have\n no friends among the Filipinos. Apparently\n the Insurgents tnought we had enough friends\n to make up this awful roll of assassination,\n for they were assassinated for being our\n friends, for being pacific natives, friendly to\n the Americans. Why, Mr. President, I have\n heard torrents of sympathy poured out for\n the insurgents fighting against the flag and\n the authority of the United States, and not\n oue word of sympathy for the Filipinos, men\n of the same race, who are friendly to us,\n and ask only to live in peace beneath our\n flag. Has it come to this, that it is a crime\n to be friendly to America, and that the mea\n who are cut down and mutilated and die\n because they are our friends are to have no\n sympathy? No grea ' . divine has yet thun-\n dered in his pulpit in behalf of ' those men on\n that list whose lives were as dear to them\n as were the lives of those Filipinos who were\n aiding the insurgents. They were our\n friends, and there are more of them there.\n I say that, whatever else may be true or\n false, if we go out of those islands and\n leave those friendly Filipinos to a fate\n like that, we are unworthy of the name\n of a great nation, and it will be a deeper in-\n famy than any cruelty that has ever been\n proved. Those people trusted to us, they\n have been murdered for us, and those who\n survived and live under our protection are\n still entitled to our protection.

HOAR, OF MASSACHUSETTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Delivered in the United States Senate, Thursday, May 22, 1902.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the pending Philippine Government\n Bill, Senator Hoar addressed the Senate as\n follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n Declaration of Independence and the\n Monroe Doctrine.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President \u2014 I have something to say,\n which I will say as briefly and as compactly\n as I may, upon the pending bill. We have to\n deal with a territory 10,000 miles away, 1,200\n miles In extent, containing 10,000,000 people.\n A majority of the Senate think that people\n are under the American flag and lawfully\n subject to our authority. We are not at war\n with them or with anybody. The country is\n in a condition of profound peace as well as\n of unexampled prosperity. For us the tem-\n ple of Janus is open. The world is in pro-\n found peace, except in one quarter, in South\n Africa, where a handful of republicans are\n fighting for their independence, and have\n been doing better fighting than has been\n done on the face of the earth since Ther-\n mopylae, or certainly since Bannockburn.\n The Filipinos have a right to call it war.\n They claim to be a people and to be fight-\n ing for their rights as a people. The Sen-\n ator from Ohio (Mr. Foraker) admits that\n there is a people there, although he says\n they are not one people, but there are sev-\n eral. But we cannot be at war under the\n constitution without an act of Congress.\n</p>\n<p>\n We are not at war. We made peace with\n Spain on the 14th day of February, 1S99.\n Congress has never declared war with the\n people of the Philippine Islands. The Presi-\n dent has never asserted nor usurped the\n power to do it. We are only doing on a\n large scale exactly what we have done at\n home within a few years past, where the\n military forces of the United States have\n been called out to suppress a riot or a\n tumult or a lawless assembly, too strong for\n the local authorities. You have the same\n right to administer the water torture, or to\n hang men by the thumbs, to extort confes-\n sion, in one case as in the other. You have\n the same right to do it in Cleveland or Pitts-\n burg or at Colorado Springs as you have to\n do it within the Philippine Islands. I have\n the same right as an American citizen or\n</p>\n<p>\n an American Senator to discuss the conduct\n of any military officer in the Philippine Is-\n lands that I have to discuss the conduct of\n a marshal or a constable or a captain in\n Pittsburg or in Cleveland if there were a\n labor riot there. That duty I mean to per-\n form to the best of my ability, fearlessly as\n becomes an American citizen, and honestly\n as becomes an American Senator. But I\n have an anterior duty and an anterior right\n to talk about the action of the American\n Senate, both in the past and in the present,\n for which, as no man will deny, I have my\n full share of personal responsibility.\n</p>\n<p>\n Bound to Keep the Faith.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Senator from Ohio, in his very brill-\n iant and forcible speech, which I heard with\n delight and instruction, said that we vrere\n bound to restore order in the Philippine Isl-\n ands, and we cannot leave them till that\n should be done. He said we were bound to\n keep the faith we pledged to Spain in the\n treaty, and that we were bound before we\n left to see that secured. He said we were\n bound especially to look out for the safety\n of the Filipinos who had been our friends,\n and that we could not. in honor, depart un-\n til that should be made secure. All that,\n Mr. President, is true. So far as I know,\n no man has doubted it. But these things\n are not what we are fighting for; not one of\n them. There never was a time when, if we\n had declared that we only were there to\n keep faith with Spain and that we only were\n there to restore order, that we were only\n there to see that no friend of ours should\n suffer at the hands of any enemy of ours,\n that the war would not have ended in that\n moment.\n</p>\n<p>\n You are fighting for sovereignty. You are\n fighting for the principle of eternal dominion\n over that people, and that is the only ques-\n tion in issue in the conflict. We said in the\n case of Cuba that she had a right to be free\n and independent. We affirmed in the Teller\n resolution, I think without a negative voice,\n that we would not invade that right and\n would not meddle with her territory or any-\n thing that belonged to her. That declaration\n was a declaration of peace ae well as of\n</p>\n<p>\n righteousnesss, and we made the treaty, so\n far as concerned Cuba, and conducted the\n war and have conducted ourselves ever since\n on that theory \u2014 that we had no right to in-\n terfere with her independence; that we had\n no right to her territory or to anything that\n was Cuba\u2019s. So we only demanded in the\n treaty that Spain should hereafter let her\n alone. If you had done to Cuba as you\n have done to the Philippine Islands, who had\n exactly the same right, you would be at this\n moment in Cuba just w T here Spain was when\n she excited the indignation of the civilized\n world and we compelled her to let go. And\n if you had done in the Philippines as you\n did in Cuba you would be to-day or would\n soon be In those islands as you are in Cuba.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sovereignty That People Denied.\n</p>\n<p>\n But you made a totally different declara-\n tion about the Philippine Islands. You\n undertook in the treaty to acquire sover-\n eignty over her for yourself, which that peo-\n ple denied. You declared not only in the\n treaty, but in many public utterances in this\n chamber and elsewhere, that you had a right\n to buy sovereignty with money, or to treat\n it as the spoils of war or the booty of bat-\n tle. The moment you made that declaration\n the Filipino people gave you notice that they\n treated it as a declaration of war. So your\n generals reported, and so Aguinaldo express-\n ly declared. The President sent out an- order\n to take forcible possession, by military power,\n of those islands. General Otis tried to sup-\n press it, but it leaked out at Iloilo through\n General Miller. General Otis tried to sup-\n press it and substitute that they should have\n all the rights of the most favored provinces.\n He stated that he did that because he knew\n the proclamation would bring on war. And\n the next day Aguinaldo covered the walls of\n Manila with a proclamation stating what\n President McKinley had done, and saying\n that if that were persisted in he and his\n people would fight, and General MacArthur\n testified that Aguinaldo represented the en-\n tire people. So you deliebrately made up the\n issue for a fight for dominion on one side\n and a fight for liberty on the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then when you had ratified the treaty you\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0015/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0015/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0015/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0015/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0015/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0015.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 872387}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"15\">\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13\n</p>\n<p>\n voted down the resolution in the Senate,\n known as the Bacon resolution, declaring the\n right of that people to independence, and you\n passed the McEnery resolution, which de-\n clared that you meant to dispose of those\n islands as should be for the interest of the\n United States. That was the origin of the\n war, if it be war. That is what the war is\n all about, if it be war; and it is idle for my\n brilliant and ingenious friend from Ohio to\n undertake to divert this issue to a contest\n on our part to enable us to keep faith with\n our friends among the Filipinos, or to re-\n store order there, or to carry out the pro-\n visions of the treaty with Spain. Now, Mr.\n ' President, when you determined to resort to\n force for that purpose, you took upon your-\n self every natural consequence of that con-\n dition. The natural result of a conflict of\n arms between a people coming out of subjec-\n tion and a highly civilized people \u2014 one weak\n and the other strong, with all the powers\n and resources of civilization \u2014 is inevitably,\n as everybody knows, that there will be cruel-\n ty on one side and retaliation by cruelty on\n the other. You knew it even before it hap-\n pened, as well as you know it now that it has\n happened; and the responsibility is yours.\n</p>\n<p>\n If, In a conflict between a people fighting\n for independence and liberty, being a weak\n people, and a people striving to deprive\n them of their independence and liberty, be-\n ing a strong people always, if the nature of\n man remains unchanged, the war is con-\n verted in the end into a conflict in which\n bushwhacking, treachery, and cruelty have\n to be encountered. The responsibility is\n with the men who made the war. Conflicts\n between white races and brown races, or\n red races or black racej, between superior\n races and inferior races, are always cruel\n on both sides, and the men who decree\n with full notice that such conflict shall\n take place are the men on whom the re-\n sponsibility rests. When Aguinaldo said he\n did not desire the conflict to go on, and\n that it went on against his wish, he w T as\n told by our general that he would not par-\n ley with him without total submission. My\n friend from Wisconsin declared in the Sen-\n ate that we would have no talk with men\n with arms in their hands, whether we were\n right or wrong. The responsibility of every-\n thing that has happened since, which he\n must have forseen if he knew anything of\n history and human nature, rests upon him\n and the men who acted with him.\n</p>\n<p>\n Chose War Instead of Peace.\n</p>\n<p>\n We cannot get rid of this one fact, we\n cannot escape it, and we cannot flinch from\n it. You chose war, instead of peace. You\n chose force, instead of conciliation, with\n full notice that everything that has hap-\n pened since would happen as a consequence\n of your decision. Had you made a declar-\n ation to Aguinaldo that you would respect\n their title to independence, and that all you\n desired ' was order and to fulfill the treaty\n and to protect your friends, you would have\n disarmed that people in a moment. I be-\n lieve there never has been a time since\n when a like declaration made by this\n chamber alone, but certainly made by this\n chamber and the other House, with the ap-\n proval of the Prseident, would not have\n ended this conflict and prevented all these\n horrors.\n</p>\n<p>\n Instead of that, gentlemen talked of the\n wealth of the Philippine Islands and about\n the advantage to our trade. They sought\n to dazzle our eyes with nuggets of other\n men ' s gold. Senators declared in the Senate\n Chamber and on the hustings that the flag\n never shall be hauled down in the Philip-\n</p>\n<p>\n pine Islands, and those of you who think\n otherwise keep silent and enter no disclaim-\n er. The Senator from Ohio says our policy\n has not been in the dark, but it has been a\n policy published to the world. Has it? Has\n it? I want to ask. What was it which\n created the war, which keeps it up, which\n created and keeps up the hatred and will\n make war break out again and again for cen-\n turies to come, unless \u2022 human nature be\n changed or be different in their bosoms from\n what it is in ours? It is because you keep a\n padlock on your lips.\n</p>\n<p>\n This debate for the last three years has\n contained many audacities. One thing, how-\n ever, no Senator has been audacious enough\n to affirm, and that is that if, he were a Fili-\n pino, as he is an American, he would not do\n exactly, saving only acts of cruelty, as the\n Filipino has done.\n</p>\n<p>\n I find myself beset with one difficulty\n whenever I undertake to debate this ques-\n tion. I am to discuss and denounce what\n seems to me one of the most foolish and\n wicked chapters in history. Yet I am com-\n pelled to admit that the men w T ho are re-\n sponsible for it are neither foolish nor wick-\n ed. On the contrary, there are no men on\n the face of the earth with whom on nearly\n all other subjects I am in general more in\n accord, to whose sound judgment or practi-\n cal sagacity I am more willing to defer, or\n to whose patriotism or humanity I am more\n willing to commit the honor or the fate of\n the republic.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Flag Has Been Hauled Down.\n</p>\n<p>\n It may be that it is presumption to act\n on my own judgment against that of my val-\n ued and beloved political friends. But we\n do not settlo questions of righteousness or\n justice on any man\u2019s authority. Still less\n do we settle them by a show of hands.\n Each man is responsible only to his own\n conscience, which is the only authority he\n must obey. Besides, Mr. President, I have\n on my side in this great debate the fathers\n of the republic, the statesmen who adorned\n its first century, the founders of the Repub-\n lican party, every one of whom declared and\n lived and died by the doctrine you are now\n repudiating. I have also your own author-\n ity, your own declaration, made only three\n years ago, at the beginning of the Spanish\n war. When you declared that Cuba of right\n \u2014 of right \u2014 ought to be a free and independ-\n ent State, and that the United States would\n not acquire her territory as the result of the\n war with Spain, you settled as a matter of\n duty and of justice this whole Philippine\n question. I have, however, at least, to con-\n gratulate my friends who differ from me on\n an increased sobriety in dealing with this\n matter. We are not flourishing nuggets of\n gold in the Senate just now. The devil im-\n perialism is not promising us all the king-\n doms of this world and the glory thereof, if\n we fall down and worship him. You have\n just hauled down the American flag in China,\n where it once floated, and you have just\n hauled it down in Cuba, where it has floated\n for three years. For the words,\u2019 \u201cInterests of\n the United States,\u201d which the McEnery reso-\n lution declared were to determine our ac-\n tions in governing these islands, you sub-\n stitute in this bill the declaration that \" The\n rights acquired in the Philippine Islands\n under the treaty with Spain are to be ad-\n ministered for the benefit of the inhabitants\n of those islands.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cSec. 10. That all the property and rights\n which may have been acquired in the Philip-\n pine Islands by the United States under the\n treaty of peace with Spain, 1898, are hereby\n</p>\n<p>\n placed under the control of the Government\n of the Philippine Islands, to be administered\n for the benefit of inhabitants of the islands.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cSec. 7. There are to be municipal and\n provincial governments as far and as fast as\n the governments are capable, fit and ready\n for the same, with popular representative gov-\n ernment.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The share which you propose to admit these\n people in your scheme of government, is an\n admission that a large number of them are\n fit for self-government. You propose for them\n \u2014to take effect in the near future, a consti-\n tution, not very different from that of Canada,\n where the crown of England appoints the\n governor general, and the governor general\n appoints tho senate and there is a veto on\n every provincial law by the governor general,\n and a veto on every law of the Canadian\n Congress, not only by the governor general,\n but by the government at home.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many Filipinos Are Our Friends.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Senator from New Hampshire called a\n witness the other day to the effect that every\n Filipino would take a bride. Sir Robert Wal-\n pole said that of England. I acquit the\n majority of the Senate and the committee\n who report this bill from believing the charge\n made by my honorable friend from New\n Hampshire. They affirm that there are many\n Filipinos who are sincerely our friends. They\n admit, if I understand them, that there are in\n those islands many citizens accomplished and\n well educated, lawyers and merchants, con-\n ducting large affairs in trade, and they them-\n selves propose to commit to these people at\n once, as soon as may be, large powers of\n government, retaining for us little more than\n the power of a veto.\n</p>\n<p>\n What you have been fighting for all this\n time as your right, if you expect to enact\n this bill into law and to carry it out to prac-\n tice, is to substitute a constitution of your\n making for one of their making; to have a\n dependency, which is what you want instead\n of a republic; which is what they want; to\n have fitness for the elective franchise deter-\n mined by an authority which has its source\n ten thousand miles away instead of with the\n people at home; and to deny them independ-\n ence, even if they are fit for it, so long as\n you please, without any regard to their de-\n sire. This investigation, I suppose, is yet\n upon the threshold.

I will not repeat them now.\n My desire to-day is simply to call attention to\n the practical working of the two doctrines\u2014\n the doctrine of buying sovereignty or con-\n quering it in battle, and the doctrine of the\n Declaration of Independence. For the last\n three years you have put one of them in\n force in Cuba and the other in the Philip-\n pine Islands. I ask you to think soberly\n which method, on the whole, you like better.\n I ask you to compare the cost of war with\n the cost of peace, of justice with that of in-\n justice, the cost of empire with the cost\n of republican liberty, the cost of the way\n of America and the way of Europe, of the\n doctrine of the Declaration of Independence\n with the doctrine of the Holy Alliance. You\n have tried both, I hope, to your heart\u2019s con-\n tent. But before I do that I want to cal)\n attention to one important fact in our history\n not generally known. It is very interesting\n in its connection with this debate.\n</p>\n<p>\n John Quincy Adams, as everybody knows,\n was the father of what we call the Monroe\n Doctrine. He secured its adoption through\n the weight of his great influence, by a hes-\n itating President and a reluctant Cabinet.\n It is not so well known that he placed the\n Monroe Doctrine solely upon the doctrine\n that just governments must rest upon the\n consent of the governed. That he declared\n to be its only foundation, and that so found-\n ed it rested upon the eternal principle of\n righteousness and justice. A thorough ex-\n amination has lately been made by an ac-\n complished historical scholar, Worthing-\n ton C. Ford, aided by Charles Francis\n Adams, grandson of John Quincy Adams,\n of the unpublished Adams manuscripts at\n Quincy, the archives of the Department of\n State, and the papers of President Monroe,\n lately published by Congress. I can relate\n this story in a moment. I think it an im-\n portant contribution to this debate.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, I discussed some time ago,\n and more than once, this attempt to buy\n sovereignty with money of a dispossessed\n tyrant, or to get it as booty or spoils of\n battle. I showed that it is in contradiction\n of the great American doctrine that just\n governments rest only on tHe consent of the\n governed \u2014 in flat contradiction of the doc-\n trine on which this government is founded\n and of the uniform tradition of all our\n statesmen from 1776 to the adoption of the\n Spanish treaty. I do not mean to repeat\n that argument now. It was met by the af-\n firmation that Jefferson disregarded it when\n we bought Louisiana, and that John Quincy\n Adams disregarded it when we acquired\n Florida, and that Abraham Lincoln disre-\n garded it when he put down the rebellion,\n and that Charles Sumner disregarded it\n when he urged the purchase of Alaska.\n</p>\n<p>\n We Can Acquire Territory.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was never denied that we could acquire\n territory and that we could govern it after\n it was acquired. The doctrine was that if\n the territory be inhabited by that vital and\n living being we call a people, as distinct\n from a few scattered and unorganized in-\n habitants, neither controlling it nor govern-\n ing themselves, that people have a right\n to govern themselves and to determine their\n own destiny after their own fashion. This\n is the American exposition of the law of\n nations. Thomas Jefferson never departed\n from it. He regarded the Louisiana terri-\n tory as something not worth taking. He\n</p>\n<p>\n declared that it would not be inhabited for\n a thousand years. He only wanted New\n Orleans. The rest of the territory wa3\n forced upon him by Napoleon. There was\n no people, in the sense of the law of nations,\n either in New Orleans or in the Louisiana\n territory. There was no people there that\n could make a government or a treaty.\n</p>\n<p>\n Abraham Lincoln put down the Rebellion,\n fceeause by his and our interpretation of the\n Constitution we were one people and not two\n \u2014 to which doctrine the Southern people had\n consented when they adopted the Constitu-\n tion; and, beside, if you had counted the\n whole people, black and white, there was\n never a majority on the side of secession in\n any single Southern State. Sumner again\n and again declared that there was nothing in\n .Alaska which could be called a people, and\n that if there were the United States would\n never be willing to acquire thetf without\n their consent; and that we would never take\n Canada, if we could get it, except with the\n full approbation of her people. If my friends\n of the press or in the Senate who still stick\n to this ten hundred times refuted fallacy\n are not content they will never be persuaded,\n though Thomas Jefferson and John Quincy\n Adams and Abraham Lincoln and Charles\n Sumner rise from the dead.\n</p>\n<p>\n In Contradiction of Monroe Doctrine.\n</p>\n<p>\n I do not wdsh to detain the Senate by re-\n newing that debate. But I wish to cite a\n chapter of the history of this country, which\n shows that your present policy is in con-\n tradiction of the Monroe doctrine, as it is in\n contradiction of the Declaration of Inde-\n pendence. It is well known that John Quincy\n Adams was the author of the Monroe doc-\n trine. He carried his point over the opposi-\n tion of the Cabinet and reluctance on the\n part of the President. When Canning pro-\n posed that the United States join England\n in asserting that the holy alliance should\n not reduce any South American country un-\n der the dominion of Spain, Mr. Adams said\n that we would not join England, although\n she asked us to do it. He said we were\n not to be a little cockboat in the wake of\n the British man-of-war. He counseled the\n President, and his advice was taken, that\n this country should make its declaration to\n Russia, the head and strength of the holy\n alliance, and he put that declaration ex-\n pressly and solely on the doctrine of the\n consent of the governed, affirmed in our\n Declaration of Independence. He declared\n that doctrine was a doctrine of absolute\n right and righteousness.\n</p>\n<p>\n It will take but a moment to tell the\n story as it appears in the archives in our\n Department of State, in the Monroe papers\n lately published, in Adams\u2019 Diary, and in the\n Adams manuscripts at Quincy, w ' hich have\n been made public within a few days. In Au-\n gust, September and October, 1823, there\n came to the State Department of Washing-\n ton from Mr. Rush dispatches containing\n letters from Mr. Canning. These letters\n suggested designs of the holy alliance\n against the independence of the South\n American colonies, and proposed co-opera-\n tion between Great Britain and the United\n States against that alliance. President Mon-\n roe asked the advice of Mr. Jefferson and\n Mr. Madison, and suggested that we should\n make it known that we should view an at-\n tack by the European powers upon the colo-\n nies of Spain as an attack upon ourselves.\n But in the meantime the Russian minister,\n Baron Tuyll, on the 16th of October, cojn-\n municated to the Secretary of State a declar-\n ation of the Emperor of Russia that the\n</p>\n<p>\n political principles of that power would not\n permit him to recognize the independence\n of the revolted colonies of Spain.\n</p>\n<p>\n Monroe Doctrine Proposed.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Adams saw and seized his oppor-\n tunity. He gave this advice to President\n Monroe, as appears by his diary, on No-\n vember 7, 1823:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" I remarked that the communications re-\n cently received from the Russian Minister,\n Baron Tuyll, afforded, as I thought, a very\n suitable and convenient opportunity for us\n to take our stand against the Holy Alliance,\n and at the same time decline the overtures\n of Great Britain. It would be more candid\n and more dignified to avow our principles\n explicitly to Baron Tuyll than to go in as\n a cockboat in the wake of the British man-\n of-war. This idea was acquiesced in on all\n sides.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n At the Cabinet meeting of November 15,\n 1823, the subject was again discussed.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Letters were read from Mr. Jefferson,\n who was for acceding to the pending pro-\n posal. Mr. Madison was less decisively\n pronounced, but thought the movement on\n the part of Great Britain impelled more by\n her interest than by a principle of general\n liberty. President Monroe was quite de-\n spondent.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Adams proceeds:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" I soon found the source of the Presi-\n dent\u2019s despondency with regard to South\n American affairs. Calhoun is perfectly\n moonstruck by the surrender of Cadiz, and\n says the Holy Allies, with 10,000 men, will\n restore all Mexico ' and all South America to\n the Spanish dominion. I did not deny that\n they might make a temporary impression\n for three, four or five years, but I no more\n believe that the Holy Allies will restore the\n Spanish dominion upon the American conti-\n nent that that Chimborazo will sink be-\n neath the ocean. But, I added, if the South\n Americans were really in a state to be so\n easily subdued, it would be but a more\n forcible motive for us to beware of in-\n volving ourselves in their fate. I set this\n down as one of Calhoun\u2019s extravaganzas. He\n is for plunging into a war to prevent that\n which, if his opinion of it is correct, we are\n utterly unable to prevent. He is for em-\n barking our lives and fortunes in a ship\n which he declares the very rats have aban-\n doned. Calhoun reverts again to his idea\n of giving discretionary power to our Min-\n ister to accede to all Canning\u2019s proposals, if\n necessary, but not otherwise. After much\n discussion, I said I thought we should\n bring the whole answer to Mr. Canning\u2019s\n proposals to a test of right and wrong. Con-\n sidering the South Americans as independ-\n ent nations, they themselves, and no other\n nation, had the right to dispose of their\n condition. We have no right to dispose of\n them, either alone or in conjunctions with\n other nations. Neither have any other\n nations the right of disposing of them with-\n out their consent. This principle will give\n us a clew to answer all Mr. Canning ' s ques-\n tions with candor and confidence, and I am\n to draft a dispatch accordingly. (Adams\u2019\n Memoirs, p. 186).\n</p>\n<p>\n Adams Seized Opportunity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Before Mr. Adams prepared the draft two\n more dispatches were received from Rush,\n dated the second and tenth of October, in-\n dicating a decided change in Canning ' s tone,\n and almost an indifference on his part to\n pursue hjs project of united action. Mean-\n time, there came a new communication from\n Russia, which gave Adams his opportunity.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0017/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0017/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0017/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0017/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0017/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0017.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 864389}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"17\">\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15\n</p>\n<p>\n He put his repl 7 on the express and Impreg-\n nable ground of the consent of the governed,\n as declared In our Declaration of Independ-\n ence. On the 25th of November he made,\n for the President ' s use, a draft of observa-\n tions upon the communications recently re-\n ceived from the Russian minister. The pa-\n per begins as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" The Government of the United States of\n America Is essentially republican. By their\n constitution It is provided that \u2018the United\n States shall guarantee to every State In\n this Union a republican form of government,\n and shall protect them from invasion.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \" The principles of this polity are: 1. That\n the institution of government to be lawful,\n must be pacific, that is, founded upon the\n consent and by the agreement of those who\n are governed: and 2, that each nation is ex-\n clusively the Judge of the government best\n suited to itself, and that no other nation can\n Justly interfere by force to impose a differ-\n ent government upon it. The first of the\n principles may be designated as the princi-\n ple of liberty, the second as the principle of\n national independence; they are both princi-\n ples of peace and of good will to men.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" A necessary consequence of the second of\n these principles is that the United States\n recognize in other nations the right which\n they claim and exercise for themselves of\n establishing and modifying their own gov-\n ernments, according to their own Judgments\n and views of their interests, not encroach-\n ing upon the rights of others. (Ford, page\n 38 ).\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Adams states later in the same doc-\n ument:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIn the general declarations that the allied\n monarchs will never compound and never\n will even treat with the revolution, and that\n their policy has only for its object by forcible\n interposition to guarantee the tranquillity of\n all the states of which the civilized world is\n composed, the President wishes to perceive\n the sentiments, the application of which is\n limited, and intended in their results to be\n limited to the affairs of Europe. (Ford,\n page 40).\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Monroe and Mr. Calhoun hesitated in\n regard to the insertion of this paragraph in\n the answer to Russia, but neither of them, as\n appears from the full narrative in Mr.\n Adams\u2019 diary, objected to the doctrine.\n They thought it might be offensive to Rus-\n sia. Accordingly Mr. Adams read the paper\n to Baron Tuyll, omitting that paragraph, but\n received a letter from the President a little\n later, yielding his objections and consenting\n to its retention.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Worthington C. Ford, in an iifterest-\n ing paper contained in the \" Proceedings of\n the Massachusetts Historical Society for Jan-\n uary, 1902,\u201d narrates the whole story, and\n says in conclusion:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" That the timidity of the President was\n awakened, that record shows; but the per-\n sistence of Adams and the very weighty ar-\n guments he advanced in its favor induced\n Monroe to yield, but not until it was too\n late for the purpose intended. (Ford, page\n 40.)\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Ford adds, after citing the Russian\n minister ' s communication:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" This gave Adams his opening. If the\n emperor sat up to be the mouthpiece of\n Divine Providence it would be well to inti-\n mate that this country did not recognize the\n language spoken and had a destiny of its\n own, also under the guidance of Divine Prov-\n idence. If Alexander could exploit his politi-\n cal principles, those of a brutal repressive\n</p>\n<p>\n policy, the United States could show that\n another system of government, remote and\n separate from European traditions and ad-\n ministration, could give rise to a new and\n more active political principle \u2014 the consent\n of the governed \u2014 between which and the em-\n peror there could not exist even a sentimen-\n tal sympathy. (Ford, page 15.)\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Principle of Brutal Selfishness.\n</p>\n<p>\n So, Mr. President, if you have your own\n way, and keep on in the path you are tread-\n ing, you have not only repealed the Declara-\n tion of Independence, but you have left for\n the Monroe doctrine only the principle of\n brutal selfishness. You have taken from\n that doctrine, which is the chief glory of this\n country, from the time of the treaty of peace\n in 1783, till the inauguration of Abraham\n Lincoln in 1861, its foundation in righteous-\n ness and freedom, and you found it only\n upon selfishness. You say not that it Is\n right, but only that it is for our interest.\n If hereafter you go to war for it \u2014 if you\n have your way \u2014 it will not be for the glory\n of the liberator or for the principle op which\n the republic is founded. You will only have\n Ancient Pistol\u2019s solace:\n</p>\n<p>\n I shall sutler be unto the camp,\n</p>\n<p>\n And profits will accrue.\n</p>\n<p>\n John Quincy Adams lived to see the\n great doctrine he had been taught from\n his cradle, which he had drawn in with his\n mother ' s milk, derided, and trampled under\n foot by a people drunk with conquest and\n dazzled by military glory. He lived to see\n the President take soldiers and not states-\n men for bis counselors. He lived to see\n slavery intrenched in every department of\n the government \u2014 in the White House, in\n court, in Congress, in trade, and in the\n pulpit. But he never wavered nor faltered\n in his sublime faith. He faced the stormy\n and turbulent waves of the House of Rep-\n resentatives at eighty. He took for his\n motto: \u201cAlteri Seculo\u201d\u2014 a motto which his\n son inscribed at his burial place at Quincy.\n But the new age came sooner even than\n the faith of John Quincy Adams had pre-\n dicted. In less than thirteen years from\n his death, Abraham Lincoln, whom the\n people sent to the White House, had de-\n clared on his way thither the sublime doc-\n trine of the consent of the governed to be\n that on which the Republic is founded, and\n for which, if need, he was willing to be\n assassinated. I think, therefore, that the\n men who differ from their political associ-\n ates, and even from majorities, may find\n something of consolation and something of\n hope in the company of John Quincy\n Adams and in the company of Abraham\n Lincoln.\n</p>\n<p>\n Doctrines in Sharp Antagonism.\n</p>\n<p>\n When we ratified the treaty of Parise we\n committed ourselves to one experiment in\n Cuba and another in the Philippine Islands.\n We had said already that Cuba of right\n ought to be free and independent. So when\n in the treaty Spain abandoned her sov-\n ereignty the title of Cuba became at once\n complete. We were only to stay there to\n keep order until we could hand over Cuba to\n a government her people had chosen and\n established. By the same treaty we bought\n the Philippine Islands for $20,000,000 and de-\n clared and agreed that Congress should dis-\n pose of them. So, according to those who\n held the treaty valid, it became the duty of\n the President to reduce them to submission,\n and of Congress to govern them. Here the\n two doctrines are brought into sharp antag-\n</p>\n<p>\n onism. In Cuba, of right, just government,\n according to you, must rest on the consent\n of the governed. Her people are to \u201cinsti-\n tute a new government, laying its founda-\n tion on such principles, and organizing its\n powers in such form as to them shall seem\n most likely to effect their safety and happi-\n ness.\u201d In the Philippine Islands a govern-\n ment is to be instituted by a power ten\n thousand miles away, to be in the beginning\n a despotism, established by military power,\n and to be such, to use the language of the\n McEnery resolution, as shall seem \" for the\n interest of the United States.\u201d You have\n given both doctrines a three years ' trial.\n Three years is sometimes a very long time\n and sometimes a very short time in\n human affairs. I believe the whole life of\n the Saviour, after He first made His divine\n mission known, lasted but three years.\n Three years has wrought a mighty change in\n Cuba, and it has wrought a mighty change In\n the Philippine Islands. We have had plenty\n of time to try both experiments. Now,\n what has each cost you, and what has each\n profited you? In stating this account of\n profit and loss I hardly know which to take\n up first, principles and honor or materia)\n interests \u2014 I should have known very w ' ell\n which to have taken up three years ago \u2014 what\n you call the sentimental, the ideal, the his-\n torical on the right side of the column; the\n cost or the profit in honor or shame and in\n character and in principle and moral influ-\n ence, in true national glory; or the practical\n side, the cost in money and gain, in life and\n health, in wasted labor, in diminished na-\n tional strength, or in prospects of trade and\n money getting.\n</p>\n<p>\n I should naturally begin where our fathers\n used to begin. But somehow the things get\n so inextricably blended that we cannot keep\n them separate. This world is so made that\n you cannot keep honesty, and sound policy,\n and freedom and material property, and good\n government, and the consent of the governed,\n apart. Men who undertake to make money\n by cheating pay for it by failure in business.\n If you try to keep OTder by military despot-\n ism you suffer from it by revolution and by\n barbarity in war. If a strong people try to\n govern a weak one against its will, the home\n government will get despotic, too. You can-\n not maintain despotism in Asia and a ' repub-\n lic in America. If you try to deprive even\n a savage or a barbarian of his just rights you\n can never do it without becoming a savage\n or a barbarian yourself.\n</p>\n<p>\n Two Kinds of Sentimentality.\n</p>\n<p>\n Gentlemen talk about sentimentalities,\n about idealism. They like practical states-\n manship better. But, Mr. President, this\n whole debate Tor the last four years has been\n a debate between two kinds of sentimental-\n ity. There has been practical statesmanship\n in plenty on both sides. Your side have car-\n ried their sentimentalities and ideals out\n in their practical statesmanship. The other\n side have tried and begged to be allowed to\n carry theirs out in practical st.atesma.nshh*\n also. On one side have been these senti-\n mentalities.

Now, a good deal of practical\n statesmanship has followed from these ideals\n and sentimentalities. They have builded\n forty-five states on firm foundations. They\n have covered South America with republics.\n They have kept despotism out of the Western\n Hemisphere. They have made the United\n States the freest, strongest, richest of na-\n tions of the world. They have made the\n word republic a name to conjure by the\n round world over. By their virtue the\n American flag \u2014 beautiful as a flower to those\n who love it; terrible as a meteor to those\n who hate it \u2014 floats every wnere over peaceful\n seas, and is welcomed everywhere in friendly\n ports as the emblem of peaceful supremacy\n and sovereignty in the commerce of the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n Has there been any practical statesman-\n ship in our dealing with Cuba? You had\n precisely the same problem in the East\n and in the West. You knew all about the\n conditions in Cuba. There has been no\n lack of counselors to whisper in the ear\n of the President and Senate and House\n the dishonorable counsel that we should\n hold on to Cuba, without regard to our\n pledges or our principles, and that the\n resolution of the senator from Colorado was\n a great mistake. I do not know how other\n men may feel, but I think that the states-\n men who have had something to do with\n bringing Cuba into the family of nations,\n when he voted for the Paris treaty, and\n when they look back on their career, that\n my friends who sit around me, when each\n comes to look back upon a career of hon-\n orable and brilliant public service, will\n count the share they had in that as among\n the brightest, the greenest and the freshest\n laurels in their crown.\n</p>\n<p>\n I do not think I could honestly repeat\n all the compliments which the senator from\n Wisconsin is in the habit of paying to the\n senator from Colorado. He has gone\n against my grain very often, especially\n when his vote defeated the Bacon resolu-\n tion. But I doubt if any man who has\n sat in this chamber since Charles Sumner\n died, or if all who sit here now put to-\n gether have done a more important single\n service to the country than he did in se-\n curing the passage of the resolution which\n pledged us to deal with Cuba according to\n the principles of the Declaration of Inde-\n pendence.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some Imperialist Ideals.\n</p>\n<p>\n You also, my imperialistic friends, have\n had your ideals and your sentimentalities.\n One is that the flag shall never be hauled\n down, where it has once floated. Another\n is that you will not talk or reason with a\n people with arms in their hands. Another\n is that sovereignty over an unwilling peo-\n ple may be bought with gold. And another\n is that sovereignty rbay be got by force of\n arms, as the booty of battle or the spoils\n of victory.\n</p>\n<p>\n What has been the practical statesmanship\n which comes from your ideals and your sen-\n timentalities? You have wasted six hun-\n dred millions of treasure. You have sacri-\n ficed nearly ten thousand American lives \u2014\n the flower of our youth. You have devas-\n tated provinces. You have slain uncounted\n thousands of the people you desire to bene-\n</p>\n<p>\n fit. You have established reconcentration\n camps. Your generals are coming home from\n their harvest, bringing their sheaves with\n them, in the shape of other thousands of\n sick and wounded and insane to drag out\n miserable lives, wrecked in body and mind.\n You make the American flag in the eyes\n of a numerous people the emblem of sacri-\n lege in Christian churches, and of the burn-\n ing of human dwellings, and of the horror\n of the water torture. Your practical state-\n manship which disdains to take George Wash-\n ington and Abraham Lincoln or the soldiers\n of the Revolution or of the Civil War as\n models, has looked in some cases to Spain\n for your example. I believe \u2014 nay, I know \u2014\n that in general our officers are humane. But\n in some cases they have carried on your\n warfare with a mixture of American in-\n genuity and Castilian cruelty.\n</p>\n<p>\n Your practical statemanship has succeed-\n ed in converting a people who three years\n ago were ready to kiss the hem of the gar-\n ment of the American and to welcome him\n as a liberator, who thronged after your men\n when they landed on those Islands with\n benediction and gratitude, into sullen and\n irreconcilable enemies, possessed of a hatred\n which centuries cannot eradicate.\n</p>\n<p>\n Tfce practical statesmanship of the Dec-\n laration of Independence and the Golden\n T.ule would have cost nothing but a few\n kind words. They would have bought for\n you the great title of liberator and bene-\n factor, which your fathers won for your\n country in the South American republics\n and in Japan and which you have won in\n Cuba. They would have bought for you the\n undying gratitude of a great and free people\n and the undying glory which belongs to the\n name of liberator. That people would have\n felt for you as Japan felt for you when she\n declared last summer that she owed every-\n thing tc the United States of America ' .\n</p>\n<p>\n The Cost of These Ideals.\n</p>\n<p>\n What have your ideals cost you, and what\n have they bought for you?\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. For the Philippine Islands you have had\n to repeal the Declaration of Independence.\n</p>\n<p>\n For Cuba you have had to reaffirm it and\n give it new luster.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. For the Philippine Islands you have\n had to convert the Monroe doctrine into a\n doctrine of mere selfishness.\n</p>\n<p>\n For Cuba you have acted on it and vin-\n dicated it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. In Cuba you have got the eternal grati-\n tude of a free people.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the Philippine Islands you have got the\n hatred and sullen submission of a subjugated\n people.\n</p>\n<p>\n From Cuba you have brought home noth-\n ing but glory.\n</p>\n<p>\n From the Philippines you have brought\n home nothing of glory.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. In Cuba no man thinks of counting the\n cost. The few soldiers who came home from\n Cuba wounded or sick carry about their\n wounds and their pale faces as if they were\n medals of honor. What soldier glories in a\n wound or an empty sleeve which he got in\n the Philippines?\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. The conflict in the Philippines has cost\n you $600,000,000, thousands of American sol-\n diers\u2014 the flower of our youth \u2014 the health\n and sanity of thousands more, and hundreds\n of thousands of Filipinos slain.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another price we have paid as the result\n of your practical statesmanship. We have\n sold out the right, the old American right,\n to speak out the sympathy which is in our\n</p>\n<p>\n hearts for people who are desolate and op-\n pressed everywhere on the face of the earth.\n Has there ever been a contest between pow-\n er and the spirit of liberty, before that\n now going on in South Africa, when American\n senators held their peace because they\n thought they were under an obligation to the\n nation in the \u2022wrong for not interfering with\n us? I have heard that it turned out that\n we had no great reason for gratitude of that\n kind. But I myself heard an American sena-\n tor, a soldier of the Civil War, declare in\n this chamber that, while he sympathized\n with the Boers, he did not say so because\n of our obligation to Great Britain for not\n meddling with us in the war with Spain.\n Nothing worse than that was said of us In\n the old slavery days. A great English poet\n before the Civil War, in a poem entitled\n \" The Curse,\u201d taunted us by saying that we\n did not dare to utter our sympathy with free-\n dom so long as we were the holders of\n slaves. I remember, after fifty years, the\n sting and shame I felt in my youth when\n that was uttered. I had hoped that we had\n got rid of that forever before 1865.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Ye shall watch kings conspire\n Round the people ' s smoldering Are,\n</p>\n<p>\n And, warm for your part,\n</p>\n<p>\n Shall never dare, O, shame!\n</p>\n<p>\n To utter the thought into flame\n Which bums at your heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ye shall watch while nations strive\n With the bloodhounds \u2014 die or survive \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Drop faint from their Jaws,\n</p>\n<p>\n Or throttle them backward to death,\n</p>\n<p>\n And only under your breath\n Shall ye bless the cause.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Cuban Teachers at Harvard.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sometimes men are affected by particular\n instances who are not impressed by statis-\n tics of great numbers. Sterne\u2019s starling in\n its cage has moved more hearts than were\n ever stirred by census tables. Let me take\n two examples out of a thousand with which\n to contrast the natural result of the doctrine\n of your fathers with yours. I do not think\n there ever was a more delightful occurrence\n in the history of Massachusetts since the\n Puritans or the Pilgrims landed there, than\n the visit to Harvard two years ago of the\n Cuban teachers to the Harvard Summer\n School. The old university put on her best\n apparel for the occasion. The guests were\n manly boys and fair girls, making you think\n of Tennyson\u2019s sweet girl graduates, who came\n to sit at the feet of old Harvard to learn\n something which they could teach to their\n pupils, and to carry back to their country\n and teach their own children undying grati-\n tude to the great Republic. It was one of\n \u00bbhe most delightful lessons in all history of\n the gratitude of a people to its liberator, and\n of the affection of the liberator-Republic to\n the people it had delivered. Was there ever\n a more fitting subject for poetry or for art\n than the venerable president, surrounded with\n his staff of learned teachers and famous\n scholars, the foremost men in the Republic\n of letters and science, as he welcomed them,\n these young men and women, to the delights\n of learning and the blessings of liberty?\n</p>\n<p>\n No Welcome for the Filipino.\n</p>\n<p>\n Contrast this scene with another. It is all\n you have to show, that you have brought\n back, so far, from the Philippine Islands.\n You have no grateful youth coming to sit at\n your feet. You do not dare to bring here\n even a friendly Filipino to tell you, with un-\n fettered lips, what his people think of you, or\n what they want of you.

I am\n told in reply, and I am glad to know it, that\n the picture is sensational and exaggerated,\n but the substantial fact is confirmed that\n that load of young soldiers passed through\n that city lately, as other like cargoes have\n passed through before, maniacs and broken\n in mental health as the result of service in\n the Philippine Islands.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is no answer to tell me that such hor-\n rors exist everywhere; that there are other\n maniacs at St. Elizabeth, and that every\n state asylum is full of them. Those un-\n happy beings have been visited, without any\n man\u2019s vault, by the mysterious providence\n of God, or if their affliction comes from any\n man\u2019s fault it is our duty to make it known\n and to hold the party guilty responsible.\n It is a terrible picture that I have drawn.\n It is a picture of men suffering from the\n inevitable result which every reasonable\n man must have anticipated of the decisions\n made in this chamber when we elected to\n make war for the principle of despotism in-\n stead of a policy of peace, in accordance\n with the principles of the Declaration of In-\n dependence.\n</p>\n<p>\n Islands Cost Souls of Boys.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, every one of these maniacs,\n every one of the many like freights of horror\n that came back to us from the Philippine\n Islands w T as once an American boy, the de-\n light of some American home, fairer and no-\n bler in hie young promise, as w r e like to think,\n than any other the round world over. Ah!\n Mr. President, it was not $20,000,000 that we\n paid as the price of sovereignty. It was the\n souls of these boys of ours that entered into\n the cost. When you determined by one vote\n to ratify the Spanish treaty; when you de-\n termined by one vote to defeat the Bacon\n resolution; when you declared, in the Mc-\n Enery resolution, that we would dispose of\n that people as might be for the interest\n of the United States; when the Senator from\n Wisconsin said w r e would not talk to a peo-\n ple who had arms in their hands, although\n they begged that there should be no war,\n and that we would at least hear them; when\n some of you went about the country declar-\n ing that the flag never should be hauled down\n where it once floated, you did not know, be-\n cause in your excitement and haste your in-\n tellectual vision was dazzled with empire,\n you did not know that this was to come. But\n you might have known it. A little reflec-\n tion and a little reason would have told you.\n I wonder if the Republican editor who\n made that known was attacking the American\n Army. I wonder if those of us who do not\n like that are the friends or the enemies of\n the American soldier.\n</p>\n<p>\n I cannot understand how any man, cer-\n tainly how any intelligent student of history,\n could have failed to foretell exactly what\n has happened when we agreed to the Spanish\n treaty. Everything that has happened since\n has been the natural, inevitable, inexorable\n result of the policy you then declared. If\n you knew anything of human nature you\n knew that the great doctrine that just gov-\n ernment depends on the consent of the gov-\n erned, as applied to the relation of one peo-\n ple to another, has its foundation in the; na-\n</p>\n<p>\n ture of man itself. No people will submit,\n if It can be helped, to the rule of any people.\n You must .have known perfectly well, if you\n had stopped to consider, that so far as the\n Philippine people were like us they would\n do exactly what we did and would do again\n in a like case. So far as they w r ere civilized\n they would resist you with all the power of\n civilized w r ar. So far as they were savage,\n they would resist you by all the methods of\n savage warfare.\n</p>\n<p>\n End of the War Is Far Distant.\n</p>\n<p>\n You never could eradicate from the hearts\n of that people by force the love of liberty\n which God put there.\n</p>\n<p>\n For He that worketh high and wise,\n</p>\n<p>\n Nor pauseth in His plan.\n</p>\n<p>\n Will take the sun out of the skies\n</p>\n<p>\n Ere freedom out of man.\n</p>\n<p>\n This war, if you call it war, has gone on\n for three years. It will go on in some form\n for three hundred years, unless this policy\n be abandoned. You will undoubtedly have\n times of peace and quiet, or pretended sub-\n mission. You will buy men with titles, or\n office, or salaries. You will intimidate cow-\n ards. You will get pretended and fawning\n submission. The land will smile and smile\n and seem at peace. But the volcano will be\n there. The lava will break out again. You\n can never settle this thing until you settle\n it right. I think my friends of the majority\n whatever else they may claim \u2014 and they can\n rightly claim a great deal that is good and\n creditable for themselves \u2014 will not claim\n to be prophets. They used to prophesy a\n good deal two years ago. We had great\n prophets and minor prophets. All predicted\n peace and submission, and a flag followed by\n trade, w ' ith wealth flowing over this land\n from the far East, and the American people\n standing in the Philippine Islands looking\n over with eager gaze toward China. Where\n are now your prophets w T hich prophesied\n unto you? I fear that we must make the\n answer that was made to the children of\n Israel: \u201cThey prophesied falsely, and the\n prophets have become wind, and the word\n is not in them.\u2019\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n An instance of this delusion, which seems\n to have prevailed everywhere, is stated by\n Andrew Carnegie in the May number of\n the North American Review. He says:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe writer had the honor of an interview\n with President McKinley before war broke\n out with our allies, and ventured to predict\n that if he attempted to exercise sovereignty\n over the Filipinos \u2014 whom he had bought at\n $2.50 a head \u2014 he would be shooting these\n people dow ' n within thirty days. He smiled,\n and, addressing a gentleman who was pres-\n ent, said: \u2018Mr. Carnegie doesn\u2019t understand\n the situation at all.\u2019 Then turning to the\n writer, he said: \u2018We will be welcomed as\n their best friends.\u2019 \u2018So little,\u2019 says Mr.\n Carnegie, \u2018did dear, kind, loving President\n McKinley expect ever to be other than the\n friendly co-operator with these people.\u2019 \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n A guerilla warfare, carried on by a\n weaker people against a stronger, is rec-\n ognized and legitimate. Many nations have\n resorted to it. Our War of the Revolution\n in many parts of the country differed little\n from it. Spain carried it on against Na-\n poleon when the French forces overran\n her territory and mankind sympathized\n with her. The greatest of English poets\n since Milton, William Wordsworth, de-\n scribed that warfare in a noble sonnet,\n which will answer, with scarcely the\n</p>\n<p>\n change of a word, as a description of the\n Filipino people:\n</p>\n<p>\n Hunger, and sultry heat, and nipping blast\n From bleak hilltop, and length of march by\n night\n</p>\n<p>\n Through heavy swamp or over snow-clad height\u2014\n These hardships ill-sustained, these dangers past.\n The roving Spanish bands are reached at last.\n Charged, and dispersed like foam; but as a flight\n Of scattered quails by signs do reunite,\n</p>\n<p>\n So these\u2014 and, heard of once again, are chased\n With combination of long-practiced art\n And newly kindled hope; but they are fled.\n</p>\n<p>\n Gone are they, viewless as the buried dead;\n</p>\n<p>\n Where now? Their sword is at the foeman\u2019s heart!\n And thus from year to year his walk they thwart.\n And hang like dr.eams around his guilty bed.\n</p>\n<p>\n I believe the American Army, officers and\n soldiers to be made up of as brave and hu-\n mane men, in general, as ever lived. They\n have done what has always been done, and\n until human nature shall change, always\n will be done in all like conditions. The chief\n guilt is on the heads of those who created\n the conditions.\n</p>\n<p>\n Soldiers Must Sustain Army.\n</p>\n<p>\n One thing, however, I am bound to say in\n all frankness. I do not know but my state-\n ment may be challenged. But I am sure\n that nearly every well informed man who\n will hear it or read it will know that it is\n true. That is, that you will never get offi-\n cers or soldiers in the standing army, as a\n rule, to give testimony which they think\n will be disagreeable to their superiors or\n to the War Department. I have letters in\n large numbers myself. I believe every Sen-\n ator in this body, who is expected to do\n anything to inquire into these atrocities,\n has had abundant letters to the effect\n which I state. The same evil of which we\n are all conscious, which leads men in public\n life to be unwilling to incur unpopularity or\n the displeasure of their constituents by\n frankly uttering and acting upon their opin-\n ions, applies with a hundredfold more force\n when you summon a soldier or an officer\n to tell facts which will bear heavily on the\n administration of the war. I have had let-\n ters shown me by members of this body\n who vouched personally for the absolute\n trustworthiness of the w r riters, who detailed\n the horrors of the water torture and other\n kindred atrocities, which no inducement\n would lead them to make public.\n</p>\n<p>\n The private soldier who has ended his\n term of service or who expects to end it\n and return to private life, is under less re-\n straint. But when he tells his story he is\n met by the statement of an officer, in some\n cases, that it is well known that private\n soldiers are in the habit of \u201cdrawing the\n long bow,\u2019\u2019 to use the phrase of one general\n whose name has been brought into this dis-\n cussion. In other words, these generals are\n so jealous of the honor of the army, and\n their own, that they confine their jealousy\n to the honor of the officers, ^ and ex-\n pect you to reject these things on the as-\n sertion that the soldier is an habitual liar,\n and then they reproach the men who com-\n plain with being indifferent to the honor of\n the army.\n</p>\n<p>\n AVas it ever heard before that a civilized,\n humane, and Christian nation mad\u00a9 war upon\n a people and refused to tell them what they\n wanted of them?

Gen-\n eral MacArthur denies this statement, and\n says they were almost a unit for Aguinaldo.\n Mr. Denby and Mr. Schurman, two of the\n three commissioners of the first Filipino Com-\n mission, deny the statement. General Bell,\n In his letter of December 13, 1901, says, \u201ca\n majority of the inhabitants of his province\n have persistently continued their opposition\n during the entire period of three years, and\n that the men who accept local office from the\n governor and take the oath of allegiance do\n it solely for the purpose of improving their\n opportunity for resistance.\u201d That statement\n is concurred in by every department com-\n mander there. Certainly Major Gardener ' s\n apparently temperate and fair statement \u2014\n about which w ' e are to have no opportunity\n to examine him until Congress adjourns \u2014\n does not say any such thing as that sug-\n gested by the Senator from Ohio.\n</p>\n<p>\n But what is your cause? What is your\n cause that they favor? Do you mean that a\n majority of the Filipino people favor your\n killing them? Certainly not. Do you mean\n that a majority of the Filipino people, or\n that any one man in the Philippine Islands,\n according to the evidence of Governor Taft\n himself, favors anything that you are will-\n ing to do? The evidence is that some of\n them favor their admission as an American\n state and others favor a government of their\n own under your protection. Others would\n like to come in as a territory under our con-\n stitution. But is there any evidence that\n one human being there is ready to submit to\n your government without any right under our\n constitution of without any prospect of com-\n ing in as an American state? Or is there\n any evidence that any single American citi-\n zen, in the Senate or out of it, is willing\n tnat v r e should do anything that a single\n Filipino is ready to consent to? I have no\n doubt they will take the oath of allegiance.\n Undoubtedly they will go through the form\n ol submission. Undoubtedly you have force\n enough to make tne w\u2019hole region a howling\n wilderness. If you think fit. Undoubtedly\n you can put up a form of government in\n w ' hich they will seem to take some share,\n and they will take your offices and your sal-\n aries. But when you come to getting any-\n thing which is not merely temporary; when\n you come to announce anything in principle,\n such as those on which governments are\n founded, you have not any evidence of any\n considerable number of people there ready to\n submit to your will unless they are com-\n pelled by sheer brutal force.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Capture of Aguinaldo.\n</p>\n<p>\n I do not wish to dwell at length on the\n circumstances which attended the capture\n of Aguinaldo. Bui as they have been elab-\n orately defended in this body, and it is said\n that the officer who captured him had a\n good reoord before, and especially as he has\n been decorated by a promotion by the ad-\n vice and consent of the Senatfe, I cannot let\n it pass in silence. I understand the facts\n to be that that officer disguised the men un-\n der his command in the dress of Filipino\n soldiers, wrote or caused to be written a\n forged letter to Aguinaldo, purporting to\n come from one of his officers, stating that\n be was about to bring him some prisoners\n</p>\n<p>\n he had captured, and in that way got access\n to Aguinaldo ' s headquarters. As he ap-\n proached he sent a message to Aguinaldo\n that he and his friends were hungry; accept-\n ed food at his hands, and when in his pres-\n ence threw\u2019 down and seized him; shot some\n of the soldiers who were about Aguinaldo,\n and brought him back a prisoner into our\n lines. That is the transaction which is so\n highly applauded in imperialistic quarters.\n</p>\n<p>\n I do not believe that the Senate knew\n what it was doing when it consented to Gen-\n eral Funston ' s promotion. The nomination\n came in with a list of Army and Navy ap-\n pointments and promotions \u2014 2,038 in all \u2014\n and the Senate assented to that at the same\n time with 1,828 others. I doubt very much\n whether there were ten Senators In their\n seats, or whether one of them listened to\n the list as it w-as read. It is, I suppose, be-\n traying no secret to say that these lists are\n almost never read to the Senate when they\n come in, or when they are reported from the\n committee; that the only reading they get\n is at the time of the confirmation, when they\n commonly attract no attention whatever. I\n do not mean to say that if the Senate had\n had its attention called to the transaction\n the result would have been different. I only\n mean to say that I believe many Senators\n did not know it. I suppose the question\n whether the Senate would have approved it\n might have depended on the character and\n the quality of the general service of that of-\n ficer, and not on the estimate w f e formed of\n this particular transaction, which seems to\n have been done under orders. I did not know\n myself that the nomination had been made\n till long after the Senate had assented. But I\n incline to think, with General MacArthur\u2019s\n testimony before the investigating commit-\n tee, \" that the act was done by his direction\n and with his approval, I should not have\n thought it fair to hold the officer responsible\n for it by denying him an otherwise deserved\n promotion.\n</p>\n<p>\n I think we are bound in justice to General\n Funston to take the declaration of General\n MacArthur that he ordered and approved\n everything that officer did. If that be true\n we have no right to hold the subordinate\n responsible, however odious the act. If It\n turn out that that still higher authority\n has approved the act, then it becomes still\n more emphatically our duty to point out its\n enormity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Two Guides for Military Conduct.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, we have two guides for\n the conduct of military officers in such cir-\n cumstances. They apply not only to this\n act of General Funston, but they apply to\n most of the conduct of our military officers,\n of which complaint has been made. One of\n these is \u201cInstructions for the Government of\n Armies of the United States in the Field,\u201d\n prepared by Dr. Francis Lieber and promul-\n gated by order of Abraham Linncoln. The\n other is the convention at The Hague, agreed\n upon by the representatives of this Govern-\n ment with the others on the 29th day of\n July, 1899. and ratified by the Senate on the\n 14th of March, 1902. Observe that this con-\n vention was agreed upon before all these\n acts happened, and was unanimously adopted\n after they had ail happened. I extract from\n the \u2018\u2018Instructions for the Government of\n | Armies in the Field\u201d the following para-\n | graphs:\n</p>\n<p>\n Paragraph 148 is this:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe law of war does not allow proclaim-\n ing either an individual belonging to the\n hostile army or a citizen or a subject of the\n hostile Government an outlaw, who may be\n</p>\n<p>\n slain without triai by any captor, any more\n than the modern law of peace allows such\n intentional outlawry. On the contrary, it\n abhors such outrage. The sternest retalia-\n tion should follow the murder committed in\n consequence of such proclamation, made by\n whatever authority. Civilized nations look\n with horror upon offers of rewards for the\n assassination of enemies as relapses into\n barbarism.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, Mr. President, is It denied that hun-\n dreds upon hundreds of Filipinos have been\n put to death without trial? Has any soldier\n or officer been brought to trial by our au-\n thority for these offenses? Now ' , if it be an\n outrage upon w ' hich \" nations look with hor-\n ror,\u201d to use the language of that paragraph,\n and which \u201cthe law of war * * * ab-\n hors,\u201d is it any less a crime to be abhorred\n when it is done without such proclamation?\n The proclamation does not. according to this\n authority, justify the officer or soldier who\n acts in obedience to it. On the contrary,\n bis conduct is abhorrent to all civilized man-\n kind. And yet these things pass without\n condemnation, without punishment, without\n trial. Gentlemen seem to be impatient when\n they are asked to investigate them, or even\n to hear the story told in the Senate of the\n United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n Paragraph 16 is:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMilitary necessity does not admit of\n cruelty\u2014 that is, the infliction of suffering\n for the sake of suffering or for revenge,\n nor of maiming or wounding except in fight,\n nor of torture to extort confession. It does\n not admit of the use of poison in any way,\n nor of the wanton devastation of a district.\n It admits of deception, but disclaims acts Of\n perfidy, and, in general military necessity,\n does not include any act of hostility which\n makes the return to peace unnecesarily diffi-\n cult.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The rule says:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt admits of deception, but disclaims acts\n of perfidy.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n That also follows the prohibition of the use\n of poison, with which it is associated.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, perfidy is defined later in paragraph\n 117, which declares:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt is justly considered an act of bad faith,\n of Infamy, or fiendishness, to deceive the\n enemy by flags of protection.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Paragraph 65 is:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe use of the enemy ' s national standard,\n flag, or other emblem of nationality, for the\n purpose of deceiving the enemy in battle,\n is an act of perfidy.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Is not the uniform an emblem of nation-\n ality? If it be an act of perfidy\u2014 the use of\n that emblem of nationality to deceive the\n enemy in battle\u2014 is it any less an act of per-\n fidy to use it to steal upon him and deceive\n him when he Is not in battle and is in his\n own quarters?\n</p>\n<p>\n Prohibited by Hague Convention.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is also prohibited by the convention\n of The Hague, which must have been well\n known to all our officers, which had been\n signed by the representatives of this gov-\n ernment, although Its formal approval by\n the Senate took place this winter. I sup-\n pose if It be perfidy now, according to the\n unanimous opinion of the Senate, and was\n perfidy before, according to the concurrent\n action of twenty-four great nations, the\n question when we formally ratified the treaty\n becomes unimportant.\n</p>\n<p>\n Article 23 of the convention declares:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c(f) To make improper use of a flag of\n truce, the national Bag, or military ensigns,\n and the enemy ' s uniform\u201d \u2014\n is specially prohibited.

He went to Aguinaldo under the\n pretense that he was a-hungered and Aguin-\n aldo fed him. Was not that an act of per-\n fidy? It violated the holy right of hospital-\n ity which even the Oriental nations hold\n sacred. In Scott\u2019s immortal romance of the\n Talisman, the Sultan Saladin interposes to\n prevent a criminal who had just committed\n a treacherous murder from partaking of his\n feast by striking off his head as he ap-\n proached the banquet. \u201cHad he murdered\n my father,\u201d said the Saladin to Richard\n Coeur de Lion, \u201cand afterward partaken of\n</p>\n<p>\n my bowl and cup, not a hair of his head could\n have been injured by me.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, the story of what has been\n called the water torture has been, in part,\n told by other Senators. I have no inclina-\n tion to repeat the story. I cannot help be-\n lieving that not a twentieth part of it has\n yet been told. I get letters in large numbers\n from officers, or the friends of officers, who\n repeat what they tell me, all testifying to\n these cruelties. And yet the officer, or the\n officer\u2019s friends, or kindred who send the let-\n ters to me, send them under a strict injunc-\n tion of secrecy. Other Senators tell me they\n have a like experience. These brave offi-\n cers, who would go to the cannon ' s mouth for\n honor, who never flinch in battle, flinch be-\n fore what they deem the certain ruin of their\n prospects in life if they give the evidence\n which they think would be distasteful to\n their superiors. I do not undertake to judge\n of this matter. Other Senators can judge\n as well as I can. The American people can\n do it better. I suppose. Mr. President, that\n those of us who are of English descent like\n to think that the race from which we come\n will compare favorably with most others in\n the matter of humanity. Yet history is full\n of the terrible cruelties committed by En-\n glishmen when men of other races refused to\n submit to their authority. I think my\n friends who seek to extenuate this water\n torture, or to apologize for it, may, perhaps,\n like to look at the precedent of the dealings\n with the Irish rebels of 1799.\n</p>\n<p>\n Torture in Ireland Recalled.\n</p>\n<p>\n In Howell\u2019s State Trials there will be\n found the proceedings in a suit by Mr.\n Wright against James Judkin Fitzgerald, a\n sheriff, who ordered a citizen to be flogged\n for the purpose of extorting information. I\n believe fifty lashes were administered, and\n then fifty more by Fitzgerald, and in many\n other cases the same course was taken. It\n was wholly to extract information, as this\n water torture has been to get information.\n Fitzgerald, the sheriff, told his own story.\n He pointed out the necessity of his system\n of terror. He said he got one man he had\n flogged to confess that the plaintiff was a\n secretary of the United Irishmen, and this\n information he could not get from him be-\n fore; that Mr. Wright himself had offered to\n confess, but his memory had been so im-\n paired by the flogging that he could not\n command the faculty of recollection. Not-\n withstanding he had, by the terror of his\n name and the severity of his flogging, suc-\n ceeded mMt astonishingly, particularly in\n one instance, where, by the flogging of one\n man, he and thirty-six others acknowledged\n themselves United Irishmen.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, that was abundantly proved: and\n the sheriff, who had tortured and flogged\n these men, who were only fighting that Ire-\n land should not be ruled without the consent\n of the governed, had the effrontery to ask\n for an act of indemnity from the House of\n Commons against the damages which had\n been recovered against him, and that claim\n found plenty of advocates. The ministry un-\n dertook to extenuate the action of this mon-\n ster by citing the cruelties which the Irish\n people had inflicted in their turn, and by\n saying that very material discoveries were\n made relative to concealed arms as the re-\n sult of these tortures. The defenders of the\n administration said the most essential serv-\n ice had been rendered to the state and to\n the country by Mr. Fitzgerald. The attorney\n general trusted the House would cheerfully\n accede to the prayer of the petition. Mr.\n</p>\n<p>\n Wright, the man who had been tortured, was\n a man of excellent character and education,\n and a teacher of the French language. As\n soon as he knew there were charges against\n him he went to the house of the defendant\n to give himself up and demand a trial. I\n will not take the time of the Senate to read\n the debates. The argument for the govern-\n ment would do very well for some of the\n arguments we have heard here, and the ar-\n guments we have heard here would have\n done very well there. The House passed a\n general bill to indemnify all sheriffs and\n magistrates who had acted for the suppres-\n sion of the rebellion in a way not warranted\n by law, and to secure them against actions\n at law for so doing. The sole question at\n stake was the right of torture to extort in-\n formation. The bill passed the House, and\n afterward Fitzgerald got a considerable pen-\n sion, and was created a baronet of the\n United Kingdom.\n</p>\n<p>\n Inevitable Result of Brute Force.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, I agree that this precedent, so far\n as it may be held to set an example for\n what has been done in the Philippine Is-\n lands, may be cited against me. I cite it\n only to show that such things are inevit-\n able when you undertake by brute force\n to reduce to subjection an unwilling people,\n and that, therefore, when you enter upon\n that undertaking you yourselves take the\n responsibility for everything that follows.\n Mr. President, it is said that these horrors,\n which never would have come to the public\n knowledge had not the Senate ordered this\n investigation, were unknown to our authori-\n ties at home. I hope and believe they were\n unknown to the War Department. I know\n they were unknown to President Roosevelt,\n and I know they were unknown to President\n McKinley. But I cannot think that the re-\n cent declaration of that honorable gentle-\n man, the Secretary of War, made on a mem-\n orable occasion, that the war on our part\n had been conducted with unexampled hu-\n manity, will be accepted by his countrymen.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let us not be diverted from the true issue.\n We are not talking of retaliation. We are\n not talking of the ordinary brutalities of\n war. We are not talking about or inquiring\n into acts of vengeance committed in the\n heat of battle. We are talking about tor-\n ture \u2014 cold blooded, deliberate, calculated\n torture; torture to extort information. Clav-\n erhouse did it to the Scotch Covenanters\n with the boot and thumb screw. It has\n never till now been done by a man who spoke\n English except in Ireland. The Spanish in-\n quisition did it with the slow fire and boil-\n ing oil. It is said that the water torture\n was borrowed from Spain. I am quite ready\n to believe it. The men who make the in-\n quiry are told that they are assailing the\n honor of the American Army. How do the\n defenders of the American Army meet the\n question? By denying the fact?

But what we ar ' e talking about\n Is the torture committed in the presence of\n numerous witnesses for the purpose of ex-\n torting information, and orders from high\n authority to depopulate whole districts, and\n to slay all inhabitants, including all boys\n \u2022ver ten years old.\n</p>\n<p>\n One-Sixth of the Natives Have Died.\n</p>\n<p>\n Is it denied that these things have been\n done? Is it denied that although you are\n still on the threshold of this inquiry, and\n have only called such witnesses as you hap-\n pen to find ten thousand miles away from\n the scene, these things have been proved\n to the satisfaction of the majority of\n the committee, and that no man has yet\n been punished, although they were going\n on considerably more than a year ago?\n Now, how do our friends who seek, I will\n not say to defend, but to extenuate them,\n deal with the honor of the American Army?\n Why, they come into the Senate and say\n that there have been other cruelties and\n barbarities and atrocities in war. When\n these American soldiers and officers are\n called to the bar our friends summon Nero\n and Torquemada and the Spanish Inquisi-\n tion and the sheeted and ghostly leaders of\n the Ku Klux Klan and put them by their\n side. That is the way you defend the honor\n of the American Army. It is the first time\n the American soldier was put into such com-\n pany by the men who have undertaken his\n defense. It has been shown, I think, in the\n investigation now going on that the secre-\n tary of the Province of Batangas declared\n that one-third of the 300,000 of the popula-\n tion of that province have died within two\n years \u2014 100,000 men and women.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Boston Journal, an eminent Repub-\n lican paper and a most able supporter of\n the imperialistic policy, printed on the 3d\n of May, 1901, an interview with General\n Bell, given to the New York Times, in which\n he says that one-sixth of the natives of\n Luzon have either been killed or have died\n of the dengue fever in the last two years.\n I suppose that this dengue fever and the\n sickness which depopulated Batangas is the\n direct result of the war, and comes from\n the condition of starvation and bad food\n which the war has caused. The other\n provinces have not been heard from. If this\n be true we have caused the death of more\n human beings in the Philippines than we\n have caused to our enemies, including in-\n surgents in the terrible Civil War, in all\n our other, wars put together. The general\n adds that \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe loss of life by killing alone has been\n very great, but I think not one man has\n been slain except where his death served\n the legitimate purposes of war. It has been\n necessary to adopt what in other countries\n would probably be thought harsh measures,\n for the Filipino is tricky and crafty and has\n to be fought in his own way.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The \u201cHowling Wilderness\u201d Order.\n</p>\n<p>\n Where did this order to make Samar a\n howling wilderness originate? The re-\n sponsibility unquestionably, according to\n the discipline of armies in the field, rests\n with the highest authority from which it\n came. We used to talk, some of us, about\n the horrors of Andersonville and other\n things that were done during the Civil\n War. We hope, all of us, never to hear\n them mentioned again. But is there any-\n thing in them worse than that which an\n officer of high rank in the Army, vouched\n for by a senator on this floor, from per-\n sonal knowledge, as a man of the highest\n honor and veracity, writes about the evils\n</p>\n<p>\n of these reconcentrado camps in the Philip-\n pine Islands? Now all this cost, all these\n young men gone to their graves, all these\n wrecked lives, all this national dishonor,\n the repeal of the Declaration of Inde-\n pendence, the overthrow of the principle\n on which the Monroe doctrine was placed\n by its author, the devastation of provinces,\n the shooting of captives, the torture of\n prisoners and of unarmed and peaceful cit-\n izens, the hanging men up by the thumbs,\n the carloads of maniac soldiers that you\n bring home are all because you will not tell\n now whether you mean in the future to\n stand on the principles which you and your\n fathers always declared in the past.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Senator from Ohio says it is not wise\n to declare what we will do at some future\n time. Mr. President, we do not ask you to\n declare what you will do at some future\n time. We ask you to declare an eternal\n principle good at the present time and good\n at all times. We ask you to reaffirm it, be-\n cause the men most clamorous in support\n of what you are doing deny it. That prin-\n ciple, if you act upon it, prevents you from\n crushing out a weak nation, because of\n your fancied interest now or hereafter. It\n prevents you from undertaking to judge\n wffiat institutions are fit for other nations\n on the poor plea that you are the strongest.\n We are asking you at least to go no further\n than to declare what you would not do now\n or hereafter, and the reason for declaring\n it is that half of you declare you will hold\n this people in subjection and the other half\n on this matter are dumb. You declared\n what you would not do at some future time\n when you all voted that you would not take\n Cuba against the will of her people, did\n you not? We ask you to declare not at\n what moment you will get out of the Phil-\n ippine Islands, hut only on what eternal\n principle you will act, in them or out of\n them. Such declarations are made in all\n history. They are made in every important\n treaty between nations.\n</p>\n<p>\n Shallow Pretenses of Imperialism.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Constitution of the United States is\n itself but a declaration of what this coun-\n try will do and what it will not do in all\n future times. The Declaration of Indepen-\n dence, if it have the practical meaning it\n has had for a hundred years, is a declara-\n tion of what this country would do through\n all future times. The Monroe Doctrine, to\n w r hich sixteen republics south of us owe\n their life and their safety, was a declara-\n tion to mankind of what we would do in\n all future time. Among all the shallow pre-\n tenses of imperialism this statement that we\n will not say what we will do in the future\n is the most shallow of all. Was there ever\n such a flimsy pretext flaunted in the face\n of the American people as that of gentle-\n men who say. If any other nation on the\n face of the earth or all other nations to-\n gether attempt to overthrow the indepen-\n dence of any people to the south of us in\n this hemisphere, we w\u2019ill fight and prevent\n them, and at the same time think it dis-\n honorable to declare whether we w r ill ever\n overthrow ' the independence of a weaker na-\n tion in another hemisphere?\n</p>\n<p>\n If we take your view of it we have crushed\n out the only republic in Asia and put it\n undc-r our heel, and we are now at war with\n the only Christian people in the East. Even,\n as I said, the Senator from Ohio admits\n they arc a people, he only says there are\n several peoples and not one, as if the doc-\n triue that one people has no right to buy\n sovereignty over another, or to rule another\n</p>\n<p>\n against its will, did not apply in the plural\n number. You cannot crush out an unwilling\n people, or buy sovereignty over them, or\n treat them as spoils of conquest, or booty\n of battle in the singular, or at retail, but\n you have a perfect right to do it by whole-\n sale. Suppose there are several peoples in\n the Philippines. They have population\n enough to make 112 states of the size of\n Rhode Island or Delaware when they adopt-\n ed the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p>\n Why Not Tell of the Future.\n</p>\n<p>\n I suppose, according to this modern dee-\n trine, that if, when the Holy Alliance\n threatened to reduce the colonies which had\n thrown off the yoke of Spain in South\n America, not a whit more completely than\n the Philippine people had thrown off the\n yoke of Spain in Asia, if they had under-\n taken to subdue them all at once, John\n Quincy Adams and James Monroe would\n have held their peace and would at least\n have said it was not wise to say what we\n w r ould do in the future. If we had the\n right to protect nascent republics from the\n tyranny of other people and to declare that\n we would do it in the future, and if need\n be would encounter the whole continent\n of Europe single-handed in that case, is it\n any less fitting to avow that w ' e will protect\n such peoples from ourselves? How is it\n that these gentlemen who will not tell you\n what they will do in the future in regard\n to the Philippine Islands were so eager and\n greedy to tell you what they would do and\n what they would not do in the case of Cuba\n when we first declared war on Spain? You\n can make no distinction between these two\n cases except by having a motive, which I\n do not for one moment impute, that when\n you made war upon Spain you were afraid\n of Europe, if you did not make the declara-\n tion. These people are given to us as chil-\n dren. to lead them out of their childhood\n into manhood. They were docile and affec-\n tionate in the beginning. But they needed\n your kindness and justice, and a respect in\n them for the rights we claimed for our-\n selves, and the rights we had declared al-\n ways were inherent in all mankind. You\n preferred force to kindness and power to\n justice, and war to peace, and pride to\n generosity.\n</p>\n<p>\n You said you would not treat with a man\n with arms in\u2019 his hands. You have come,\n instead, to torture him when he was un-\n armed and defenseless Yet you said you\n would make his conduct the measure of\n your own; that if he lied to you you would\n lie to him; that if he were cruel to you you\n vmuld be cruel to him; that if he were a\n savage you wmuld be a savage also. You\n hell an attitude Loward him which you hold\n to no strong or to no civilized power. Y\u2019ou\n decorate an officer for the capture of Agui-\n naldo by treachery, and the next week rati-\n fy The Hague convention and denounce\n such action, and classify it with poisoning\n and breaking of faith.\n</p>\n<p>\n Who Began the Atrocities.\n</p>\n<p>\n You tell us, Mr. President, that the Philip-\n pine people have practiced some cruelties\n themselves. The investigation has not yet\n gone far enough to enable you to tell which\n side begun these atrocities. One case which\n one of the members of the majority of the\n committee told the Senate the other day\n was well established by proving that it\n occurred long before April, 1901, and w ' as so\n published, far and wide, in the press of this\n country at that time. I do not learn that\n there was any attempt to investigate it.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0023/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0023/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0023/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0023/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0023/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0023.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 875983}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"23\">\n<p>\n 21\n</p>\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n either by the War Department or by Con-\n gress, until the beginning of the present ses-\n sion of Congress. But suppose they (lid be-\n gin, it. Such things are quite likely to oc-\n cur when weakness is fighting for its rights\n against strength. Is their conduct any ex-\n cuse for ours? The Philippine people is but\n a baby in the hands of our republic.

It is benevolent assimilation over\n again. It is jU3t what the junior Senator\n from Indiana predicted. He thought we\n should conduct affairs in the Philippine\n Islands so admirably that we should pat-\n tern our domestic administration on that\n model. But did I understand that the\n Senator from North Carolina proposes, if\n his charge against the Democrats tnere is\n true, to make North Carolina a bowling\n wilderness, or to burn populous towns of\n 10,000 people, to get the people of North\n Carolina into reconcentration camps and to\n slay every male child over ten years old? I\n know nothing about the truth of the Sen-\n ator\u2019s charges. They have never been in-\n vestigated by the Senate so far. We had\n some painful investigations years ago by\n committees in this body and of the other\n House, notably one of which the senior Sen-\n ator from Colorado was chairman. But I\n never heard that you undertook to anply to\n Americans the methods which, if not justi-\n fied, at least are sought to be extenuated,\n in the Philippine Islands.\n</p>\n<p>\n Spain No Worse Than America.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, if the stories which come\n to me in private from officers of the Army\n and from the kindred and friends of soldiers\n are to be. trusted; if the evidence which\n seems to be just beginning before the Sen-\n ate committee con be trusted, there is noth-\n ing in the conduct of Spain in Cuba worse\n than the conduct of Americans in the Phil-\n ippine Islands. If this evidence be true, and\n nobody is as yet ready to deny it, and Spain\n were strong enough, she would have the\n right to-morrow to wrest the Philippine\n Islands from our grasp on grounds as good,\n if not better, than those which justified us\n when w r e made war upon her. The United\n States is a strong and powerful country \u2014\n the strongest and most powerful on earth,\n as w ' e love to think. But it is the first time\n in the history of this people for nearly 300\n years when we had to appeal to strength and\n not to the righteousness of our cause to\n maintain our position in a great debate of\n justice and liberty.\n</p>\n<p>\n Gentlemen tell us that the Filipinos are\n savages, that they have inflicted torture,\n that they have dishonored our dead and out-\n raged the living. That very likely may be\n true. Spain said the same thing of the\n Cubans. We have made the same charges\n against our own countrymen in the dis-\n turbed days after the war. The reports of\n committees and the evidence in the docu-\n ments in our library are full of them. But\n who ever heard before of an American gen-\n tleman, or an American, who took as a rule\n for his own conduct the conduct of his an-\n tagonist, or who claimed that the republic\n Should act as savages because she had sav-\n</p>\n<p>\n ages to deal with? I had supposed, Mr.\n President, that the question, whether a gen-\n tleman shall lie or murder or torture, de-\n pended on his sense of his own character,\n and not on his opinion of his victim. Of all\n the miserable sophistical shifts which have\n attended this wretched business from the\n beginning, there is none more miserable\n than this.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Volcano Will Remain.\n</p>\n<p>\n You knew \u2014 men are held to know what\n they ought to know in morals and in the\n conduct of states \u2014 and you knew that this\n people would resist you; you knew you were\n to have a war; you knew that if they were\n civilized, so far as they were civilized and\n like you, the war would be conducted after\n the fashion of civilized warfare, and that\n so far as they were savage the war would\n be conducted on their part after the fashion\n of savage warfare; and you knew also that\n if they resisted and held out, their soldiers\n would be tempted to do what they have\n done, and would yield to that temptation.\n And I tell you, Mr. President, that if you\n do not disregard the lessons of human na-\n ture thus far, and do not retrace your steps\n and set an example of another conduct, you\n will have and those who follow you will\n have a like experience hereafter. \u2019You may\n pacify this country on the surface; you may\n make it a solitude and call it peace; you\n may burn towns; you may exterminate popu-\n lations; you may kill the children or the\n boys over ten, as Herod slew the first-born\n of the Israelites. But the volcano will be\n there. You will not settle this thing in a\n generation or in a century or in ten cen-\n turies, until it is settled right. It never\n will be settled right until you look for your\n counselors to George Washington and Thom-\n as Jefferson and John Quincy Adams and\n Abraham Lincoln, and not to the reports\n of the War Department.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is iijuch more I should like to say,\n but I have spoken too long already. I have\n listened to what many gentlemen have said\n gentlemen whom I love and honor \u2014 with pro-\n found sorrow. They do over again in the\n Senate what Butke complained of to the\n House of Commons. \u00bb\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIn order to prove that the Americans\n have no right to their liberties we are every\n day endeavoring to subvert the maxims\n which preserve the whole spirit of our own.\n To prove that the Americans ought not to\n be free we are obliged to depreciate the\n value of freedom itself; and we never seem\n to gain a paltry advantage over them in de-\n bate without attacking some of those prin-\n ciples or deriding some of those feelings\n for w ' hich our ancestors have shed their\n blood.\u2019\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n I wish to cite another weighty max ' im from\n Burke:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAmerica, gentlemen say, is a noble object\n \u2014 it is an object well worth fighting for.\n Certainly it is, if fighting a people be the\n best way of gaining them. Gentlemen In\n this respect will be led to their choice of\n means by their complexions and their hab-\n its. Those who understand the military art\n will of course have some predilection for it.\n Those who wield the thunder of the State\n may have more confidence in the efficacy of\n arms. But I confess, possibly for the want\n of this knowledge, my opinion is much more\n in favor of prudent management than of\n force \u2014 considering force not as an odious,\n but a feeble instrument, for preserving a\n people so numerous, so active, so growing,\n</p>\n<p>\n so spirited as this, in a profitable connection\n with us.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThere is nothing \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Says Gibbon, the historian of the Decline\n and Fall of the Homan Empire \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cmore adverse to nature and reason than to\n hold in obedience remote countries and for-\n eign nations in opposition to their inclina-\n tion and interest. ' A torrent of barbarians\n may pass over the earth, but an extensive\n empire must be supported by a refined sys-\n tem of policy and oppression; in the center,\n an absolute power, prompt in action and\n rich in resources; a swift and easy com-\n munication with the extreme parts; fortifica-\n tions to check the first effort of rebellion;\n a regular administration to protect and pun-\n ish; and a w r ell disciplined army to inspire\n fear, without provoking discontent and des-\n pair.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n A Question We Must Answer.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lord Elgin, goverqor general of India and\n formerly governor general of Canada, well\n known and highly esteemed in the United\n States, declared as the result of his experi-\n ence in the East: \u201cIt is a terrible business,\n however \u2014 this living among inferior races.\n I have seldom from man or woman since\n I came to the East heard a sentence which\n was reconcilable with the hypothesis that\n Christianity had ever come into the world.\n Detestation, contempt, ferocity, vengeance,\n whether Chinamen or Indians be the object.\n One moves among them with perfect Indif-\n ference, treating them not as dogs, because\n in that case one would whistle to them and\n pat them, but as machines with which one\n can have no communion or sympathy. When\n the passions of fear and hatred are Ingrafted\n on this indifference, the result is frightful \u2014\n an absolute callousness as to the sufferings\n of the objects of those passions, which must\n be witnessed to be understood and believed. \"\n</p>\n<p>\n The American people have got this on\u00ae\n question to answer. They may answer It\n now; they can take ten years, or twenty\n years, or a generation, or a century to think\n of it. But it will not down. They must\n answer it in the end \u2014 Can you lawfully buy\n with money, or get by brute force of arms,\n the right to hold in subjugation an unwill-\n ing people, and to impose on them such con-\n stitution as you, and not they, think best\n for the m?\n</p>\n<p>\n We have answered this question a good\n many times in the past. The fathers an-\n swered it in 1776, and founded the republic\n upon their answer, which has been the corner\n stone. John Quincy Adams and James Monroe\n answered it again in the Monroe doctrine,\n which John Quincy Adams declared was only\n the doctrine of the consent of the governed.\n The Republican party answered it when It\n took possession of the forces of government\n at the beginning of the most brilliant period\n in all legislative history.

I can fancy\n each generation bringing its inscription,\n which should recite its own contribution to\n the great structure of which the column\n should be but the symbol. The generation\n of the Puritan and the Pilgrim and the\n Huguenot claims the place of honor at the\n base. \u201cI brought the torch of Freedom across\n the sea. I cleared the forest. I subdued the\n savage and the wild beast. I laid in Chris-\n tian liberty and law the foundations of em-\n</p>\n<p>\n pire.\u201d The next generation says: \u2018\u2018What\n my fathers founded I builded. I left the\n seashore to penetrate the wilderness. I\n planted schools and colleges and courts and\n churches.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Then comes the generation of the great co-\n lonial day. \u2018\u2018I stood by the side of England\n on many a hard fought field. I helped hum-\n ble the power of France. I saw the lilies go\n down before the lion at Louisburg and Que-\n bec. I carried the cross of St. George in tri-\n umph in Martinique and the Havana. I knew\n the stormy pathways of the ocean. I fol-\n lowed the whale from the Arctic to the Ant-\n srctic seas, among tumbling mountains of\n Ice and under equinoctial heat, as the great\n English orator said, \u2018No sea not vexed by my\n fisheries; no climate not witness to my\n toils.\u2019 \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Then comes the generation of the Revolu-\n tionary time. \u201cI encountered the power of\n England. I declared and won the independ-\n ence of my country. I placed that declaration\n on the eternal principles of justice and right-\n eousness which all mankind have read, and\n on which all mankind will one day stand. I\n affirmed the dignity of human nature and the\n right of the people to govern themselves. I\n devised the securities against popular haste\n and delusion which made that right secure. I\n created the Supreme Court and the Senate.\n For the first time in history I made the right\n of the people to govern themselves safe, and\n established Institutions for that end which\n will endure forever.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The next generation says: \u201cI encountered\n England again. I vindicated the right of an\n American ship to sail the seas the wide world\n over without molestation. I made the Amer-\n ican sailor as safe at the ends of the earth\n as my fathers had made the American farmer\n safe in his home. I proclaimed the Monroe\n doctrine in the face of the Holy Alliance,\n under which sixteen republics have joined the\n family of nations.

I brought in conciliation\n and peace instead of war. I secured in the\n practice of nations the great doctrine of ex-\n patriation. I devised the homestead system.\n I covered the prairie and the plain with\n happy homes and with mighty states. I\n crossed the continent and joined together\n the seas with my great railroads. I de-\n clared the manufacturing independence of\n America, as my fathers affirmed its political\n independence. I built up our vast domestic\n commerce. I made my country the richest,\n freest, strongest, happiest people on the face\n of the earth.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n And now what have we to say? What\n have we to say? Are we to have a place\n in that honorable company? Must we en-\n grave on that column, \u2018\u2018We repealed the\n Declaration of Independence. We changed\n the Monroe Doctrine from a doctrine of\n eternal righteousness and justice, resting\n on the consent of the governed, to a doctrine\n of brutal selfishness, looking only to our\n own advantage \\\\ e crushed the only re-\n public in Asia. We made war on the only\n Christian people in the East. We converted\n a war of glory to ' a war of shame. We\n vulgarized the American flag.

He\n would make, if he could, free speech trea-\n son, treason odious and cart us away to the\n gallows. He would perhaps allow the Sena-\n tor from Massachusetts (Mr. Hoar) the ben-\n efit of clergy on account cf his sympathy for\n a superheated conscience. All this, if we\n are to believe what he says, has the approv-\n al of the President of the United States. Con-\n gress no longer has to declare war. An\n Otis or a Chaffee will graciously undertake\n to do that and relieve us of the responsibil-\n ity.\n</p>\n<p>\n A few days ago a message came to us that\n Malvar, the last of the insurrectos, had sur-\n rendered. On the next day it was announced\n that General Chaffee had made a declaration\n of a new war, and had dispatched an army\n to wage it against 2,000,000 people in the\n Island of Mindanao. But, Mr. President,\n mum is the word so long as there is any dis-\n turbance anywhere within our borders or in\n any one of the thousand islands of the sea.\n The temple of Janus will never be closed;\n the brazen gates of war will remain forever\n open, and there will be no peace if only the\n party in power can thereby put a padlock\n upon our mouths and coin political capital\n out of the blood of our soldiers and the\n slaughter of unoffending peoples. So, Mr.\n President, if we are to speak at all we are\n compelled to speak now, although the Sena-\n tor in charge of this bill desires it to go\n through in silence, pursuant to the notion\n that so long as we have troubles upon our\n hands anywhere it is our patriotic duty to\n remain silent, even in respect to a measure\n of great importance and which is pending\n before the Congress for consideration.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, there are facts which cry\n out for utterance. There are things which\n demand revelation. Across the water there\n are more than 10,000,000 of suffering people\n silent and unheard, but whose souls doubt-\n less cry out against wrongs, cruel, unspeak-\n able, beyond the ken of mortal language to\n describe. There are more than 70,000,000\n people on this side of the water wanting to\n</p>\n<p>\n know the truth, heretofore stifled and sup-\n pressed. Mr. President, it seems to me that\n it is a time when it is a patriotic duty to\n give utterance to the truth, that the Ameri-\n can people may be advised and that w r e may\n intelligently deal w\u2019lth the important ques-\n tions which confront us.\n</p>\n<p>\n Friends of justice, champions of liberty,\n have ever been jealous of the encroachment\n of the executive or kingly power, and those\n who, irrespective of consequences to them-\n selves, have resisted its aggressions and re-\n fused to be seduced by its blandishments have\n passed into history with enduring and hon-\n orable fame, while those who have catered\n to it and sought to profit by the favors which\n it had to bestow have sunk into oblivion, or,\n if remembered, are only remembered to be\n despised.\n</p>\n<p>\n What is this bill? The Senator who intro-\n duced it has not explained it; but upon its\n examination we will find that it continues,\n if it does not establish in perpetuity, a presi-\n dential despotism \u2014 not a benevolent despot-\n ism, but a cruel, a remorseless and a preda-\n tory despotism.\n</p>\n<p>\n For this they have no warrant in our his-\n tory or traditions. To do this they must\n trample under foot the precepts of our Consti-\n tution and axioms of our liberty- This bill\n reaches backward as well as forward. It\n strikes its roots into and derives its support\n from the excrescence upon the army oppro-\n priation bill of 1901 known as the \" Spooner\n amendment.\u201d The qualification of the abso-\n lute power therein conferred, adopted at the\n instance of the Senator from Massachusetts,\n by this bill is eliminated. After this bill\n shall have passed, this absolute power w r ill\n stand forth stripped of every qualification\n and limitation. In order to comprehend this\n bill, therefore, it is necessary to read into it\n as a part of it that grant of absolute author-\n ity. This bill appears in some respects in dis-\n guise. Its real purpose does not in all re-\n spects appear upon its face. It is another\n Trojan horse stalking into the citadel of the\n nation filled with the arms and soldiers of a\n despotic power, concealing the instrumentali-\n ties of tyranny and oppression and the means\n of spoliation and plunder. * * *\n</p>\n<p>\n Philippine Commission.\n</p>\n<p>\n Senator Rawlins then entered upon a\n lengthy analytical argument as regards con-\n ditions in the Philippines under the provis-\n ions of the commission in matters of land,\n</p>\n<p>\n power of courts. On the land question he said\n in part:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cOne of the evils of the islands Is the\n large holdings of land by what are known\n as the friars. These holdings each amount,\n on the average, to about 60,000 acres of land,\n held by corporations; and authority is given\n iu this bill to appropriate those lands in ex-\n ercise of the power of eminent domain. The\n effect of the transaction will be, if it is con-\n summated, to take lands now held in large\n quantities from one corporation in order to\n sell them in equal quantities to another cor-\n poration.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe mischief which now exists in the is-\n lands does not consist particularly in the\n character of the individuals who compose\n those organizations, but in the fact that they\n are corporations or syndicates holding\n large tracts of land and excluding all the\n people from proprietorship in those lands.\n They are a constant source of irritation.\n The persons bolding them desire to exploit\n them to the greatest possible advantage, and\n they naturally -desire to obtain the cheapest\n labor which will yield to them the largest\n amount of product with the lowest amount\n of outlay. That same mischief \u2014 \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 How many acres did the sen-\n ator say was the amount of these lands?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Rawlins \u2014 Held by the friars?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 The senator stated the number\n of acres as 60,000, as I understood him, and\n I thought he had made a mistake.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Rawlins \u2014 Those lands are held In\n tracts of about 60,000 acres each, and there\n are about thirty such tracts. There are\n thirty religious centers, and the aggregate\n of the land is something in the neighborhood\n of half a million acres.\n</p>\n<p>\n Taking From One to Give to Another.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, it is an unusual authority,\n as the Senator from Massachusetts (Mr.\n Hoar), who Is a distinguished lawyer, will, I\n think, at once recognize, to undertake to\n appropriate in the exercise of the power of\n eminent domain the lands or property be-\n longing to one corporation in order to trans-\n fer the same lands to another corporation.\n In this case the power is to be exercised by\n the application of a sort of religious test.\n If these lands are held by a corporation com-\n posed of Catholics or a certain order, they\n are to be the subject of condemnation, to be\n turned over by the process of eminent do-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0026/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0026/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0026/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0026/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0026/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0026.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 1046680}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"26\">\n<p>\n 24\n</p>\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n main into the hands of another corporation,\n composed perhaps of Protestants, or people\n of mixed religion, or no religion.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is scarcely a public purpose, within the\n usual rule established at least by the courts\n of this country, to condemn one man\u2019s land\n in order to sell it or dispose of it to another.\n That is not a public purpose. This provision\n In relation to the friars\u2019 land, this attempted\n exercise of the power of eminent domain to\n appropriate the property of one individual\n in order to give it to another, is fundamen-\n tally vicious.

Is not the sole purpose to take\n the title of the lands out of one corporation\n regardless of the question of who will get\n th# benefit of them? In proceedings of con-\n demnation the object in view is to give a\n certain privilege or interest in land to some\n party who is to make a certain use of it \u2014\n under our system a public use\u2014 but in this\n case, as I understand it, the motive is not\n to give the advantage of the lands to some\n other particular person, but to see that they\n are gotten away from a certain corporation,\n which is distasteful to some people. Is not\n that true? In other words, there is no par-\n ticular object that is in view in the change\n of ownership; it is not for the purpose of\n benefiting somebody else who is going to\n make a certain use of them\u2014 build a rail-\n road, for instance, or engage in any other\n work\u2014 but the purpose, as I understand it,\n is to get the title of the lands out of the\n friars. Is not that the main and controlling\n motive?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Rawlins \u2014 Well, Mr. President, I am\n unable to give the Senator the motive other-\n wise than appears from the provisions of\n the bill, and the effect of the bill, if it shall\n become a law, will be that if the lands of\n these religious orders are condemned and\n appropriated in the exercise of the power\n of eminent domain, the title will vest in the\n government of the Philippine Islands, in\n which government the titles to all other\n public lands in the islands are vested under\n the provisions of this bill. I mean the title\n in the sense of having the power of abso-\n lute control and disposition.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Bacon \u2014 Mr. President\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Ra-lins \u2014 Now, if the Senator will per-\n mit me, these lands when thus condemned,\n these religious orders thus oemg deprivefl of\n them, will become a part of the public lands\n of the islands. Then the Philippine Com-\n mission, if it carries into effect the purpose\n as expressed by Governor Taft, and which\n is embodied in the report of the com-\n mission in the exercise of the authority\n which this bill is designed to confer, will\n grant those lands by sale to syndicates or\n corporations in large tracts for purposes of\n exploitation, Governor Taft saying that 5,000\n</p>\n<p>\n acres was too limited a quantity, and men-\n tioned one concern which desired at least\n 10,000 acres, and in another place indicating\n that 20,000 acres would not be excessive.\n So that the practical effect, if this policy be\n carried out, will be to issue bonds, to incur\n this indebtedness, and to appropriate, against\n the will of these religious orders, in the ex-\n ercise of the power of eminent domain, this\n more than half a million acres of land ar.d\n immediately, under the rules to be prescribed\n by the Philippine Commission, dispose of it\n in tracts ranging from 6,000 to 20,000 acres\n to syndicates or corporations in perpetuity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Tends to Degrade People.\n</p>\n<p>\n But if the policy which is recommended by\n the commission and which this bill is de-\n signed to subserve is carried into effect the\n evils which now prevail there, and which\n prevailed there during the dominance of\n Spain, will be multiplied in extent and in\n their difficulties as we proceed to create new\n orders, new syndicates, new corporations\n for purposes of spoliation or exploitation\n and to place the control of lands in large\n quantities into their hands.\n</p>\n<p>\n We know absolutely with certainty that\n syndicates of this character are not interested\n in the public weal. Their primary and in\n fact, their only purpose is to derive the\n largest degree of profit possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n There will be ten or twenty thousand acres\n of land in a tract, and a few large tracts\n will cover all the available land in the\n islands, that is, land which can be reclaimed.\n These syndicates will be controlled by alien\n proprietors, who have no personal interest in\n the islands or in their welfare or In the wel-\n fare and happiness of their people. It will\n be a system of pernicious landlordism, which\n has led to disquiet on the part of the people\n of Ireland.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, these syndicates, organized\n with stockholders in New York and Chicago\n and San Francisco, of Great Britain, with\n their agents in the islands to execute their\n policy of greed (using that word in no offensive\n sense, but only to the end for which the cor-\n poration itself is organized), the land being\n thus held and thus managed, how are you\n ever to have a citizenship in the islands\n upon whom could safely be devolved the ex-\n ercise of the powers of government? How\n do you ever expect by such a policy to uplift\n the people of the islands and make them fit\n for self-government? This policy does not\n tend to insure an independent and self-re-\n liant and intelligent citizenship. It tends to\n degradation, to turpitude, and slavery. It\n tends to unfit the people, and if they are now\n unfit to be intrusted, with the employment\n of any power of government, they will be\n doubly unfit after they receive a schooling\n under the training and despotism of alien\n syndicates holding possession of all their\n lands.\n</p>\n<p>\n So, Mr. President, this part of the bill re-\n lating to the friars, while apparently justi-\n fied. on account of the difficulties which have\n grown out of the situation in the islands, it\n seems to me will result in no cure of the\n mischief unless we shall alter the bill so as\n to make an entirely different disposition of\n the lands that may be acquired from these\n religious orders.\n</p>\n<p>\n For Benefit of Speculators.\n</p>\n<p>\n Passing from that question, Mr. President,\n the lands, which are distributed throughout\n the archipelago, held by these religious or-\n ders, in some thirty different localities,\n amounting to more than a half million acres,\n if we are to believe the testimony of Gov- i\n ernor Taft, are nc longer held by the re- <\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2022 ligious orders referred to. He says in his\n i testimony that they have been transferred,\n ; but that, in his opinion, the transactions\n are only colorable; that in reality these\n</p>\n<p>\n > lands remain the property of the religious or-\n \u2019 ders in question. They are not the property\n - of the apostolic authorities of the Catholic\n</p>\n<p>\n Church. They were the property of the dif-\n i ferent corporations constituting the five re-\n ! ligious orders, and the property was sup-\n I posed to be dedicated to certain specific\n : charities in the islands; but I alluded to the\n</p>\n<p>\n > fact that it was at one time thought that\n $5,000,000 would be sufficient to cover the\n purchase price of these lands. More recent-\n ly the figures have been raised to $17,000,000.\n</p>\n<p>\n It happens to have been disclosed in re-\n gard to some of these tracts, notably one in\n Mindoro, referred to in the testimony of\n Governor Taft, amounting to about 60,000\n acres of land, that it has been disposed of at\n least under option to a man, who attained\n some notoriety as having been indicted for\n corrupting certain officers and people in the\n Philippine Islands. Having obtained an op-\n tion upon this large tract of land at the\n figures therein mentioned, he was interest-\n ed in disposing of the tract at a profit to\n himself and his associates. I have no doubt\n that the designation of the condition of that\n tract of land, which is to be appropriated\n under the authority to which I have re-\n ferred, will be found to be true w T ith respect\n to every other of these tracts claimed to\n belong to religious orders in the Philippine\n Islands.\n</p>\n<p>\n The urgency or pressure is brought to bear\n to confer unusual and unlimited power upon\n the government of the Philippine Islands is\n in order that such government will issue\n bonds, raise the money, and appropriate\n these lands on terms w r hich will prove pro-\n fitable to the speculators who have obtained\n options upon them. It is, of course, to the\n interest of these so called religious orders\n in the islands to dispose of these lands. The\n orders have become so obnoxious to the in-\n habitants throughout the islands that they\n cannot safely remain; they cannot operate\n those large estates with profit, and, as dis-\n closed in the testimony in the case which\n has been laid before us, they are at present\n unprofitable, owing partly to the disturbed\n state of the country, and these orders have\n been only too willing to make some arrange-\n ment, I have no doubt, with speculators to\n dispose of these lands; and the speculators,\n of course, have no other interest in this\n question than to obtain the profit upon the\n conditional investment made by them. The\n statement of Governor Taft that these trans-\n actions are colorable, when explained, will\n be found to mean nothing more than the\n parties have obtained preferential rights of\n purchase, and hold those rights subject to\n the condition that they can dispose of these\n so called lands to the government of the\n Philippine Islands.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, ought we to confer authori-\n ty like this to this end? If these lands were\n to be taken from the friars, who held them,\n if there was a necessity for this action in\n order that the people of the islands who\n want to make and maintain their homes\n there and are interested in its future and\n permanent welfare and we might thereby re-\n store peace to that stricken land, I would\n join with any others in doing what I could\n to bring about such a desirable result.\n</p>\n<p>\n A Vicious Policy.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is a most vicious policy, in my opinion,\n to commit in any country large tracts of\n God\u2019s footstool, designed to be devoted to\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0027/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0027/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0027/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0027/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0027/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0027.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 883198}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"27\">\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 25\n</p>\n<p>\n the use of His creatures, to the monopoly\n of any sort of corporation, whether it be re-\n ligious or secular.\n</p>\n<p>\n As I have pointed out, the authority\n under this bill given to the Philippine gov-\n ernment is to acquire any land, whether be-\n longing to religious orders, corporations or\n individuals. That language is industrious-\n ly employed for a purpose. It would not do\n to limit it to religious corporations or or-\n ganizations or to these five orders, because\n then it could not be employed in the inter-\n ests of speculators who have obtained op-\n tions on this land. It would not do to limit\n it to corporations holding in such large\n quantities as might be injurious to the wel-\n fare of that people, for the individuals who\n hold there options in some instances are not\n incorporated.\n</p>\n<p>\n So we have the designation broad enough\n to cover the individual, who, without ex-\n pense to himself, has gone to these relig-\n ious orders and obtained the option, with\n the sole purpose of turning over the lands,\n at a profit to himself, to the government of\n the Philippine Islands. Hence it is natural\n that our friends upon the other side do not\n care to have a discussion of this bill.\n</p>\n<p>\n Fanatical but Brave.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have had within a few days a beauti-\n ful illustration of the very thing to which I\n now invite the attention of the Senate. In\n the course of our investigation in the Phil-\n ippine committee Governor Taft referred to\n the fact that a gentleman from Chicago had\n proposed to embark in an industry in the\n Island of Mindanao. It furthermore ap-\n peared that he had made an exploration of\n that island, and it was ascertained there\n that by the acquisition of a large tract of\n land it could be devoted to the culture of the\n rubber tree, to the great profit of those who\n might engage in the enterprise. Of course,\n the inhabitants of Mindanao are non-Chris-\n tian tribes; they are Moros. There are down\n there about 300,000 slaves, more or less.\n They are a brave people; they are a fanat-\n ical people.\n</p>\n<p>\n But it is necessary to subdue those peo-\n ple; it may be necessary to exterminate\n those people, because probably they can\n only be subdued by extermination or annihi-\n lation. A syndicate of non-resident stock-\n holders cannot make a profit out of the en-\n terprise so long as that menace, that cloud,\n overhangs their operations in the Island of\n Mindanao. What pernicious influence has\n been brought to bear upon the general com-\n manding our Army or the subordinate com-\n manders in the immediate vicinity of this\n field of contemplated exploitation I know\n not. I do not intend to do any injustice to\n any one; but seemingly, if we are to believe\n the messages emanating from the adminis-\n tration responsible for this government, we\n are to understand that these are, substan-\n tially the facts.\n</p>\n<p>\n The tribes of Moros never submitted to\n Spain, never acknowledged allegiance to her,\n except in a qualified way. At most Spain\n had but a suzerainty over them. In all their\n past they have been pursuing their own lines\n and their own methods of government, sub-\n ject to their own traditions and forms of\n religion. Since the date of the Paris treaty\n there has been little or no disturbance there,\n and they have been proceeding in peace\n and quietude until the disturbing hand of the\n syndicator has thrust itself into their midst,\n and then what happened? A subordinate\n officer sends out a message to those people\n that now they must submit, that now they\n</p>\n<p>\n must submit to exploration, with the in-\n cidental and resultant exploitation. They\n must yield up their guns and ammunition\n aDd submit to the dictates of the representa-\n tives of the American Government. They\n must no longer stand as a menace to those\n who seek to take possession of their lands\n and devote them to their own uses and carry\n their wealth away to a foreign country. We\n invite you to do this in all kindness and\n benevolence. We do not want to have any\n bloodshed, but if you will thus submit and\n thus surrender all that is dear to you, you\n may have peace, else we will present the\n other alternative.\n</p>\n<p>\n So he sends out his expedition, his criers\n in advance, calling upon the people to ac-\n knowledge the beneficence of the edict that\n he issued for their subjugation. They resist.\n Thereupon, without consulting Congress \u2014\n which, under the Constitution is supposed\n alone to have the power to declare war \u2014\n seemingly without consulting the President\n of the United States, -who, although he has\n no such power, is at least or ought to be the\n commander of the Armies of the United\n States (whether he consulted the general\n commanding the Armies in the Philippines\n we have no very definite information), the\n Army was sent out and the war was begun.\n A new declaration of war against between\n one and two million people, covering an\n island amounting to something like 30,000,000\n acres!\n</p>\n<p>\n What Cares the Exploiter?\n</p>\n<p>\n It is said that this island is as large as the\n Island of Luzon. It was a large undertaking\n against a brave people, a fanatical people,\n ready to fight for what they conceived to be\n right. It was the beginning of a war which\n will involve the sacrifice of how many thou-\n sands of American soldiers we can only con-\n jecture; involving the expenditure of moneys\n wrung from the American people by taxa-\n tion to the extent of how many millions we\n can only estimate in the roughest possible\n way; involving all the brutalities and cruel-\n ties which seem to be necessary incident to\n the waging of war in the tropics.\n</p>\n<p>\n What is that to one of these exploiters?\n What is that to a military satrap? What\n is that to the governor general of the Philip-\n pine Archipelago? What care ' they for the\n welfare of the people in the distant islands?\n What care they for the welfare of the people\n of the United States? They (the exploiters)\n can see within their reach a few paltry dol-\n lars to enrich their coffers. What care they\n how many millions may be extracted from\n the treasury of the United States or what\n treasures of blood are wasted?\n</p>\n<p>\n The attention of the country will be called\n to these things, though the other side may\n remain vacant and silent, and 1 believe that\n ultimately the people of the United States\n will be aroused to the situation and will\n listen with attentive ears, and that they will\n be heard in a manner which will be sur-\n prising to those who now treat this ques-\n tion with indifference.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then, we are informed, the President of\n the United States yesterday advised a sus-\n pension, and the word, comes back that that\n will never do. Stop a war? Never. Stop a\n war never declared by Congress? What is\n Congress? Stop a war that the American peo-\n ple do not want? What are the American\n people? Stop a war and prevent the shedding\n of human blood and the sacrifice and slaugh-\n ter of people who have given no offense?\n What care we for them? General Chaffee\n says it is necessary to do all this in order\n</p>\n<p>\n that we may have the respect of the Moros.\n Will we have their respect after we have\n slaughtered their people?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, who would have thought,\n who could have dreamed, that scarcely more\n than a hundred years from the time our\n fathers laid the foundation of this Republic\n a bill like this could have been brought into\n the legislative body of this nation with any\n prospect of meeting with favorable consid-\n eration? The government of the Philippine\n Islands is to have all civil, judicial and mil-\n itary power which it may, in its sweet Judg-\n ment, believe necessary to govern 10,000,000\n people and 76,000,000 acres of territory,\n coupled with a provision that the land,\n 76,000,000 acres, for which the American peo-\n ple paid, at least to Spain, the sum of\n $20,000,000, made as a donation to this oli-\n garchy of absolutism, is to be disposed of\n for their own benefit and not for the benefit\n of any man, woman or child in the United\n States, or, I might add, in the land which is\n to be oppressed by them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Asks Questions.\n</p>\n<p>\n Are there any limitations upon the power\n of the government of the Philippine Islands?\n I should like any one upon the other side\n to answer that question. (A pause.) There\n is no response. Is there any independent\n judiciary to safeguard the rights of all the\n people or any of the people or the property\n of any one in the archipelago or elsewhere?\n Is it not absolutely dependent upon the will\n of the oligarchy known as the Philippine\n Commission? If any one thinks there is, I\n would be glad now to have him make re-\n sponse to the interrogatory I propound. (A\n pause.) No; there Is no independent Ju-\n diciary. The judges are dependent for the\n tenure of their office and the amount of\n their salaries on this oligarchy. The judges\n are dependent for the jurisdiction they may\n exercise absolutely upon the will of this\n oligarchy. The Judges are dependent for\n their existence in any given district upon\n the caprice and will of this oligarchy.\n</p>\n<p>\n Any judge who may presume to exercise\n any jurisdiction derogatory to the wishes\n of the oligarchy may be supplanted the mo-\n ment he undertakes to render his decision.\n When he has decided the question, and it\n is favorable to them, they may make it final\n and cut off the right of appeal to any su-\n perior tribunal, and if it is unfavorable they\n can remove him and put in a neuv judge who\n will grant to them what they wish.\n</p>\n<p>\n Army Not Responsible for Use to Which\n It Has Been Put.\n</p>\n<p>\n But, Mr. President, I am going to pass now\n from the questions relating immediately to\n the provisions of this bill to another sub-\n ject, and I desire to premise what I say in\n relation to that by the statement that our\n Army originally sent to the Philippine\n Islands did not undertake the service which\n they have since been compelled to perform.\n Without undertaking to go into the history\n of our relation fully, I may state two or\n three things connected with it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Men volunteered to achieve a given result\n in the Island of Cuba in a w ' ar with Spain.\n That was achieved to the fullest possible de-\n gree.

When we had completed the\n benign purpose which had brought the\n American people up to the point of making\n the declaration of war against Spain, we\n then entered upon a repetition of the history\n of the very cruelty and barbarism of torture\n and oppression, of killing and extermination\n of which Spain had been guilty, and we did\n it deliberately, willfully, maliciously, with\n malice aforethought.\n</p>\n<p>\n Every nation is endowed with the power\n of rational volition and must suffer the con-\n sequences for the failure to exercise it, and\n I am not willing to concede that the Execu-\n tive Mansion is but a madhouse and that its\n occupant Is not responsible for his acts, or\n that they are the result of incompetence and\n incapacity for government.\n</p>\n<p>\n Barbarism and Cruelty.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, the war was begun in the\n manner which I have pointed out. Those\n who came in conflict with the American\n troops were slaughtered. It finally developed\n that no wounded were left upon the field. I\n say no wounded, because the official reports\n of the wounded among the Filipinos do not\n disclose any wounded to speak of. Whether\n the marksmanship of the American troops\n was so unerring that in every instance they\n struck the fatal spot \u2014 a theory which was\n propounded in the testimony of General Mac-\n Arthur\u2014 I must leave the Senate or those in-\n terested in this question to determine.\n Whether the Filipinos, shot down by hun-\n dreds and thousands, were enabled under\n the pressure and speed of the American\n troops to carry away their wounded, accord-\n ing to an alternative theory propounded in\n the testimony of General MacArthur, I sub-\n mit to the fair consideration of the judg-\n ment of those who are to pass upon this\n question.\n</p>\n<p>\n Certain It is, Mr. President, that our troops\n swept those people from the face of the earth\n in hundreds and in thousands. I commend\n the official reports of General MacArthur and\n other generals as to the relative proportion\n of killed and wounded on the American side,\n which is normal, to the killed and wounded\n on the Filipino side, which discloses prac-\n tically no wounded at all.\n</p>\n<p>\n That is one phase of this war. As it pro-\n gressed the policy of those who had control\n of it, according to the testimony of General\n Hughes, became stiffer and stift ' er, to use his\n exact language. It became progressively\n more severe, and when you look back at the\n earliest stages of that war you wonder what\n that signifies. But we find out what it signi-\n fies.\n</p>\n<p>\n First, the war was waged against men in\n arms, and they were slaughtered. Next it\n became stiffer by waging it against men and\n women and little children. Next it became\n stiffer by the burning of the villages and,\n irrespective of age, sex or condition, sweep-\n ing the land of every vestige of shelter and\n of food. Next it became still stiffer, follow-\n ing precedents of the dark ages, when\n tyrants resorted to excruciating torture to\n compel information and inflict punishment\n against people struggling to be free \u2014 tor-\n tures devised under the supervision of a\n Torquemada and the inquisition; tortures\n employed by a Phillip II in the Nether-\n lands; the water torture, and other hideous\n tortures so infamous that modern language |\n</p>\n<p>\n falls to furnish terms in which to adequately\n and properly characterize them were applied\n to the racking of the nerves of a sensitive\n peopib, loving justice, music, and the higher\n arts of civilization.\n</p>\n<p>\n But the Secretary of War has denied this,\n and General Funston, coming back from the\n midst of its very universal practice, said,\n \u201cIt is an atrocious lie,\u201d and proceeded to de-\n scribe it in a manner which showed his\n familiarity with the practice as it prevailed\n in his presence. These denials have been so\n impudent that it has really been astonishing\n that they could be made in the face of the\n overwhelming testimony of the universal and\n systematic practice of these brutalities\n everywhere where our soldiers penetrated in\n the Philippine Islands.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, most all of you have read\n the \u201cCommentaries of Caesar,\u201d as he dealt\n with barbaric peoples in Gaul and in Ger-\n many, and in the course of those commen-\n taries we have read how severe he waged\n that war, sometimes in open battle, wiping\n out nations of people; but, Mr. President,\n you will search the lids of that work in vain\n to find an account of any such cruelties as\n have been practiced, according to the ad-\n mitted testimony of our soldiers and our\n Armies, in the Philippine Islands.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, there w r as torture in old\n Rome. After Caesar was assassinated and\n some tyrants seized P9ssession of the reins\n of government, overthrowing the republic,\n a conscription list was issued, under which\n Cicero, the great orator, philosopher and\n statesman, was beheaded, as according to\n some modern suggestions some other people\n ought to be beheaded or hanged. When they\n sought to carry out their proscription in\n one instance Quintus Cicero, who had fought\n bravely in the armies of Rome and upheld\n the standard of the Roman Republic, was\n also one of those designated to death. As\n they were seeking to find him in the city\n of Rome they seized his son and inflicted\n upon him this torture, until by his screams\n reaching the ears of his father he came forth\n and both were put to death. But every one\n who has read that instance in history has\n been horrified at it and- wondered how in a\n civilized country such things could possi-\n bly be.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, we have taken the sover-\n eignty of Spain, it is said, over the Philip-\n pine archipelago, and our friends on the\n other side have maintained that it is such a\n rightful sovereignty that w ' hen it passes to\n us under general grant and general cession\n we possessed it also as inviolably as did\n Spain and that we did not acquire it to be\n administered according to the precepts of\n our Constitution and the traditions of our\n history, but that we have acquired it to\n rule them with an iron hand and by the\n methods of Spanish cruelty and despotism.\n</p>\n<p>\n Conscience of Humanity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ah, Mr. President, what an awful thing this\n is! I commend it to the conscience and to\n the considerations of humanity, if such a\n thing may happen to lurk still in the breast\n of the American people. But I have not told\n all. I am not charging the American soldier\n in the ranks, sent hither to fight an unhon-\n ored battle, to engage in a w\u2019ar which would\n not and could not commend itself to his\n sense of propriety and justice. I am making\n no indictment of the men who have thus,\n unc^er the eommands of superiors, been led\n against a people struggling to be free. I am\n making no charges of isolated cruelty for the\n</p>\n<p>\n purpose of arraigning any man who has vol-\n unteered in the service of his country.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President. I would be guilty of arrant\n cowardice if I should undertake to break\n my shafts of criticism against those men who\n have been but the tools of an iniquitous pol-\n icy, because the evidence has developed un-\n til it is overwhelming and incontrovertible\n that these practices in the islands have been\n widespread and systematic, and approved by\n the military superiors, not by the subordi-\n nate commanders. I invite Senators to look\n over one of these reports, a list of about\n forty charges made against American sol-\n diers for misconduct in the Philippine Is-\n lands. The testimony is now uncontroverted\n and incontrovertible, from Governor Taft and\n from witnesses whose credulity Is beyond\n dispute, to which I shall call attention later.\n In a report of the governor of Tayabas, Major\n Gardener, who served in the volunteer\n forces, he reported that in his province\n American soldiers and officers had so re-\n peatedly inflicted the torture that it rendered\n it impossible for him to maintain peace un-\n der the civil government.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Presdent, of those forty charges made\n iu the manner which I have stated you will\n not find a single instance of a man arraigned\n upon the charge of inflicting torture known\n as the water cure. We find that certain\n methods of torture there, mild in their char-\n acter, were not approved\u2014 for Instance, for\n hanging a Filipino by the neck for a few\n minutes a soldier was convicted upon the\n trial, and his punishment was a reprimand.\n</p>\n<p>\n Water Cure Confessions.\n</p>\n<p>\n H. A. Davis, a man evidently frank and\n truthful, and manly in every way in his ap-\n pearance, appeared and testified to these in-\n flictions of the water cure upon the presi-\n dents or mayor of Igbarras and the inflic-\n tion of it upon the policemen by the regu-\n lar water detail. In addition thereto he tes-\n tified that on the sai\u2014 e day Dr. Lyon went\n into the school house and, presenting a pis-\n tol at the head of the schoolmaster or school\n teacher, threatened his life unless he made\n a certain statement which was demanded of\n him by Dr. Lyon. Thereupon they obtained\n the statement, whatever of truth there may\n have been in it.\n</p>\n<p>\n We pressed this matter, and could have\n \u2022produced witnesses without number in sup-\n port of these same tacts, showing that this\n torture was inflicted in public in the pres-\n ence of numerous men, and under the direc-\n tion of the judge advocate on the staff of\n General Hughes, until one member of the\n majority of the committee arose in his place\n when it was proposed to make further in-\n vestigation of this matter and declared that\n he would object to any further tes-\n timony upon a fact which was proved\n conclusively, and concerning which there\n was no dispute. So that the com-\n mittee at this point has decided to call no\n more witnesses in support of the facts which\n I have now detailed to the Senate, on the\n ground that they are conclusively proved to\n be true.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is not all that those witnesses testi-\n fied to. This company of the Twenty-sixth\n Volunteer Infantry were at the town of Ig-\n barras for seven months, the months prior to\n the 27th of November, 1900, and until the ap-\n proaching March, 1901. They stated that dur-\n ing that time there were fifteen men in that\n garrison. They also stated that there had\n been no trouble, no assault committed upon\n any American soldier; that that community\n had been peaceable.

These scouts\n \u2014 the Gordon Scouts \u2014 and Captain Glenn ap-\n pear upon the scene early in the morning\n of the 27th of November, 1900.\n</p>\n<p>\n Seemingly, according to this testimony they\n desired to establish certain things, namely,\n that the mayor of the town was in reality\n disloyal to the United States; that the police-\n men of the town were not acting in good faith\n In maintaining the peace; that- in some way\n or other they were rendering aid, directly or\n indirectly, to the insurrectos in the field. In\n the morning officers were sent out, who ar-\n rested the mayor of the town. He was\n dragged in and stripped, and Captain Glenn,\n the judge advocate, decided to prove his case,\n and when he had proved his case he decided\n to Inflict the penalty. How did he prove his\n case? He took the poor old man and strip-\n ped him, brutally laid him down upon his\n back under a faucet, thrust a stick in his\n mouth to keep it open, and let the water run\n in until he was filled. According to the tes-\n timony of these witnesses, his eyes became\n bloodshot, and he shrieked In pain and agony.\n</p>\n<p>\n Copernican Methods.\n</p>\n<p>\n While in that situation, the interpreter,\n doubtless compelled to perform this infamous\n service, stooped over him and said, \u201cConfess,\n confess. \" It makes us think of Copernicus,\n when he was subjected to the torture and\n thrown down. They wanted him to announce\n that the world did not revolve upon its axi3,\n and was promised if he would say so that they\n would let him go or else they would take his\n life, and he, refusing to say so, they took his\n life. So this presidents was tortured until he\n was compelled to say what these men wanted\n him to say. If he had not said it, what would\n have happened to him we can only conjecture;\n but, being unable to endure that form of tor-\n ture longer he said what they desired he\n should say. He declared that he himself was\n a traitor and was communicating with the in-\n surrectos in the field.\n</p>\n<p>\n Not satisfied with that, they wanted to get\n corroborating testimony. They doubted the\n credibility of this witness, and the testimony\n elicited in this way, in this sort of judicial\n proceeding, by the judge advocate, a prose-\n cutor of the army. So they wanted corrobo-\n ration and they arrested two policemen, and\n throwing them down and placing over them\n the interpreter, tortured them and wracked\n their nerves until they shrieked with agony\n and pain, and, to obtain relief, were com-\n pelled to give testimony, doubtless in cor-\n roboration of the testimony of the mayor.\n</p>\n<p>\n Still they were not satisfied. They wanted\n the more credible testimony of the school\n teacher of the town, and an army contract\n surgeon, under the direction of Captain Glenn,\n visited the place where the little children\n were congregated and, aa an example of the\n beneflceneeof the administration of American\n government to the rising generation of the\n Filipinos, brandished his weapon and, put-\n ting it at the head of the teacher in the\n presence of the pupils, said: \u201cConfess! Con-\n fess that you are a traitor; that your people\n are traitors\u201d; and under danger of death\n thus threatened in the presence of the little\n children, he doubtless confessed, whether to\n the truth or a falsehood I know not and\n care not. In that way the testimony of the\n presidente w r as corroborated by the police-\n men, and the policemen were corroborated\n by the school teacher, and what was the\n penalty? They sent the old man to prison.\n They sent him away to Manila, and he is\n doubtless now in that infamous Spanish den,\n languishing away his days, convicted by a\n</p>\n<p>\n I judge advocate representing the authority\n I of the American Republic, based upon tes-\n timony extorted thus and corroborated only\n in the same way.\n</p>\n<p>\n Other Penalties.\n</p>\n<p>\n What were the other penalties? There\n were 10,000 men, women and little children\n in that town. That evening, at 8 o\u2019clock, a\n most opportune hour, direction was given\n to the soldiers to proceed to the head of\n the town with an interpreter and go along\n the street with all speed and begin the work\n of destruction, burning the village, begin-\n ning at the top; and the only notice of it as\n they marched up the street was that the\n crier called out to such people as heard him\n that they were going to burn the town.\n They got to the top of the town and they\n began the work of destruction. The torch\n was applied to every house and they were\n all destroyed with the exception of fifteen.\n Ten thousand people who had committed no\n offense whatsoever against any human being,\n so far as anything disclosed in this case is\n concerned, had their homes wiped from the\n face of the earth. Men, women and chil-\n dren were turned out to starve; yes, their\n provisions destroyed, their household effects\n destroyed, everything except that which they\n had upon their person, if anything, de-\n stroyed.\n</p>\n<p>\n These men. women and little children were\n the victims of this \u201cstiffer\u201d policy of Gener-\n al Hughes, and I have read to you already the\n excuse General Hughes gave. He said,\n \u201cYes; we burned the town. The best way to\n punish the man is to punish the women and\n children.\u201d The most effectual method of\n bringing to terms a parent who loves his\n child is to inflict torture and punishment\n upon his unoffending offspring. Why? Be-\n cause the War Department and Colonel\n Dickman telis us some cruel things had hap-\n pened, mentioning three or four instances\n which are named in the report, and when\n they are made the subject of scrutiny and\n inquiry what do we find? The nearest one of\n those that happened was more than forty\n miles away. The War Department said the\n wrong was inflicted by insurgents, but the\n testimony showed that the cruelty was in-\n flicted by robbers, or common murderers and\n plunderers, and not by insurrectos. But no-\n body claims that the people in this town had\n the slightest connection with any of those\n things. Still the town was destroyed and\n tbeir leading men carted away and put into\n prison, where they are now languishing.\n</p>\n<p>\n More Than Burning.\n</p>\n<p>\n They did not stop with burning the barrios.\n On the same night they proceeded out to a lit-\n tle hamlet and wiped from the face of the\n earth the habitation of men, women and chil-\n dren. They went twelve miles away to an-\n other town of 12,000 and burned it to the\n ground, and not a vestige remained. They\n went elsewhere and continued this work of\n death and desolation in order to give those\n people a benign example of American admin-\n istration! Oh, that is not all. We have it\n now plainly upon the official records. This\n was in the Island of Panay, in the Province\n of Ilolio. It was made a howling wilderness\n and the people were tortured.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then they jumped over to Samar. We find\n in the official reports, and I have not time\n to read them, but I will verify every state-\n ment I make by the official record if any one\n desires me to do so, that General Smith took\n charge in Samar, under command of General\n</p>\n<p>\n Chaffee. We find General Chaffee declaring\n to him in substance, as shown by his report:\n \u201cWage this war vigilantly; yes, relentlessly;\n yes, wage it according to your own discre-\n tion; enjoin upon your subordinate command-\n ers to employ the utmost severity; proceed\n and use your own discretion. Theee are not\n civilized people.\u201d General Hughes said they\n are not. \u201cThis is no longer civilized war.\u201d\n The Articles of War, issued under the high\n authority of Mr. Lieber of the War Depart-\n ment, are cast to the winds, although they\n are sent to us by the War Department as a\n proof of the humane character of the war.\n It is no longer civilized war and he was com-\n manded to do those things.\n</p>\n<p>\n Among other subordinates was Lieutenant\n or Captain Waller, and after Waller had gone\n over the Island and dispensed death and deso-\n lation General Smith in an official order\n recommended his promotion. General Smith\n issues his commands in conformity with the\n command of General Chaffee. He immediate-\n ly issued an edict to the effect that all the\n people are presumed to be traitors and public\n enemies, and are to be dealt with as if in\n open arms unless they can conclusively show\n their loyalty; and there are three methods\n alone by which they can make that proof.\n Little children, women and men must con-\n clusively prove their loyalty.\n</p>\n<p>\n As to Chaffee.\n</p>\n<p>\n Oh, my God! that is the logic upon which\n Chaffee based the brutal orders and instruc-\n tions which he Issued to his subordinate\n commanders. Did Chaffee, alone, unaided, in\n coldness and in brutality and in savage and\n unrelenting disregard of every humane senti-\n ment or possibility of human suffering, con-\n ceive this iniquitous scheme? Whence, from\n what diabolical source was it derived? The\n American people ought to know. Is there\n any penalty beneath the sun adequate to be\n meted out to the merciless wretch who has\n thus brought such dishonor upon the Ameri-\n can name and the American people?\n</p>\n<p>\n The presumption is against every presi-\n dtnte and every cabeza by these station com-\n manders. They are all enemies and insur-\n gents and traitors to the United States.\n They must be given a drastic lesson. Why\n are the principal men of the town, the lead-\n ing officials, who have done no overt act, to\n be seized? Then vchat is to become of them?\n They are to be dragged out and put in front\n of the expeditious of the soldiers of the\n United States and they are to be marched\n on daily at the head of the columns or de-\n tachments until they have had a drastio\n lesson.\n</p>\n<p>\n The query arose in my mind, Why thus\n put these principal men of these barrios and\n towns out in front of the marching soldiers\n of the United States, on foot, to trudge along\n day after day \u2014 these starving people \u2014 to be\n marching every day until they had a drastic\n lesson or until they fell down and were re-\n lieved by death of the torture? This was\n not, perhaps, a vicarious punishment, for\n whenever an offense was committed any-\n where by any man who was so unfortunate\n as to have become a prisoner of the Amer-\n ican troops he was to be taken out and shot\n to death in Batangas; and now we find that\n people who had not offended, whose only\n offense at least was neutrality and inaction\n \u2014 that they did not go out to aid their com-\n patriots and people of their own race \u2014 were\n to be seized and placed at the head of the\n expedition of the soldiers of the United\n States, perhaps as a shield to receive the\n shot and fire of their compatriots, and thus\n screen the American soldiers from the perlA\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0030/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0030/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0030/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0030/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0030/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0030.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 822054}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"30\">\n<p>\n 28\n</p>\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n with which otherwise they might be con-\n fronted.\n</p>\n<p>\n My God, Senators, will any one rise and\n tell me when and where among the most\n barbaric peoples you ever read such an act\n of brutality as that?

They had\n nothing, in their possession with which\n longer to indulge in the luxury of protec-\n tion to their homes, their lives, and their\n fortunes.

It\n sets up a despotism. It provides for exploi-\n tations, for spoliations and plunder. It is\n to be the foundation of new insurrections,\n new deaths. It means, \" in all probability, if\n we are to follow it out in ajl its conse-\n quences, what is implied in the declaration\n of the former chairman of the Philippine\n Commission \u2014 the exinction cf that race of\n people.\n</p>\n<p>\n When you have followed to the end the\n road upon which you are now about to enter,\n after you have achieved the results which\n knowingly you thus set out to accomplish,\n what will they be? An extinct race, who\n will remain, like the Huron tribe of Indians,\n</p>\n<p>\n a3 a tradition of history; a race of people\n who have not wronged us; a race of people\n indigenous to the soil and the climate in\n which they live, a climate to which we can-\n not be inured, a land which cannot be made\n the home of our people. You want to ex-\n terminate those people \u2014 in order to supplant\n them? No; you never can supplant them.\n You never w ' ill go there for the sake of a\n home, for the sake of the establishment of a\n permanent abode. You annihilate those peo-\n ple for revenge, because you do not like\n them, because their color is different from\n yours, because they are an alien race, be-\n cause they have a different religion, because\n their habits and customs are not your habits\n and customs.\n</p>\n<p>\n You want to go there as if you were carry-\n ing out the edict of some inscrutable fate, to\n annihilate a race of men who never have in-\n jured us, while we have gone and ruthlessly\n assaulted them and their institutions. After\n you have annihilated them, after you have\n made Samar a howling wilderness, how many\n will still live in Batangas, one-third of whom\n had perished in December last? How many\n will remain in Tayabas or the rest of Luzon?\n God only knows. We have taken no census\n upon that subject, and It is not proposed to\n take any.\n</p>\n<p>\n A Munificent End.\n</p>\n<p>\n But all this is to secure some munificent\n end. This is in order to advance civiliz:-.-\n tion. This is In order to uplift races of\n mankind. This is a humane policy. Tills\n drastic policy, this severe and uncivilised\n war, is the most humane in the end. Aye, ire\n humanity consists in the extermination of a\n people, and when they are dead they cease\n suffering. But some of our people, I think,\n would follow them into the realms of perdi-\n tion and keep them there dancing forever-\n more upon the burning marl of hell. What\n vengeance do we want to wreak upon them?\n What benign end do we want to accomplish?\n Tell me, tell me, you upon the other side,\n you who say you will not speak on this sub-\n ject, say who struck you dumb? Why will\n you not utter a word in the face of this\n great, epoch in the history of our country?\n Why do you remain silent?\n</p>\n<p>\n I ask you to speak and tell me what use-\n ful and humane purpose you have in now\n embarking upon this policy.

SPOONER, OF WISCONSIN.\n</p>\n<p>\n Delivered in the United States Senate, Thursday, May 29 and Saturday, May 31, 1902.\n</p>\n<p>\n \\\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner said:\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President \u2014 I am very reluctant to ad-\n dress the Senate again upon the Philippine\n o.uestion, and I am keenly anxious to be\n through with what I have to say, peculiarly\n ao in view of the suggestion, which I resent,\n that I have sought time for speech with a\n view to precluding others from replying.\n</p>\n<p>\n If the people of the United States take\n much note of what occurs in this chamber\n they must have been strangely impressed by\n the proceedings here at this session in re-\n lation to the Philippines. We spent some\n v/eeks in debate in the early part of the ses-\n sion upon a Philippine bill; to speak more\n accurately, not upon a Philippine bill, but\n upon the general Philippine subject.\n</p>\n<p>\n That was a very simple bill. Mr. President.\n It was an emergency bill. It did not deal at\n oil with the policy of the United States as\n it is, or as Senators think it ought to be. It\n was a tariff bill intended to raise money for\n the support of the Philippine government,\n to administer the courts with their writ of\n habeas corpus, to furnish additional educa-\n tional facilities, and generally to carry ' out\n the policy thus far pursued of giving as rap-\n idly as possible the advantages of a better\n system of government to the people of the\n Philippine Archipelago.\n</p>\n<p>\n When we protested mildly that that was\n not the proper bill to be delayed indefinitely\n by general debate upon the Philippine policy,\n and that such debate would be more appro-\n priate to the discussion of the. Philippine\n government bill, we were told that that bill\n involved the whole subject, and that there\n would be little, if any, debate on the govern-\n ment bill, except that which pertained to its\n provisions.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have been disappointed in this re-\n spect, Mr. President. We have been spend-\n ing, weeks here in debate, not especially\n upon the government bill and its provisions,\n but. pending the consideration of the govern-\n ment bill, upon the general Philippine policy\n of the country.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is a little odd that this bill, intended to\n exalt civil government in those islands, to\n more efficiently and more quickly subordin-\n ate the military authority there, should be\n delayed almost indefinitely by speeches, the\n</p>\n<p>\n object of which has been to show that the\n military operations in the archipelago have\n been infamous in their torture, cruel beyond\n expression, and therefore a dishonor to the\n people of the United States, If that were\n true one would think Senators would have\n been anxious to facilitate the passage of\n this bill in order that that unhappy element\n might be speedily eliminated.\n</p>\n<p>\n It has been a strange debate, Mr. Presi-\n dent. I am forced to say that on both\n sides it has been a debate characterized\n by very much more than ordinary ability and\n eloquence. But when one looks through the\n speeches which have been made here by\n the minority (for it is well known that with\n proper amendments this bill will pass) one\n finds in them nothing but pessimism, noth-\n ing but the gospel of despair, nothing but\n suspicion and distrust and imputation of\n the motives and character of all who differ\n with them on this subject.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Senator from Tennessee (Mr. Car-\n mack) made a speech which rhetorically and\n oratorically was a credit to him. He said\n many bitter things in that speech. Some of\n them in a manly way he withdrew, and as to\n them there is nothing more to be said.\n</p>\n<p>\n But, Mr. President, I think he loft obser-\n vations in that speech which, in the days to\n come, he will regret. I will not think lie\n meant deliberately to tell the Philippine\n people that we are there to enslave them.\n I will not think he intended to impute to\n President McKinley, a fragment and bleated,\n memory forever in this land and in (he\n world, a commercial dollar motive in the\n negotiation of the Paris treaty aud its trans-\n mission to the Senate. I will not think he\n intended to grossly misconstrue the cable-\n gram which was sent by direction of the\n President to Admiral Dewey at Manila to\n examine and report upon the islands at. to\n naval and commercial advantages, including\n coal. I know he did not mean to say that\n the President had in mind individual or\n syndicate \u201cexploitation.\u201d 1 know he did r.ot\n mean to impute any purpose other than one\n in the general public interest to find that\n island, if we were to take but one and if\n we took any, which would afiord adequate\n</p>\n<p>\n harbor and coal for our war ships and a\n resting place for our merchant ships.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Senator indulged in some observations\n in relation to the President of the United\n States. I think some day he will regret\n that he did so, because, Mr. President, it is\n a tradition of both parties which should al-\n ways be observed, and it is in the public\n interest, too, that each co-ordinate branch of\n the government shall treat with respect the\n other. The Senator likened the President\n in his characteristics to a horse whose nat-\n ural gait is \" running away,\u201d intending to\n give the impression that he regarded him as\n a man of impulse, who speaks and acts with-\n out duo thought and deliberation. If the\n President of the United States should public-\n ly make an observation of that kind about a\n Senator he would not be forgiven. The Pres-\n ident of the United States is a man who does\n not run away from any duty or from any\n danger.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the time came, Mr. President, to\n send the American flag, not to stay, but to\n come down when its mission had been ac-\n complished\u2014 carried by our soldiers to Cuba,\n Theodore Roosevelt did not \u201crun away.\u201d\n Ho left his place at the capital here and went\n there as a soldier and fought there as a\n soldier, with the bullets of the enemy \u201cweav-\n ing linos of death and danger around him\n \u2022and above him,\u201d offering his life \u2014 and who\n could offer more \u2014 for what? For the liberty\n of a people; for the independence of Cuba.\n Ho lies v.on the right to be regarded, if\n *ny man has, as the daring, steadfast, stren-\n uous friend of liberty everywhere. He is not\n alow to perceive bis duty, nor is he slow to\n do Ills duty.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Senator also referred, and I thought\n it was not fair, to a statement in the news-\n papers of a supposed \u201cconference,\u201d and as-\n sumed that \u201cinstructions\u201d had been given\n by the President, to introduce in this debate,\n in order to hide the atrocities of the Army\n in tho Philippines from the public gaze, a\n discussion of what is called sectionalism. I\n think the Senator really will not believe that.\n The President is one of the lost nice to do\n anything or advise anything ' o mar the\n harmony n Inch exists and ought to exist be-\n tween the 6 \" cUons.

The associations of his\n life are the other way. I could not but\n think, as the Senator spoke, of what occurred\n a little time ago when the brilliant and elo-\n quent Senator from Missouri (Mr. Vest), in\n speaking tender words of eulogy over our\n late colleague here. General Wade Hampton,\n took occasion to pay tribute to President\n Roosevelt for the generous manner in which\n he had commented upon the career of Gen-\n eral Lee.\n</p>\n<p>\n Few have escaped in this debate conducted\n by the other side who have had in any way\n to do with the Philippines. Governor Taft\n had cast upon him not only by suggestion,\n but by argument, the imputation that he had\n wilfully suppressed before the committee two\n reports. There w r as but one answer that\n neded to be made to that, and that is that\n Governor Taft is and always has been a\n gentleman.\n</p>\n<p>\n Really, this debate has been so full of\n generalities of a malignant Sort as to affect\n my kindly friend from Mississippi (Mr. Mc-\n Laurin), who read from a book here one day\n to establish the proposition that old General\n Gomez is a brute and tried to slaughter a\n little boy with his sword, and then that\n Gomez and his staff were \u201cafraid of the\n cars.\u2019\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n He was led to do that by the mistaken im-\n pression that Funston, then unknown to\n fame, at the time was a member of Gomez\u2019s\n staff. Poor General Funston has occupied\n a large space in the debate upon this very\n grave and important bill. I have nothing to\n say about him \u2014 he has been ably defended \u2014\n except this: I cannot account for this bitter-\n ness toward him unless it grows out of a\n consciousness that his criticism and feeling\n were somewhat justified. It is the same that\n Lawton had and that others have had. Law-\n ton is dead and cannot speak and will not\n be traduced. It has not injured Funston.\n</p>\n<p>\n The general attitude of Senators who have\n spoken on the other side is this: \u201cWe w r ho\n voted against the treaty at least are men\n who observed the obligations of the Consti-\n tution. You who voted for it violated it.\n We who are opposed to you stand by the\n Declaration of Independence. You disregard\n It. We are the friends of the Army. You are\n Its assailants. We love the flag and you \u2018vul-\n garize\u2019 it. We hate atrocity and you defend\n it. We wish to give liberty to the Filipinos\n and you are giving them bondage \u2014 are try-\n ing to enslave them.\u201d It is a modest atti-\n tude, of course, but not altogether persua-\n sive.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, some extracts have been\n read here from a speech of mine on the\n treaty, of course intended to show that I am\n inconsistent. It is a matter of no conse-\n quence whether I an) or am not inconsistent.\n I have never cared overmuch for consistency.\n I have always reserved to myself the right\n to change my mind if, on further reflection,\n I thought I should do so. But I have not\n changed my attitude.\n</p>\n<p>\n I declared myself opposed to permanent do-\n minion in the Philippines. I speak for my-\n self when I say that that is still my feel-\n ing. I said I would not take islands or peo-\n ple for trade. That is still my feeling. I\n would not buy trade with the blood of my\n own people or any other, nor at the cost of\n any man\u2019s liberty.\n</p>\n<p>\n I ridiculed the notion that the flag once\n put up never shall come down. I said it was\n put up in Cuba, and when another repre-\n senting and standing for a new born re-\n public there should go into the air, our flag\n would come down \u2014 come down in honor as\n It went up in the interest of liberty. And\n</p>\n<p>\n so it has. But that has nothing to do with\n this bill or with the general Philippine sub-\n ject. Only I have net changed my view.\n</p>\n<p>\n I voted against Hawaii. I did not want\n to take that first long step out into the\n Pacific. I did not look upon it\u2014 I differed\n with my party upon that question \u2014 as for\n the interest of the United States or the in-\n terest of the people of Hawaii that those\n islands should be annexed. It was done,\n and I quit. I have never criticised the men\n who differed with me. On the other hand,\n Mr. President, I think I may justly say that\n industriously and to the best of my ability\n I have co-operatcd with my colleagues here\n in an endeavor to give to Hawaii the wisest,\n best and most liberal government which\n could be devised.\n</p>\n<p>\n I found no fault w ' ith those who voted\n against the ratification of the treaty, Mr.\n President. It was not only the right, but\n the duty, of every Senator, to vote as his\n conscience and judgment led him to con-\n clude.\n</p>\n<p>\n But I have been surprised at the course\n pursued by some who voted for it and some\n who voted against it- I have been surprised\n by the statement, so often reiterated here,\n that if we had adopted the Vest amendment,\n assuming as to the Philippines the same\n relation we assumed by the 1 treaty as to\n Cuba, or that if after we had ratified the\n treaty without the Vest amendment we had\n passed the Bacon resolution, there would\n have been no trouble in the Philippines;\n that they were all our friends then, includ-\n ing Aguinaldo, and would have been our\n friends, our devoted friends, now and for-\n ever after.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, it seems to be forgotten\n that before the treaty was ratified and be-\n fore the Senate could vote upon the Vest\n amendment or on the Bacon resolution our\n troops in Manila had been attacked and hos-\n tilities had broken out. Aguinaldo and his\n associates, having an agent in tt is city,\n knowing that the amendment and the Bacon\n resolution \u2014 for they were public \u2014 were pend-\n ing, could not and would not wait to ascer-\n tain in peace what the action of the Senate\n would be upon them. But there was an at-\n tack and there was war.\n</p>\n<p>\n He had long intended to attack us. He\n was so \" friendly.\u201d Here is the translation\n of a captured cablegram or letter sent on the\n 3d of February, 1899, the day before the at-\n tack, by the agent of the \u201cFilipine republic\u201d\n in London.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Allison \u2014 A friendly republic?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Yes; a \u201cfriendly republic\u201d;\n just as friendly as it was a republic; perhaps\n more friendly than it was a republic.\n</p>\n<p>\n London, February 3, 1899.\n Senor Regidor to Kant:\n</p>\n<p>\n My Dear Friend and Fellow Countryman \u2014\n Thanks for your Christmas card; I return my\n best wishes. In the last two mails I sent\n first a letter to the general and then one to\n Senor Mabini. I hope that you read them.\n Next Monday we shall know what to expect\n on the question of the treaty.\n</p>\n<p>\n They knew what was going on. It was on\n Monday we were to vote. It was the day\n fixed for a vote.\n</p>\n<p>\n According to two telegrams which I have\n seen to-day its passage is not certain. Still\n I believe without any doubt that it will pass,\n because otherwise it would be a crushing\n blow to McKinley, and be will wish to avoid\n exposing himself to it. Whether it passes or\n not, you must prepare yourself for a further\n increase in the American forces in the Phil-\n ippines. Some are going by way of the Pa-\n cific and others by the Suez Canal. If the\n treaty is approved, these forces will serve to\n immediately attack the Filipino troops. Do\n you not think it would be well for them to\n</p>\n<p>\n be attacked the moment the treaty is ap-\n proved here?\n</p>\n<p>\n And then follows more, but I will not read\n it all:\n</p>\n<p>\n One of our friends unquestionably devoted\n to our cause proposes a plan to me which\n seems certain to me to bring us some thou-\n sands of dollars which could be applied to\n the purchase of arms and munitions and es-\n pecially some effective torpedoes, which\n would serve to repeat in the bay of Manila\n the scene in that of Habana, which would\n serve to give a fortunate termination to our\n struggle.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar\u2014 Did the Senator say that was a\n cablegram?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I say it is a copy.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Of a telegram?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Of a letter.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 The Senator said, as I under-\n stand, a telegram. I thought it was the fun-\n niest telegram I ever heard.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 A letter. There are a good\n many funny telegrams in this business.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 That seems to be one of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Mr. President, I have here a\n record of the vote upon the treaty. We\n who voted for the treaty are all said to have\n been pretty bad men, so far as judgment is\n concerned. I take the liberty of reading\n the names of the Senators who voted for\n the treaty: Aldrich, Allen, Allison, Baker,\n Burrows, Butler, Carter, Chandler, Clark,\n Clay, Cullom, Davis\u2014 one of the most\n brilliant men w f e ever had here, now dead\n and gone \u2014 Deboe, Elkins, Fairbanks, Faulk-\n ner, Foraker, Frye, Gallinger, Gear, Gray,\n Hanna, Hansbrough, Harris, Hawley, Jones\n of Nevada, Kenney, Kyle, Lindsay, Lodge,\n McBride, McBnery, McLaurin, McMillan,\n Mantle, Mason, Morgan, Nelson, Penrose,\n Perkins, \u2018Pettus, Piatt of Connecticut, Platt\n of New York, Pritchard, Quay, Ross, Sewell,\n Shoup, Simon, Spooner, Stewart, Sullivan,\n Teller, Thurston, Warren, Wellington and\n Wolcott. Barring myself, that iB a very re-\n spectable group of Senators. Those who\n voted in the negative are Messrs. Bacon,\n Bate, Berry, Caffery, Chilton, Cockrell,\n Daniel, Gorman, Hale, Heitfeld, Hoar, Jones\n of Arkansas, Mallory, Martin, Mills,\n Mitchell, Money, Murphy, Pasco, Pettigrew,\n Rawlins, Roach, Smith, Tillman, Turley,\n Turner and Vest. The pairs were as fol-\n lows: Mr. Canncn and Mr. Proctor with Mr.\n White. Mr. Wetmore and Mr. Wilson with\n Mr. Turpie.\n</p>\n<p>\n A very respectable group of men. I would\n not impugn the motive of any one Of them.\n Every man who voted for that treaty \u2014 some\n of them voted for it reluctantly after grave\n consideration, and I was one of them \u2014 voted\n conscientiously and in the belief that Presi-\n dent McKinley had been right in negotiating\n it, and that the Senate was right in ratifying\n it. This was not a party vote, and when\n Senators on the other side, with vitupera-\n tive words inveigh against the ratification\n of that treaty and denounce it as mistaken\n \" Republican\u201d policy they are inveighing\n against some of their best associates, some\n of the oldest and truest Democrats and\n some of the ablest, most conservative and\n liberty-loving men their party has ever\n known.\n</p>\n<p>\n The President negotiated the treaty and\n sent it to us. We were independent of\n him in the action which we took upon it. He\n had done his part. It was for us to do ours,\n and we did. For one, I never have seen the\n hour, Mr. President, when I regretted the\n vote I cast for the treaty.\n</p>\n<p>\n Is that what led to war? Is that the\n origin of all these \u201catrocities,\u201d of all this\n waste of treasure? Is that what broke\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0033/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0033/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0033/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0033/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0033/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0033.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 860262}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"33\">\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 31\n</p>\n<p>\n down a \u201cPhilippine republic?\u201d Is that\n what violated the Constitution of the United\n States?

I have never had, nor have I\n now, any apology to make for that utterance.\n The Senator said\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Mr. President \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n The presiding officer (Mr. Platt of Connect\n icut) \u2014 Does the Senator from Wisconsin yield\n to the Senator from Massachusetts?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Certainly.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 May I ask the Senator from Wis-\n consin if he likens the case of an affray\n breaking out between two armies stationed\n near together and the general of one of them\n drawing hie troops back and sending word to\n us that he was sorry it had happened and did\n not expect to have it break out \u2014 on one side\n the Filipino people and on the other this great\n Republic\u2014 to the case of a man holding a re-\n volver to his breast? Does he think that is a\n fair illustration?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Oh, Mr. President, I did not\n limit my remarks to that illustration; the\n man with a revolver at my breast; and more-\n over the Filipino troops were not drawn\n back. They were driven back. (Manifestations\n of applause in the gallerie6.)\n</p>\n<p>\n The presiding officer rapped with his gavel.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 I do not think, if the Senator\n will pardon me, that he quite states the his-\n toric fact on that occasion. I understand\n that Aguinaldo instantly expressed his regret\n for the occurrence and a desire to maintain\n peace. Whether he drew back his troops\n or whether they were driven back, he offered\n to draw them back and remove the soldiers\n to a place where it would not occur again. I\n think, however, I should apologize to the\n Senator. I do not think it is fair to interrupt\n him.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I have no objection.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 If the Senator will permit me \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Certainly.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 I wish to say that I believe it\n is the desire of the entire Senate that the\n very able and interesting speech of the\n Senator from Wisconsin should be conclud-\n ed without interruption or an attempt to\n challenge anything he says, and I regret that\n I rose for the purpose, contrary to my in-\n tention. I shall not do it again.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 The Senator owes me no\n apology at all.\n</p>\n<p>\n The ratification of the treaty did not pro-\n voke the attack. Aguinaldo on the 9th day\n of January had issued an elaborate order\n for an attack by his troops on our troops.\n Not only that, but he had written to Benito\n Legardo on the 7th day of January: \u201cMy\n dear Don Benito; I beg you to leave Manila\n and come here with your family\u2014 not be-\n cause I wish to frighten you\u2014 I merely wish\n</p>\n<p>\n to warn you for your satisfaction, although\n it is not yet the day or the week.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The suggestion, Mr. President \u2014 and I am\n involved in this branch of the subject at an\n earlier time than I intended to be \u2014 that\n Aguinaldo did not desire the outbreak at\n precisely that time may be true. The cable-\n gram advised that it be done immediately\n after the ratification of the treaty. But for\n days before it was done citizens of Manila,\n to the extent of 40,000 nearly, had been tak-\n ing their valuables out of the City in antici-\n pation of a fight. Aguinaldo, January 13\u2014\n .after this order of January 9, with over 2,000\n words in it, for an attack on our troops at\n Manila and an uprising in the city \u2014 the same\n day that he appointed peace commissioners\n to meet those appointed by General Otis\n to see if terms might not be arranged and\n a conflict avoided \u2014 received this telegram,\n and here (exhibiting) is a photograph of his\n autographic reply:\n</p>\n<p>\n To the president of the republican govern-\n ment, Malolos:\n</p>\n<p>\n We desire to know the result of ultima-\n tum which you mentioned in your telegram,\n and we also desire to know what reward\n our government is preparing for the forces\n who will first be able to enter Manila.\n</p>\n<p>\n This was on the 13th day of January, 1899,\n to which Aguinaldo replied in his own hand-\n writing, as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n As to the contents of your telegram, those\n who prove themselves heroes will have as\n rewards large sums of money, lands, extraor-\n dinary promotions, crosses of Biacnabato,\n Marquis of Malate, Ermita and Count of\n Manila, etc., beside .the congratulations of\n our idolizing country on account of their\n patriotism, and more if they capture the\n regiments with their generals, and if pos-\n sible the Chief of them all who represents\n our future enemies in Manila, which (lot)\n falls to you, or, better said, to General\n Noriel and Colonel Cailles.\n</p>\n<p>\n The ultimatum has not yet been sent, but\n will be within a few days.\n</p>\n<p>\n He had the \u201cconstitution of a republic\u201d\n copied from that of Mexico, of Argentina and\n of the United States, and it prohibited abso-\n lutely the granting of patents of nobility. He\n had evidently learned early that great Amer-\n ican constitutional question \u2014 \" What is the\n constitution between friends?\u201d (Laughter.)\n Here we find him on the 14th day of January,\n 1899, promising to those who first should en-\n ter Manila \u2014 inspiring them to attack and\n urging them to the onset \u2014 patents of nobility,\n crosses of Biacnabato, and extraordinary\n grants of land and money, though he was a\n \" friend\u201d of ours of course and his \" repub-\n lic\u201d was, and if, after he had attacked us\n and been whipped and driven back \u2014 as I hope\n every band of soldiers who ever attack the\n Army of the United States, wherever it is\n sent, will be defeated \u2014 we had made a dec-\n laration like the Bacon amendment they\n would have been our \u201cfriends\u201d forever and\n forevermore!\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, it has been said here that\n Aguinaldo, after this attack on our troops\n at Manila, sent a flag of truce with a request\n for an armistice. I presume that is what the\n Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Hoar) re-\n ferred to a few moments ago. That has been\n absolutely denied by General Otis, not only\n officially, but in his testimony, as I under-\n stand it, before the committee on the Philip-\n pines. Am I wrong about that? N\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Allison \u2014 That is right.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 What he stated to be the\n fact was this: Judge Torres, who had been\n connected with that government, though th^n\n not a soldier, and, as I recollect, residing in\n Manila at the time, came to General Otis,\n asking if something could not be done to se-\n cure an armistice and the delineation of\n zones which each army might occupy, to the\n</p>\n<p>\n end that further trouble might be avoided,\n to which General Otis replied that as Agui-\n naldo had \u201ccommenced fighting he must apply\n for cessation\u201d; that he \u201chad nothing to re-\n quest from insurgent government.\u201d He\n passed Torres and his associates through the\n lines, and they went to Malolos. They came\n back, reporting what they had stated to Agui-\n naldo at Malolos, and that he had said \u2014 I\n do not remember the exact language \u2014 that if\n General Otis wanted an armistice he did not\n object; but he sent back a formal answer by\n this messenger, Judge Torres, to General\n Otis; and what was it? It was a declaration\n of war against the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, it was said by the Senator\n from Georgia (Mr. Bacon) that until the rati-\n fication of the treaty, as I understood him,\n without amendment putting the Philippines\n in the same relation to us as Cuba, or with-\n out the declaration of the Bacon resolution,\n they were perfectly friendly to us and never\n had thought of war with us. This surprises\n me, in view of the fact that it is in the\n Record, in a document signed by Aguinaldo\n and his associates of the Junta at Hongkong,\n before he went back to the Philippines at all,\n that it was decided as one reason why he\n should go against his will, that in that way\n be could obtain arms from the United States,\n and if dissatisfied later with the course of\n the United States toward the archipelago\n they could turn those arms against the United\n States. From the beginning they considered\n and arranged for the possibility of war with\n the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n It has been said here that they were only\n children and they ought to be treated like\n children. I notice one strange thing in all\n this transaction, when it comes to the Aguin-\n aldo side of this business, to what he wants\n and what his alleged \" republic\u201d wants and\n are entitled to have, it is said that they hhd\n colleges; they had universities; they had\n music and art; they had great international\n lawyers; they had doctors; they had all the\n signs of civilization; they produced constitu-\n tions which challenge the admiration of the\n world, and their discussions of international\n law were as fine as any that could be found.\n All this has been said to show that they\n were fit and civilized and proper representa-\n tives of a republic. And yet when we hold\n them to responsibility for outrage, to\n responsibility for violence, they are no\n longer statesmen, they are no longer\n educated, they are no longer re-\n sponsible\u2014 they are \u201cchildren!\u201d Well, chil-\n dren have to be spanked sometimes when\n they do not behave themselves. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n<p>\n It is said they had been struggling for in-\n dependence. There is nothing in the history\n of the Philippine Islands to warrant that\n statement \u2014 nothing that I have ever been able\n to find. They have had insurrections in those\n islands, but they have been sporadic. There\n has never been a general insurrection in the\n islands. There has been one in this island,\n that island, and the other against the Span-\n ish government. For w r hat? To secure re-\n forms and in protest against outrages and\n tyrannies, but never in all the history of\n those islands have I been able to learn that\n there has been an insurrection the object of\n which was independence.\n</p>\n<p>\n Why, Mr. President, the Senator from Ala-\n bama (Mr. Morgan) read this afternoon\u2014 and\n it is very interesting \u2014 from some of the cap-\n tured documents; and among them was found\n the preliminary treaty of Biacnabato. It was\n signed by Aguinaldo and was his proposition\n of terms for discontinuing the insurrection\n with Spain. He had led an insurrection \u2014\n this was in 1896; he had been whipped every-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0034/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0034/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0034/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0034/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0034/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0034.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 880472}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"34\">\n<p>\n 32\n</p>\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n where by the Spanish troops; he had been\n driven to the mountain fortress of Blacna-\n bato, where he \u201cproclaimed\u201d a republic \u2014 a\n republic of which he was the president, and\n he was also the republic; and when Paterno\n went there to propose some adjustment on\n behalf of the Spanish captain general,\n Aguinaldo consented and presented his\n terms. I only mention this, Mr. President,\n to show how much idea Aguinaldo had of a\n republic and of independence.\n</p>\n<p>\n You will remember that some time before\n the war broke out with Spain, or about the\n time, Agoncillo proposed an alliance between\n the Filipino republic and the Republic of the\n United States, when the Filipino republic\n was without an army, without a ship, with-\n out a local habitation\u2014 a junta in Hong-\n kong.

Application of true- justice In the Phil-\n ippines, equal for the Indian and the Span-\n iard. The same laws in Spain and the Phil-\n ippines.

Don Emilio Aguinaldo, in his quality as\n supreme leader of those in the island of\n Luzon now waging open hostilities against\n legitimate government, and Don Baldomero\n Aguinaldo and Don Mariano Llanera, who\n also exercise important commands in the\n forces mentioned, are to cease their hostile\n altitude, surrender their arms that they are\n using against their fatherland, and are to\n surrender to the legitimate authorities claim-\n ing their rights as Spanish Filipino citizens,\n which they desire to preserve.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was ultimately signed and executed with\n the reforms omitted, part of the money was\n paid, and they expatriated themselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Cullom \u2014 What was the money ior.sid-\n oration?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Eight hundred thousand dol-\n lars, and they left the country and carried\n</p>\n<p>\n the Philippine Republic with them. (Laugh-\n ter).\n</p>\n<p>\n Talk about the similarity between the situ-\n ation in Cuba and the situation in the Philip-\n pine Islands! Cuba had been struggling for\n independence, there had been a ten years\u2019\n war for Independence. We had for years\n heard tho two words \u2014 now, thank God and\n the American people, true \u2014 \u201cCuba Libre! '\n \u201cCuba Libre!\u201d They were not fighting for\n reforms.\n</p>\n<p>\n They had asked them, they had been prom-\n ised them; they had been cheated again\n and again, until the Cuban people resolved\n that nothing\u2014 and that was long ago\u2014 but in-\n dependence of Spain would content them; but\n there never has been, as I said before, and\n there -was not when Dewey entered Manila\n Bay, an insurrection or a struggle in the\n Philippine Archipelago for liberty or Inde-\n pendence from Spain. On the contrary, Ag-\n uinaldo proclaimed shortly after he reached\n Manila that he came there to prevent his\n associates, the former insurrectos, from join-\n ing the Spaniards in an attack upon tho\n Americans. Senators who seek to draw a\n parallel in the situation so far as a struggle\n for liberty was concerned\u2014 anc when I say\n \u201cliberty\u201d I mean independence \u2014 between the\n Cubans and the inhabitants of the Philippine\n Archipelago, speak without support in history.\n</p>\n<p>\n We ratified the treaty and we drove Aguin-\n aldo away from Manila. Does any Senator\n deny our right to be in Manila? The Span-\n iards had surrendered Manila to us. By the\n protocol -we had entered into a solemn com-\n pact with Spain to hold Manila, and we were\n with our troops in and around Manila, where\n we had as much right to be as we have to sit\n in this chamber under our flag. I say to-day\n again what I said a day or two after the\n treaty was ratified, that the attack made by\n Aguinaldo upon our Army was as w ' anton,\n deliberate, unrighteous, and unjustifiable an\n invasion of our rights as ever could have oc-\n curred in the world, and he knew it.\n</p>\n<p>\n It has been said that President McKinley\n declared war, usurping a function com-\n mitted to Congress by the Constitution, by\n sending the instructions to General Otis, of\n December 21, to extend our sovereignty over\n the archipelago. Who was that war declared\n against? What was that war declared\n against, if it were war? Of course the Pres-\n ident could not declare war. Only Congress\n can declare war. If it be true that there was\n a government there which had succeeded to\n the sovereignty and the property of Spain,\n then we would derive no title by the treaty,\n and the proclamation by the President di-\n recting our officers to extend American sov-\n ereignty over the archipelago would be, in\n effect, a declaration of war.\n</p>\n<p>\n But it is necessary, in order to sustain\n that proposition, to first establish another \u2014\n which has not been established and can\n never be established \u2014 that there was a gov-\n ernment there against which war could be\n declared.\n</p>\n<p>\n Aguinaldo did not treat that proclamation\n of General Otis as a declaration of war. That\n proclamation, or those instructions issued by\n the President, of course, antedated the rati-\n fication of the treaty. Technically that was\n an offense upon the part of the United States,\n or the President, at least, against Spain, for\n her sovereignty could only be devolved upon\n us by the ratification of the treaty and the\n exchange of ratifications.\n</p>\n<p>\n General Otis has testified before the com-\n mittee that General Miller was sent to\n Iloilo, I think without instructions from\n</p>\n<p>\n Washington, upon the prayer of the people\u2014\n the merchants, the foreigners and natives of\n Iloilo\u2014 that they needed his protection. When\n he sailed for Iloilo it was supposed by Gen-\n eral Otis and by General Miller that the\n Spaniards were still in possession. It would\n have been a matter entirely between Spain\n and the United States if in that situation we\n had taken possession of Iloilo. General Rios\n had notified General Otis that he needed\n troops, and had asked him to loan him \u2014 It\n was a strange request \u2014 2,000 of the Spanish\n prisoners, that he might the better hold\n Iloilo. The insurgents had attacked Iloilo\n and had been repulsed with a loss of 500 and\n a large number of wounded, and had with-\n drawn.\n</p>\n<p>\n Just before General Miller reached Iloilo\n General Rios withdrew from that city under\n instructions from the Spanish government\n and betook himself to another Spanish\n place. General Miller was not instructed to\n fight. On the contrary, he was instructed\n not to use force without further orders.\n General Miller, the Senator from Massachu-\n setts (Mr. Hoar) will now admit, was not\n anxious to fight.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 No.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Well, I saw put in the\n Record by the Senator from Massachusetts\n (Mr. Hoar), I think in this morning\u2019s Record,\n a letter from General Miller saying that he\n was not.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 No; I beg the Senator\u2019s pardon.\n I did not mean to interrupt the Senator.\n After reading General Miller\u2019s letter I dis-\n claimed any idea that he published that\n proclamation for the sake of bringing on a\n fight; but by the record, which I said I had\n not time to read, General Miller had re-\n peatedly urged General Otis that he might\n be permitted to attack at once, fearing that\n the enemy were constantly increasing their\n strength, and that it would be much easier\n to do it the sooner it was done. Undoubt-\n edly General Miller did not want the con-\n flict\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Well, General Miller \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Let me state what I said ex-\n actly, because it is important to myself that\n it should be stated correctly. I do not be-\n lieve that General Miller, especially after\n reading his letter \u2014 and no man can believe\n it \u2014 was in favor of this conflict or wanted\n to bring it on; but what he did want, if I\n correctly recollect his letter, which you will\n find in the old report, is that, if he had to\n make the attack, it should be made at once,\n instead of waiting until the enemy had\n strengthened.

He had told him that he was\n instructed to avoid by every possible means\n a conflict between his army and the army\n of Aguinaldo. And that is not all. Aguin-\n aldo had been otherwise informed. He had\n received a notice through the junta from\n here that the President had instructed Gen-\n eral Otis not to attack his troops.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thi3 is from Santos, Hongkong:\n</p>\n<p>\n Hongkong, January 26, 1899.\n Honorable President of the Filipino Repub-\n lic, General Don Emilio Aguinaldo:\n</p>\n<p>\n My Distinguished General and Dear Friend\n \u2014 After sealing my former letter of this morn-\n ing, Reuter\u2019s telegram arrived containing the\n good news that General Otis has been ordered\n not to attack the Filipinos. Our efforts here\n have not been in vain. They, together with\n your firm attitude, have forced the Yankees\n at least to reflect.\n</p>\n<p>\n I will not read the rest of it. So I say\n again it was a perfectly wanton attack upon\n our troops, who were rightfully in and\n around Manila.\n</p>\n<p>\n Senators talk about the President declaring\n war. Who sent the Army to Manila? First,\n the President, on the request of Admiral\n Dewey, in order that they might take pos-\n session of Manila and hold it, Congress being\n in session. There was a critical act, I think.\n If those troops had not been sent to Manila\n to take possession of that city the situation\n might have been a little different. No man\n in the United States, so far as I know but\n one, found any fault with the President for\n sending those troops to Manila. No man in\n the Senate, however he may upbraid us for\n what has followed, found any fault with the\n President for sending those troops to Manila,\n although one Senator found fault with him\n here for not sending them with sufficient\n promptitude. The one Senator who objected\n to it, or afterward stated here that he had\n objected to the President\u2019s action, is now '\n dead and gone, a Senator who had spent some\n time in the Philippines in his early years,\n and that was .General Sewell of New Jersey.\n</p>\n<p>\n The fighting went on there. We passed the\n army bill. What for? I ask this question\n because of the attitude of some Senators\n here to-day. We passed it February 27, 1899,\n after the ratification of the treaty, when we\n were at peace with Spain and all the world,\n with no war cloud upon our horizon except\n in the Philippines. The army bill was passed\n to furnish to the President troops with which\n to maintain the sovereignty of the United\n States in the Philippines. There was a halt-\n ing point. Who called a halt? I have here\n the vote upon it. I will name the Senators\n who .voted for it. The bill was a great mis-\n take in one respect. My friend from Iow r a\n (Mr. Allison) remembers how it was. The\n term of enlistment was limited to July 1,\n 1901. It expired absolutely on that day, and\n the necessity for raising new troops, hurry-\n ing them away, and withdrawing the others\n prolonged the insurrection in the islands.\n That was our mistake, not the President\u2019s.\n But we could do no better in the then situ-\n ation.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Allen voted for it; Mr. Allison, Mr.\n Bacon voted for it; Mr. Burrows, Mr. Carter,\n Mr. Chandler, Mr. Clark, Mr. Cockrell, Mr.\n Cullom, Mr. Deboe, Mr. Elkins, Mr. Fair-\n banks, Mr. Faulkner, Mr. Foraker, Mr. Frye,\n Mr. Gallinger, Mr. Gear, Mr. Gorman, Mr.\n Hanna, Mr. Hansbrough, Mr. Harris, Mr.\n Hawley, Mr. Heitfeld, Mr. Jones of Nevada,\n Mr. Lindsay, Mr. Lodge, Mr. McBride, Mr.\n McEnery, Mr. McLaurin, Mr. Mallory, Mr.\n Mantle, Mr. Mitchell, Mr. Money, Mr. Mor-\n gan, Mr. Murphy, Mr. Nelson, Mr. Pascoe,\n Mr. Perkins, Mr. Pettus, Mr. Platt of Con-\n necticut, Mr. Platt of New York, Mr. Pritch-\n ard, Mr. Proctor, Mr. Rawlins, Mr. Roach,\n Mr. Ross, Mr. Sewell, Mr. Shoup, Mr. Simon,\n Mr. Smith, Mr. Spooner, Mr. Stewart, Mr.\n Teller, Mr. Warren and Mr. Wellington.\n</p>\n<p>\n Who voted against it?\n</p>\n<p>\n Messrs. Bate, Berry, Butler, Caffery, Chil-\n ton, Clay, Daniel, Hoar, Martin, Pettigrew,\n Turley, Vest and White.\n</p>\n<p>\n What was that army raised for? What did\n</p>\n<p>\n Senators of the minority vote with us to\n raise it and send it to the Philippines for?\n And in the face of that record they tell us\n that we ought to have known that a war be-\n tween a civilized nation and an inferior peo-\n ple could not do otherwise than bring about\n cruelty and atrocity. Was there any politics\n in this? Are senators on the other side who\n voted to raise this army and send it to the\n Philippines in a position to turn on us with\n the vituperation and challenge which has\n characterized this debate? I do not know\n how my friend from Tennessee (Mr. Carmack)\n voted on this in the House.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 Mr. President \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 I did not mean to challenge\n the Senator, although I will gladly hear him.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 I was just going to say that\n I probably voted in accordance with the prin-\n ciple laid down by Abraham Lincoln in vot-\n ing for troops and supplies for the Mexican\n war, and that I would so vote again.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 That comes pretty near plead-\n ing the same act that is pleaded for the\n Filipinos when they do wrong things. We\n are not children. Every man who voted for\n that \u2014 and it was only a few days after the\n treaty was ratified \u2014 voted for it upon the\n basis that we had acquired title and sover-\n eignty from Spain and had paid for it, and\n that we were to enforce our sovereignty,\n and constitutionally and properly do it, in\n the Philippines, and that our sovereignty\n was being forcibly resisted by men who had\n no right to resist it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, Mr. President, what policy did Presi-\n dent McKinley have as to the Philippines\n after we had ratified the treaty and acquired\n the title and the sovereignty o\u00a3 Spain? The\n President\u2019s duty was to enforce the sover-\n eignty of the United States in those islands.\n He could not make disposition of the\n islands; he could make no promises to the\n inhabitants of the islands. He gave us this\n notice in his message:\n</p>\n<p>\n Until Congress shall have made known the\n formal expression of its will I shall use the\n authority vested in me* by the Constitution\n and the statutes to uphold the sovereignty\n of the United States in those distant islands\n as in all other places where our flag right-\n fully floats. I shall put at the disposal of\n the Army and Navy all the means which the\n liberality of Congress and the people have\n provided to cause this unprovoked and waste-\n ful insurrection to cease. If any orders of\n mine were required to insure the merciful\n conduct of military and naval operations,\n they would not be lacking \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n One would know that if he had not said\n it \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n but every step of the progress of our troops\n has been marked by a humanity which has\n surprised even the misguided insurgents.\n</p>\n<p>\n And there is overwhelming evidence that\n the President was not misinformed as to that\n fact.\n</p>\n<p>\n The truest kindness to them \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n This is what you find in General Order\n 100, approved by Abraham Lincoln. This is\n what you find in every enlightened work upon\n the subject. This is what General Bell\n thought; this is what General Chaffee\n thought; this is what General MacArthur\n thought, and it is the truth:\n</p>\n<p>\n The truest kindness to them will be a\n swift and effective defeat of their present\n leader. The hour of victory will be the hour\n of clemency and reconstruction.\n</p>\n<p>\n No effort will be spared to build up the\n waste places desolated by war and by long\n years *of misgovernment. We shall not wait\n for the end of strife to begin the beneficent\n work.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nor did we.

It has been referred to,\n but I have never heard any explanation of\n it. It is that Agoncillo and his secretary,\n who had been for weeks stopping at the Ar-\n lington in this city, representing the Phil-\n ippine republic (so called) at midnight on\n February 4, without notifying the hotel peo-\n ple, without paying their bills, secretly left\n for Canada. And when the next morning,\n on February 5, we learned for the first time\n of the outbreak in Manila, their attack upon\n our troops there, they were approaching the\n Canadian line.\n</p>\n<p>\n . They need not have run away. They knew\n the treaty was to be voted upon the next\n day. They knew the Vest amendment, put-\n ting them on the same basis w ith Cuba, was\n to be voted upon that day or the day after-\n ward. They knew that the Bacon resolution\n was pending.

General MacArthur, when his\n attention was called to it again, said he\n stood by his report, and that he had testified\n hastily and inadvertently that they began\n about 10:30. I recollect his testimony. Here\n is the argument of the Senator from Utah:\n</p>\n<p>\n There was the overwhelming political ne-\n cessity. There was the war that Congress\n did not declare. There was the war for\n which the American people are not respon-\n sible. There was the war begun not by any\n recognized authority emanating from the\n people of the United States. There was the\n war either begun by General Otis or begun\n by the President of the United States with-\n out the sanction of the sole repository of\n that power under the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p>\n I took occasion to look into that matter a\n little, because the imputation there is that\n there was a \u201cpolitical necessity\u201d for its in-\n fluence upon the vote on the treaty that news\n of the outbreak should get here at a certain\n time, and that in contemplation of the out-\n break, which we intended should occur, the\n message had been put upon the wire two\n hours or more before the outbreak did oc-\n cur. The fact is that the first official in-\n formation received in Washington about the\n outbreak was a cablegram from Admiral\n Dewey, received here February 5, 1899, at\n 8:05 A. M., as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n Manila, Received February 5, 1899, 8:05 A. M.\n Secretary of the Navy, Washington.\n</p>\n<p>\n Insurgents have inaugurated general en-\n gagement yesterday night which is continued\n to-day. The American Army and Navy is\n generally successful. Insurgents have been\n driven back and our line advanced. No\n casualties to Navy. In view of this and pos-\n sible future expenditure, request ammuni-\n tion requisition doubled. DEWEY.\n</p>\n<p>\n General Chaffee was asked to ascertain\n when that cablegram was filed in Manila for\n transmission, and replied as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n Manila.

Original messages sent London.\n Otis message dated February 5, filed 8:32\n morning, February 6. CHAFFEE.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus the fact is that this message of Ad-\n miral Dewey was filed for transmission at\n two minutes after 6 on the evening of the\n 5t.h of February, twenty-one hours after the\n outbreak had occurred, and refers to an out-\n break having occurred yesterday night. At\n the time\u2014 there being thirteen hours differ-\n ence between Manila and here \u2014 that tele-\n gram was filed for transmission \u2014 6:02 in the\n evening of February 5 \u2014 it was 5 o ' clock or\n thereabouts in the morning, February 5, here,\n and this message was received from Dewey\n at five minutes after 8, which gave it three\n hours and five minutes for transmission and\n delivery.\n</p>\n<p>\n I have here a letter from General Otis and\n a letter from Secretary Root upon the sub-\n ject, which I do not care to read, but ask\n leave to insert.\n</p>\n<p>\n Rochester, N. Y., May 18, 1902.\n Adjutant General, U. S. A., Washington:\n</p>\n<p>\n Sir \u2014 In answer to your communication of\n</p>\n<p>\n the 16th inst., I have the honor to report\n that I am quite certain of the correctness\n of my statement that the insurgents com-\n menced the attack on our outer lines around\n Manila about 8:45 P. M. on the evening of\n February 4, 1899; that the time was fixed\n by referring to my watch that evening and\n consulting with the officers of my staff the\n following day.\n</p>\n<p>\n No report or dispatch of any kind was\n sent from the Philippines to the United\n States announcing that fighting had begun\n or was in progress until after 4 o\u2019clock on\n the afternoon of February 5, to my knowl-\n edge. Certainly none was sent by me, nor by\n any officer of the Army. Some twenty hours\n after hostilities had commenced I cabled\n facts and results, and not until then. Shortly\n after I sent that cablegram I received a dis-\n patch from Washington, purporting to be\n signed by the Adjutant General of the Army,\n which read, according to my present recol-\n lection, as follows: \u201cThey say you are fight-\n ing. Why do not you report?\u201d Evidently\n Washington obtained information from some\n source; where, I do not know. It might be\n well to ascertain what inspired the Adjutant\n General\u2019s dispatch.\n</p>\n<p>\n Very respectfully, your obedient servant,\n</p>\n<p>\n E. S. OTIS, Major General, retired.\n</p>\n<p>\n War Department,\n Washington, May 20, 1902.\n</p>\n<p>\n My dear Senator\u2014 I find that the first in-\n formation of the beginning of hostilities be-\n tween the insurgents and the American troops\n at Manila on the 4th of February, 1899, re-\n ceived by the government at Washington\n was contained in a dispatch from Admiral\n Dewey to the Secretary of the Navy, re-\n ceived at the Navy Department February 5,\n 1899, at five minutes after 8 o\u2019clock in the\n morning, Washington time. It was in cipher\n and you already have the translation. It\n w ' as filed for transmission at the office of\n the cable company in Manila two minutes\n after 6 o\u2019clock on the evening of February\n 5, Manila time, twenty-one hours after the\n hostilities began, as appears from a dis-\n patch received from General Chaffee to-day,\n a copy of which I inclose. The first infor-\n mation received from General Otis, who\n commanded the American Army at that\n time, was contained in a dispatch (a copy\n of which you have) received at the War De-\n partment February 5, at 10:52 P. M., Wash-\n ington time, and this appears, by General\n Chaffee\u2019s message, to have been filed for\n transmission at the cable office in Manila\n at 8:32 in the morning of February 6, Manila\n time, nearly thirty-six hours after the\n fighting began.\n</p>\n<p>\n I wish to make two observations regarding\n Senator Rawlins ' s charge in his speech of\n April 23:\n</p>\n<p>\n (1) Admiral Dewey\u2019s dispatch said: \" Insur-\n gents have inaugurated general engagement\n yesterday night, which is continued to-day.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n General Otis ' s dispatch said: \u201cInsurgents\n in large force opened attack on our outer\n lines at 8:45 last evening. Renewed attack\n several times during night. At 4 o\u2019clock this\n morning entire line engaged.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n If Senator Rawlins\u2019s charge were true, then\n Admiral Dewey and General Otis, or at all\n events the former, would be guilty of a gross\n fraud and falsehood in stating that an event\n occurred the day before, when in fact it had\n not yet occurred.\n</p>\n<p>\n (2) Senator Rawlins evidently figured the\n difference in time between Manila and Wash-\n ington the wrong way, or more probably ac-\n cepted the statements of some one else who\n had figured it the wrong w ' ay. The sun rises\n in Manila thirteen hours earlier than it does\n in Washington, and Manila time is therefore\n thirteen hours later than Washington time,\n so that at five minutes after 8 in the morn-\n ing of February 5 in Washington, when Ad-\n miral Dewey\u2019s dispatch was received, it was\n five minutes after 9 in the evening of Febru-\n ary 5 at Manila.\n</p>\n<p>\n I send you also a copy of a leter from\n General Otis, which states his knowledge of\n the facts. General MacArthur\u2019s testimony\n fixing the beginning of the fighting at half\n past 10 on the night of the 4th of February,\n whereas Otis\u2019s dispatch fixes it at 8:45. is\n of course immaterial in view of the long\n time which elapsed before the dispatches re-\n porting the engagement were sent. The dif-\n</p>\n<p>\n ference is probably due to the fact that Mac-\n Arthur had in mind the time when he got\n into the fight with the troops under his com-\n mand, while Otis was reporting the first\n fighting done by any troops.\n</p>\n<p>\n Faithfully yours,\n</p>\n<p>\n ELIHU ROOT.\n</p>\n<p>\n Hon. John C. Spooner,\n</p>\n<p>\n United States Senate.\n</p>\n<p>\n Inclosures.\n</p>\n<p>\n I could not allow this matter to pass with-\n out some notice. It is only due to the Sen-\n ator from Utah (Mr. Rawlins) that I should\n say he did not assert it. He said \u201cit is\n said,\u201d and I took the trouble to ascertain the\n facts, not having any doubt whatever about\n it, but in order that they might be put off\n record, once for all.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Mr. President, I acknowl-\n edge with grateful sensibility the courtesy\n of my colleagues on both sides of the cham-\n ber in permitting me on Friday to suspend.\n I was not able to proceed, and this morning,\n if I were not in the middle of a speech, I\n would not ask the attention of the Senate.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Senator from Massachusetts (Mr.\n Hoar) a moment ago seemed to be surprised\n that there were \" sides\u201d in this committee\n investigation. I agree with him. There\n ought not to be sides in it. After the rati-\n fication of the treaty, and with an army\n in the field, there ought not to have been\n \u201csides\u201d here at home. One of the troubles,\n Mr. President \u2014 one of the wicked elements\n in it all to me\u2014 is that, without necessity,\n there have been from the beginning and are\n now \u201csides\u201d in this matter.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is a problem of great delicacy, novelty\n and not a little danger. It is the problem of\n no man and no party, and the interest of\n the country demands now. as it has hitherto\n demanded, in my judgment, that men in pub-\n lic life and private life should bring to the\n solution of it a sole desire to get at the\n right without prid e of opinion or spirit of\n advocacy or party interest.\n</p>\n<p>\n Recurring for a moment to a remark which\n I made on Thursday, that I have not been\n in favor of permanent dominion in the Phil-\n ippine Islands, in order to make it complete\n I wish to add a word. I did not mean by\n that that I have ever been in favor of\n running like a coward from responsibilities\n which this government had assumed. I did\n not mean by that that I had been in favor\n of abandoning a people who have come under\n our protection and government to tyranny,\n to anarchy, to chaos, or to seizure by those\n who would treat them harshly. I have never\n bean able for one moment to contemplate\n with equanimity the proposition that the\n Philippines should ever be admitted into\n this Union as a state or states. I have\n never been willing to contemplate the ad-\n mission of Hawaii into the Union as a state.\n</p>\n<p>\n Speaking only for myself \u2014 and I have no\n right to speak for others nor for my party \u2014\n I have never contemplated with equanimity\n the notion that Porto Rico should be ad-\n mitted into the Union as a state. Nothing\n has been dearer to my heart, nor can be,\n outside of the ties that bind me to my own\n home, than that this great political entity,\n the government of the United States, con-\n stituted of states, shall be confined to this\n continent.\n</p>\n<p>\n I have expected that we would proceed\n to discharge as speedily as might be, with\n as lofty a purpose as the human mind is ca-\n pable of conceiving, our duty in the Philip-\n pines, to bring peace to that people, to teach\n them the principles of good government, the\n difference between liberty and license, that\n independence, Mr. President, may be nothing\n but tyranny as under many governments it\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0038/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0038/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0038/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0038/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0038/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0038.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 994482}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"38\">\n<p>\n 88\n</p>\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n has been nothing but tyranny; that that in-\n dependent government which is to be de-\n sired is a government made by a people un-\n derstanding the rights and duties of liberty,\n tutored in the ways of government, and made\n and perpetuated by their consent.

When that time comes the people\n may be trusted to settle it righteously.\n</p>\n<p>\n There has not been in the history of this\n country, so far as I know, an instance be-\n fore where some of our people in high places\n have sought so incessantly, and I think so\n unfairly, to put the nation in the wrong, and\n to stain the honor of the government, re-\n solving every doubt against the officers of\n the government and in favor of the loose,\n disjointed statements of men who have been\n In arms against us.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was stated here the other day and re-\n peated (that song has been sung from the\n beginning) that, we were at fault in the Phil-\n ippines anterior to the outbreak of hostili-\n ties because the patrol which attempted to\n force our lines was challenged but twice.\n There is no rule of the Army that requires\n a challenge three times; there is none which\n requires a challenge twice; there is none\n under certain circumstances which requires\n a challenge once. General MacArthur testi-\n fied before the committee that, if a sentry\n has reason to think that those moving against\n him place him in menace, he has not only\n a rlgljt, but it is his duty to fire. That is\n to give warning to those for whom he stands\n guard; that is to protect the safety of an\n army, Mr. President; and no one knows any\n better \u2014 although in some respects there has\n been an attempt to criticise him here\u2014 what\n the laws of war are than does General Ar-\n thur MacArthur, nor is there a braver sol-\n dier, a kindlier man, or a more chivalrous\n gentleman under this flag of ours than Gen-\n eral Arthur MacArthur.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Senator from Utah (Mr. Rawlins) said\n that when our sentry called \u201cHalt!\u201d \u201cprob-\n ably\u201d the Filipino patrol did not understand\n the language. I had occasion once before to\n say that there never was a band of soldiers\n in the world approaching the lines of an-\n other who were called to halt by one with\n arms in his hands who did not understand\n what it meant. But General MacArthur has\n testified before this committee that the word\n \u201chalt\u201d in Spanish is \u201chalto,\u201d having the same\n sound as in our language, and there is evi-\n dence that that word was repeated \u2014 the word\n \u201chalto\u201d \u2014 in Spanish .among the patrol the\n moment the sentry had said \u201cHalt,\u201d show-\n ing that it was understood, and yet for the\n purpose of putting us in the wrong by sug-\n gestion that unnecessarily, perhaps with mal-\n lcq, a shot was fired in order to bring on\n the attack or for its effect upon the treaty\n</p>\n<p>\n then pending in the Senate, a breach of the\n peace \u2014 all this is ignored.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, we have had again and again\n here in this debate the old talk that Aguin-\n aldo was our ally; that the Filipino people\n were our allies. This notion that Aguinaldo\n with, say 30,000 men gathered around him,\n intending in a way to co-operate with us,\n represented the Filipino tribes of 10,000,000\n and put them in the attitude of an ally, to\n whom for that we were under national obli-\n gations, is a fever dream. Aguinaldo \u2014 call\n him an ally if you please, though he could\n not be \u2014 co-operated with us; but if he had\n been an ally, as he was a mere auxiliary,\n he could have waited, and he would\n have had from the people of the United\n States the treatment and recognition which\n he and his forces deserved. But the idea\n from the standpoint of to-day that our people\n are to be told all the time that we have\n repudiated an honorable obligation to a peo-\n ple who helped us is to me in the highest\n degree an absurdity.\n</p>\n<p>\n When Aguinaldo, Mr. President, with de-\n liberation in ihe execution of a plan long\n made in every detail, advised both from\n abroad and at home, attacked our Army in\n Manila, where it had a right to be, he ab-\n solved the American people from any obliga-\n tion personally to consider him for what he\n had, for his own purposes, as he afterward\n said, done in front of Mani la. I pass that.\n I hope never to have occasion again to speak\n upon this general subject in the Senate.\n Should I, however, do so, I shall not again\n refer to the oft repeated historical details to\n which I have alluded on Thursday and to-\n day, because the character of the debate has\n seemed to render it necessary.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, it has been repeated with\n some bitterness in this debate that by the\n ratification of the treaty we bought mere\n sovereignty over people, and that under our\n Constitution we could not do this thing. This\n contention came early into the Philippine\n discussion. I thought once there might be\n something in it. It was admitted when first\n made, as I remember, that we could acquire\n territory, even if it were inhabited, but that\n where there was no territory, nothing but a\n few public buildings, docks, etc., an attempt\n to acquire involved the purchase of mere\n sovereignty.\n</p>\n<p>\n I dwell only for a moment upon this phase\n of the discussion. I am not able to say that\n we could not acquire mere sovereignty. I\n cannot say that we have not the power to\n do it. I can conceive of circumstances under\n which the safety of the government would\n require that we should do it, and I do not\n think the government would hesitate in such\n a case to do it. But we know now what we\n did not definitely know when this proposi-\n tion was first broached, that of the 72,000,000\n acres of land in the Philippines, 67,000,000\n acres were public lands, the title to which\n passed from Spain to us by the treaty. If\n the acquisition of 67,000,000 out of 72,000,000\n acres of land is not the acquisition of terri-\n tory it would be difficult to imagine what\n would constitute an acquisition of territory.\n</p>\n<p>\n I have discussed this matter before and I\n will never admit that the government of the\n United States may not lawfully as indemnity\n at the end of a war successful upon its part,\n take a cession of inhabited territory without\n consulting and obtaining the consent of its\n inhabitants. I deny that any such limitation\n upon the power of nations has ever been rec-\n ognized in international law or by any gov-\n</p>\n<p>\n ernment in the world, including our own. I\n do not see that the Declaration of Independ-\n ence has any relation to it. Its framers\n said ;\n</p>\n<p>\n That these United Colonies are and of right\n ought to be free and independent states. *\n * * and that, as free and independent\n states, they have full power to levy war,\n ccnclude peace, contract alliances, establish\n commerce, and to do all other acts and\n things which independent states may of\n right do.\n</p>\n<p>\n We lost no power by the adoption of the\n Constitution, which created a Union and the\n federal government. That Constitution gives\n us the power to make treaties, to make war,\n and to make peace; and again I repudiate as\n dangerous to the Republic any attempt to\n emasculate the powers of this government\n under the Constitution and to leave it\n weaker in this particular than any other in-\n dependent nation in the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n We may take cession of inhabited territory\n as indemnity at the termination of war for\n selfish or for unselfish purposes. The motive\n has nothing to do with the power. We may\n take it solely with reference to our own in-\n terests. We may take it for the purpose of\n completely separating inhabitants from a ty-\n rannical power. We may take it for the\n purpose of giving them what otherwise they\n could not attain\u2014 good government and civil\n liberty. And certainly the power to take\n inhabited territory involves the power to\n govern the inhabitants. The idea that we\n can take a cession of an inhabited territory,\n but cannot govern it without consulting the\n people; that those who inhabit it have the\n right to govern it, independent of us, is a\n proposition that refutes itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have acquired much territory, some-\n times by treaty of purchase, sometimes as\n indemnity at the end of a war. I hope we\n will never have occasion to acquire any\n again in the latter way; but if occasion shall\n arise, Mr. President, I doubt not we shall do\n it, as we acquired the Philippines, not for\n the purposes of tyranny, not to enable us to\n exercise mere sovereignty and power, but\n for a purpose as lofty as that which inspired\n the men who drafted and adopted the Decla-\n ration of Independence.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr President, I do not think it singular,\n perhaps, that with my intellectual limita-\n tions I am not able to see through some of\n the propositions which are made in this de-\n bate and which have been made in other de-\n bates upon this subject. It is said that we\n are engaged in \" crushing out\u201d the \u201conly re-\n public in Asia.\u201d Is that true, Mr. President?\n Of course, if we are crushing out a republic\n in Asia, there must have been a republic in\n Asia to crush out. Confessedly, if there was\n a republic in Asia, it was what was called\n the \" Philippine republic.\u201d Was there a\n Philippine republic? If there ever was, it\n was when we ratified the treaty.

How\n does it harmonize with the proposition, so\n often made then and now, that the in-\n habitants of the archipelago had and have a\n right, fit or unfit, to establish a government\n which they wish and which they think\n adapted to their condition? Note the Vest\n amendment: \u201cThe United States, desiring\n that the people of the archipelago shall be\n enabled to establish a form of free govern-\n ment\u201d\u2014 How does this language consist\n with the notion that they already had\n established one?\u2014 \" suitable to their con-\n dition\u201d \u2014 Who was to decide?

How would we have ob-\n tained control? What would Aguinaldo and\n his Philippine republic have said when we\n attempted with our troops to \u201cassume con-\n trol\u201d of the Philippine Archipelago? Is\n it sane to suppose that Aguinaldo, who had\n already attacked us, who had proclaimed to\n the world a republic with a constitution and\n a congress, who had gathered an army, who\n had representatives abroad, including one\n at Washington, whose jealousy and suspi-\n cion and hostility had been so many times\n evidenced, would, on the basis of the Vest\n amendment, have quietly abdicated and per-\n mitted us to distribute our troops through-\n out the archipelago for the purpose of con-\n trol and enabling the people to establish a\n government in accordance with the standard\n of the Vest amendment, and which would\n safeguard our contract with Spain as to\n commerce with the Philippines?\n</p>\n<p>\n Is it possible to believe that Aguinaldo\n (and his associates), puffed with a sense of\n power and with oriental vanity, who turned\n a deaf ear to all the sincere and generous\n promises of President McKinley, who\n wrought by every means, fair and foul, in\n the power of a dictator to deter vast num-\n bers of his people from accepting the terms\n offered by the first Commission, would have\n tolerated for a moment an attempt to take\n control of the archipelago under the terms\n of the Vest amendment? They would\n have said to us; \u201cWhat are you\n here for?\u201d We should have replied:\n \u201cWe are here to enable you people\n to establish a form of free government\n \u2018which we think suitable to your condition\n and securing the rights of life, liberty and\n property, and the preservation of order,\u2019 \u201d\n etc. They would have answered: \u201cWe have\n a government, which we proclaimed long\n ago to the world, with a constitution, a con-\n gress, an army, provincial and municipal\n organizations enforcing peace, protecting\n property and securing life, and this govern-\n ment suits us.\u201d They would have asked\n us: \u201cDo you claim title and sovereignty\n over the archipelago?\u201d Our answer must\n have been: \u201cNo; we refused that.\u201d Then\n would have come the quick question: \u201cBy\n what right, then, are you here?\u201d And our\n answer must have been: \u201cUnder a contract\n with Spain substantially similar in language\n as that which we made as to Cuba.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n To say that he would have met us with\n insult, defiance, and armed resistance in such\n a situation defies belief. And instead of being\n there as we are now, with a title which the\n Supreme Court of the United States says is\n complete, which the Senate accepted as com-\n plete, which the Congress paid for as com-\n plete, which the world recognizes as com-\n plete, which gives U3 the power to do there\n what is just and right, generous and uplift-\n ing, we should have been there upon the weak\n foundation of contract with a former tyrant.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the event of their defiance, could we\n have turned our guns against them and by\n force of arms have taken control of the ar-\n chipelago wherever resisted? I thank God\n that we were saved from such unutterable\n folly. We would have been in a position\n infinitely worse than the proposition \u2014 to\n which I never could give my consent\u2014 would\n have placed us in Cuba, if before we sent our\n soldiers there we had recognized a govern-\n</p>\n<p>\n ment, subordinating our military operations\n to it, subject to its orders* and liable any\n day to a situation which would have been\n distressing in its weakness and results.\n</p>\n<p>\n Senators who can see no difference between\n Cuba in her relation to this subject and the\n Philippines seem to me, if I may say so\n without offense, to be afflicted by some sort\n of mental strabismus. Cuba is a little island,\n almost in sight of U3, inhabited by about\n</p>\n<p>\n 1.600.000 people, deducting those slain by the\n infamous reconcentrado policy of Weyler. A\n large number of people in Cuba had been ed-\n ucated in the United States. There were\n American citizens in Cuba who for years had\n carried on business there. The Cubans took\n note of w-hat we did and of our methods.\n The island lay in the shadow of this greatest\n of republics, which for all the years since it\n was created had been an object lesson in\n liberty and good government to the Cuban\n people.\n</p>\n<p>\n We had gone to war to free Cuba, and,\n above all things else marking the difference\n between the situation of Cuba and the Phil-\n ippines when the war with Spain was sus-\n pended by the protocol, with relinquishment\n by Spain of sovereignty and title over Cuba,\n she surrendered posses3ion of Cuba to the\n United States, and when we ratified the\n treaty we were in possession of every foot\n of Cuban territory and might well agree to\n discharge the duties imposed by international\n law upon a military occupant, to continue to\n occupy it, and as a military occupant to ob-\n serve the obligations imposed by interna-\n tional law, the duty of protecting life, liberty,\n and property. There was a homogeneous\n people in Cuba, not in our lofty sense, but\n measured by a fair standard, having reference\n to their antecedents and their condition.\n</p>\n<p>\n But as to the Philippines, \u25a0with 10,000,000\n of inhabitants of different races and tribes\n and grades of civilization, strangers to us,\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.000 miles away, we were In possession only\n of the city of Manila. Added to this want\n of possession and the other conditions to\n which I have adverted, and the differenco\n of the situation between Cuba and the Phil-\n ippines would seem to be very obvious.\n</p>\n<p>\n But we have been and are upbraided for\n not having, after the ratification of tho\n treaty, adopted the Bacon resolution, which\n was as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n That the United States hereby disclaim any\n disposition or intention to exercise perma-\n nent sovereignty, jurisdiction, or control\n over said islands and assert their determina-\n tion, when a stable and independent gov-\n ernment shall have been erected therein,\n entitled, in the judgment of the government\n of the United States, to recognition as such,\n to transfer to said government, upon terms\n which shall be reasonable and just, all\n rights secured under the cession by Spain,\n and to thereupon leave the government and\n control of the islands to their people.\n</p>\n<p>\n This resolution, Mr. President, for which\n many Senators voted, is also utterly incon-\n sistent with the notion that there was a\n Philippine republic capable of discharging\n the duties of a government. Not only that,\n but it is utterly inconsistent with the idea\n that Senators who voted for it thought the\n people there could establish without our as-\n sistance a stable and independent govern-\n ment. Not only that, but it Is utterly incon-\n sistent with the idea that under the Declara-\n tion of Independence they had a God-given\n right, whether fit or unfit, to frame such\n government as they saw fit.\n</p>\n<p>\n I did not vote for it.

But as I am on my feet, I\n will say that they had their 1,200 islands,\n and what there were on them I do not say.\n There were people there who have never\n heard of the JJnited States up to this day.\n They had men by the millions, all acting\n together, who had raised an army, who wel-\n comed a general, who had turned Spain out\n of that territory, except the City of Manila,\n who had invested the Spanish troops there\n from water to water, who had agreed upon\n a constitution, republican in form, and who\n had order, peace, quiet; who had local mu-\n nicipal governments all through a large ter-\n ritory, occupied by at least six or seven\n million people, with men in every town or\n neighborhood able to conduct its affairs in\n order and in peace; and that is a people.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 That would be a people if it\n were true.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar\u2014 I wish to say again that I beg\n the Senator\u2019s pardon for interrupting him.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 The Senator need never beg\n my pardon for anything.

That would be a people if\n that were true.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar\u2014 It is true.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 I deny that, except superfi-\n cially^ there is any truth in it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Dietrich\u2014 Mr. President\n</p>\n<p>\n The Presiding Officer\u2014 Does the Senator\n from Wisconsin yield to the Senator from\n Nebraska?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 I am very anxious to proceed,\n but I will yield.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Dietrich \u2014 General MacArthur and\n other prominent witnesses stated that Aguin-\n aldo represented only what he termed by\n his people the Tagalos, and they w ' ere di-\n vided.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar\u2014 I am stating MacArthur\u2019 s re-\n port.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Dietrich \u2014 And also that at Malolos,\n where the constitution was adopted, there\n were no representatives from any other\n island or any other people except the Taga-\n los, and the men who were there were named\n by Agulnaldo, and none were chosen by any\n of the people of the other islands.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 In the Philippines it is said\n there was a people. Of course there must be\n a people to establish a government. There\n is not much distinction, so far as I can find,\n in the sense in which that phrase is used in\n this connection between a people and a na-\n tion. It takes more than land and inhabi-\n tants to constitute a people in the sense in\n which internationally or from the standpoint\n from which we use it that word has signifi-\n cance. To say that there was a people in\n the Philippines in the sense that we were a\n people when our independence of Great Brit-\n ain was declared finds support, in my judg-\n</p>\n<p>\n ment, neither in reason nor in any authority\n on government or law. Aside from other\n things, submitted facts render It philosophi-\n cally impossible that there should have been\n in the Philippine Archipelago a people in\n the sense in which the distinguished Senator\n from Massachusetts uses that phrase and in\n the sense in which the Declaration of Inde-\n pendence uses it.\n</p>\n<p>\n I take from the masterful speech of the\n Senator from Ohio (Mr. Foraker) this quota-\n tion from the report of the Schurman Com-\n mission, to save time, as to what were and\n are the elements constituting the popula-\n tion of this archipelago. The Senator from\n Massachusetts (Mr. Hoar) admits that scat-\n tered tribes do not constitute a people.\n The Declaration of Independence did not ap-\n ply to the Indians. They were great nations,\n sub modo, it is true. They occupied the\n land in which they were born. Mr. Jefferson,\n in his message to Congress in 1806, spoke of\n them as lovers of liberty and lovers of in-\n dependence. They had governments suited\n to their wishes. They had a liberty which\n was satisfactory to them. They were not\n peoples, however.\n</p>\n<p>\n What is this aggregation In the Phil-\n ippines? There are 84 different tribes,\n three different races, all set out long ago\n by the junior Senator from Massachusetts\n (Mr. Lodge) In one of the two brilliant and\n searching speeches which he has made upon\n the subject; and I wmnt to pay here in pub-\n lic to the junior Senator from Massachu-\n setts the tribute of my respect and admira-\n tion for the eloquence, labor and construc-\n tive genius which he has brought to the\n work for the Philippines in which this na-\n tion is involved. The Senator from Ohio\n said:\n</p>\n<p>\n I find there are 21 tribes of Negritos, 16\n tribes of Indonesians, and 47 tribes of\n Malays.

It fits in\n here, I think, very properly.\n</p>\n<p>\n AGUINALDO\u2019S CLAIM\u2014 NOW ASSERTS JURIS-\n DICTION OVER THE ENTIRE PHILIPPINE\n</p>\n<p>\n GROUP.\n</p>\n<p>\n Aguinaldo has broadened his claims, or at\n least his agent here, Agoncillo, has done it\n for him. In another one of the series of com-\n munications which he has addressed to the\n State Department, Aguinaldo asserts his jur-\n isdiction to all of the Philippine group.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is a notable extension, as heretofore\n there was nothing to show that he spoke for\n anything more than the Tagals, and even\n though there may have been an intimation\n that the Visayas, or central group, was part\n of the Philippine confederation, this is cer-\n tainly the first time that any suggestion\n has been made touching the Sulu Archipelago.\n</p>\n<p>\n I hope I have not interrupted the Senator\n in putting that fact into his speech.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Not at all.\n</p>\n<p>\n I have always supposed, apparently I am\n mistaken about it, that distinguished and in-\n telligent Americans charged with the duty\n over there, not over here, of investigating\n conditions in the Philippines, of studying\n the Philippine inhabitants, of endeavoring to\n ascertain and report for the guidance of the\n Government which sent them there, and hav-\n ing taken the time to discharge that duty as\n far as it was possible, would be entitled to\n some credit for accurate information upon\n the subject. But with the minority they are\n not.\n</p>\n<p>\n The testimony of men who know the Phil-\n ippine Archipelago, who have spent years\n there, who studied the inhabitants in time of\n peace, all goes for nothing, but this bubble\n of a living, cohesive, initiating people fit to\n give consent to a government, and able to\n organize one, is built up, so far as I know,\n upon this quotation from General MacArthur\n and upon the statement of the two naval offi-\n cers who wandered on an auspicious occasion\n through a portion of the islands.\n</p>\n<p>\n To-day President Schurman coincides with\n some distinguished gentlemen as to what\n ought to be done in the Philippine Archi-\n pelago. I have admiration for him. I lose\n none of it because he changes his mind.\n Every man has a right to do that, and every\n man ought to do that if he thinks it i3 right\n to do it. But I think he knew as much about\n the Filipino population when he came back\n to report the investigations of his Commis-\n sion over there as he does now. I think that\n he and his associates know as much / as the\n two young naval officers did who traveled\n through a portion of the Philippine Archi-\n pelago.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Lodge\u2014 For three weeks.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 For three week.;. There is\n a side light on that trip, too. They were\n not permitted to see anything except what\n the Filipino general wanted them to see, or\n to gain any impression based upon fact ex-\n cept what he wanted them to gain.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, this is what is said further by the\n Commission:\n</p>\n<p>\n The most striking and perhaps the most\n significant fact in the entire situation is\n the multiplicity of tribes inhabiting the\n</p>\n<p>\n archipelago, the diversity of their languages\n (which are mutually unintelligible) \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Governor Taft testifies to the same thing,\n and everybody else who knows anything\n about it from actual observation,\n and the multifarious phases of civilization \u2014\n ranging all the way from the highest to the\n lowest \u2014 exhibited by the natives of the sev-\n eral provinces and islands. In spite of the\n general use of the Spanish language by the\n educated classes and the considerable simi-\n larity of economic and social conditions\n prevalent in Luzon and the Visayan Islands,\n the masses of the people are without a com-\n mon speech and they lack the sentiment of\n nationality.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Filipions are not a nation, and there\n can be no \u201cpolitical being that we call a\n people,\u201d one people, in the language of the\n Declaration of Independence, which lacks the\n sentiment of nationality and which is not\n capable, by acquirement and characteristics,\n of cohesion, power for organization, and con-\n ception of right and law and order equal to\n the formation of a nation, which can be\n called a people in the sense in which that\n language is used.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Filioinos are not a nation, but a vari-\n egated assemblage of different tribes and\n peoples, and their loyalty is still of the\n tribal tvpe.\n</p>\n<p>\n I do not suppose they have changed great-\n ly since the Schurman report was written.\n</p>\n<p>\n Colquin, who knows the Orient and has\n studied well the Malay and the Filipino, in\n his work, \u201cThe Mastery of the Pacific,\u201d says:\n</p>\n<p>\n Other deficiencies in their mental and\n moral equipment are a lack of organizing\n power. No Malay nation has ever emerged\n from the hordes of that race which have\n spread over the islands of the Pacific. Wher-\n ever they are found they have certain\n marked characteristics, and of these the\n most remarkable is their lack of that spirit\n which goes to form a homogeneous people,\n to weld them together. The Malay is al-\n ways a provincial; more, he rarely rises out-\n side the interests of his own town or vil-\n lage.\n</p>\n<p>\n And with this limitation he recognizes\n many good qualities.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of course Aguinaldo had an army of 30,-\n 000 people, armed partly by the United\n States. Was that an army of a Philippine\n people? Was that an army that represented\n the Yisayans? ' Was that an army that rep-\n resented the Macabebes? Was that an army\n that represented the different tribes there\n at the outset? It was an army of Tagals\n and bandits, or ladrones who have infested\n the mountains in the archipelago.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar\u2014 May I ask the Senator did not\n our general commit 4,000 Spanish prisoners\n to their care?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 Yes. He did that because\n he could not take care of them himself. He\n did not turn them pver\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack\u2014 Mr. President\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n The presiding officer (Mr. Gallinger in the\n chair) \u2014 Does the Senator from Wisconsin\n yield to the Senator from Tennessee?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 Certainly.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 Do I understand the Senator\n to say that because he could not take care\n of the prisoners himself he turned them over\n to robbers and outlaws?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I do not say they were all\n robbers or outlaws.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 You said it was an army of\n ladrones.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 I said there were ladrones\n and bandits in the army, and that it was\n not an army representative of a Philippine\n people, such a people as we are told here\n were a living, organized people, capable of\n creating and maintaining a government.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack\u2014 Mr. President \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n The presiding officer \u2014 Does the Senator\n yield?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Certainly.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 I simply want to understand\n the Senator. He says there are ladrones and\n outlaws in the army. Of course there may\n be bad men \u2014 outlaws \u2014 in every army.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Yes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 Do I understand the Sena-\n tor to mean that the Philippine army organ-\n ized there and co-operating with the Ameri-\n can forces were largely or to any consider-\n able extent composed of mere outlaws and\n robbers and bandits?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I do not know to what ex-\n tent; neither does the Senator.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 Mr. President \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 But being a Philippine\n army, from the Senator\u2019s standpoint, it must\n have been composed of liverty-loving, pa-\n triotic, law-abiding citizens.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 Being an army organized\n with the co-operation of Admiral Dewey and\n in co-operation with the American forces,\n</p>\n<p>\n I assume that it was not an army of outlaws\n and cutthroats and ruffians.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 One of its leading generals\n had been for a great many years the leader\n of bands of cut throats and ruffians.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 Whom?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Pinar del Pilar. Nobody de-\n nied that. I know it will be denied now; at\n least, I suppose so.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 The Senator from Wiscon-\n sin, of course, is the only prophet in the\n chamber.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Oh, no; I am not.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 He always knows what *\n Senator is going to say before he says it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 No; I beg the Senator ' s par-\n don.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 And he very seldom knows\n himself what he has said after he has said\n it.\n</p>\n<p>\n The point to which I wish to direct the at-\n tention of the Senator was this: Admiral\n Dewey and other American representatives\n sought the aid and co-operation of Aguinaldo\n and his associates, and if it be true that\n by their help they organized an army of cut-\n throats and bandits and ruffians, then Ad-\n miral Dewey is guilty of violating the rules\n of civilized warfare, and instead of being\n acclaimed as a hero he ought to be branded\n and court martialed and turned out of the\n navy, if the charge made by the Senator\n from Wisconsin is a true one.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Mr. President, that adds only\n one more to the horrible suggestions about\n Admiral Dewey\u2019s conduct which I have heard\n made in this chamber before the Senator\n took a seat here. It* was an army which\n sought the right to enter Manila to loot it.\n It was an army which, represented by a\n commission, insisted upon the right to enter\n Manila for loot and violence and rapine.\n</p>\n<p>\n The commander of that army, when in-\n formed in writing by General Otis that the\n rules of warfare recognized by the American\n people precluded loot, was not satisfied with\n it. It was an army which afterwards vio-\n lated habitually the rules of civilized war-\n fare. It was an army, Mr. President, which\n perpetrated \u2014 and some of them were re-\n ferred to by the Senator from Massachu-\n setts (Mr. Lodge) \u2014 unparelleled atrocities not\n only upon American prisoners who fell into\n their hands, but upon countless thousands\n of their own people. It was an army which\n respected neither sex. It was an army\n whose rule came to be confiscation and am-\n bush.\n</p>\n<p>\n When Senators in the light of to-day talk\n about the crowd which swiftly came around\n Aguinaldo as \u201can army of a DiMpino\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0042/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0042/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0042/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0042/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0042/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0042.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 828390}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"42\">\n<p>\n 40\n</p>\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE\n</p>\n<p>\n pie,\u201d friendly to the Americans from the\n beginning, I deny it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Recurring to Pinar del Pilar, one of the\n strongest characters in point of ability, and\n one of the most desperate in point of sav-\n agery in the islands, who was made a gen-\n eral \u2014 Governor Taft refers to him as a cattle\n thief before the insurrection.

Your alwavs faithful sub-\n ordinate, ISIDORO TORRES.\n</p>\n<p>\n I read in a Manila paper a description of\n a procession of friars marched under guard\n by these lovers of liberty out of Manila to\n this place of disease and death.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here is something else from this diary:\n</p>\n<p>\n After supper, -which was at 6 o\u2019clock, the\n honorable president, in a conversation with\n B., V., and Lieutenant Carasco \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n This is from the other side; it is from a\n friend and companion \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n told them that as soon as the independence\n of our country was. declared he would give\n each one of them an amount of land equal\n to what he himself will take for the future\n of his own family, that is, he will give each\n one of the three senores 13,500 acres of land\n as a recompense for their work; and also\n that these plantations will be located ad-\n joining one another in such a manner that\n they will lie in the same province.\n</p>\n<p>\n He did not say anything there about pat-\n ents of nobility, but of course they would\n have come in season.\n</p>\n<p>\n As I have said, Mr. President, he sent 1.500\n armed Tagalos into Visaya to bring that un-\n armed people to acknowledge his govern-\n ment.

Small re-\n publics were formed which exceeded the\n Spanish Government in ineptitude and cor-\n ruption. Robber bands were let loose, and\n the whole country was in confusidn. When\n it became apparent, however, that the United\n States had no intention of leaving the islands\n to work out their own salvation, a new\n phase began. The insurrecto leaders, hav-\n</p>\n<p>\n I STANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n ing pledged themselves to independence, or-\n ganized resistance to the United States, in-\n flaming the people by declaring that the\n Americans were going to bring back the\n friars. Color was given to this by the fact\n that they could not see their way to a whole-\n sale confiscation of church lands, and, while\n incurring the displeasure of the Filipinos\n by protecting the friars to a certain extent,\n they had all the weight of the latter against\n them, for the priests felt that the return of\n Spain was the one hope of retaining their\n position.\n</p>\n<p>\n I have here among these papers the most\n frantic appeals of Aguinaldo begging the\n Filipinos to withhold any welcome to the\n officers of the Commission, begging them, as\n he says in one of the appeals \u2014 I will not\n take the time to read it \u2014 on bended knee not\n to accept any proffer of autonomy from the\n American government.\n</p>\n<p>\n He was not content with that, Mr. Presi-\n dent. He issued an order, signed with his\n own hand, in order to prevent the inhabi-\n tants from repudiating his government of\n force and violence, in order to deter them\n all through the archipelago from accepting\n the protection, the peace, the care of the\n government of the United States by which\n he put every man in the islands in the\n Katipunan. Up to that time those only had\n joined it who desired to join it or were\n forced as individuals to join it. There never\n has been in my reading such an oath as that\n of this society \u2014 never. I put it in the Record\n the last time I had occasion to address the\n Senate on this subject. It required a man to\n give himself soul and body to the Katipunan\n to do its bidding, to give his life when it was\n demanded, to give his property when de-\n manded, and to kill his father, mother,\n brother, sister, wife or children upon its de-\n mand.\n</p>\n<p>\n More than that, Mr. President, it was part\n of the oath that if he did not obey the com-\n mand of the Katipunan, he should forfeit his\n life, not to be taken upon a trial, not to be\n taken under the judgment of any court, but\n to be taken by the swift execution of the de-\n cree of this oath-bound association of ty-\n rants. Not only that, but the lives of hi3\n family should pay the forfeit if he failed to\n stand practically by this alleged government\n of Aguinaldo; this government self-pro-\n claimed; this government of force and vio-\n lence; this government \u25a0which had no regard\n for the consent or the rights of the people;\n this government whose sole existence was\n one of blood, and whose career was one of\n tyranny, which the testimony shows made\n the tyranny of Spain in comparison a para-\n dise. To prevent these people whom it is\n said General MacArthur thought were behind\n Aguinaldo from espousing our cause and to\n bind them to him, not by kindness, not by\n justice, not because of their consent, not by\n the tie of good government and protection,\n but to hold them to him by the iron hand of\n the Katipunan he issued this order, which I\n cannot at this moment find, by which he\n made every man in the archipelago, whether\n he would or not, a member of the Katipunan,\n bound by its oath, and subject to its punish-\n ments.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, Senators may talk about the\n depopulation of districts, may figure up the\n number of Filipinos who have been destroyed,\n but do not charge that to atrocity and cruelty\n upon the part of the American Army, except\n so far as war goes, and exceptional cases\n where bad men, forgetting the flag and the\n honor of the Army, have done cruel and\n 1 wicked things\u2014 do not leave out the silent.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0043/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0043/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0043/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0043/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0043/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0043.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 872095}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"43\">\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 41\n</p>\n<p>\n ghastly, diabolical judgments and executions\n of the Katipunan.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the first commission went there this\n alleged congress voted to accept autonomy,\n and but for Mabini and the war leaders who\n were playing for a high stake \u2014 to govern the\n people through an oligarchy, to govern them\n regardless of their consent, to govern them\n for their own purposes and uses, so that\n they could have \u201ca million dollars to pay the\n expenses of a trip to Europe,\u201d it would have\n been accepted.\n</p>\n<p>\n Talk about a people and a republic in Asia\n upon which we are making w ' ar and which\n we are destroying!

There had been\n no proposition in the Congress to hold that\n people in colonialism; there had been no\n proposition to treat that people in any other\n way than wo would treat Cuba; there was no\n reason for that impeachment of the people;\n there was no reason to suppose that the peo-\n ple who went to war for liberty in Cuba\n would be any other than generous and true\n to their ideals in the Orient; and yet it be-\n came a party issue, and those people in revolt\n were given, day after day, for months, to\n understand that the success of Democracy\n meant their independence, and they appealed\n to their troops\u2014 albeit their army had been\n disbanded and were shooting our men from\n ambush\u2014 not to attack them in the open,\n not to meet them in fair fight, but to shoot\n them down in \u2018\u2018uninhabited and desolate\n places,\u201d using the language of the order, and\n</p>\n<p>\n to keep it up until the election should come\n off. Ah, Senators cannot charge to the rat-\n ification of the treaty, nor to the sending of\n the Army over there, all the bloodshed and\n cruelty which came to the Philippine Archi-\n pelago.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here is a copy of the instructions issued by\n Aguinaldo to Sandico under date August 10,\n 1898, two days before the protocol, as I\n recollect it:\n</p>\n<p>\n Revolutionary Government of the Philippines,\n Office of the President.\n</p>\n<p>\n Instructions for Senor Sandico.\n</p>\n<p>\n First. To arrange so that all the Filipino\n subjects residing in Hongkong act in unity.\n To look for the best means to persuade those\n who have contrary opinions and induce them\n to co-operate in the policy of the government,\n or at least not to oppose it by imprudent be-\n havior, which would be to our discredit with\n the powers.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Lodge \u2014 If the senator will excuse me,\n did I understand him to say that they were\n subjects or citizens of the republic?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Subjects; they were the sub-\n jects of a tyranny, an oligarchy founded upon\n force, and exercising nothing but force and\n violence.\n</p>\n<p>\n The second paragraph I shall not read.\n</p>\n<p>\n Third. The policy of the government is as\n follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. To struggle for the independence of\n \u201cFilipinas\u201d as far as our strength and our\n means will permit. Protection or annexation\n will be acceptable only when it can be clearly\n seen that the recognition of our independence\n either by force of arms or diplomacy, is im-\n possible. .\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The Filipino government and its repre-\n sentatives will attempt as far as possible to\n be on good terms with the Government at\n Washington, entreating the recognition of\n the Filipino government under pretext that\n such recognition constitutes a sine qua non\n before any terms of agreement between the\n United States and \u201cFilipinas.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This is signed \" E. Aguinaldo\u201d and dated\n Bacoor, August 10, 1898.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Who translated that?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 This was translated by Cap-\n tain Taylor, I suppose. I did not translate\n it. I could not. I suppose it is correctly\n translated. I am in the habit of believing\n that officers of the Army are honorable gen-\n tlemen, and that they would not be willing,\n either by accident or otherwise, that a paper\n should come translated by them incorrectly.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 The suggestion I meant to make\n by my inquiry was this: When you are de-\n pending on niceties of expression, as in the\n case of a distinction between \u201csubjects\u201d and\n \" citizens,\u201d or a distinction between two\n things which are generally alike, as \u201cpre-\n text,\u201d or \" pretense,\u201d or \u201cclaim,\u201d it is pretty\n important that you know whether the orig-\n inal phrase which is translated had precisely\n that shade of meaning. I do not in the least\n question the integrity of the translator.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 There is no question about\n this part of it anyhow, and no reason to think\n there is about the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n Protection or annexation will be acceptable\n only when it can be clearly seen that the\n recognition of our independence, either by\n force of arms or diplomacy, is impossible.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 I think that is very much what\n the Senator from Wisconsin would have said,\n speaking for his people under like circum-\n stances.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I have heard it said that\n there is no Senator here who would not have\n done just what Aguinaldo did when he at-\n tacked our Army. Now, speaking for myself,\n I would not have done that, and no other man\n who was not bent upon a fight; no man of\n intelligence, fit to be at the head of a gov-\n</p>\n<p>\n ernment would have done it, in my judg-\n ment.\n</p>\n<p>\n He would have at least waited, with an\n agent here and the word President McKinley\n had sent over there, until the Senate could\n have voted, in two or three days, upon the\n Vest amendment and the Bacon amendment.\n</p>\n<p>\n By the way, the Senator from Massachu-\n setts did not accurately, two or three times\n in his speech, quote the McEnery resolution.\n He quoted it as if it referred only to the\n \u201cinterest of the United States.\u201d That is not\n all it says. It added, \u201cand the interest of\n the inhabitants of said islands.\u201d That omis-\n sion may not be material, but with those\n words in it reads more kindly \u2014 it reads more\n like an American document. I merely call\n the Senator\u2019s attention to that.\n</p>\n<p>\n So, Mr. President, I say again that it was\n a miserable thing that in that day and later\n there went to the Filipinos from the United\n States, with our Army over there, words of\n encouragement to the Filipinos, denouncing\n us as having unconstitutionally bought sov-\n ereignty, as violating the Declaration of In-\n dependence; that we were there to enslave\n them, not to give them liberty, all a false\n political issue. They might as well have\n been told: \u201cYou fight our men and hold out\n until after the election and if we win you\n will get independence under a protectorate.\u201d\n It prolonged the war. It vastly embar-\n rassed the operations of the government.\n It made difficult, and it will do so hereafter,\n to carry forward as speedily as we wished\n to do to the earliest possible fruition the\n blessings which we wished to confer and\n will confer upon that people.\n</p>\n<p>\n I say \u201cwill confer\u201d because. Senators, the\n American people will not run away from that\n duty. They never run away from any duty.\n They indorsed at the polls, long after our\n action upon the treaty, after we had sent\n our Army into the Philippines, when they\n knew it meant war and trouble and division\n at home the attitude of the Republican party\n and of the brave and chivalrous Democrats\n who joined in our action, and they re-elected\n McKinley President of the United States.\n They have no idea, Mr. President, in my\n judgment, of turning back.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Senator from Massachusetts has had\n a great deal to say about the Declaration\n of Independence. He reveres it, as I wish\n I could make him believe I do, for I wish his\n good opinion. But he wants the Declaration\n of Independence as he reads it, and I want\n it as I read it. Neither of us means to be\n false to it. It will bring no \u201cblush of\n shame\u201d to my cheeks to read it publicly\n again as I used to sometimes on Independ-\n ence Day, and that is not because I have lost\n conscience or love of liberty.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Declaration of Independence, like\n other documents \u2014 and I refer here to it\n only for a moment, Mr. President, because\n I must hurry along \u2014 must be read as a\n whole to be rightly interpreted. There is\n nothing more dangerous than a maxim mis-\n applied.\n</p>\n<p>\n When in the course of human events it\n becomes necessary for one people \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n And the colonies were one people; they\n were a part of the English people; they\n were children of England; they had the ed-\n ucation and the conditions of England; they\n had here the best of England\u2019s institutions;\n they were no less one people with the En-\n glish in ties of blood, association, education\n and love of liberty than the Southern people,\n and we were one people in the old days, as\n we are to-day, and as we always, altvf.Us\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0044/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0044/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0044/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0044/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0044/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0044.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 857371}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"44\">\n<p>\n 42\n</p>\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n hereafter will be; anil Jefferson wrote of\n that situation:\n</p>\n<p>\n When in the course of human events it be-\n comes necessary for one people \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n W 7 ho would compare our people with the\n tribes in the Philippines?\n to dissolve the political bands which have\n connected them with another and to assume\n among the powers of the earth the separate\n and equal station to which the laws of na-\n ture and of nature\u2019s God entitle them \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n That presupposes a people so far educated\n in love of liberty and in the science and\n capacity for government, as to be able to\n form a nation entitled upon principles of in-\n ternational law and usage to \" the separate\n and equal station to which the laws of na-\n ture and of nature\u2019s God entitle them\u201d\n among the powers of the earth.

Mr. President, it was worked out in\n the end.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Hoar)\n in his beautiful speech said, speaking for one\n epoch: \u201c\u2019I put down the rebellion; I freed\n the slave.\u201d Ah, but how did we free the\n slave? We washed out that awful stain\n with precious blood, shed not only by our\n people, but by yours of the South.\n</p>\n<p>\n When Abraham Lincoln put his hand to\n the Proclamation of Independence war was\n flagrant in the land, the flag was being stained\n with the sulphurous smoke of battle and shot\n into rags on a hundred fields of fight, and\n the shrieks of the wounded and the dying,\n the weird and awful music of war, were borne\n upon every breeze from the South to the\n North, and our homes and your homes were\n filled with sadness and broken hearts and\n everywhere were new-made graves. In the\n providence of God it has happened since the\n dawn of civilization that sometimes only\n through agony and the shedding of blood\n could the principle of the Declaration of\n Independence \u2014 the eternal principle of indi-\n vidual rights and liberty\u2014 be wrought out.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI put down the rebellion.\u201d That war has\n seemed to me a practical exposition by our\n people of the doctrine of the \" consent of the\n governed\u201d and almost a national repudiation\n of it as a doctrine of general application. The\n Southern people, they thought rightly and\n we though* wrongly, decided that ' we had in-\n vaded, or intended to invade, their consti-\n tutional rights; that there had come an ir-\n repressible conflict between the North and\n the system of slave labor in vogue in the\n South and recognized by the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p>\n This system the South considered not only\n their constitutional right, but indispensable\n to their prosperity. Preceded by years of\n bitter agitation, the time came when, as-\n serting the right of revolution, which in the\n last analysis is based upon the doctrine of\n the consent of the governed, they revolted\n and created a Confederacy, \u201claying its foun-\n dation on such principles and organizing its\n powers in such form \" as to them seemed\n \u201cmost likely to effect their safety and hap-\n piness.\u201d We denied their right to withdraw\n their consent to be governed by the United\n States.\n</p>\n<p>\n They struggled long and gallantly and at\n inexpressible sacrifice for the independence\n of the government which they had instituted.\n If they had had the money and the men and\n the resources, they would have established\n their right. We suppressed their rebellion and\n preserved the Union because we had resources\n of men and money to whip this \u201cconsent-of-\n the-governed\u201d theory out of the good people\n of the South. We forced a government upon\n them against their will.\n</p>\n<p>\n The great transactions of the world have\n not been and cannot be governed by mere\n maxims of abstract right. Some day it may\n be so. Thus far it never has been so in any\n age or among any people.\n</p>\n<p>\n I have always believed that in no other\n way could slavery have been eliminated from\n our system, and that in no other way save\n through the bloodshed and heartbreak and\n cruelty of war could we have been molded\n perpetually into one people.\n</p>\n<p>\n A general from the Philippines, and one\n of the most intelligent, who has read the Dec-\n laration of Independence and knows fairly\n well what it means, who has been all through\n the Philippines, has met those people of every\n</p>\n<p>\n class and description, when asked before the\n committee if the people wanted independence,\n replied, \u201cYes, I guess they do, but they do\n not know what it means.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n He thought that most of the Taos or peas-\n ants regarded it as \u201csomething good to eat.\u201d\n Even Aguinaldo never talked about inde-\n pendence except with a protectorate, and he\n was negotiating with himself as to what gov- _\n ernment on earth he would have protect him\n and his republic.\n</p>\n<p>\n No, Mr. President, the Senator from Mass-\n achusetts, In that \" rhetorical\u201d column of\n his, remarkably eloquent and beautiful, to\n which each epoch in our history contributes\n its message, placed properly at the founda-\n tion to that of the Puritan and the Hugue-\n not. That message, as the Senator from\n Massachusetts read it, was short, yet true,\n of course. \u201cI brought the torch of Freedom\n across the sea. I cleared the forest. I sub-\n dued the savage and the wild beast. I laid\n in Christian liberty and law the foundations\n of empire.\u201d That is all true. But through\n what a terrible, strenuous and bloody path-\n way they walked at times from the beginning\n to the end of the journey which the Senator\n so beautifully and so briefly epitomizes.\n</p>\n<p>\n They found the Indian tribes here, and\n they did subdue them. I say it with no dis-\n respect, for my father was born in Massa-\n chusetts, and for his sake and the sake of my\n forbears there, as well as for the splendid\n history of that grand old Commonwealth,\n</p>\n<p>\n I could have nothing but respect and venera-\n tion and love for her. It is one of those\n harsh things that come about when you get\n away from mere theories and into \u201cthe cor-\n rupted currents of thi3 world.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n I refer to one item in the history of Mass-\n achusetts which I do not mention to con-\n demn, because in the progress of civiliza-\n tion the elements of barbarism have always\n resisted every forward step, and men with\n love of liberty, men who wished to work out\n in the sight of God great results for liberty,\n have many, many times, as Abraham Lincoln\n had to do, passed through cruelty and hard-\n ships and suffering, sometimes inflicted by\n thdmselves, in order to reach the goal.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI subdued the savage.\u201d Here is the act\n of the province of Massachusetts, passed in\n 1722, a hundred years after the settlement.\n</p>\n<p>\n I could not help thinking of this statute\n when I heard the general denunciation of\n the Army in the Philippines for its cruelty,\n based upon the assumption that a military\n officer over there, stung by unspeakable\n cruelty to American soldiers, had forgotten\n the honor of the flag and verbally given an\n order which no officer ought to obey, and\n which no officer ever ought to think, much\n less to utter.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is one of the many cruel chapters in\n the history of civilization.

That order of 1722 \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 It is a statute.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar\u2014 No matter what it is, it is a\n cruel and barbarous order, a relic of what\n was a cruel and barbarous time. Do you\n approve it that at the beginning of the twen-\n tieth century you are making a precedent of\n it? Tell us that.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I think our fathers bought\n the lands of the Indians and then proceeded\n to buy the scalps of the Indians.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 I will agree that this policy\n which the Senator from Wisconsin is defend-\n ing is well supported by all the wicked pre-\n cedents that can be culled from the lives of\n good men. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Yes; but when the Senator\n finds it in his heart upon ex parte testimony\n to denounce in general language transac-\n tions in this age of officers as brave as ever\n lived, he ought not to forget at least that\n our forebears \u2014 brave men \u2014 in war also\n found it necessary to resort to what in time\n of peace no man on earth would approve of.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Does the Senator approve of\n that order \u2014 war or peace? He has not an-\n swered that question.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I think if it was necessary\n to pass that statute in order to protect the\n wife, the children, the home from destruc-\n tion \u2014 the wife from debauchery, the children\n from torture and death\u2014 I would have done\n what they did. What does the Senator say?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr Hoar \u2014 It never was necessary to do it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Oh!\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 It was a base and wicked order,\n and when the Senator speaks about our\n forebears I am happy to have the right to\n say that the men in that generation who\n bore my name incurred obliquy and indigna-\n tion by resisting those things just as I do\n now. (Applause in the galleries.)\n</p>\n<p>\n The presiding officer (Mr. Platt of Connec-\n ticut) rapped with his gavel.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Civilization has never gone\n forward without contest and conflict and re-\n</p>\n<p>\n sistance and bloodshed and the cruelties of\n war.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Mr. President, does the Senator\n from Wisconsin approve that order \u2014 without\n any \u201cif?\u201d He says he does not approve the\n order in the Philippines. Now, does he ap-\n prove this one?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 If it was necessary \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Does the Senator approve it?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 I for one am not willing to\n accept the opinion even of the distinguished\n Senator from Massachusetts, as great an\n historian as he is, that this statute was a\n mere wanton, useless exhibition of brutality\n and cruelty. It may be true, but I have\n never believed it, that the men who left\n their homes in England, who crossed in a\n little bark with their families the treacher-\n ous sea\u2014 i\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 This was a hundred and two\n years later.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 I know; but they brought\n liberty with them to this continent, and I\n have never believed that the men who\n sprang from them lost in love of liberty.\n</p>\n<p>\n If the Indians had not been driven back,\n if this maxim in the Declaration of Inde-\n pendence about which so much is said had\n been literally construed and strictly ob-\n served, we would have had no United States.\n This country would still have been inhabited\n by nations of savages, considering liberty as\n the right to roam where they chose and kill\n whomever came in their way. The states\n which have been upbuilded have been build-\n ed in the same way in degree. Wherever\n the frontier has been pushed back by the\n advancing forces of civilization it has in-\n volved struggle, hardship, strife and blood-\n shed. We have pressed the Indians, whom\n Mr. Jefferson said loved independence and\n liberty, farther and farther, until to-day we\n have nearly all who are left in \u201cconcentra-\n tion camps,\u201d called reservations.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Mr. President \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 And, if the Senator from\n Massachusetts will pardon me, it is one\n thing, taken in an isolated way, dealt with\n by itself, independent of conditions, and,\n another thing regarded in its connection\n with the work of civilization, with the irre-\n sistible impulse of the Anglo-Saxon to move\n forward; to conquer the forest; to remove\n obstructions; to build cities; to erect houses\n of worship; to turn a continent into the\n home of 80,000,000 free people; when neces-\n sity came for it I somehow believe it was a\n part of the scheme of the Almighty that\n some of these things should be done.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Now, Mr. President \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Just as I believe \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 I beg the Senator\u2019s pardon. The\n Senator disapproves of the order in the\n Philippines. He says so.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I say it is \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 One minute. Let me finish\n the .sentence.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I did not say so as the Sena-\n tor says it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 I understood the Senator to\n say that it was an order which no soldier\n ought ever to have given and that he dis-\n approves of these cruelties. I understand\n he approves in his mind of 1722. What is the\n distinction in his mind that makes him ap-\n prove that f and disapprove what has hap-\n pened lately?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 I did not say that I approved\n the statute of 1722.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Very will.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 I cannot put myself in their\n situation. The Senator said it was a\n wanton, causeless, unneccesary thing. I\n have not so understood it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar\u2014 My honorable friend agrees\n with me in disapproving what has been done\n in the Philippines in that particular, but\n does not say whether or not he approves\n the precedent he cites.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I did not cite it for my bene-\n fit. I cited it for the benefit of the Senator\n from Massachusetts, to show that even the\n liberty-loving people of the Province of\n Massachusetts\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Did a mean thing once.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Had to do a cruel thing onco\n in order that their families might live, that\n civilization might move forward, and that ia\n the end liberty might dwell in that colony.\n We cannot carry out our own \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar\u2014 In 1722 there was no such ne-\n cessity. The Indian wars were all over, so\n far as they were carried on by any Indian\n tribes in Massachusetts. Philip\u2019s War ended\n in 1666 or 1667. That was an act aimed at\n the allies of the French who came down from\n Canada and brought some Indians with them.\n There was no war in Massachusetts in 1722.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Lodge \u2014 Will the Senator from Wiscon-\n sin permit me?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Certainly.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Lodge \u2014 That statute was directed\n against the Maine Indians, and was owing\n to the slaughters committed by those In-\n dians on the frontier settlements of Maine,\n which was then a part of Massachusetts. It\n was for the protection of those villages on\n the Maine frontier that the statute was\n passed.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Gallinger \u2014 If the Senator from Wis-\n consin will permit, perhaps it is not impor-\n tant, but a similar statute was passed in\n the province of Massachusetts in the year\n 1694, only they did not give quite so mucli\n for a scalp. That is the only difference.\n (Laughter.)\n</p>\n<p>\n They paid \u00a350 per scalp in 1694, but as they\n progressed in civilization they paid \u00a3100 in\n 1722, twenty-eight years later.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 I want every senator who likes\n the taste of either of those statutes in his\n mouth to tell me two things which the Sen-\n ator from Wisconsin has partly told. One 1\u00bb\n whether he approves of them, and the other\n is whether he approves of what has been\n done in the Philippine Islands.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Gallinger \u2014 I was not there; so I can-\n not tell much about it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 I have not yet found anybody,\n thank God, who will say that he approves\n of either.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 And the Senator will not find\n anybody, thank God, who approves of any\n cruel order in the Philippines.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 I know that.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 And so far as I am concerned\n the Senator will never find me ready to im-\n peach the whole Army in the Philippines\n upon ex parte statements. (Applause in the\n galleries.)\n</p>\n<p>\n The presiding officer rapped with his gavel.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Who has impeached the whole\n Army?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 It has been done in this whole\n debate. It has been done by witnesses be-\n fore the committee. I am not talking about\n the Senator from Massachusetts.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 I thought you were talking of me\n or trying to. I said distinctly that our Army\n was composed of brave and humane men;\n that in a few instances these things had been\n done, but that they always did occur in con-\n tests between savage or inferior and super-\n ior races, and therefore the fault was not\n with the Army, and that the Army ought not\n to be denounced for it.

He did not intend by that\n to put a taint upon the men w r ho enacted that\n law. I do not judge them because I cannot\n put myself in their places. I do not know\n what I would not do in order to protect my\n wife and my children or my neighbor\u2019s wife\n and children against destruction. I merely\n mean that, regardless of maxims, in the ad-\n vance of civilization on our own continent the\n fundamental message which that epoch seilds\n as expressed by the Senator from Massachu-\n setts, involved subduing the savages in all\n necessary ways.\n</p>\n<p>\n So did the next one. The states to which\n he referred were not builded without subdu-\n ing the savages. Some way I find in the\n progress of civilization here and there, all\n along the line that men have done, and I pre-\n sume they had to unlesss I know differently\n things which from the standpoint of peace\n and the enlightened civilization of this day\n would be condemned. I am not condemning\n them.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Declaration of Independence and its\n words \u201cthe consent of the governed\u201d has\n played from the beginning a conspicuous part\n in the debase upon this subject. I confess I\n have not been able to see its applicability.\n Perhaps that is partly due to our differences\n as to the facts. To me it is clear that a con-\n dition precedent to the applicability of the\n doctrine is the existence of a people of suffi-\n cient intelligence, cohesion and power of\n organization to alter or to abolish a form of\n government which to them had become de-\n structive of the ends of government and to\n institute a new government and to maintain\n it.\n</p>\n<p>\n If the 10,000,000 inhabitants of the Philip-\n pines had, independent of our presence and\n operations there as an enemy of Spain, or-\n ganized an insurrection, declared their inde-\n pendence and won it, and established a gov-\n ernment to suit themselves it would have\n been their right to maintain it as they saw\n fit, without dictation from any other govern-\n ment or people. But this is not the case.\n From my point of view they had done none\n of these things in any substantial sense, and\n we acquired from Spain by treaty the title\n to the archipelago, the sovereignty over it\n and the right to govern it. That in such\n case adherence to the Declaration of Inde-\n pendence, if it be applicable at all, requires\n regardless of the fitness of the people to\n govern, that they shall be turned loose to\n form a government of their own I deny.\n</p>\n<p>\n The doctrine of the consent of the gov-\n erner, as used here as an argument against\n the government for what it has done and\n proposes to do in the Philippines, has been\n Violated by this nation from the beginning.\n</p>\n<p>\n We purchased Louisiana, a vast territory,\n .tid we ask the consent of the people? Did\n we not put upon that people, many of them\n intelligent people, too, a government against\n which they protested? And was not the man\n</p>\n<p>\n w r ho did it and the man who defended it the\n same Thomas Jefferson who wrote those\n words in the Declaration of Independence?\n</p>\n<p>\n The Senator from Massachusetts (Mr.\n Hoar) in attemptirg to parry that said the\n other day (and if he had not felt that there\n was force in it he w r ould, I know, never have\n been driven to parry it in that way), that\n Jefferson did not want to buy Louisiana;\n that all he wanted to buy was the City of\n New Orleans, and that Napoleon forced the\n whole Louisiana purchase upon him. That\n may be true. I have no notion to challenge\n that.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Mr. Jefferson\u2019s reason was w ' hat\n he gave at the time, that there were not any\n people there, and it would be a thousand\n years, he thought, before the territory would\n be settled.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Yes, but what was in the\n mind of Mr. Jefferson has nothing whatever\n to do with it, nor will it have anything to\n do with it in the mind of anybody else, I\n think, who stops carefully to consider the\n question. It is not a question whether Jef-\n ferson intended to buy the territory or only\n the city. The question is what he did with\n the people of the territory after he acquired\n it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Mr. Jefferson thought there were\n not any people in the definition the Senator\n has just given. Now Orleans had French\n traders who were to make their money and\n go home to France. The others wanted to\n come to us. But in the territory, with the\n exception of a little trading post at St.\n Louis, there were no settlements.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 There were 60,000 people, Mr.\n President.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Guyarre fixes the number at\n about 30,000. It was a vast territory.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 When did it ever come about\n that 60,000 people are entitled to the \u201cbless-\n ings of liberty\u201d and 30,000 are not?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 But, when you are talking about\n a continent, the question whether there is one\n man to ten miles square spread all over it.\n or whether there are 30,000 men so compact\n that they can make treaties and fo ' rm a\n government is the question. It is not a\n question of numbers. Rhode Island was as\n much a people as New York or Virginia at\n the time of the Declaration. So was Dela-\n ware. But If the people of Rhode Island had\n been scattered over this whole continent or\n over the whole Louisiana territory without\n any cohesion or vital life, they would not\n have been a people then. I beg the Senator\u2019s\n pardon, because he stated it in the beginning\n of his speech exactly that way.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 In Louisiana and in the\n United States no people can be a people en-\n titled to the privileges and blessings of the\n Declaration of Independence unless they are\n such a people as can maintain a government\n and make a treaty? Mr. Jefferson in this\n transaction utterly repudiated the notion that\n the Declaration of Independence, so far as the\n consent of the governed goes, took no account\n of the question whether people were fit for\n self-government or not. I will read what he\n said:\n</p>\n<p>\n The question is not whether a people are\n scattered, no matter if they be educated, no\n matter if they be able to write such a splendid\n protest to the Congress as came up from\n them against the alleged tyranny of Jeffer-\n son\u2019s government, and nothing on the public\n files is finer than their protest. They were\n not children. Many of them were men of\n education. They were men of refinement.\n</p>\n<p>\n When Mr. Jefferson was arraigned for vio-\n lating the Declaration of Independence, for\n putting upon that people down there a gov-\n</p>\n<p>\n ernment which was not in accord with it,\n not consulting them, denounced in one House\n or the other of Congress as being a king \u2014\n I read it once here in debate \u2014 he wrote to\n Dewitt Clinton, December 2, 1803, as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n Although it is acknowledged that our new\n fellow citizens are as yet incapable of self-\n government as children, yet some can not\n bring themselves to suspend its principles\n for a single moment. (Works, vol. 8, p. 283.)\n</p>\n<p>\n That is what Mr. Jefferson thought about\n it. He did not look upon this declaration as\n at all times applicable to all classes of peo-\n ple, without regard to fitness, and the fac-\n ulty of sustaining and administering govern-\n ment.\n</p>\n<p>\n That is one trouble here. We say we will\n put a government in the Philippines. W\u2019e\n will give them participation. We will give\n them a bill of rights. We will fill their land\n with schools. We will give them object les-\n sons in government; but w r e do not think, as\n Jefferson did not think, that this principle\n is applicable without regard to circum-\n stances. We do not belong to the class of\n whom he writes, of men who are willing to\n apply the Declaration at once without re-\n gard to fitness, who think it cannot be sus-\n pended for a minute.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, my distinguished friend as\n a prophet may be correct. We may not be\n able to work out this problem as McKinley\n wanted to work it out, as Taft is laboring to\n work it out, with a measure of self-sacrifice,\n in my judgment, endangering his own life,\n and an adhesion to an ideal that is as patri-\n otic, as liberty-loving, as any which ever en-\n tered a human heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n But w\u2019e think if, when the time comes that\n we have educated the people to appreciate\n government, to sustain it, to take part in it,\n w\u2019e w\u2019ill consult them\u2014 it is we who are car-\n rying about with us in this work as a vital,\n living force the principles of the Declaration\n of Independence, and not those who insist,\n w\u2019ithout regard to circumstances and situa-\n tion, as was insisted as to Louisiana, upon\n putting into practical operation at once\n these maxims.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Jefferson had this to say about it. In\n 1826, writing to John Adams, and I read this\n in its relation to the argument nlade by the\n distinguished Senator as to the Monroe doc-\n trine, although I know he does not refer to\n that, perhaps;\n</p>\n<p>\n I enter into all your doubts as to the event\n of the revolution of South America. They\n will succeed against Spain. But the danger-\n ous enemy \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n And that is true, Mr. President, over yon-\n der \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n But the dangerous enemy is within their\n own breasts. Ignorance and superstition\n will chain their minds and bodies under re-\n ligious and military despotism. I do believe\n it would be better for them to obtain free-\n dom by degrees only \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n He was willing to W\u2019ait on fitness and edu-\n cation. To do otherwise in the Philippines\n is to make of the great Declaration of Inde-\n pendence not a shield of liberty but the in-\n strument of tyranny, not the tyranny of\n Spain, but the tyranny of anarchy, of vio-\n lence and domestic oppression,\n because they would by degrees bring light and\n information, and qualify them to take charge\n of themselves understanding^; with more\n certainty if in the meantime under so much\n control as may keep them at peace with one\n another.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this very diary furnished before the com-\n mittee Aguinaldo says that after independ-\n ence, if they obtain it, he fears will come\n civil war.\n</p>\n<p>\n Surely it is our duty to wish them inde-\n pendence and self government, because they\n wish it themselves, and they have the right.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0047/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0047/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0047/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0047/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0047/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0047.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 862835}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"47\">\n<p>\n 45\n</p>\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n and we none, to choose for themselves, and I\n wish, moreover, that our ideas may be er-\n roneous and theirs prove well founded.\n</p>\n<p>\n Jefferson is speaking of the South Ameri-\n can republics.

When William\n McKinley sent his message over there that\n our purpose was to carry to them the bless-\n ings of liberty, to regard their prejudices,\n to cohsult their habits, to teach them the\n difference between liberty and license, to\n ameliorate and destroy the ancient system\n of Spanish tyranny, does the Senator think\n that he did not speak for the whole Ameri-\n can people?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Mr. President, I have not the\n slightest doubt on that subject.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Was it ever \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar\u2014 The Senator asked me a ques-\n tion.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Well.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar\u2014 I have not the slightest doubt\n of the absolute sincerity and desire of Pres-\n ident McKinley to do what was right and\n just, and of the majority who voted for this\n treaty; not the slightest. I never have said\n anywhere otherwise.

That is\n the proposition.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Mr. President, theoretically\n that, is lofty and beautiful.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 I am glad I have got the Senator\n so far, because things that are lofty and\n beautiful theoretically always work out under\n the government of God of this universe to\n be the best things practically.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Yes; but the negro did not\n find it so with the Government of the United\n States. You cannot deal with peoples or\n with transactions like this upon maxims\n without regard to environment.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 I want to look at what the Sen-\n ator quoted from Mr. Jefferson, because he\n was led into an error.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 In what respect?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Mr. Jefferson was not, as the\n Senator stated, arraigned for violating the\n Declaration of Independence. He was not\n replying to any such charge. Mr. Jefferson\n was arraigned for having done something\n that was not within his constitutional power,\n which he admitted.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 The Senator is mistaken.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Lodge \u2014 He was attacked \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 This is \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Lodge\u2014 I do not know anything about\n what he .expected, but I know, historically,\n that he was attacked.\n</p>\n<p>\n The presiding officer\u2014 Senators must ad-\n dress the Chair.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Mr. Jefferson never admitted\n for a moment that he violated the Declara-\n tion of Independence.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Gallinger\u2014 He was charged with it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I know he did not; but he\n was charged with violating it. He was\n charged with violating it in precisely\n the same particular that the Senator from\n Massachusetts charges us with violating it;\n and he denied it, as we deny it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Mr. Jefferson was wrongfully\n charged and you are rightfully charged.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I never yet have been able\n to say that I was right and that everybody\n who disagreed with me was absolutely\n wrong.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 But the Senator stand up for\n his way, does he not?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I stand up in this matter,\n not for my way alone, but for McKinley\u2019s\n way \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Oh!\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 And the way of the Sena-\n tor ' s colleagues in this chamber who voted\n for the treaty, and the way of the Ameri-\n can people who re-elected President Mc-\n Kinley after all these things had been done.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 A great many people voted for\n McKinley who did not approve of that.\n There were a vast number, as the Senator\n knows very well. This is the first time I\n ever heard it argued in the Senate that the\n question of righteousness was settled by a\n show of hands at a popular election.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Mr. President, I do not say\n that, but I say this: I am not an overly good\n man; but if I thought my party was engaged\n in unrighteousness, if I thought it was a\u00ab-\n</p>\n<p>\n gaged in a policy of dishonor, if I thought it\n was marching forward to trample upon hu-\n man rights, to destroy an aspiration for\n independence, to crush out a liberty-loving\n and well-established republic, so help me,\n God, I would vote against my party, not\n with it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 I suppose the Senator probably\n would have to find some other party to vote\n for that did not indorse the same thing.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 If one party was standing\n by my construction of the Declaration of\n Independence and the other was trampling\n upon it and destroying it I think when it\n became a matter of conscience I would not\n have much hesitation about it.\n</p>\n<p>\n But, Mr. President, we are all trying to do\n the best we can. I know my friend thinks\n his way is right. We think ours is right.\n He loves liberty; so do we. He does not\n admit that we do, but he admits that he\n does.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 My honorable friend utterly\n misstates it. I received in my mail this\n morning from a clergyman the wrathiest\n of leters, denouncing me. He wanted to\n know how I can possibly say as I do; that\n these men are good and honest men. and\n love liberty as well as I do. and with a\n great deal more intelligence than I have,\n when I think this particular measure is\n wrong. Now, Mr. President, we are not born\n into this world to live here on those terms.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Certainly not.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 We have to judge all questions\n of right and wrong and constitutional liberty\n as well as we can through the feeble and\n imperfect light of a feeble and imperfect in-\n tellect, and not to judge other men ' s mo\n tives. We are bound to take that as true.\n But still, when we come to decide what we\n must do, there is nothing but the light of\n our conscience given us to act upon.\n</p>\n<p>\n I admit that the Senator from Wisconsin\n has a far clearer and abler intellectual light\n in his brain than I have in mine. I admit\n that the Senator from Wisconsin is as pure\n a lover of liberty and of justice and that li6\n is as patriotic as any man who lives now or\n ever did live; but are we to act as Senators\n simply by going about and saying who we\n think on the whole is the best and able3t\n man we can find and surrender our judg-\n ments and consciences to him, or are we to\n act on our light? I think that Abraham\n Lincoln, Thomas Jefferson, Daniel Webster\n and Charles Sumner, whom I loved as a\n father and as a leader, took another view\n of these questions; I think they were right;\n yet, whilst I hold myself to be the humblest\n of the members here, and set up and arro-\n gate to myself no superiority over any other\n man, I am still bound to say what I believe\n and to vote what I believe.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Senator says that if he thought his\n party was wrong he would vote against it.\n I think my party is coming out right in this\n matter.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 So do I.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 I thiDk in that party Is the only\n hope, and I think there is a great deal that\n is admirable in this bill, especially with the\n amendments proposed by my colleague (Mr.\n Lodge), but I can find no hope of a righteous\n solution of this question either in following\n the leadership of Mr. Bryan or of his associ-\n ates. I believe that the Senator from Wis-\n consin, as I believe would William McKinley,\n if he had lived, I believe that Theodore\n Roosevelt, who is living now \u2014 as brave and\n honest and liberty-loving a man as ever\n was charged with executive power in this\n country or any other \u2014 are going to work out\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0048/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0048/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0048/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0048/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0048/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0048.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 851690}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"48\">\n<p>\n 46\n</p>\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n this problem; but they will work it out soon-\n er and better if they are made to see that\n the principle upon which they have gone so\n far is vicious.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is nothing in my vision which makes\n me believe that I am to trust the solution of\n this question to a party every other doctrine\n of which I oppose and a large number of\n whom are as responsible as is our party for\n what has happened in the past.

I am willing to bear\n my share of the responsibility. I voted to\n take that cession. The Senator voted against\n it. I have never anywhere in the world crit-\n icised him for that, or permitted any mem-\n ber of any political party to criticise him\n for that without denouncing such criticism.\n I voted against the Bacon resolution for the\n reason w ' hich I gave. The Senator voted for\n it; but that he did so in absolute good con-\n science, no one can deny. I voted for the\n Army bill to send troops to the Philippines.\n The Senator voted against it. He has, as I\n have said on the floor of this Senate more\n than once in discussing this subject, been\n consistent in his votes. But, Mr. President,\n I will not permit it, without protest \u2014 for to\n do so would not be just \u2014 to be said here or\n anywhere else that those of us who have\n cast these votes are responsible for the\n waste of treasure and the w ' aste of precious\n blood of our own people, the terrible loss of\n life, the cruelties of w r ar and the cruelties\n that ought not to pertain to war in the Phil-\n ippines. It is not true.\n</p>\n<p>\n I believe, as solemnly as I ever believed\n anything in my life, that if, after the ratifi-\n cation of the treaty, if after the majority in\n this country had established a policy, we\n had gone on, our troops at the front, with-\n out the words of encouragement to the en-\n emy, which have been uttered here and else-\n where, there wmuld have been infinitely less\n loss of life, less w ' aste of money, less of the\n cruelty of war; and I believe to-day if it\n were not for the curse of politics \u2014 I do not\n say that as to one side more than the other;\n I believe if, on this subject, which is so diffi-\n cult and w ' hich belongs to all the people, we\n</p>\n<p>\n could work together without division on po-\n litical lines, trying to perfect legislation-\n trying to help each other do the best to v\n bring the government forward in this work\n upon w ' hich we are started and from which\n we cannot now retreat in honor or in de-\n cency, we would save loss of life, and we\n would bring much more quickly to the Fili-\n pinos that which the Senator from Massa-\n chusetts and al of us desire.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Senator is right, in my belief, in his\n faith in the ultimate result of the policy of\n the Republican party; he is right in his\n belief that we mean well by that peo-\n ple; he is right in his faith in\n the American people, that when the\n time comes that those people are fit for self\n government over there our people will de-\n cide to give it to them; but I think the Sen-\n ator is wrong in his idea \u2014 it is an honest\n difference of opinion, of course \u2014 that if to-\n day, regardless of conditions, we should pro-\n ceed upon the maxim of Jefferson and have\n regard to that mainly, there would come\n safety, or peace, or any good thing to the\n Filipinos.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, the Senator from Massa-\n chusetts said in his speech \u2014 and I was sur-\n prised at it \u2014 that almost the only thing w r e\n have done there \u201chas been to get some few\n thousand children actually at school in the\n whole Philippine dominion,\u201d but that we had\n killed a great many more parents than we\n had enrolled scholars. I do not know how\n many Filipinos w T e have killed, and God only\n knows how ' many Filipinos Aguinaldo and the\n Katipunan have killed. The evidence is over-\n whelming that their policy, in order to avert\n friendship for us, has been one of assassina-\n tion and bloodshed. We have heard of some\n pitiful and pathetic cases. But is the Sen-\n ator right as to what we have done for\n them?\n</p>\n<p>\n I have a letter from a teacher over there\n \u2014 I do not often refer in debate to letters\u2014\n but the letter was written by a noble man,\n who believes in the possibilities of develop-\n ment in the Filipinos, just as Governor Tate\n does, and just as I do on the evidence, in\n which letter he states that 72 of the police\n force in the city come every night to his\n school to receive instruction in English. Have\n we done nothing in the Philippines of which\n w ' e ought to be proud? Have we done noth-\n ing in the Philippines which gives nothing\n of hope for vast blessings to that people?\n</p>\n<p>\n Why, Mr. President, we have carried to\n them incorruptible courts of justice. They\n are represented in the Supreme Court; they\n are represented in the courts of first in-\n stance; they are governors of the provinces;\n they are presidentes of the municipalities.\n Does that all mean nothing? They have\n never before had any participation in govern-\n ment. They are represented in the commis-\n sion, the law-making power for the time\n being.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have not been fighting for sovereignty\n over there. We obtained that by the treaty.\n We have been fighting against ah attempt to\n oust us, not for lucre, not for \u201cnuggets of\n gold,\u201d but to enable us to carry forward the\n work of pacification and upbuilding. We\n have put in force there the bill of rights and\n the habeas corpus. There is testimony be-\n fore the committee that one woman, an\n educated woman of large property in Manila,\n was taken out of prison by a writ of habeas\n corpus, who had been confined there for\n twelve years without trial, or even being in-\n formed of the charge against her, the Span-\n ish government in the meantime occupying\n her property and taking the rents and profits.\n They have been under the curse of ladronism\n</p>\n<p>\n for three hundred years, a terrible weapon\n of tyranny to that people in almost every\n province. We have almost driven that away.\n Those people have been subject to the feu-\n dalism that kills ambition and hope in the\n hearts of the peasantry.\n</p>\n<p>\n They say ihese men are lazy; but they have\n had little motive for being anything but lazy.\n They have been slaves, Mr. President. When\n they wanted men to work they did not seek\n the men who were to work. They asked the\n presidente for 200, for 300, or for 400 men \u2014\n that was always the way in the past \u2014 and he\n would send them, he would fix the pay, he\n would collect the pay, and he would give to\n the men who earned it just what he thought\n they should have \u2014 a system of slavery. In\n spite of resistance and war and its distrac-\n tions we have given them more of liberty\n and security and good government than they\n have had in their existence.\n</p>\n<p>\n General Hughes has testified that he wanted\n 250 men, I think it was, and that he called\n upon the presidente for them. The men came\n the next morning. They moved along during\n the day. At night he called every one of\n them up, and paid him his day\u2019s wages in\n change. The first time in their lives these\n men found an object lesson from us that they\n were free, that they owned their own labor\n and the wages of their toil, and the next day\n a great number came for work. They had\n learned something. So we are rescuing that\n people from feudalism; we are teaching them\n that they are free, as I said a moment ago,\n and General Hughes has testified, and others\n also, that that once established there will\n be no trouble in the Philippine Archipelago,\n because the peasant class will keep every-\n thing right.\n</p>\n<p>\n Are we bringing nothing to the Philippines\n but cruelty, atrocity, bloodshed, and crime?\n Do they hate us? Are these governors all\n falsifiers when they send report after re-\n port to us giving in detail the conditions\n in their provinces, and bearing testimony to\n the friendliness of the people and their de-\n sire for peace. When Senators here were de-\n nouncing the Army and attempting to show\n that cruelties and atrocities have been gen-\n eral in the archipelago, there were presented\n at the desk, and more have come since, peti-\n tions from eeventy-odd places, of presidentes\n and governing bodies there, asking that these\n soldiers be retained there to piotect the peo-\n ple against ladrones and against the unlaw-\n ful acts of the insurrectos. Does that all go\n for nothing?\n</p>\n<p>\n General Chaffee, who has been so bitterly\n denounced here by a portion of the minority,\n in his personal letter to General Hughes, of\n September 30, 1901, in speaking of the senti-\n ment of the people in the islands, says:\n</p>\n<p>\n Women aod children are probably friendly\n toward us, but as a rule I would not trust\n 50 per cent, of the male population.\n</p>\n<p>\n This may be fairly taken as a fact as to the\n women and children\u2014 and he thinks it also\n true, evidently, of approximately half of the\n male adults. And it is a fact full of hope-\n ful significance and one that will bear rich\n fruit for peace and for the good of the Fili-\n pinos and for lis. The Filipinos are shown\n to us to be a domestic people. Nowhere in\n the world is the wife a truer wife than in the.\n Philippines; nowhere is there greater hos-\n pitality in the home; nowhere is the child\n better loved than in the Philippine home. If\n the women and children are friendly to us,\n who can doubt that their influence in the\n homes will bear great results?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, I do not intend to go into\n this testimony about the Army, but I have\n read it and I have gone through all these\n</p>\n<p>\n L\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0049/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0049/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0049/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0049/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0049/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0049.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 1046705}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"49\">\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 47\n</p>\n<p>\n printed o-rders and I do not find one among\n them, including Smith ' s written orders, not\n justified in the circumstances by the rules of\n civilized warfare. I do not find one of them\n that is out of harmony with General Order\n No. 100, issued in Lincoln\u2019s day and still in\n force. The concentration order of General\n Bell w r as a wise order. It subserved an en-\n tirely lawful purpose in war. It was for the\n protection of our soldiers, but it was also\n for the protection of the friendly Filipino\n or any Filipino who came within our lines.\n It was lawful to protect our soldiers. It was\n lawful \u2014 and it was not only lawful, but a\n duty as solemn as ever rested upon a people\n or an army \u2014 to protect in every possible\n way, compatible with the rules of civilized\n warfare, those Filipinos who were friendly\n to us; and it was lawful also to devastate,\n in order to destroy the sustenance of an\n enemy preying upon the people, forcing con-\n tributions and subsistence from them, and\n shooting down from ambush our men.\n</p>\n<p>\n The attempt to treat the concentration in\n the Philippines as a parallel in infamy with\n the reconcentrado policy of Weyler in Cuba\n is not only found to be without support in\n the evidence, but to be disproved. Here is\n a description of the concentration camps in\n Cuba;\n</p>\n<p>\n The helpless people were allotted ground\n near the towns, almost invariably in low\n lying, swampy, and malarious places. The\n Spanish residents would not be burdened\n with them and generally cared not how soon\n they died. They were concentrated in great-\n est numbers where the accommodations were\n least adequate, as if extermination were the\n main object. There was nothing for them to\n do and there was less and less for them to\n eat, and finally they stretched out upon the\n damp ground, gazing vacantly before them\n as the weary days dragged by. Mothers lay\n listless with dead babies in their arms. The\n quick and the dead lay side by side till the\n latter were taken out and thrown into the\n dead carts and carried off into the country,\n where lay the half buried bodies of hundreds\n of victims of this system of warfare. The\n huts of these people were jammed together\n in rows, with but a few inches of space be-\n tween, and the ground was covered with filth.\n Diseases of malignant types claimed their\n victims everywhere and every day. There\n was no medical attendance; it was fortunate\n if there were half rations. In the different\n stations of concentration there were esti-\n mated to be over 400,000 of these helpless\n people, and by the summer of 1897 the death\n rate had become terrible. The beautiful\n island was a plague spot upon earth.\n</p>\n<p>\n Is any one willing to believe that this de-\n scribes concentration by our army in the\n Philippines? Is it pretended that Filipinos\n within the lines of concentration were\n starved or neglected?\n</p>\n<p>\n I -will not take the time to read, but I\n insert the following from the report of the\n chief commissary of the Philippines, March\n 17, 1902, as to the people in the concentra-\n tion camps there:\n</p>\n<p>\n We are getting along very nicely in sup-\n plying rice to the natives who are concen-\n trated in Batangas and Laguna provinces.\n Last week, in company with General Wheat-\n on, I visited Binan, Colamba, Santo Tomas,\n Tananan and Lipa, and the way the con-\n centration of the natives is carried out up\n there is a credit to the United States Army.\n Generals Wheaton and Bell both deserve\n a great deal, of credit.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u25a0 Instead of being called \u2019\u2018camps of concen-\n tration \" the proper name would be \" camps\n of instruction and sanitation.\u201d The differ-\n ent barrios, or little villages, are gathered\u2014\n each barrio\u2014 on a street or avenue by itself.\n Then these different avenues are separated\n by about 200 feet from their back yards,\n where they do their cooking, burn up the\n offal, etc. They have their fire brigades,\n armed with buckets of bamboo about 6 or 8\n feet long. These are grouped on racks every\n 200 or 300 feet, and every house is required\n</p>\n<p>\n to keep two of these filled at night. The\n houses are about as comfortable as those\n they were required to vacate. They all have\n an abundance of food, either collected by\n themselves or furnished by the military au-\n thorities.\n</p>\n<p>\n The inhabitants are most respectful and\n very cheerful looking. They all have the\n appearance of being well fed. No indica-\n tions of sulleuness or discontent. Their herds\n are taken out to graze, and I really think,\n outside of a military standpoint, the natives\n will be decidedly improved by virtue of hav-\n ing lived in these well regulated camps of\n instruction and sanitation. The very poor\n are made better off in every way than they\n ever were before, and they are subject by\n the military to less tyranny than formerly\n by the headmen. From a military stand-\n point, of course, the concentration has been\n most valuable and has resulted in bringing\n in nearly every gun and every insurgent be-\n hind it who has not fled to the province of\n Cavite and Tayabas, which are under the\n control of the civil government.\n</p>\n<p>\n General Hughes testified upon the subject\n as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n I know it as it is practiced there. It is\n a misnomer to call it a policy of concentra-\n tion, because the world has learned to put\n a significant meaning to that word. The\n policy as practiced in the Philippines has\n no element of cruelty in it. It is simply an\n order to the inhabitants of a particular lo-\n cality to move from one portion to another,\n and there they reside and carry on their\n operations and business. If the locality into\n which they have moved does not afford them\n ample support, the United States govern-\n ment provides them with food and shelter.\n The people are pleased with it, because they\n are permitted to lead an easy life; much\n easier than at home. There is no element\n of punishment or deprivation. They are\n simply requested to come into a certain dis-\n trict.\n</p>\n<p>\n They are moved out of danger, then, for\n their own benefit?\n</p>\n<p>\n Exactly; because those who are inclined\n to favor the Americans are assailed by the\n ladrones or the rebels, and unless they came\n within the lines of the American Army they\n would be compelled to pay tribute to the in-\n surgents. These people largely accept this\n concentration, as it is practiced, as a relief\n instead of a punishment. It is a relief from\n a punishment inflicted upon them by the in-\n surgents, with whom they have no sym-\n pathy.\n</p>\n<p>\n Professor Barrows testified as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n Senator Beveridge\u2014 You were pretty well\n over the Island of Luzon, as I judge from\n your answers to questions, particularly in\n those provinces going northward from\n Manila to the north portion of the island.\n Did you observe in the prosecution of your\n work the operation at any point of the re-\n concentration policy, of which so much has\n been sa\u00ab? If you did, tell the committee\n what it was with reference to this cruelty\n or the reverse. Describe it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Barrows \u2014 I was in one province which\n was reconcentrado, and I think I visited all\n but one town in the province. I think the\n matter has been very greatly misunderstood.\n In this case the population was in no sense\n confined within barriers inimical to its well\n being. There was no barbed wire fence busi-\n ness at all. They were simply required to\n dwell and to work along a great cultivated\n stretch which made up the arable land of\n the province, within a certain distance of a\n military road that traversed it. They had to\n stay there. They could not go out to the\n mountains. They could not take to the\n woods. Of course within those limits they\n could pass, and pass for miles; harvest their\n rice, fish, do anything they wanted to do;\n but they must stay in the territory capable\n of patrol by the military forces.\n</p>\n<p>\n Senator Beveridge \u2014 But within those limits\n their personal action was free?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Barrows \u2014 Yes, sir.\n</p>\n<p>\n Senator D ' etrich\u2014 There was no starvation?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Barrows \u2014 No, sir; that was impossible.\n</p>\n<p>\n Senator Beveridge \u2014 Did you observe any\n cruelties in those lines?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Barrows \u2014 None whatever.\n</p>\n<p>\n Senator Beveridge\u2014 It is just as you have\n described it? *\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Barrows \u2014 Yes, sir. For example, after\n the rice was cut they had to bring it in the\n vicinity of this military road and stack it\n there and thrash it there and harvest if\n there. They could not do as they had been\n doing \u2014 stack it way out in the country where\n the insurgents could come in and carry It off.\n It was simply a measure adopted to prevent\n the contribution to the insurgent cause of\n supplies and the rendering to it of assist-\n ance in many ways by a population that was\n supposedly and professedly peaceful.\n</p>\n<p>\n And on May 5 General Chaffee telegraphed\n that a month prior natives of Laguna Prov-\n ince, collected under orders of General Bell,\n had been allowed to return home, and that\n in Batangas Province, Luzon, the last of the\n natives were relieved of all army surveil-\n lance April 16.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is said that General Smith issued an or-\n der to \" kill and burn\u201d \u2014 to kill all males over\n 10 years of age, whether in arms or not. I\n do not know whether he gave such an order\n or not. It is said that if he did it was oral\n and after the slaughter at Balingiga. If he\n did, nothing on earth, so far as I know,\n could justify it, and I have yet to hear any\n one defend it; but I have a sort of tender-\n ness in my heart for an absent man who is\n accused. I have been bred to think it un-\n fair to try a, man and condemn him at the\n bar of public opinion, or otherwise, upon\n ex parte testimony when he is absent, and I\n reserve, as I think it my duty to do, my\n Judgment upon General Smith until I know\n the facts.\n</p>\n<p>\n One thing is certain, there is no evidence\n here that it ever was carried out; there is no\n evidence here that Major Waller and his men\n shot a boy over 10 years of age or under 10\n years of age; there is no evidence here that\n they killed a woman or a child, or shot\n any one except those in arms against us,\n save the men whom he executed; and that\n question is yet to be tried at the bar of pub-\n lic opinion when the evidence is all in and\n when Waller can be heard.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is an utterly unjust thing, Mr. Presi-\n dent, even if General Smith gave that horri-\n ble order just as it is said he did, for Sen-\n ators to use that as evidencing the standard\n of the Army in the Philippines. If I had the\n time to read them I would show from\n speeches made on the other side that a sys-\n tematic attempt has been made to put upon\n that standard the general conduct of the\n Army in the archipelago.\n</p>\n<p>\n There were many harsh orders Issued dur-\n ing the Civil War. There was a great deal\n that was bitter on both sides. General Grant\n instructed General Sheridan, if the rebellion\n continued, to make of the Shenadoah Valley\n a barren waste. General Grant instructed\n Sheridan, if he caught Mosby\u2019s men, to\n hang them without trial. General Grant in-\n structed Sheridan to seize every male under\n 50 years of age able to bear arms and hold\n them as citizen prisoners within a range of\n territory. Men were executed during that\n war many times under the dreadful law of\n retaliation. It is civilized warfare, but it is\n pathetic.\n</p>\n<p>\n General Sterling Price turned Major Wilson\n and five Union soldiers over to Tim Reeves\n and his guerrillas to be executed, and they\n were executed.\n</p>\n<p>\n General Rosecrans, that brave old soldier,\n whom we laid away the other day at Ar-\n lington, where his earthly home will forever\n be, and where it ought to be, among his\n comrades, ordered the execution, in retalia-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0050/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0050/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0050/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0050/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0050/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0050.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 816306}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"50\">\n<p>\n 48\n</p>\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n tion, of six Confederate soldiers, and they\n \u25a0were drawn by lot and executed.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Senator from-Utah, Mr. Rawlins, con-\n demned that in bitter, biting, vicious lan-\n guage in Bell\u2019s order, which was mainly a\n threat.

Great as the provocation has\n been in dealing with foes who habitually\n resort to treachery, jnurder and torture\n against our men. nothing can justify, or\n will be held to justify, the use of torture or\n inhuman conduct of any kind on the part\n of the American Army.\n</p>\n<p>\n I object not to this investigation so much;\n I do not object at all to the facts coming\n before the public that the water cure has\n been administered In the Philippines, al-\n</p>\n<p>\n though it is grossly exaggerated, in my\n judgment. I think it is a good thing, if it\n happened at all, that the country should\n quickly know it, because we are establishing\n a civil government, Mr. President.\n</p>\n<p>\n I do not doubt that the military authori-\n ties have not taken altogether kindly to the\n civil government. I do not believe that as\n a rule they could maintain and cultivate as\n friendly relations with the natives as could\n the civil government. But officers and men\n must stay there, and they cannot be ad-\n vised one moment .too soon, in my judg-\n ment, what the general orders issued from\n the beginning advised them (some of which I\n append), that we are not there as tyrants;\n that we are ' not there for looting; that we\n are not there to violate the rules of civil-\n ized warfare; that we are not there to in-\n sult, belittle, or anger the inhabitants. We\n are there to treat them kindly. We are\n there to win their confidence. We are there\n to protect them. We are there to help them.\n It is now known, and if It were needed I\n am glad it has come so soon, from the\n highest authority, that nothing of the kind\n will be tolerated on the part of the Ameri-\n can Army.\n</p>\n<p>\n But, Mr. President, for one I protest\n against the spirit in which this investiga-\n tion has been conducted and in which the\n matter has been exploited before the Sen-\n ate. Senators have been a little too ready,\n in my judgment, to seize upon improbable\n tales and put them before the country. The\n story, as stated by one man, that a hundred\n and sixty Filipinos had had administered to\n them the water cure, and all but twenty-\n six had died, turns out to be untrue.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 Does the Senator say that\n that matter was brought out by the investi-\n gation conducted by any committee here?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I did not say it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack\u2014 The Senator spoke of it in\n the connection in which he was deprecating\n the spirit in which the investigation is be-\n ing conducted.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I did not say that. I spoke\n of the spirit in which the investigation had\n been conducted and the exploitation which\n had been made on the floor of the Senate\n of the alleged atrocities in the Philippines.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack\u2014 I did not remember that.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 That statement was made.\n Everybody knows \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Teller\u2014 Will the Senator allow me to\n interrupt him?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 Certainly. \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Teller \u2014 When I was making some re-\n marks on the first bill before the Senate on\n this subject, I read that as published news-\n paper statement.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I know it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Teller \u2014 I said that it deserved the at-\n tention of the committee.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 Yes, sir; that is right.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Teller \u2014 It had been published probably\n in a hundred newspapers before it appeared\n in the Senate.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 The Senator will find that in\n the speech which I made some time ago I\n acquitted him of making that charge against\n the Army, but it went to the world and it\n turns out that it was not true.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Teller \u2014 It had gone to the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Yes; I know.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Teller \u2014 That is why I brought it before\n the Senate.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Yes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Teller \u2014 I said for the credit of the\n Army it was necessary we should know\n whether it was true or not.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 Then there was a charge read\n here that our troops over there had com-\n pelled a thousand Filipino prisoners to dig\n their own graves and then had shot them in\n files to fall In the graves they had dug. That\n is exploded.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 I do not understand exactly\n what the Senator means by saying it is ex-\n ploded.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 What would the Senator\n mean by saying that it is not exploded?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack\u2014 I say that the letter from the\n soldier detailing those circumstances was\n written.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 That may be.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 But whether or not the state-\n ment was true has not been proved or dis-\n proved.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Written to whom?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 To the father of the young\n man who w r rote it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 The Senator from Tennessee\n says that such a statement was written to\n the father, and the father says it never was.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 I will say to the Senator from\n Wisconsin that the proof is undoubted that\n that letter was written and a copy of it or\n the substance of the letter was given by the\n father of the man who wrote it to a news-\n paper. If the Philippine Committee will per-\n mit us to summon that man we will prove\n that he did receive such a letter.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Rawlins and Mr. McLaurin of Missis-\n sippi addressed the chair.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Foraker \u2014 Will the Senator from Wis-\n consin allow me?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 We ask to have the recip-\n ient of the alleged letter summoned, and we\n are ready to prove that he did receive the let-\n tr. But the committee voted not to receive\n the testimony.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 That is the spirit of which I\n complain \u2014 \u201cWe are ready to prove.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 We are ready to prov e \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Who are we?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 I mean the minority of the\n committee.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 That is right.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 We are ready to prove it if\n the majority of the committee will allow the\n evidence to come before them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Rawlins \u2014 Mr. President\n</p>\n<p>\n The Presiding Ocffler \u2014 Does the Senator\n from Wisconsin yield to the Senator from\n Utah, who first addressed the chair?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Certainly.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Rawlins \u2014 I should not interfere in this\n debate except that the question on compell-\n ing men to dig their own graves seems to be\n involved, and I desire to invite the attention\n of the Senator from Wisconsin to a report\n signed by an American officer, J. G. Living-\n ston, bearing date January 7, 1902. Living-\n ston is the governor of Sorsegon, the place\n where it was alleged that a thousand prison-\n ers had been compelled to dig their own\n graves.\n</p>\n<p>\n I do not find in this report that a thousand\n prisoners were required to dig their own\n graves and afterward were shot and burled\n in them, but I do find in this report that a\n presidente or mayor of a town and a police-\n man, whom the governor reports were inno-\n cent, were first tortured, subsequently taken\n out and compelled to dig their own graves,\n and afterward shot and buried in them.

He denied ab-\n solutely that there was any truth in the\n story. That is my recollection of it, and I\n never have heard the story referred to since.\n I supposed, to employ the language used by\n the Senator from Wisconsin, that it had\n been exploded. I did not suppose it w r ould\n ever be repeated. I see that the junior Sen-\n ator from Massachusetts (Mr. Lodge) is now\n in the Chamber. He, no doubt, will have a\n positive recollection on the subject.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar\u2014 I rose a little while ago to say\n that I had myself taken some pains to\n inquire into the matter, as the information\n purported to come from the neighborhood\n where I dwell, and I am bound in all fair-\n ness to say that I do not believe there is the\n slightest foundation for such a story.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Foraker \u2014 The junior Senator from\n Massachusetts can, perhaps, inform us with\n certainty whether or not there has been\n a contradiction published by the father.\n</p>\n<p>\n ' Mr. Lodge \u2014 I do not want to break in on\n the Senator from Wisconsin, but there was\n a letter forwarded, printed in the record\n of the committee hearings, from the Rev.\n Mr. Walker, in which he said that the news-\n paper account entirely misrepresented the\n only letter he had received from his son.\n The letter I cannot repeat verbally, but it\n is in the record and I have sent for it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack\u2014 I do not want to be misun-\n derstood in this matter, if the Senator from\n Wisconsin will yield to me.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 Certainly.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack\u2014 I want to say myself that I\n have believed the statement itself was at\n least a gross exaggeration. I do not believe It\n is possible that the statement as narrated\n can be true, but that the letter was written\n by the soldier and received by his father is\n beyond the question of a doubt. That fact\n can be proved, if it is a matter of importance\n if the committee will permit us to bring the\n testimony before us. Up to this time it has\n refused to do so.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Lodge \u2014 There is no doubt that the sol-\n dier wrote the letter to his father. The\n father said the story, as represented in the\n papers, was not correct. The moment it ap-\n</p>\n<p>\n peared in the newspaper the War Department\n cabled to General Chaffee to make immediate\n investigation and to question the soldier him-\n self and investigate all that was charged in\n the letter. That is the only way of getting\n at the direct testimony, and that i3 now in\n process.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 Of course the soldier, what-\n ever he may have said, will promptly re-\n pudiate it, as every soldier in the Philippine\n Islands has been required and compelled to\n do.\n</p>\n<p>\n Several Senators \u2014 Oh!\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I think that is an attack on\n the Army and the Administration and every-\n body else. What does the senator mean by\n that? What evidence has he of that?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 I will give the evidence later.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 Will the Senator from Wisconsin\n allow me? I inquired into this matter pretty\n carefully. I think I ought to state that not\n only did the father deny having received a\n iettre with any such contents, but it turned\n out by the record that the soldier was not\n at the place where it was alleged he located\n the transaction at the time, but was on serv-\n ice at a distant place.\n</p>\n<p>\n If the charge were true, I would not of\n courge hold it back, but I am bound in all\n fairness to say that I do not believe there is\n the slightest ground for this charge.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 I desire to say that I thor-\n oughly agree with the Senator from Massa-\n chusetts. My only point was that the Sena-\n tor from Washington had brought the matter\n before the Senate and established the fact\n that such a letter had been written. That\n the letter was written I do not think there is\n the shadow of a doubt. I do not believe the\n charge in the letter is true, and I do not\n believe it is possible that it can be true.\n Ihere may have been some foundation for it,\n but I think that the letter is so wild in its\n exaggeration that it is simply impossible.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Foraker \u2014 May I inquire of the Senator\n from Tennessee what he had in mind when\n he informed the Senate a few moments ago\n that he did not understand the story had ever\n been exploded?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 I will say it never has been\n disproved.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Foraker \u2014 The Senator has simply be-\n come satisfied that there is no truth in it?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack\u2014 I was satisfied from the\n time the story was first published that there\n was absolutely no truth in it; that . is, I\n was satisfied that, while there may have been\n some foundation for it, the story to its full\n extent could not be true. I never did be-\n lieve it and do not believe it now.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Foraker \u2014 Does the Senator imagine\n that anybody else in the Senate now be-\n lieves any such story?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 Oh, well, I will not answer\n for anybody else.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I will wait for the \u201cother\n side\u201d of the case presented by the Senator.\n In order that I may quit the floor at the\n earliest possible moment, which I desire to\n do, I ask that I may put in the Record cop-\n ies of some of those orders which were is-\n sued in. the Philippines, and also one or two\n other papers to which I have referred, which\n I do not care to take the time to read.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Presiding Officer \u2014 If there is no ob-\n jection, that order will be made.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Mr. President, I spoke of the\n spirit of this investigation. I was led to do\n that by reading the testimony, the questions,\n and I am forced to the conclusion, and with\n pain, too, Mr. President, that there are\n \" sides\u201d in this investigation of the Army. 1\n was not at all surprised when the Senator\n</p>\n<p>\n from Tennessee (Mr. Carmack) said: \u201cGive\n us a chance and we will prove it.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n I do not like an investigation involving the\n honor of soldiers in the Philippines or in-\n volving the honor of soldiers who are dtead\n and buried in the Philippines conducted in a\n spirit of partisanship or upon ex parte testi-\n mony. I note one thing in all this attack\n upon the Army, that on the Democratic side\n of this Chamber not more than two or three\n of the Senators who fought in the Confeder-\n acy, gallant, chivalrous men, men who\n learned what war is, at its best, who know\n how it inflames the passions of men, who\n know how difficult it is to restrain some-\n times in active operations the indignation\n and wish among soldiers for retaliation, have\n risen here to join in this condemnation of\n the Army. They remember the war for the\n Union. They know what happened on their\n side; they know what happened on ours.\n They know that no order has been issued in\n the Philippines, unless perhaps this alleged\n verbal order of Smith, which does not find\n its counterpart on both sides over and over\n again during the war for the Union.\n</p>\n<p>\n I must make one exception in the minority\n of the committee. I cannot apply what I\n have said of the committee minority to the\n Senator from Idaho (Mr. Dubois). I wish I\n could not say it of any senator on the com-\n mittee. I do not recall a question put by the\n minority calculated to elicit the whole truth\n or to elicit a fact which would tend to vindi-\n cate the honor of the Army in the Philip-\n pines. There is evidence there, of course,\n that the water cure was administered. There\n is evidence that it was administered to eleven\n or twelve men at one time, men who con-\n fessed that they had roasted Sergeant\n O\u2019Hearn. While it was indefensible, there\n is no evidence that it injured any one of\n the men to whom it was administered.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, Mr. President, I do not, nor does any\n man on this side, approve of it or defend it;\n it violated the rules of civilized warfare, but\n I fancy \u2014 I cannot help it \u2014 that when senators\n detail it in the campaign in which they are\n about to enter and call the attention of the\n people to it, the people will regret it, but\n they will not forget the environment. They\n will not forget that Aguinaldo and his army\n had long before disappeared; that the army,\n upon an order made by him, had broken into\n guerrilla bands; that they had leftd aside their\n uniforms and acted as presidentes and other\n civil officials; that they took the character\n of amigos and protested their friendship for\n the American government and its sway in\n the Philippines, and that under cover of that\n friendship there was hostility, treachery, as-\n sassination and torture:\n</p>\n<p>\n There were 480 p < ^ts in those islands, most\n of them under the command of subordinate\n officers \u2014 some of them under the command of\n sergeants and corporals \u2014 and these little\n bands of soldiers dwelt in an atmosphere of\n treachery. The people will not forget that\n the men of that company, the Twenty-sixth,\n who under the leadership, it is said, of Cap-\n tain Glenn, gave the water cure to those\n Filipinos, were mourning the loss of a brave\n and an admirable soldier. They will not for-\n get that they already knew that he had been\n destroyed \u2014 destroyed, Mr. President, not\n quickly, but tortured, not by the water cure f\n which does not kill, but tortured slowly in\n the most diabolical and fiendish way to death.\n</p>\n<p>\n While you picture to the people the Fili-\n pinos receiving the water cure, rising from\n it and walking away, I tell you, gentlemen\n of the minority, who think an attack upon\n the Army if. good policy, there is nobody in\n this land who listens to you who will not\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0052/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0052/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0052/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0052/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0052/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0052.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 823405}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"52\">\n<p>\n 50\n</p>\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n see in the background Sergeant O\u2019Hearn tied\n to a tree and -with agonized face being hour\n after hour burned slowly to death, and as the\n sun went down boloed and buried.

He testified to our use of the dum-\n dum bullet. Is that believed by the commit-\n tee? He testified to acts of dishonor, inde-\n cency, shame, Mr. President, upon the part\n of certain officers over there \u2014 acts the very\n mention of which would carry pain into the\n home over here of those officers, wound the\n heart of the wife, and bring the olush of\n shame to the cheeks of the children and the\n accused far away, and defenseless for the\n time. Is that believed now to be true?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Dubois \u2014 Mr. President\n</p>\n<p>\n The Presiding Officer-\u2014 Does the Senator\n from Wisconsin yield to the Senator from\n Idaho?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Certainly.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Dubois \u2014 I know that the Senator from\n Wisconsin would not be unjust.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 I do not mean to be.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Dubois \u2014 The minority of the commit-\n tee insisted that the witness should not be\n allowed to give the testimony which he was\n giving. The majority of the committee\n wrung it from him under protest and over\n the protest of the minority of the commit-\n tee.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I know of no man who would\n be less willing to do an unjust thing than\n the Senator from Idaho, but my recollection\n Is that the testimony was given and went to\n the press. Am I wrong about it?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Dubois \u2014 It was given, but over the\n</p>\n<p>\n protest of the minority. When the witness\n started to give this testimony we objected\n that he had no right to give such testimony,\n but the majority of the committee insisted\n upon his giving it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. McLaurin of Mississippi \u2014 It was ob-\n jected to because it was hearsay.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Dubois\u2014 Because it was hearsay.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Lodge\u2014 Will the Senator from Wis-\n consin allow me?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 Certainly.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Lodge\u2014 The first statement to which\n the Senator from Idaho refers was a volun-\n teer statement. The witness was asked\n about the water cure. He said he had\n witnessed a case at Igbaras, a case already\n testified to. Subsequently it appeared that\n he was not at Igbaras at the time. He broke\n off from that and volunteered a statement\n as to the conduct of certain officers w T ho\n were in Igbaras at the time. The minority\n asked to have that statement stricken from\n the record. I was determined, believing\n that the man was testifying falsely, to have\n it go in the record and have it refuted. I\n was determined that at least some officers\n of the United States should have the op-\n portunity to meet the foul attacks that were\n being made on them in that committee\n room, and I knew if it was stricken from\n the record that man\u2019s statement, in some\n form or other, would go out, for it was\n already a part of an interview published in\n a New York newspaper.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Dubois\u2014 That is all I wanted to say,\n that the majority, for purposes of their\n own, insisted on this testimony being in,\n and the minority did not want it, and that\n is the only \u25a0witness whose testimony has\n been impeached.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 Mr. President, I simply\n want to say that I did not object to the\n action of the chairman of the committee or\n to the majority of the committee in insist-\n ing that this testimony should be made a\n part of the record if they chose to do so.\n Still I am satisfied that if the matter had\n been excluded it never would have gone to\n the press, because I know matters which\n have occurred in that committee in testi-\n mony never have gone to the press upon the\n request of representatives of the majority.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Lodge \u2014 It was in the press already,\n the Senator shows, as an interview.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 Well, you could have kept it\n out of the press so far as it was not in the\n press. I merely wanted to say that I am en-\n tirely sattefied with the action of the com-\n mittee. The statement was made upon hear-\n say. I did not believe then and I do not\n believe now that there is one word of truth\n in the statement of the witness. But I do\n want to protest against any attempt to make\n the testimony of this witness a standard by\n which the testimony of every other witness\n shall be judged.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 I think the Senator is right\n about that.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 And if the Senator from\n Wisconsin is citing the testimony of this wit-\n ness as characteristic of the testimony that\n has been brought before the committee, I\n want him to say if any other witness who\n has been brought before the committee has\n uttered one single word that is not the truth,\n and if so, what is the name of the witness\n and what is the testimony that is falsely\n sworn to? I say the testimony related by this\n witness upon hearsay is false, and I give no\n credence whatever to his testimony. I\n think the chairman of the committee acted\n properly, if he chose to do so, in insisting\n that the testimony should be refuted, inas-\n</p>\n<p>\n much as it had already gone to the press of\n the country.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Now, Mr. President, I am\n anxious more than anything else to be\n through. I do not think it would be fair to\n mention this case as a standard at all for the\n conduct of the committee on either side, and\n I do not do it for that purpose. I have been\n impressed with the notion that it is a grossly\n unfair thing, that it is out of harmony with\n the first principles of decency and justice to\n try army officers, or any other men, while\n they are 8,000 miles away. The way to im-\n peach the honor of a soldier in the Phil-\n ippines is not before a committee of the Sen-\n ate. I do not believe in trying a man in his\n absence. And if there is one man above\n another whose word I do not trust about an\n officer under whom he served it is the fellow\n who came home mad about his rations.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack\u2014 The only man who com-\n plained about his rations that I am aware\n of was a man who was brought before the\n committee upon the request and summons\n of the chairman of the committee, the Senator\n from Massachusetts.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 I am not talking about who\n calls them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Beveridge\u2014 Will the Senator excuse\n me?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 Certainly.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Beveridge \u2014 The recollection of the Sen-\n ator from Tennessee is defective. The whole\n testimony of Mr. O\u2019Brien, who was summoned\n at the request of the Senator from Tennessee,\n was to the effect that his rations were most\n defective. He talked about carabao soup, or\n something of that kind, and said constantly\n that his officers were thieves because he did\n net get enough to eat. The Senator remem-\n bers that testimony.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Carmack \u2014 There was also the testimony\n of Mr. Boardman.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Beveridge \u2014 But the Senator said Board-\n man was the only witness not satisfied with\n his rations.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 One man brought a couple of\n cans before the committee.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Lodge \u2014 That was Boardman.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 He had no use for the United\n States Army anyhow, and said a man ought to\n be shot who furnished such rations. Those\n cans never had been opened, but he testified\n that one of them was spoiled. One was some\n sort of soup and the other was salmon. The\n Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Dietrich) took\n the cans for examination, and invited the wit-\n ness, with one or two Senators, to lunch,\n and gave him some of that spoiled soup, and\n he ate it all and liked it. (Laughter.)\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Beveridge \u2014 And wanted more.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 He wanted more and got it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Hoar \u2014 He ate it all, and none of the\n others got any?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 He ate all that was in the\n dish. He wanted more in his dish and got\n it. He ate the soup and then it was almost\n impossible, I have been told, to get him to\n stop eating that salmon.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. McLaurin of Mississippi\u2014 Will the\n Senator allow me to ask him a question?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 Certainly.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. McLaurin of Mississippi \u2014 I did not catch\n exactly the statement which was made. By\n whom was this witness subpenaed?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Lodge \u2014 The witness came and volun-\n teered, and I laid his name before the com-\n mittee.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner \u2014 He was summoned to lunch\n by the Senator from Nebraska (Mr. Dietrich).\n (Laughter.)\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. McLaurin of Mississippi\u2014 I see that the\n Senator can answer more readily auestiona I\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0053/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0053/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0053/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0053/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0053/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0053.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 862102}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"53\">\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 51\n</p>\n<p>\n do not ask than those which I ask. (Laugh-\n ter.)\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Spooner\u2014 Notv, Mr. President, I am\n through with this branch of the matter. I\n did not mean to take time to refer to it. All\n I mean to say is this: If there has been any\n violation of the rules of civilized warfare in\n the Philippines, it ought. to be hunted up\n and punished. But I do not remember a\n question put by the Senators on the other\n side to these witnesses intended to elicit an\n answer which could be creditable to the\n Army. They sought to prove by every wit-\n ness the general reputation of the Army in\n the Philippines as to administering the water\n cure.\n</p>\n<p>\n It remained for the Senator from Indiana\n (Mr. Beveridge) mainly to draw from the\n witnesses, as he did from almost every wit-\n ness, that they were instructed by the officers\n to treat the Filipinos kindly; that they treat-\n ed them kindly as a rule and in a friendly\n way; that they treated the prisoners taken\n kindly; that they were fed just as our sol-\n diers were fed; that they were taken care\n of in our hospitals just as our own men were\n who were 111 or wounded, and that they bad\n treatment by our surgeons. I do not recall\n that this testimony was mentioned by any\n Senator on the other side in his speeches\n attacking the Army in the Philippines.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Senator from Massachusetts (Mr. Hoar)\n seemed to think there is not any glory in\n what the soldiers have done in the Philip-\n pines. It has been a magnificent, brave\n Army, kindly, considerate, and helpful to that\n people. It has been officered by brave and\n humane men, with here and there a possible\n exception. It has been an uncomplaining\n Army, surrounded bv novel conditions, dis-\n persed, as I have said, throughout the archi-\n pelago, encircled by treachery and dangers\n of every description, subject constantly to\n ambush, deceived by the false use of flags of\n truce.\n</p>\n<p>\n Yet I take it it will be found that in com-\n paratively few instances have members of\n that Army been guilty of atrocity. I know\n it has been brave in battle. I find many re-\n ports here of the conduct of men and officers\n fine in the quality of gallantry, which would\n be applauded anywhere in the civilized world\n where courage and fidelity and uncomplain-\n ing fortitude are admired. Major Waller,\n who has been so bitterly attacked, led an\n expedition, November, 1901, for which he was\n highly commended by his superiors, and, with\n his officers, recommended for promotion, and\n the report of it can not be read by an Amer-\n ican citizen, whether he believes in the war\n or does not, without a thrill of pride. It was\n as brave an assault upon an almost impreg-\n nable position as troops ever made. It is a\n fair illustration of the Army in the Phil-\n ippines \u2014 not of the bad men, not of the\n brutes, but of the Army in the Philippines.\n</p>\n<p>\n The ill fated expedition in which he lost\n his way, a dozen of his men by starvation,\n and in a measure his own mind, was in Jan-\n uary and February, 1902.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here is one instance of bravery and sen-\n timent after that awful massacre at Balan-\n giga, when our men at the breakfast table\n were killed by those who had protested\n friendship, and by those whom they had\n trusted. The captain was killed. Lieutenant\n Bumpus was killed. American soldiers were\n lyiDg slaughtered all around them. A little\n band, and a very little band, remained, and\n here is what a survivor says of it:\n</p>\n<p>\n Sergeant Betrom, the only officer alive,\n assumed command, and those of us who were\n too weak to walk were carried down to the\n convent, where we hoped to find the officers\n alive.\n</p>\n<p>\n They found them all dead \u2014 all killed, by\n friends, by these \u201cchildren.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n We found the sentry beheaded and the cap-\n tain cut to pieces in front of the convent.\n The doctor lay in his bed murdered. Lieu-\n tenant Bumpus \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n From whose father I have here a published\n letter, full of pathos, beseeching justice to\n the Army.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lieutenant Bumpus was stretched over the\n threshold of his room literally hacked to\n pieces. We could not stop to tie up the\n wounds. Then we heard the goo-goos com-\n ing with the horns, and Sergeant Betrom put\n four men on the road to hold the passage\n down to the boats, where the wounded were\n being conveyed.\n</p>\n<p>\n Meanwhile the goo-goos \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n As they call them\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n were trying to burn our quarters. A party\n of the boys under the lead of Private Claude\n Wingo started back to get the flag which was\n on a flagpole in front. He climbed up with\n the goo-goos around him and got the flag,\n but was mortally wounded when he slid\n down. The boys carried him, with the flag\n in his hand, to the boats. He died while we\n were going up the river.\n</p>\n<p>\n There was that love of the flag and that\n pride of the soldier which does not permit\n men to be brutes and savages.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Senator from Utah (Mr. Rawlins), re-\n ferring to the sentence in General Chaffee\u2019s\n letter of September 30, 1901, to General\n Hughes, \u201cIt is our interest to disarm these\n people and to keep them disarmed, and any\n means to that end is advisable. It will\n probably cost us one hundred lives to get the\n guns lost at Balangiga,\u201d endeavored to im-\n press upon the Senator from Georgia (Mr.\n Bacon), and failed, as any one who knows the\n Senator from Georgia woould expect him to\n fail, that Chaffee intended to authorize the\n use of the water cure for that purpose.\n</p>\n<p>\n Although Chaffee is a man of unstained\n soldierly honor; although Chaffee had distin-\n guished himself not onlv for bravery, but for\n humanity and power to restrain soldiers in\n China; although Chaffee stands to-day one of\n the noblest chieftains of the American Army,\n the Senator from Utah sought to find in this\n language ground for casting imputations upon\n his character as a soldier. The Senator said\n he read that \u201cbetween the lines.\u201d Too much\n to the discredit of our Army in the Philip-\n pines has been \u201cread between the lines.\u201d 1\n do not like reading \u201cbetween the lines.\u201d It\n means to find something there that is not\n written; it reauires a mind filled with sus-\n picion; it requires an eye which seeks to And\n something, but cannot And it, yet reads it as\n if it were there.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cReading between the lines\u201d where honor\n is involved never is a fair thing. \u201cReading\n between the lines. \" Mr. President, has put\n the taint of suspicion upon the character of\n many a good woman and has put the taint of\n dishonor upon the fame of many a good man.\n</p>\n<p>\n I will not read between the lines, Mr. Presi-\n dent, to find anything prejudicial to the honor\n of the American soldier in the Philippines or\n anywhere else, and I do not like the spirit\n which permits it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, Mr. President, one thing more, and\n I have done. Senators demand that we tell\n them what our ooiicv is in the Philippines.\n Here it is in this bill. We propose to make\n no foolish promises to the Filipinos at this\n juncture, or any other. They have had enough\n from Spain. We do not intend to furnish\n there an element of distraction. We do not\n intend to put there anything to promote agi-\n tation. We want the mind of the Filipino to\n be on progress; to be on the upbuilding of\n government: to be on the education of his\n children, to be on the excellence of our in-\n</p>\n<p>\n stitutions. and upon the earnestness of our\n purpose to safeguard liberty in that land.\n</p>\n<p>\n That is our policy. To go ahead; to feel our\n way, of course, but to go ahead with an hon-\n est purpose and with all the wisdom we can\n command. And we want your help, sena-\n tors of the minority. We are entitled to it.\n We will do better if we get it. If we cannot\n get it. we are going along without you, and\n it will not be the first time.\n</p>\n<p>\n W\u2019hat is your policy? This is your policy,\n this substitute bill:\n</p>\n<p>\n Sec. 1. That, subject to the provisions\n hereinafter set forth, the United States of\n America hereby relinauish all claim of sov-\n ereignty over aud title to the archipelago\n known as the Philippine Islands.\n</p>\n<p>\n I have always thought (and that is one\n reason why I thought we should have the\n title and the sovereignty) that there would\n come a time when they were capable of au-\n tonomous government, and yet not be able\n to maintain satisfactorily international re-\n lations. So I have felicitated the country\n upon the fact that we are in position,\n through the ratification of the treaty, to\n cede or grant to them the qualified sover-\n eignty which might be needed for autono-\n mous government, representative govern-\n ment, when they were fit for it, and yet re-\n tain in this government that part of the\n larger sovereignty and title which would\n enable us to control their foreign relations,\n and therefore safely protect them.\n</p>\n<p>\n This substitute gives that possibility and\n that status all away, deliberately, I am\n bound to suppose:\n</p>\n<p>\n Sec. 2. That the United States shall con-\n tinue to occupy and govern said archipelago\n until the people thereof have established a\n government.\n</p>\n<p>\n What brought this change over the spirit\n of your dream, Senators? Why have you\n omitted from this proposition that word\n which Mr. Bryan never omitted, as I recol-\n lect, that word which your substitute for\n the tariff bill did not omit? I can not under-\n stand it. I hope it will be explained. It is\n the word \u201cstable \" before the word \" govern-\n ment.\u201d It is a word in this connection of\n overwhelming importance.\n</p>\n<p>\n That the United States shall continue to\n occupy and govern said archipelago until the\n people thereof have established a govern-\n ment.\n</p>\n<p>\n Does it make no difference to Senators\n whether it is a stable government or not?\n Does it make no difference to you whether\n it is a government able to maintain law and\n order or not? Which can protect life and\n liberty and property or not? Which can\n take care of the lives and interests of the\n people who have adhered to us over there?\n Why do you strike out this word \u201cstable\u201d\n and leave the safeguarding of McKinley\u2019s\n pledge of protection to all who came to us\n with friendship to a mere paper stipulation?\n Was it intended? Was it accidental?\n</p>\n<p>\n And until sufficient guarantees have been\n obtained for the performance of our treaty\n obligations with Spain and for the safety of\n those inhabitants who have adhered to the\n United States, and for the maintenance and\n protection of all rights which have accrued\n under the authority thereof, as hereinafter\n provided.\n</p>\n<p>\n Under this substitute these guaranties are\n not to be found in a stable government; but\n you will see as I go along, and I shall take\n but a moment, what they are to be:\n</p>\n<p>\n Sec. 3.

Do you mean\n that?\n</p>\n<p>\n The members of the said convention shall\n number 300, and shall be apportioned by the\n United States Philippine Commission among\n the several provinces of said \" archipelago so\n that the distribution shall be in proportion to\n their population as near as may be; and when\n the said apportionment has been determined\n upon, the said commission shall by proclama-\n tion order an election of the member^ for said\n convention, to be held throughout the said\n archipelago at such time as shall be fixed by\n the said commission \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n It is a short time \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Sec. 4. That the members of the conven-\n tion thus elected shall meet at the city of\n Manila on a day to be fixed \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n And after organizing the convention they\n are to proceed to form a constitution and\n organize a government. This is the first\n constitution. The people are not to be con-\n sulted about it. It is not to be submitted\n to them. It is all to be done by the con-\n vention, and the convention is to organize\n the government. What a beautiful spectacle!\n Whom will you have in that convention? Is\n it intended on your basis of 300 to take in\n every tribe in the Philippine Archipelago?\n Does it include the Moros? Does it include\n the Igorrotes? Does it take in the head-\n hunters? Whom does it include? A photo-\n graph of this convention would be \u201ca thing\n of beauty and a joy forever.\u201d\n and after organization the said convention\n shall proceed to form a constitution and\n orgaqize such government as they may deem\n best adapted to promote the welfare and\n secure the peace and happiness of the in-\n habitants of said islands: Provided \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, here is the guaranty; here is the\n bond which is to protect the obligations\n which the United States has assumed to\n Spain; the bond which is to safeguard the\n obligations, sacred as the honor of your fire-\n side, assumed by the United States to pro-\n tect the men, women and children who have\n been faithful and friendly to us against the\n gCatipunan and assassination and threats\n \u25a0and horrors which have prevailed in the\n</p>\n<p>\n Philippine Islands. How have you provided\n for safeguarding them here? \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Provided, That said convention shall pro-\n vide by an ordinance, irrevocable without\n the consent of the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n I am a little surprised that they should\n take care first of our right to military,\n naval and coaling stations and terminal\n facilities for submarine cables.\n</p>\n<p>\n Next:\n</p>\n<p>\n To carry into effect the treaty obligations\n of the United States with the Kingdom of\n Spain, and for the maintenance and protect-\n ion of all rights and property under the\n authority of the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n And last, and apparently least, to safe-\n guard and protect by paper assurance of a\n government, stable or not, made for a people\n who never ruled themselves, except for a\n time under our guidance \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Third. That no inhabitant of said archi-\n pelago shall ever be molested in person or\n property on account of his or her adherence\n to the United States.\n</p>\n<p>\n And then we are to sail away. Ah, God\n help the amigos in the Philippine Islands.\n The men who have surrendered; the men\n who have gone into our service; the govern-\n ors of the provinces and the children and the\n ' women who have been kindly and friendly\n to our soldiers and to our schoolmasters;\n the great body of people, who, in spite of the\n Katipunan, who in spite of violence, in spite\n of assassination, in spite of tortures and\n burials alive, have come to us with friendly\n greetings, with information, with help\u2014 you\n protect them how? By an irrevocable ord-\n inance in or appended to this \u201cconstitution.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n How would we know whether that was\n maintained or not? The poor amigo, the\n friend of America, slaughtered in thq mango\n grove, tortured to death by the Katipunan in\n the elephant grass or boloed in the mountain\n pass, lying there with his face to the sky\n and his lips sealed forever\u2014 we would not\n hear from him. The mountains, the crevas-.\n ses, the jungles, the forests would not give\n up their secrets. The very officers of this\n \u201cgovernment,\u201d members of the Katipunan,\n many if not all of them all the way through\n engaged in a tremendous effort to alienate\n that people from the United States! We sail\n away leaving them in the care of a quickly\n formed oligarchy and protected by an \u201cord-\n inance!\u201d What a noble redemption of a\n nation\u2019s pledges!\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, this nation, if it did that\n thing, would earn a new title, and the world\n would give that title to us and fasten it for-\n ever upon us \u2014 we would be the \u201ccow r ard na-\n tion\u201d of all the world. I w r ould not for any-\n thing \u2014 and that is one of the obligations\n which bind us to go on \u2014 turn over for pro-\n tection the thousands and hundreds of thous-\n ands Of men and women and children there,\n the Macabebes and all the rest who have\n been friendly to us, to the tender mercies of\n the \u201cgovernment\u201d provided for by this\n minority bill.\n</p>\n<p>\n Who would enforce an observance of this?\n Is it contemplated that we are to go back\n there with war ships or an army some time\n if our obligations to Spain are not respect-\n ed by that Government? Is it intended, after\n having relinquished title and sovereignty\n and sailed away, carrying with us the flag\n as a symbol of liberty and protection to all\n that people and leaving it there as a symbol\n of ownership of coaling, naval and military\n stations, that we are to go back and that we\n are to again train our guns against Manila\n \u2014that we are again to take possession of\n this archipelago in order to protect the\n amigos No, that is not intended. It is in-\n tended. Mr. President and Senators, if that\n</p>\n<p>\n were adopted, to sneak away from there like\n a coward and abandon them to their fate,\n knowing what their fate will be. The people\n of the United States will never do that\n thing.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then, after all this, what is to be done?\n They are to have amnesty there. I do not\n care for that.\n</p>\n<p>\n Provided, That such amnesty shall not ap-\n ply to any who have violated the rules of civ-\n ilized warfare or w ' ere guilty of murder or\n torture. That the latter, if any, shall be\n afforded a speedy trial for their offenses in\n the civil courts of said archipelago and be\n punished or acquitted, as the facts and law\n may warrant.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is a wise foresight to give them author-\n ity to acquit if the facts warrant, is it not?\n</p>\n<p>\n That the President of the United States is\n hereby requested to negotiate an agreement\n between the United States, the said Philip-\n pine Archipelago \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n That is, after we have quit, after we have\n surrendered the sovereignty, and have no\n longer any right there, except to take care\n of our coaling station and our naval sta-\n tion and our military station \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n That the President of the United States\n is hereby requested to negotiate an agree-\n ment between the United States, the said\n Philippine Archipelago. \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n How would you negotiate an agreement\n with an archipelago, anyway? I know my\n friend from Texas (Mr. Bailey) does not\n know \" . What does the minority of the com-\n mittee mean by that?\n</p>\n<p>\n That the President of the United States is\n hereby requested to negotiate an agreement\n between the United States, the said Philip-\n pine Archipelago\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n That is like negotiating an agreement with\n a tree br with a mountain \u2014\n and Great Britain, Germany, France, and\n such other powers as he may deem best, pro-\n viding for its perpetual neutrality and in-\n violability from all foreign interference, and\n also for equal opportunities of trade to for-\n eign countries with said archipelago.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have tried that on a small scale once.\n The Senator from Ohio (Mr. Foraker) in his\n speech the other day recalled the fact that\n we were not willing in the Hay-Pauncefote\n treaty to enter into an alliance with other\n nations as to maintaining the neutrality of\n the isthmian canal, it being our canal. We\n intend now to take care of its neutrality\n ourselves; but that is not the only instance\n where we have tried agreements w r ith other\n governments, and great governments, too,\n for joint neutrality. We tried it in Samoa\n with England and Germany, friends of ours.\n How did we get along? We came very near\n the \u201cperilous edge,\u201d and it required a good\n deal of diplomacy, to extricate ourselves\n from it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Suppose those governments w\u2019ould not\n agree, \u2019as they would not, and we could not\n go into that if they would, what then? Sen-\n ators forgot to provide here that before we\n sail away the President shall notify the\n nations who have subjects there with fam-\n ilies and property of the hour of our de-\n parture that Germany, France, England,\n China and Japan, and Russia may have their\n warships there to protect the interests of\n their own people.\n</p>\n<p>\n What would happen? I will tell you what\n I think would happen, Mr. President. I do\n not think the nations would be willing that\n any one of them should have those islands.\n</p>\n<p>\n I think most of them sympathized with\n Spain. I think they wfill not fear the occu-\n pation and control of the Philippines by\n Spain. 1 have a notion \u2014 of course I may be\n wrong \u2014 that in the end, with the aid of these\n other governments, we having utterly with-\n drawn from it, the Philippines would agsua\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0055/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0055/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0055/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0055/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:un:it:ed:st:at:es:ph:il:00:un:se:unitedstatesphil00unse:unitedstatesphil00unse_0055/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/un/it/ed/st/at/es/ph/il/00/un/se/unitedstatesphil00unse/unitedstatesphil00unse_0055.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 495413}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"55\">\n<p>\n THE UNITED STATES AND THE PHILIPPINE ISLANDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 53\n</p>\n<p>\n belong to Spain.

We subdued resistance to our author-\n ity. We filled the islands with schools and\n with homes owned by the people. We es-\n tablished a school of government in which\n were taught the lesson of liberty restrained\n by law. We separated the church from the\n state. We lifted the dead hand of eccles-\n iastical ownership. We gave them our bill\n of rights and an independent judiciary to\n enforce its guaranties. \u201cWe emancipated the\n peasant from feudalism. We drove from the\n archipelago the scourge of ladronism. We en-\n countered obstacles, but we surmounted them.\n We made mistakes, but we corrected them. We\n</p>\n<p>\n educated the inhabitants for self-government,\n and although occupying a territory of our\n own, we extended to them the principles of\n the Declaration of Independence, consulted,\n when they were fit, their wishes as to gov-\n ernment, and aided them in the erection of a\n \u201cRepublic in Asia.\u201d We threw the shield of\n our protecting power around them. In the\n end we left our flag floating there among a\n grateful, friendly, and independent people \u2014 a\n sign of welcome, safety, and rest to the\n mariners of our Republic who sail the far\n Pacific and a reminder to the Filipinos and\n their children of the rich fulfillment of Mc-\n Kinley\u2019s prophecy that it would not lose \u201cits\n gift of benediction in its world-wide journey\n to their shores.\u201d *\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. President, I regret to have occupied so\n much of the time of the Senate.
