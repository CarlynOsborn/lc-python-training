These thoughts\n I considered as \u201creasonable and candid;\u201d and it was with no\n small satisfaction 1 soon had the assurance that you, Sir, and\n no inconsiderable number of the friends of pure and undefiled\n religion considered them as justly entitled to that character.\n But whatever may be their claim to reasonableness and can-\n dor, they have been instrumental of exciting very considera-\n ble attention to the subjects about which they are conversant ;\n and, I have much reason to believe, to good effect. Never have\n I known the attention of people of my connexion and in the\n vicinity, so much excited in relation to the interesting and im-\n portant question, \u201c what saith the scripture,\u201d as it has been\n since the publication of the seasonable and candid thoughts.\n To ascertain what is truth respecting the person and charac-\n ter of the son of God, the scriptures have been read by many\n with much assiduity and deep interest, and so far as this at-\n tention has extended, the result has, in many instances been a\n conviction, that Jesus Christ is a person or being distinct from\n him, who is his Father ; and that he is inferior to, and de-\n pendent on his Father. Besides, I have much reason to be-\n lieve, that so far as the subject has been duly attended to in\n this region, a general and satisfactory conviction prevails, that\n the inspired scriptures are abundantly competent, as a rule of\n faith and practice, without the aid of human creeds. The\n prevalence of truth in this world of sin and error, although\n slow, is nevertheless sure, and will ultimately prevail.\n</p>\n<p>\n That the sentiments contained in the \u201c seasonable and can-\n did thoughts,\u201d whether correct or otherwise, would meet with\n opposition in some form, was to be expected. This expecta-\n tion is now realized in the publication of a pamphlet, entitled\n \u201c Seasonable Thoughts on Human Creeds, or Articles of Faith,\n by an orthodox clergyman, shewn to be very unreasonable\n thoughts, in a letter to a friend.\u201d To this letter is affixed the\n signature, T.

In support of this opinion I have to observe \u2014 that the\n self-existent God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ is re-\n peatedly represented in scripture in the character of king seat-\n ed on a majestic throne, as in the following examples. \u201c I\n saw the Lord sitting on his throne, and all the host of heaven\n standing by him. And behold a throne was set in heaven, and\n one sat upon the throne. And I saw in the right hand of him\n that sat on the throne a book. And I beheld, and lo, in the midst\n of the throne a Lamb, and he came and took the book out of\n the right hand of him that sat on the throne.\u201d \u2014 And thus the\n Supreme God and Father is, in vision represented to Isaiah , in\n which the prophet heard the voice of Him who was enthroned\n saying u whom shall I send I To which Isaiah answered u here\n I am, send me.\u201d \u2014 Ver. 8.\n</p>\n<p>\n It then follows in ver. 9, 10, \u201c Go, tell this people, & c.\u201d In\n this visionary message the prophet was assured, that this people\n would remain impenitent and unrestrained. And the apostle\n John shews that the obstinacy and blindness of the Jews, in\n rejecting Christ and the messages of salvation which he brought,\n were an illustration and fulfilment of Isaiah ' s prophecy. These\n things said Esaias , when he saw his glory , and spake of him ,\n viz. the things stated in John 12, 38, 40 verses. That this pas-\n sage refers, not to Christ but to God the Father ; you will find\n much, if not satisfactory evidence, by comparing it with verse\n 38. \u201c Lord , who hath believed our report, and to whom is the\n</p>\n<p>\n arm of the Lord revealed.\u201d These things said Esaias when he\n saw him , & c. viz.

And if the imposers of\n them, do not view them in the same light, their honesty and \u00ab\n uprightness must appear rather questionable. Now il these\n articles be orthodox, why should any other creed or articles\n have been formed, as tests of orthodoxy ? Why should not all\n protestant dissenters, subscribe, or assent to them ! To deny\n the usefulness, the importance, and necessity of such subscrip-\n tion or assent,, would appear with an ill grace in the advocates\n of human creeds.

How\n many folios have been written and printed upon the subject, I\n shall not undertake to decide ; nor shall I undertake to deter-\n mine how much precious time has been wasted, by rational\n beings, in reading and commenting upon those ponderous lu-\n cubrations.

But what has been the result of these learned and ar-\n duous labors ? An elucidation of the articles, or a unanimity\n of sentiment respecting them ? This can hardly be pretended.\n In this great work, doctor has risen up against doctor, and\n bishop against bishop, till in intricate mazes they have lost\n themselves and confounded their readers. Each writer, how-\n ever, has appeared a champion for the national creed, as the\n bulwark of the national religion. And those to whom this re-\n ligion has been principally intrusted, have but too often agreed,\n to require subscription to it, under the most severe pains and\n penalties , The consequence has been that multitudes of the\n most learned, pious and successful preachers of the gospel,\n who could not conscientiously subscribe the creed imposed up-\n on them by their superiors , have suffered the most rigorous\n and unchristian treatment. Because they embraced the Bible,\n as the standard of their faith and preaching, instead of a hu-\n man creed and establishment, they were forcibly silenced as\n preachers, deprived of their livings, imprisoned, and in a vari-\n ety of other ways injuriously \u2014 cruelly treated !\n</p>\n<p>\n How many and great also have been the sufferings of the\n puritans as well as their public teachers in consequence of the\n religious test, or tests of the church of England ! For their\n neglect to conform to them, because their consciences would\n not suffer them to do it, or because they thought it right to\n obey God rather than man , the redoubtable Defender of the\n Faith, James the first, threatened that he would u hurry them\n out of the land , and even -worse .\u201d His sacred majesty was not\n forgetful of his threatening. He very rigidly carried it into\n effect. Accordingly many conscientious Christians, found it\n necessary either to violate the dictates of conscience, or flee\n from the impending tempest by leaving their native land and\n pleasant habitations, to seek an asylum in a strange country.\n Without hesitation the latter course was adopted.\n</p>\n<p>\n Such were the views of these masters in Israel, and a nume-\n rous tribe of their subordinates, that with unblushing front\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0013/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 142, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 258}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0013/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 284, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 516}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0013/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 569, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0013/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1138, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2065}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0013/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2277, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4131}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0013/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/th/in/gs/se/ti/np/ro/pe/00/un/se/thingssetinprope00unse/thingssetinprope00unse_0013.jp2", "height": 4131, "width": 2277, "levels": 6, "size": 700053}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"13\">\n<p>\n 13\n</p>\n<p>\n they could say\u2014 u We the representatives of a formed establish-\n ed church, do not think fit to mention the word Religion, any\n further than it is the religion of some formed established church /\u201d\n However different might have been their language at certain\n times and on certain occasions, yet it cannot be disguised that\n their conduct but too well accorded with this their extraordi-\n nary avowal.

What good\n reason, then, can be assigned why this church has not the same\n right to establish a religious text, for its peace and prosperity,\n and for the promotion of orthodox sentiments, as any other\n church or association of men P\n</p>\n<p>\n The Protestants, indeed, who shook off the Papal creed or\n yoke complained that it was too unreasonable, oppressive, and\n heavy to be borne. Nor is this to be wondered at. They\n urged that they could not, with a good conscience, submit to\n it. And do we not believe that their conduct was as rational,\n as magnanimous ? And that their apology for, and vindication\n of it, were as forcible as just ? How then could the leaders of\n these same Protestants, and particularly in England, have con-\n sistently imposed a creed or yoke upon their brethren, similar\n in principle to that, which they had just shaken off!

But if this creed or\n test is not to be assented to in one and the same sense, but in\n as different senses, as assent is given to the thirty-nine articles\n of the church of England, what valuable purpose can be an-\n swered by it ?

Besides, if creeds of orthodox churches were well un-\n derstood, and assent to them required, as containing nothing\n but \u201c pure, evangelical truth,\u201d how many of those churches,\n now in fellowship with each other, would, like the Jews and\n Samaritans have no further mutual religious intercourse !\n Whence, then, their seeming union?

And this is the very sentiment which I suggest-\n ed in my seasonable thoughts, and particularly in the passage\n ' quoted by my opponent, in p. 8 of his letter, and which ques-\n tion he there opposes, or seems to oppose, as a very dangerous\n error, and to vindicate the creeds and establishments of the\n Romish church, and other corrupt churches, as \u201c pure, evan-\n gelical, holy truth.\u201d But u I do not perceive how thus saying\n and unsaying a thing is better than saying nothing at a*ll.\u201d If,\n however, I am to consider the gentleman as abiding by what\n he has last said upon tbe subject, as stated in the above quo-\n tation, I must consider him as vindicating the cause of truth,\n however he may not extend it against the erroneous doctrine\n of human creeds. And most readily do I concur with him in\n the sentiment, as expressed, (p. 9.) that u it is the indispensa-\n ble duty of every Christian to endeavour to guard the church\n against the least departure from the faith once delivered to the\n saints.\u201d But how can this departure be more effectually guard-\n ed against than by opposing, by bringing into disrepute, and by\n prostrating religious creeds and tests of human invention.\n</p>\n<p>\n A readily concur also with Mr. A. in what he says, page 11,\n in relation to false principles and doctrines. u A false princi-\n ple dr doctrine,\u201d he observes, \u201c may descend from age to age,\n live and operate on the minds of millions, after he who first\n broached it is dead. It clothes falsehood with divine authori-\n ty, binds the conscience and makes strong the bonds of iniqui-\n ty in him who believes it.\u201d \u2014 And because there is, and always\n has been so much of the leaven of this \u201c false principle or doc-\n trine,\u201d in human creeds and inventions, X feel constrained to\n bear my testimony against them as tests of orthodoxy, and\n terms of communion ; and earnestly to recommend the Bible\n creed as a substitute, in which none of tbid injurious leaven is\n to be found. . ' *\n</p>\n<p>\n Under the third article, p. 11, Mr. A. speaking of errors in\n judgment relative to the fundamental doctrines of the gospel,\n as an evidence of an heart at enmity^ith God, quotes, in con-\n firmation of this truth, a very pertinent, monitory, and I should\n think, to some men , a very alarming passage from the writings\n of the inspired Paul. The passage is the following. \u201c If any\n man teach otherwise, and consent not to wholesome words,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0027/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 142, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 258}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0027/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 284, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 516}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0027/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 569, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0027/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1138, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2065}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0027/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2277, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4131}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0027/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/th/in/gs/se/ti/np/ro/pe/00/un/se/thingssetinprope00unse/thingssetinprope00unse_0027.jp2", "height": 4131, "width": 2277, "levels": 6, "size": 809387}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"27\">\n<p>\n even the words of our Lord Jesus Christ, and to the doctrine\n which is according to godliness, he is proud knowing nothing.\u201d\n He might have very pertinently proceeded in his quotation,\n thus \u2014 44 But doting about questions and strifes of words, where-\n of cometh envy, strife, railings, evil surmisings, perverse dis-\n putings of men of corrupt minds, & c.\u201d\u2014 Whether this passage\n is to 0e applied to those who advocate a scriptural creed, ex-\n pressed in the 44 wholesome words \u2014 the words of our Lord\n Jesus Christ,\u201d \u2014 or to those who, rejecting these words as a\n test of orthodoxy and communion, insist upon a creed in which\n but very few of these words are found, you, Sir, will judge !\n</p>\n<p>\n Passing over several observations of my ppponent, as re-\n quiring no particular remark, I will invite your attention to a\n passage in p. 12, of his letter. It is as follows. \u2014 44 The Jews\n professed a most sacred regard for the writings of Moses as a\n divine revelation, yet Christ charges them with not believing\n those writings. Like thousands of modern Christians they had\n a superstitious reverence for the letters, syllables and words of\n scripture ; but entertained an implacable hatred of the truths,\n of which these very words were the signs or representatives.\u201d\n Here I would ask, for what purpose did Mr. A. make these\n remarks, but that they should be applied to those Christians,\n who plead for the scriptures as a complete rule of faith and\n practice, to the exclusion of human creeds or articles of faith i\n But to whom, if to any denomination of Christians, the applica-\n tion is really to be made, you will judge for yourself. Why,\n Sir, did the Jews hate the real doctrines or truths of the Bible\n Was not this one very important reason of it, that they taught\n and received, 44 for doctrines the commandments of men,\u201d\n and held them in higher estimation than Bible doctrines or\n truths ? because they 44 transgressed the commandment of God\n by their tradition ?\u201d because by this, they 44 made the com-\n mandment of Ged of none effect,\u201d and because they were\n u zealous for the traditions of the fathers,\u201d and by them were\n 44 spoiled ?\u201d Had they not been attached, even to infatuation,\n to human creeds and articles of faith, they would, beyond all\n reasonable doubt, much better have understood the 44 writings\n of Moses,\u201d and much better have profited by them. And\n were it not for the superstitious reverence which is paid to hu-\n man creeds by 44 thousands of modern Christians,\u201d it cannot\n reasonably be \" doubted that they would much more highly res-\n pect, and much better understood the doctrines of the Bible,\n and derive from them much more instruction and benefit, than\n they now do. And what is it but trifling with a most inter-\n esting and solemn subject, when these same modtrn Christians\n 44 profess a most sacred regard lor the waitings of Moses\n of the prophets \u2014 of Jesus Christ and his Apostles, and yet re?\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0028/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 142, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 258}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0028/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 284, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 516}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0028/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 569, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0028/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1138, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2065}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0028/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2277, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4131}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0028/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/th/in/gs/se/ti/np/ro/pe/00/un/se/thingssetinprope00unse/thingssetinprope00unse_0028.jp2", "height": 4131, "width": 2277, "levels": 6, "size": 842714}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"28\">\n<p>\n 28\n</p>\n<p>\n fuse to admit to their communion, and to hold fellowship with\n those, who profess a cordial assent to these writings, merely\n because they will not subscribe to articles of faith of their owa\n devising.\n</p>\n<p>\n To show 44 the real necessity and vast utility of creeds ex-\n pressed in other language than that of scripture.\u201d Mr. A.\n states a case, p. 13, consisting of several suppositions and cir-\n cumstances.

I am, howev-\n er, willing to allow that by human creed he intend^ that his own\n creed, and such other creeds as are modled according to the\n fashion of this . But if he thus restricts the meaning of the\n word, he excludes from the catalogue of creeds, probably, not\n less than ninety-nine in a hundred, as creeds to which assent\n ought not to be required. Now if assent to but one creed in\n a hundred, tends to check the progress of M irreligion, error\n and delusion,\u201d an assent to all the rest, I should suppose, would\n tend to promote these evils. Hence, the sum of evil to that of\n good, which may be supposed to result from assenting to hu-\n man creeds may be considered according to this estimate, as\n about ninety-nine to one.

Is it not, therefore, the dictate of prudence and\n safety to withhold assent to it ?\n</p>\n<p>\n In pages 14, 15, under his fourth article Mr. A. seems to\n apprehend that requiring assent to a human creed as a u term\n of communion,\u201d will be opposed on the ground, that it inter-\n feres with the right of private judgment. Nor was this expec-\n tation unnatural. But how does he meet and repel the objec-\n tion ? 11 To require a person,\u201d he observes, \u201c to judge as we\n do in regard to religion in order to communion, is the forbid-\n ding him to judge at all.\u201d Whether this be the case or not,\n he will not forbear, it is presumed, to exercise his judgment;\n and should he exercise it as he ought, he will judge, I should\n think, that the requisition ought not to be made at all , and that\n he xv k Q uid never submit to it at all .

Whence no small difficulty arises in shaping a\n pertinent answer to it. I will, however, make the attempt.\n</p>\n<p>\n To compel a person to say that a creed is true, contrary to the\n conviction of his own mind, is a violation, it seems, of the\n sacred rights of his conscience. But how is this a violation\n of these rights ? Does it oblige a person to believe that , which\n he is persuaded is not true P Surely not. No external force,\n or penalty, or torture, can produce this effect. It is impossi-\n ble. Conscience will be free as to its dictates. Nor is there\n any man but will judge for himself, whatever external force\n may be used to prevent it. The torture of an inquisition may,\n indeed, constrain a naan to say, that he believes^ a creed to be\n true when he verily believes it to be grossly erroneous . And\n this, there is too much reason to apprehend, has often been the\n case ; but the dictates, both of the conscience and understand-\n ing, are left free ; nor can their freedom in this sense ever be\n violated. This compelling force, however, is a most unrea-\n sonable and cruel act . And, in this sense , it unquestionably\n violates, if the expression be admitted, the rights of con-\n science. But what is the mighty difference with respect to \u00ab\n the rights of conscience, between the external force under con-\n sideration, and the imposing of a human creed upon one, who\n believes it to be erroneous?

Or\n whether he would predicate moral depravity of both P I would\n further enquire, whether the term opposition does not express\n malevolence or hatred, as operating with less strength and vi-\n olence, than is expressed by the word enmity P I beg leave to\n ask, again, whether the statement, that \u201c the carnal mind is\n \u2022nmity against God\u201d conveys precisely the same idea as the\n statement, that \u201c the heart of man is full\u201d or is filed with\n opposition to God ?\u201d If by the terms by nature , with appli-\n cation to man the gentleman means his character as he comes\n into the world ; and if he would be understood as saying that\n every, or any child of Adam, commences existence with a\n heart full of exercises of opposition and hatred against God,\n the sentiment is more easily advanced than substantiated. If\n by the heart of man \u201c devoid of the least degree of friendly\n affection to God,\u201d be meant as an illustration of the carnal\n mind as \u201c not subject to the law of God, neither indeed can\n befi I can see but very little analogy, I must confess, between\n the words of the text and the illustration. The carnal mind,\n the apostle says, cannot be subject to the law of God. The\n meaning of this declaration, according to Mr. A. if I under-\n stand him, is, that the heart of man is devoid of the least de-\n gree of friendly affection to God. Is this the meaning, the\n definite meaning of the Apostle ! If the gentleman does not\n mean to say it is, I cannot find any definite meaning in what\n he does say ; nor do I find any attempt he has made to illus-\n trate the latter part of the verse which composes the first ar-\n ticle of his scriptural creed. Yet he has affixed a definite\n meaning to that article, yes ! the exact meaning of the inspired\n Apostle ! ! If the gentleman believes that he has done justice\n to the text, his belief, I presume, must be peculiar to himself ;\n for it is not a little difficult to conceive, that a more indefinite\n sense could be affixed to it by any honest man, acquainted\n with the meaning of words. And yet this same definite\n meaning of the Apostle\u2019s words must be subscribed, or assent-\n ed to, as a term or condition of Christian communion ! a\n meaning which Paul, could he be consulted on the subject,\n would, 1 am persuaded, reject as very loose and indeterminate ,\n if not as a gross perversion of his real meaning.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0041/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 142, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 258}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0041/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 284, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 516}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0041/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 569, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0041/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1138, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2065}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0041/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2277, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4131}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0041/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/th/in/gs/se/ti/np/ro/pe/00/un/se/thingssetinprope00unse/thingssetinprope00unse_0041.jp2", "height": 4131, "width": 2277, "levels": 6, "size": 671463}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"41\">\n<p>\n 41\n</p>\n<p>\n Whether Mr. A. has been more successful in affixing a def-\n inite meaning to the second article of his scriptural creed, is\n now to be considered.\n</p>\n<p>\n Article 2 . \u2014 44 This is the true God and eternal life 1 John\n v. 20.\n</p>\n<p>\n Definite meaning \u201c The Lord Jesus Christ is himself\n sell-existent, independent Deity.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n That this is really the definite meaning of the text in the\n estimation of the gentleman, 1 would by no means question ;\n but that he should have been so peremtory in his assertion that\n it is so, must have arisen, it is presumed, from his not having\n duly attended to the subject.

But it is to be remembered, that\n u when there is something in a passage or sentence, or in the\n connexion which requires it, the relative or definitive pronoun\n not only may, but often does and must refer to a remote ante-\n cedent, as that which -was uppermost in the writer\u2019s thoughts,\n and principally aimed at in the whoje discourse.\u201d These re-\n marks, it is believed, apply to the passage under consideration ;\n so that this refers to him , even to him who is the true God ,\n and not to Jesus Christ. In support of this construction sev-\n eral examples occur in this very Epistle, and a multitude of\n others in the inspired scriptures, in which relatives and pro-\n nouns refer, not to the nearest , but to remote antecedents .\n</p>\n<p>\n It may be further observed, that eminent writers, whose ac-\n quaintance with the early Christian fathers is unquestionbly\n intimate, affirm, that these same fathers of the three first cen-\n turies, refer this text to God the Father. And that the pro-\n noun this , is thus to be referred seems evident from the con-\n sideration that the Father is, by this same writer, St. John,\n called the only true God , as contradistinguished from our Lord\n Jesus Christ, in John xvii. 3, with which compare 1 Thessa-\n lonians, i. 9, 10, \u201c How ye turned to God from idols, to serve\n the living and true God ; and to wait for his Son from heaven,\n whom he raised from the dead,\u201d & c. It may not be unim-\n portant farther to remark, that God the Father is, in a number\n of scripture passages, opposed to idols. This circumstance\n seems to furnish additional evidence that by true God in the\n passage under review, we are to understand God the Father ,\n as in this, passage he is opposed to idols.

Will the cause of truth and the extension of scriptural\n knowledge, be likely to be promoted by this expedient ? Will\n Christians, by assenting to this creed, be likely to be cemented\n together by that charity, which the gospel inculcates ? Will\n assenting to error for truth, convert that error into truth ? Can\n such an assent be acceptable and pleasing to the great head of\n the church Is it justifiable ? is it safe ? I speak as unto a\n wise man, judge thou.\n</p>\n<p>\n Whether this definite creed is less exceptionable than many\n others now in use, as tests of orthodoxy and terms of Christian\n communion, I shall not undertake definitely to decide.

If I understand them, all real Trinitarians believe that\n Jesus Christ the Saviour is a mere man like other men, sin only ex-\n cepted, and that he never actually existed till the reign of the Ro-\n man Emperor, Augustus Caesar ; and yet they profess to believe\n that he is God over all, even self-existent and independent. Now\n since these Christians do worship in the same assembly, it requires\n no reasoning to show that they can do it. Nor do I see but \u201c the So-\n cinian can join in this idolatry.\u201d Why should he not ? for, with the\n Trinitarian, he believes that \u201c the Saviour is a mere creature.\u201d and,\n with the Trinitarian, he believes there is but one supreme and inde-\n pendent God. He believes also, with the Trinitarian, that this one\n God is united, and so intimately with the man Christ Jesus, as to ena-\n ble him to perform miracles and to do all his wonderful works.\n Such is the unity of sentiment between Trinitarian and Socinian\n Christians, respecting the one God, and the one Lord Jesus Christ,\n that they might well harmonize, I should think, in worshipping in\n the same assembly. And this union between them in sentiment\n would, I am persuaded be very apparent , were \u201c the doting about\n questions and the strife of words\u201d but once abandoned, and their\n seemingly discordant opinions, fairly analysed. Their difference in\n opinion, it is confidently believed, relates much more to words than\n to things . I would ask my opponent then, \u201c how can they not wor-\n ship in the same assembly ?\u201d If u he who leads in the solemnities\n addresses the Lord Jesus as the Jehovah of Hosts,\u201d or as the self-ex-\n istent God, neither will the Socinian nor the Trinitarian consider him\n as addressing a mere creature ; but as addressing the one supreme\n God , besides whom there is none other. The Socinian can reasona-\n bly infer nothing more in reality from the address than this, that the\n speaker believes the ofie God has made himself known, besides other\n titles, by the title, Lord Jesus. And the Trinitarian worshipper\n would, I should think, be likely to make the same inference. How-\n ever then the Socinian should believe the speaker to be under a mis-\n take, as to the application of this title to the one God, yet his candor\n it may be presumed, w T ould not allow him to consider his mistake as\n a fundamental error, or an error furnishing sufficient ground for\n their separation, and worshipping in different assemblies. But\n whether either the Socinian or the Trinitarian party will view the\n subject in this light, I know not. Should they, however, view the\n subject differently, I see not, I confess, any sufficient reason for it.\n Nor, should the event happen, and at no very distant period, that\n they will better understand each other, and inter ' changeably give and\n receive the right hand of fellowship, I shall not be greatly disappoint-\n \u00a3 ed. Yet may not the hope be indulged that, abandoning the belief\n that Jesus Christ is either mere man, or the self-existent and inde-\n pendent God, they will mutually agree to meet their opponents on\n harmonious , and as they believe, scriptural ground ? Meeting on this\n ground, we shall all believe that Jesus Christ was before Abraham \u2014\n that he was begotten of the Father \u2014 in the beginning with God \u2014 that\n God by or through him made the worlds \u2014 that he is the brightness of\n the Father ' s glory and the express image of his person \u2014 that he is\n head over all things to the church, and that he is God over all , in\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0055/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 142, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 258}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0055/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 284, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 516}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0055/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 569, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0055/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1138, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2065}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0055/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2277, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4131}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0055/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/th/in/gs/se/ti/np/ro/pe/00/un/se/thingssetinprope00unse/thingssetinprope00unse_0055.jp2", "height": 4131, "width": 2277, "levels": 6, "size": 725298}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"55\">\n<p>\n that the supreme God, even his God put all things under him, (him-\n self being excepted) \u2014 in that his Father hath committed all judgment\n to him, and given all things into his hands , even all power in heaven\n and earth \u2014 in that God hath given him a name which is above every\n name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is\n to come \u2014 and that he is blessed forever, or the object of everlasting\n blessing ; for u worthy is the Lamb that was slain to receive power\n and blessing ; and blessing and honor shall be ' * not only \u201c unto him\n that sitteth upon the throne* 5 but \u201c unto the Lamb forever and ever.**\n In page 21, the gentleman has the courtesy to crave u pardon\u201d if\n he should \u201c ask, whether this zeal against creeds, may not arise\n from the dread of ecclesiastical censure, the loss of popularity, and\n of the loves and fishes ?*\u2019 \u2014 This insinuation is so very extraordinary,\n that I can hardly conceive that it would come from any one whose\n head is not a \u201c babel.\u201d That the \u201c dread of ecclesiastical censure\n should induce any one to oppose human creeds, and in a public\n manner too, whether with w zeal\u201d or moderation, is to me as unac-\n countable as it is wonderful. Are not human creeds almost as gen-\n erally the object of attachment and veneration among us, and around\n us, as was the goddess Diana to the Ephesians ? And do not great\n numbers of the most respectable and pious ministers and churches*\n hold them in high estimation ? Is it not true also that these minis-\n ters and churches verily believe they ought, in some way or other,\n to censure those of their brethren, who openly oppose their creeds ?\n Do they not give evidence of this, not by words only , brut by actions ,\n and by such words and actions too, as cannot be very pleasant to the\n ears or grateful to the sensibilities of those, against whom they are\n levelled ? And yet a dread of this censure excites a spirit of zeal\n n some, to incur it, and with their eyes open, by publickly, and\n without disguise, opposing human creeds or articles of faith ! Thus\n did Luther , Calvin , and many others, oppose the dogmas of the\n church of Rome, lest they should incur the displeasure of its pon-\n tiff, and expose themselves to the thunder of the Vatican ! But that\n any one whose idol is \u201c popularity,** and who has a keen appetite.\n for the \u201c loves and fishes** should, with his eyes open, pursue a\n course, destructive of popular applause, ruinous to the gratification\n of his appitite, and effectually conducive to \u201c ecclesiastical censure,**\n is so unnatural and so strange, that no one, I should suppose, would\n ever think of this course, had it not been suggested by a man of ex-\n traordinary policy. Nor should I suppose that any man of common\n discernment and policy, would pursue a course like this, to regain\n to his ear the \u00ab dulcet sounds of applause from the flattering mul-\n titude,** or to recover the lost loves and fishes for the gratification of\n his ravenous appetite. But I can suppose that men are to be found,\n even in this degenerate age, who, fearless of censure, regardless of\n the sweet incense of public admiration, and the gratification of a\n selfish appetite, dare appear as advocates for Christian liberty, in op-\n position to ecclesiastical influence, and usurpation.

It was my design, to pursue a middle course between those\n who believe that Jesus Christ is a mere man , and those who profess\n to believe that he is the self existent and indc/iendent God. \u2014 That\n neither of these characters belongs to Jesus Christ, but an intermedi-\n ate character between them I attempted to prove by scriptural testi-\n mony, in my seasonable thoughts. In doing this, I thought I acted\n somewhat like a mediator between opposite and contending parties.\n But what will be the effect of this mediation, future time must de-\n clare. That it would be a good and desirable one, I did hope \u2014 I\n still hope so ; nor, as I trust, without sufficient reason.\n</p>\n<p>\n But the gentleman, it seems, found my \u201c arguments stale and\n thread bare,\u201d that is old and firm. Whatever is stale , is old or an-\n cient. And that my arguments have great antiquity in their favor\n cannot reasonably be questioned. It is acknowledged, and even by\n Trinitarians, who are acquainted with the subject , that the most an-\n cient Christian writers in general, \u201c speak of Christ as a distinct per-\n son\u201d from the Father; that before the Council of Nice, which was\n near the beginning of the fourth century, \u201c they generally spoke of\n the Son as having had a glorious nature, pre-existent to his incarna-\n tion, and as derived from the Father .\u201d Nor can any satisfactory\n evidence be found in any of their writings, I am persuaded, in sup-\n port of Christ\u2019s supreme and independent divinity. Thus it appears\n that my arguments are stale ; that is, they were used in the early\n ages of Christianity , before the church had become corrupted, as it\n afterwards was.\n</p>\n<p>\n My arguments are also thread bare \u2014 that is, they are of a firm\n and strong texture , and have worn well. A garment which becomes\n thread bare must have been made of good materials, and have been\n well fabricated. But a garment of the opposite description is worn\n \u2022ut, or becomes tattered, before the threads exhibit a bare appearance.\n Now these same arguments, notwithstanding they may be figura-\n tively thread bare, are nevertheless firm and strong. Although by\n frequent and rough handling, their opponents may have worn off the\n nap. yet they have not been torn or materially injured by them.\n They still remain firm and entire, and so far as I can see are likely\n to become more substantial , the more they are worn.\n</p>\n<p>\n I am not going to apply it\u201d observes my opponent, in the same\n page, \u201c but it (my assuming the epithet orthodox) certainly reminds\n me of a passage in Rev. 13, 11. \u201c He had two horns like a lamb, and\n he spake as a dragon.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n As it may be of no disservice to the gentleman, I will take the\n liberty just to remind him, that the author of the Apocalypse had, in\n the above cited chapter, a vision of two beasts.

The foundation of God standeth sure,\n having this seal, the Lord knoweth them that are his.\u201d To these\n things I observe, happy would it be for Christians, and Christian\n churches of all denominations, were they to abandon all the devious\n paths which their own wisdom has marked out, and to tuin their\n feet into the good old paths , which were trod by Jesus Chiist and his\n apostles.\n</p>\n<p>\n That \u201c stars\u201d which now blaze in their orbits like portentous and\n formidable comets, \u201c will\u201d indeed \u201c fall from the spiritual heavens,\u201d\n where they now ' revolve with apparent safety, is highly probable ;\n when it will be found that their light had been deceptive, and their\n influence baleful.

This is an expedient but illy adapted to con-\n vince me of my supposed heresy ; and possibly it will be found in the\n end, as illy adapted to accomplish its own design.\n</p>\n<p>\n I shall now close with an extract from an impressive charge given\n on the occasion of introducing several pious young men of promising\n talents 10 the work of the gospel ministry \u2014 u As you are to publish\n the whole counsel of God, faithfulness requires that you publish that\n only. Christ is the sole lawgiver in his church ; and sole king in his\n kingdom. He has not given his ministers power to make laws, or\n impose articles of faith, or to appoint terms of communion, w hich he\n hjs not appointed. This would be to resign his kingdom and power\n into those hands, which are not fit to be entrusted with them. It is\n possible, men may, under the pretence of ambassadors, representa-\n tives, vicegerents, or any other lordly name assume to themselves a\n power, to determine rut horatively in the affairs of conscience and sal-\n vation ; and to enforce their decisions by tests and penalties. But\n this can be no other than a bold usurpation of the authority of Christ,\n and the rights of hi s s subjects ; a most grievous injury to truth , and\n the liberties of mankind.\n</p>\n<p>\n Oh ! the tragedies this usurped authority has acted in the world 1\n It was authority that put the Lord of life to death, and opposed the\n propagation of his gospel. It was authority, that brought in purga-\n tory and transubsiantiation, with all the other absurdities of the\n church of Rome, and made them sacred from ridicule. It was au-\n thority that hid the purity of the gospel so long from our eyes, and\n delayed the reformation for ages, before it happened. Authority has\n often consecrated error ; nursed ignorance, and suppressed truth.\n Authority has made knaves. Authority has made fools. But mere\n authority has seldom propagated virtue or true religion. The very\n claim of this authority is a reproach to Christianity, and an insult up-\n on common sense.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Author and Finisher of our faith has given his ministers a\n commission to declare his will ; to administer his ordinances ; to\n receive those to communion, whom the scripture -canon receives ;\n to exclude those whom that excludes ; to reprove them who act\n amiss ; to exhort to repentance, and to enforce their exhortations\n with the highest authority of Almighty God, the awful powers of an-\n other world, and all the engagements of redeeming love. Further\n degrees of church power I know not. The commission which Christ\n gave even to his apostles was, to teach men to observe whatsoever\n HE had commanded them, and nothing else. In vain do we call\n ourselves the ministers of Christ, unless we follow him alone, as our\n ultimate director. As far as we neglect to do this; as far as we\n follow our own imaginations, or the directions of any other unin-\n spired men, without comparing them with the will of Christ; so far\n we cease to be his ministers , and become the ministers of our own\n will , or the will of other weak men like ourselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nothing can be more inconsistent with faithfulness, than for a ser-\n vant, whose commission is limited , to vary from the instructions he\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0068/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 142, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 258}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0068/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 284, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 516}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0068/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 569, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1032}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0068/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1138, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2065}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0068/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2277, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4131}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:th:in:gs:se:ti:np:ro:pe:00:un:se:thingssetinprope00unse:thingssetinprope00unse_0068/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/th/in/gs/se/ti/np/ro/pe/00/un/se/thingssetinprope00unse/thingssetinprope00unse_0068.jp2", "height": 4131, "width": 2277, "levels": 6, "size": 557533}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"68\">\n<p>\n 68\n</p>\n<p>\n has received, and to substitute his own commands instead of his mas-\n ter ' s.
