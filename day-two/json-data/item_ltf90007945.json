Man being adapted to a\n material universe, dependent upon a material organization,\n must be subject to the laws that govern the instrument upon\n which his mind acts to produce its phenomena, and it having\n power to reveal itself only through the co-operation of a\n physical world, it is not a source of astonishment that man,\n when engaged in a study of mind, in relation to matter, should\n become embarrassed and lost; and doubting the reality of what\n he cannot comprehend, despising the voice of Revelation, de\u00ac\n clare that he is a product of matter, a creature of blind neces\u00ac\n sity, exhibiting in his phenomena but a display of the laws of\n the physical world, thus identifying mind and matter.\n</p>\n<p>\n With these views or theories I have no sympathy.

From Ionia it extended to other colonies, and at\n last to Greece proper, where, in consequence of trouble with\n Italy and Persia, it was centered at Athens, and from this in\u00ac\n tellectual center radiated over all Greece. Philosophy found\n its origin in an attempt to determine the elementary principle\n of the world. The first notions were disseminated by oral\n teachings, and handed down by tradition.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thales, B. C., 600, of Miletus, in Ionia, was the first Grecian\n who applied reason to determine the origin of the world. He\n made experiments, and concluded that water was the original\n element, and spirit (vobc) the impulsive principle. From the\n action of the magnet, he inferred that everything had a soul\n and was full of divinity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Pythagoras, B. C., 550, belonging to the same period, taught\n that mind and soul are emanations from the great central fire\n \u2014the Sun. The Sun (the seat of Jupiter) was the most per\u00ac\n fect object in Nature; the principle of heat, and consequently\n of life, permeating and vivifying all things. He regarded the\n soul as being in constant activity, capable of combining with\n any body, and compelled to pass through several successive\n stages. It is supposed that Pythagoras borrowed this theory\n from the Egyptians. (Herodt. ii\u2014123.) Pythagoras is sup\u00ac\n posed also to be the first who attempted, rude as it was, an\n analysis of the operations and faculties of the mind. The in\u00ac\n tellect or understanding was located in the brain; the will\n and appetites in the heart. He made a distinction between\n the human and the animal soul.\n</p>\n<p>\n Heraclitus, B. C., 500, attributed everything to fire\u2014which\n he thought to be the elementary principle upon which every\n thing depended\u2014the foundation of all things. He believed\n that all Force is identical\u2014the principle physical force the\n same as that of thought. Here we find the germ of the doc\u00ac\n trine, if not the doctrine itself, of the equivalence or correla\u00ac\n tion of force, i. e., that heat, light, electricity, chemical affini\u00ac\n ty,* vital force, and mind are identical, and are but different\n modes of motion.\n</p>\n<p>\n Moschus, B.

He says :\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c The brain is the principal, although not the sole organ of\n mind, and its leading functions are mental. The proofs of\n this position are these :\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. u The physical pain of excessive mental excitement is\n located in the head. In extreme muscular fatigue, pain is\n felt in the muscles; irritation of the lungs is referred to the\n chest, indigestion to the stomach, and when mental excerise\n brings on acute irritation, the local seat is the head.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. \u201c Injury or disease of the brain affects the mental powers ;\n a blow on the head destroys consciousness ; physical alterations\n of the nervous substance, as seen after death, are connected\n with loss of speech, loss of memory, insanity, or some other\n mental deprivation or derangement.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. \u201c The products of nervous waste are more abundant after\n mental excitement. These products, eliminated mainly by the\n kidneys, are the alkaline phosphates combined in the triple\n phosphate of ammonia and magnesia. Phosphorus is a charac\u00ac\n teristic ingredient of the nervous substance.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. \u201c There is a general connection between the size of the\n brain and mental energy; in the animal series intelligence in\u00ac\n creases with the development of the brain. The human brain\n exceeds the animal brain, and the most advanced races of men\n have, as a general rule, brains of an unusual size.

Barker, of Yale, in a lecture on the Correlation\n of the Vital and Physical Forces, in 1870, said : \u201c No doubt can\n be entertained that the actual energy of the muscle is simply\n the converted potential carbon of the food. A muscle, there\u00ac\n fore like a steam engine is a machine for converting the po\u00ac\n tential energy of carbon into motion.\u201d He says : \u201c Chemis\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n try teaches that though force, like muscular force comes from\n food, and demonstrates that the force evolved by the brain\n like that produced by the muscle comes not from the disinte\u00ac\n gration of its own tissue, but is the converted energy of burn\u00ac\n ing carbon. Can we longer doubt then, that the brain, too, is\n a machine for the conversion of energy ? Can we longer re\u00ac\n fuse to believe that our thought is in some mysterious way\n correlated to the natural forces ? And this even in the face\n of the fact that it has never yet been measured ?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n When I was a student I was taught to believe in the exist\u00ac\n ence of vital force, the anima of Stolil, the vis medicatrix\n naturae of Cullen, the so-called conservative power of nature of\n other writers.

There is much greater re\u00ac\n semblance between nerve force and electricity than between\n mind and vital force. Thus the muscle with each contraction\n gives off electricity and as exhaustion follows ceases to show\n its presence.* This force, whatever it is, is closely allied in its\n nature to electricity. Yet that it is not electricity is shown by\n the fact that when sufficient time has elapsed after death for\n muscular contractility to cease, no current however strong will\n elicit a response from the then dead muscles. There was a\n force present that electricity could stimulate to activity, yet\n when absent renders electrical action without effect. We know\n that electricity will call muscle into play, will excite the sen\u00ac\n sory organs, causing light, smell, taste and sound to be\n perceived, yet we have no evidence that it will produce thought.\n It will give rise to physical activity but not mental in the\n same manner. Thought follows no known physical law. A\n single thought, expressed perhaps months or years before,\n looming up in consciousness, is often more powerful than all\n else in producing physical activity, yet it is not uniformly\n correlated in physical effects. Thus, what will cause one man\n to swear, stamp and gesticulate furiously, will not perhaps\n have any effect upon another, while a third may suppress, by\n an effort of the will, the rising storm.

Passion may be excited, the emotions almost un\u00ac\n controllable as it were, yet some self-determining power says\n peace, be still; and immediately there is a great calm. Here\n is a force that controls other forces. It is self-acting and self\n determining.

If you determine that mind and the\n motor power of the nerve centers that administer to volun\u00ac\n tary motion are the same, what do you do with involuntary\n muscular action, as the contraction of the heart, intestines,\n stomach, arteries, gland ducts, etc ?

The matter of all bodies is the same in kind\n when traced back to its earliest state. This matter he terms\n \u201cProtoplasm.\u201d He declares this Protoplasm, or Physical\n Basis of Life, to be the clay of the potter, separated by ar\u00ac\n tifice, and not by nature, from the commonest brick or sun\n dried clod.\n</p>\n<p>\n But here Prof. Huxley loses sight of a very important fact,\n when he asserts that all living forms are of the same funda\u00ac\n mental character, and may be likened to the clay in the hands\n of the potter; for he asserts that all vital action is but the re\u00ac\n sult of the molecular forces of the Physical Basis, and further\n concludes, that all thought is but the expression of molecular\n changes in the matter o f life, which is the source of all vital\n phenomena. Now, the moulding force and the clay moulded\n are not the same\u2014the clay does not resolve itself into the\n baked and painted forms, but is moulded by an external force.\n Were we to analyze the clay, the paint, or the baked ware of\n the potter\u2019s shop, our conclusions would be as sensible concern\u00ac\n ing the force that moulded it as are those of Prof. Huxley, in\n asserting that the phenomena of life are self-directing, and\n belong to the oxygen, hydrogen, carbon and other elementary\n compounds which enter into the composition of the body, and\n are said to have inherent to them the properties of vital and\n mental phenomena. His illustrations are most unfortunate for\n his theory, as they nearly always are when an attempt is made\n to set aside the Creator and substitute Force.

The presence of another\n and higher force seems necessary for the proper action of the\n physical forces. Life is an independent force, like mind\u2014a\n force resident in the organization\u2014at times but a transient\n tenant. When vital force ceases to operate, the physical forces\n are powerless. When vital force is active in a plant, the sun\u00ac\n light decomposes the compounds which nourish it\u2014carbonic\n acid releases its carbon, which is deposited in the plant. Re\u00ac\n move this force, and the sun shines in vain upon it. The grain\n of corn, planted beneath the sod, puts forth its sprout before\n sunlight falls upon it. Stored up with the germ is sufficient\n nutriment to maintain its growth until it appears above the\n surface. When this store is expended, sunlight is needed to\n decompose the compounds that shall nourish it.

As we have before stated, the fact that we have no such\n experience, is not conclusive evidence that mind can not so\n exist. It rather tends to show our limited knowledge, than the\n contrary.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another argument advanced is, that mental power is devel\u00ac\n oped only in a degree that corresponds with that of the physio\u00ac\n logical and anatomical development of the cerebral structures.\n Growth of mind keeps pace with growth of brain. Matured\n mind is only functional activity belonging to a fully developed\n cerebral organization.\n</p>\n<p>\n Again, it is alleged that the mind receives its store of knowl\u00ac\n edge through the senses\u2014hence the mind is dependent wholly\n upon the body. The eye gives knowledge of light, color, dis\u00ac\n tance ; the ear of sound; the nerves convey ideas of resist\u00ac\n ance, extension, weight. The destruction of a single organ of\n sense deprives the mind of all knowledge to be obtained in\n that direction. As the organs of sense are one by one de\u00ac\n stroyed, so does the possibility of the mind diminish for the\n acquisition of knowledge. This goes farther than Locke and\n the Sensual school, who declared that there is nothing in the\n mind that has not first been in the senses. It shuts off all\n upon which the Mystics rest in their philosophy\u2014i. e., that the\n mind may be in direct communion with God, and receive di\u00ac\n rect revelations of his will. It reduces the mind to a com\u00ac\n pound body, composed ' of the senses, or makes it but the sum\n total of them, for, however else they may explain it, according\n to this theory we have no knowledge of mind further than that\n learned by the exercise of the senses, and in proportion as\n they are wanting, so is the evidence of mental existence di\u00ac\n minished. For it is clear by this process of reasoning that the\n organs of sense are not servants of the mind, but mind itself.\n By it, if the organs of sense did not first act, there would\n never be mental activity, and there would be increased mental\n activity in proportion as the senses are stimulated.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is true that the main process of developing the idiotic\n mind is through the senses, and unless aroused through them\n can never be aroused. If we regard the senses as only out\u00ac\n posts where sentinels are placed who give the mind notice\n within of all that is observed without, then it in no way fol\u00ac\n lows that they are other than sources of information.\n</p>\n<p>\n Again, and this is the strongest argument that is advanced,\n the materialist urges that mind is a property of brain, for the\n reason that all changes in the brain affect mental activity.

It asserts that when there is motion in the bodi\u00ac\n ly organization, God excites in the mind corresponding repre\u00ac\n sentations. When thoughts arise in the mind, He expresses\n them by a corresponding movement in the body.\n</p>\n<p>\n God, according to the advocates of this scheme, governs the\n universe, and its constituent existence, by the laws according\n to which He has created them ; and as the world was origi\u00ac\n nally called into being by a mere fiat of the divine will, so it\n owes the continuance of its existence from moment to moment\n only to the unremitted perseverence of the same volition. Let\n the sustaining energy of the divine will cease, but for an in\u00ac\n stant, and the universe lapses into nothingness. The exist\u00ac\n ence of created things is thus exclusively maintained by a\n creation, as it were, incessantly renewed. God is thus the\n necessary cause of every modification of mind, and His\n efficiency is sufficient to afford an explanation of the union and\n intercourse of extended and unextended substances.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c External objects determine certain movements in our\n bodily organs of sense, and these movements are, by the nerves\n and animal spirits propagated to the brain. The brain does\n not act immediately and really upon the soul; the soul has no\n direct cognizance of any modification of the brain ; this is im\u00ac\n possible. It is God himself who, by a law which he has estab\u00ac\n lished, when movements are determined in the brain, produces\n analogous modifications in the conscious mind.

As w T e forewarned you\n we fear your conclusions are no clearer than before we began.\n We are unable to demonstrate to you clearly the process by\n which a single thought results, the relation of mind and\n matter by virtue of which mental phenomena are produced.\n We have shown you, more by inference than by direct proof,\n that mind is a final cause, a first cause, an ordinary, directing\n force, dependant upon a material world, a material organiza\u00ac\n tion, and physical laws for its operations and manifestations.\n I admit that every mental action is coincident with some vital\n change in the brain, but I do not admit that mental action\n consists in this vital change, more than that the movement,\n the wear and tear of an engine, is the force that moves it.\n Where else in nature do we find the same thing become at the\n same time cause and effect. The operation of an intelligent\n cause alone can satisfy the mind of man as an explanation of\n</p>\n<p>\n * I. e. the same thing can not be at the same time cause and effect.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:nd:in:tr:od:uc:to:ry:00:mo:rs:mindintroductory00mors:mindintroductory00mors_0030/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 149, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 260}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:nd:in:tr:od:uc:to:ry:00:mo:rs:mindintroductory00mors:mindintroductory00mors_0030/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 299, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 521}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:nd:in:tr:od:uc:to:ry:00:mo:rs:mindintroductory00mors:mindintroductory00mors_0030/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 599, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1043}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:nd:in:tr:od:uc:to:ry:00:mo:rs:mindintroductory00mors:mindintroductory00mors_0030/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1199, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2086}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:nd:in:tr:od:uc:to:ry:00:mo:rs:mindintroductory00mors:mindintroductory00mors_0030/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2398, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4172}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:nd:in:tr:od:uc:to:ry:00:mo:rs:mindintroductory00mors:mindintroductory00mors_0030/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/mi/nd/in/tr/od/uc/to/ry/00/mo/rs/mindintroductory00mors/mindintroductory00mors_0030.jp2", "height": 4172, "width": 2398, "levels": 6, "size": 473155}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"30\">\n<p>\n [ 26 ]\n</p>\n<p>\n the workings of the mind.

The Physiologist\n says : study the brain. Gentlemen, the common sense way is\n to study both. Take a practical view of the question. When\n a medical man is called into court to interpret the elements\n that constitute a case of insanity, does he figure before the\n court and jury brain cells, and processes, talk of connective\n tissue, of tubuli, of cortical and white substance ? Does he\n state how much the brain of the individual is deficient in\n phosphorus, that the laboratory wants stocking up; does he\n discuss brain circulation, the relative weight of brain to mental\n capacity? All questions that are legitimate in their true rela\u00ac\n tions to insanity. No, he becomes at once a Psychologist.\n He considers the power of Will, attention, memory, reasoning\n faculty and judgment. He makes his \u201c opinion \u201d up from a\n metaphysical stand point, and if physical symptoms exist\n indicative of corporeal derangement he details them to\n stengthen the presumption that insanity exists, but in no case\n would he on these alone risk an opinion that would affect his\n reputation. When we study electricity we study not only\n phenomena but materials. We learn what substances are good\n conductors and what are non-conductors. We study strength,\n weight, durability; and when we utilize steam, in the application\n of instruments to every day requirements. What would you\n learn of electricity from an analysis of the conducting wire ?\n What would you learn of steam though you dissected every\n engine in the land without you employed this motor power ?\n What do you learn of nerve force by an analysis, microscopic\n examination, or any test to which you can submit a portion\n of a nerve trunk ? The microscope, the scalpel, and the\n laboratory will give you an insight into healthy brain and nerve\n structure. Study the instrument. The instrument in oper\u00ac\n ation elicits phenomena that are indices of its perfect condition.\n Study the phenomena. The only true method consists in a\n thorough knowledge of the anatomical and physiological rela\u00ac\n tions of the brain, joined to a thorough analysis and classifica\u00ac\n tion of mental phenomena. With this in view, our next lecture\n will discuss the three divisions or departments of the mind,\n recognized by metaphysicians, the Intellect, the Sensibilities,\n and the Will, as a basis for a study of the varieties of insanity.\n When we study the pathology of insanity, the subject will\n receive due consideration from the physiological stand point.\n</p>\n<p>\n And now, gentlemen, in conclusion, let me beg of you not to\n despise any source of information that can afford you light to\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:nd:in:tr:od:uc:to:ry:00:mo:rs:mindintroductory00mors:mindintroductory00mors_0032/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 149, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 260}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:nd:in:tr:od:uc:to:ry:00:mo:rs:mindintroductory00mors:mindintroductory00mors_0032/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 299, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 521}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:nd:in:tr:od:uc:to:ry:00:mo:rs:mindintroductory00mors:mindintroductory00mors_0032/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 599, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1043}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:nd:in:tr:od:uc:to:ry:00:mo:rs:mindintroductory00mors:mindintroductory00mors_0032/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1199, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2086}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:nd:in:tr:od:uc:to:ry:00:mo:rs:mindintroductory00mors:mindintroductory00mors_0032/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2398, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4172}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:nd:in:tr:od:uc:to:ry:00:mo:rs:mindintroductory00mors:mindintroductory00mors_0032/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/mi/nd/in/tr/od/uc/to/ry/00/mo/rs/mindintroductory00mors/mindintroductory00mors_0032.jp2", "height": 4172, "width": 2398, "levels": 6, "size": 343554}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"32\">\n<p>\n [ 28 ]\n</p>\n<p>\n guide you in the study of insanity.
