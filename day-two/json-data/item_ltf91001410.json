The smaller the coin used the more\n difficult to successfully carry out the trick. It is therefore,\n advisable, perhaps, to start with a larger coin, say a dollar,\n and follow this up gradually with smaller coins, until you\n find one which exactly suits the width of your fingers.\n</p>\n<p>\n To commence the trick the coin is placed on the front of\n the hand, being gripped between the tips of the first and\n</p>\n<p>\n Fig. 2.\n</p>\n<p>\n fourth fingers (see Fig. i). You now draw down the two mid-\n dle fingers until the points rest behind the coin at its lower\n end. If you now exert with these two fingers a slight pres-\n sure on the lower part of the coin it revolves between the first\n and fourth fingers (see Fig. 2), and, upon the performer now\n extending carefully the two middle fingers, these stretch out\n in front of the coin (see Fig. 3, which represents a back view)\n (which is now held in same position as at first, except that it\n is at the back instead of the front of the hand), the coin being\n quite invisible and appearing to have vanished. To cover this\n movement, which, of course, should be executed with light-\n ning-like rapidity, the performer makes a short movement\n with the hand as if about to throw the coin away. The slight\n movement facilitates the deception to a great extent. Now,\n to make the coin reappear, the above movements are simply\n reversed. This novel movement should be acquired by both\n hands, which should perform it with equal freedom and ease.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0010/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 263, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 429}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0010/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 526, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 858}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0010/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1053, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1717}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0010/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2107, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3434}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0010/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/br/os/tr/ic/ks/00/do/wn/wehmanbrostricks00down/wehmanbrostricks00down_0010.jp2", "height": 3434, "width": 2107, "levels": 6, "size": 616837}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"10\">\n<p>\n 8\n</p>\n<p>\n MODERN COIN MANIPULATION.\n</p>\n<p>\n With considerable practise this can be accomplished with\n more than one coin.

The hat is now taken by the edge nearest the au-\n dience, aud, with right hand, turned over so that the fingers of\n the left hand containing the 20 coins are brought into the in-\n side of hat (see Fig. 13), in position for the money-catching.

This is repeated, and, as\n the hand goes to the hat to make a pretense of dropping in a\n coin, two coins are quickly palmed in the right hand. You\n look in the air for more coins, and one of those palmed is\n now produced at the finger tips (the mode of which is des-\n cribed on page 5), and visibly dropped into the hat. You\n now produce the second one, but, instead of placing this in\n the hat, one is dropped from the left hand at the same mo-\n ment that the right approaches the top of the hat, thereby\n inducing the audience to believe that the visible coin was\n really placed in the hat.

This lies with the thirty to forty\n half-dollars on the table. These latter coins have in each\n case a small hole drilled through the centre, and in gathering\n them up they are each threaded on the wire attached to the\n trick coin. It is then, of course, an exceedingly easy matter\n to palm them, as none of the coins can slip owing to the wire.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now to describe the correct method as employed by the au-\n thor. The pile of thirty to forty coins is taken between the\n</p>\n<p>\n fingers in exactly the same\n manner as described in\n \u201cThe Elusive Pass.\u201d The\n right hand now makes a\n motion of passing the coins\n into the left, but in reality\n the two fingers holding the\n coins bend \u2019round and palm\n them in the right hand, in\n the position shown in Fig.\n 34, the left hand closing at\n the same time and the right\n hand keeping in an upright\n position pointing at the left.\n The left hand is now shown\n empty. The right hand can\n be brought down to\n hang in a natural position\n by slightly bending the\n third finger \u2019round on to\n the top of the coins, which\n keeps them from falling, and the same can be produced in any\n manner the performer desires.\n</p>\n<p>\n The author\u2019s favorite method is to produce them in a shower\n from under the vest. This is accomplished in the following\n manner : As the right hand (containing the coins) lifts up the\n edge of the vest with the first finger and thumb, the third\n finger, which it will be remembered is supporting the coins,\n pushes them under the vest. The stomach is now expanded\n and the hand can almost be withdrawn, and by gradually\n drawing in the abdomen the coins escape, a few at a time, and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0031/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 263, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 429}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0031/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 526, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 858}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0031/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1053, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1717}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0031/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2107, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3434}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0031/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/br/os/tr/ic/ks/00/do/wn/wehmanbrostricks00down/wehmanbrostricks00down_0031.jp2", "height": 3434, "width": 2107, "levels": 6, "size": 430719}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"31\">\n<p>\n MODERN COIN MANIPULATION.\n</p>\n<p>\n 29\n</p>\n<p>\n fall into the right hand which is waiting to receive them.

Fig. 37 gives\n the secret of the trick: A A are two\n minute flesh-colored rubber bands en-\n circling the finger and supporting a\n very fine flesh-colored tube, through\n which the needle D runs, the latter be-\n ing pushed up and down by the thumb.\n The borrowed coins are, of course, ex-\n changed for duplicates, each of which\n has a hole drilled completely through\n from one milled edge to the other. It\n is therefore obvious that when a coin is\n placed in a perpendicular position on\n the finger tips and the needle pushed\n up into the drilled hole, it will adhere\n to the finger with ease. To balance\n the others the needle is pushed up far\n enough each time to enter the next\n coin. It is as well when endeavoring to\n balance the first coin to let it fall once\n or twice, thereby giving the impression\n that it is a feat of genuine dexterity.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0038/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 263, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 429}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0038/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 526, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 858}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0038/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1053, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1717}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0038/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2107, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3434}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0038/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/br/os/tr/ic/ks/00/do/wn/wehmanbrostricks00down/wehmanbrostricks00down_0038.jp2", "height": 3434, "width": 2107, "levels": 6, "size": 681815}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"38\">\n<p>\n 36\n</p>\n<p>\n MODERN COIN MANIPULATION.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO PASS TWENTY COINS FROM ONE HAND\n TO THE OTHER.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this trick the performer borrows, say, 20 half-dollars, and\n holds them spread out in a fan in the left hand (palm towards\n audience).

The hat was suspended at the bottom of the ladder,\n as in the engraving. The coins were now placed in the glass\n tumbler, which was covered with a handkerchief, and placed\n on the top of the ladder. The performer now remembers that\n he intended to place more than six coins in the glass, and so\n proceeds, as in the \u201cMiser\u2019s Dream,\u201d to catch a few in the\n air, which vanish from his hands and are unmistakably heard\n to fall into the tumbler (still on top of the ladder and covered\n with handkerchief). The coins in the glass are now com-\n manded to pass, one at a time , from the top to the bottom of\n the ladder, which they do, falling from one glass slab to an-\n other till they reach the hat at the base of the ladder. The\n tumbler is now taken down, still covered with the handker-\n chief, which the audience remove, when the coins are seen to\n have vanished, and upon the hat being examined, there are\n the coins. The six half-dollars originally borrowed are then\n handed back to the lender with thanks. Now for the secret.\n</p>\n<p>\n The top of the ladder is in reality a box containing the\n mechanism of the illusion. At the rear is a kind of drawer,\n into which six duplicate coins (or as many more as you intend\n using) are placed. Now upon an assistant in the wings pull-\n ing a cord, one of these coins is let through the top of the lad-\n der on to the first glass slab, the latter being arranged so that,\n when a coin drops on to it, the coin immediately slides to the\n lower edge and then drops on to the next slab \u2014 this being re-\n peated until the coin has reached the hat. ' One of the vases,\n apparently placed on the ladder for ornament, is a trick one.\n A few coins are previously placed in the bowl of this vase and\n upon an assistant pulling another cord a piston rises, making\n these coins jump up and fall again. This latter effect is to\n produce the sound of the extra coins being invisibly\n passed into the tumbler. The glass used is, first of all, filled\n with water to prove that it is a genuine one, but in the act of\n throwing the water away, it is dropped on a servante be-\n hind a chair, and a duplicate one brought away, no one hav-\n ing the slightest suspicion that it has been changed if it is\n done neatly.

The secret is this : The coins have\n a small hole drilled through their centres, also the glass has a\n hole drilled through its bottom ; likewise the table has a\n small hole where you stand the glass. A strong knotted\n thread is passed through the coins, thence into and through\n the tumbler, and finally the end is carried down through the\n table, and out to a concealed assistant. The coins rest upon\n the servante of your table, directly behind the glass.

As the coin falls through upon the plate, it can be seen\n and heard all over the house. The explanation is that in the\n tube, when making it, you place a coin-dropping apparatus\n that can be secured at the magical dealer\u2019s. A thread of wire\n runs through one side of the ribbon that holds the tube, and\n is fastened by a hook while attaching the ribbon to the tube,\n aud when your assistant pulls the string it releases one coin\n at a time, and after the experiment is finished you take down\n the tube, showing it empty, palming off the box. A good\n way to secure it, when making the tube, is when your assist-\n ant brings out the cardboard on a waiter\u2019s tray, which, al-\n though innocent-enough looking, has a double bottom that\n you have your box in, with a small wire attached to it, so that\n when lifting up the cardboard your finger goes through the\n loop in the wire, bringing the small box back of the card\n board, aud when you make the tube you have it already in-\n side. You make the tube of cardboard to fit exactly the coin\n box inside, and have a catch attached to the ribbon so when\n you fasten it to the tube it also clasps the little box inside,\n holding it suspended. A small ring fastened to the thread or\n wire running through one side of the ribbon slips over a\n catch, which liberates the coins.\n</p>\n<p>\n AN OLD TRICK IMPROVED.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our readers will probably recall the following very puzzling\n trick, which made its appearance a few years ago. A sheet of\n brown paper was laid on the table, and an ordinary tumbler\n was inverted upon it. Beside the tumbler, and on the brown\n paper, was laid a ten-cent piece, and, a borrowed handker-\n chief being thrown over the tumbler, any person is asked to\n set the tumbler over the ten-cent piece. Now, upon raising\n the handkerchief, the ten-cent piece (which should be under\n the glass) had vanished. The secret consists in the fact that\n a round disc of paper of the same sort as that on which the\n tumbler stood, was neatly pasted on the mouth of the tum-\n bler, just covering it. Of course, when under cover of the\n handkerchief, the tumbler was set over the dime, the paper\n disc covered aud caused it to vanish apparently. Now, this\n is the new version of the trick.

The glass will thus appear devoid of preparation.\n However, there is a disc of white paper on the mouth of the\n tumbler, but this does not show against your white shirt\n bosom. Now, behind this disc, and against it, you hold with\n your finger a penny, and when you set the tumbler bottom\n upon the sheet of paper, there will be under it a penny, but it\n will be invisible. Now you make an ordinary paper cone\n which just fits over the glass, and is open at the top. Then\n you borrow a penny, and dropping it in the top of the cone\n it is plainly heard to fall on the bottom of the tumbler. You\n now command the penny to pass down through the tumbler\n on to the paper. Upon lifting the tumbler in the cone, the\n penny appears on the paper.

Again it drops, and again he picks it up,\n but this time with the left hand, when he takes it apparently\n with the right, but really, by means of the drop, leaves it in\n the left hand. The fingers recommence the rubbing of the\n elbow, as though they still held the coin : but meanwhile the\n left hand, which is brought by the bent position of the arm\n closer to the neck, drops the coin inside the performer\u2019s col-\n lar, to be found at pleasnre. Meanwhile the performer con-\n tinues the rubbing, presently removing the fingers, showing\n that apparently the coin has passed into his elbow, both\n hands being empty.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO TELL DATE ON BORROWED COIN.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is one of the very best parlor tricks in existence. Per-\n former, whilst blindfolded, desires spectator to hand him a\n half-dollar, which he, the performer, simply drops on the table,\n instantly naming the date on same.\n</p>\n<p>\n To commence the trick you have a duplicate coin, the date\n of which you are acquainted with, palmed in the right hand,\n and as you take the borrowed coin between finger and thumb,\n exchange it for the palmed one in the act of throwing same\n on the table.

The\n coins are apparently placed in the left hand, which closes, but\n in reality are stacked on the outside of fingers, being sup-\n ported by the little finger of the left hand. Right is now\n shown empty and passes over left, during which movement\n the coins can very easily be palmed off into the right hand\n without a sound or suspicious movement being made. Left\n hand is then opened ai^d shown empty, coins being produced\n as fancy dictates. Five minutes\u2019 practice will suffice to show\n what a really brilliant move this is.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE NEW GLASS COIN-JAR.\n</p>\n<p>\n The following will be found a pretty effective little trick,\n worked either with a coin show or by itself. A pretty glass\n jar, containing a silk American or other flag, is brought on\n and placed on table, the stopper is removed and thoroughly\n examined. The flag is taken out and laid on table, and the\n jar held horizontally by the top and bottom and looked\n through by performer to show no trickery. Jar is replaced\n on table and stopper put in, and the whole covered with the\n flag. A silver tripod, with ring at top to receive dish, is next\n placed over jar. Four coins are now placed in a glass dish,\n and placed on top of the tripod. On removing flag the coins\n are seen and heard to fall into the jar and to have left the\n dish on tripod. Dish, tripod, and jar can now be thoroughly\n examined. Now for the solution. In each side of neck of\n jar, which is roughly cut so as to be opaque, are drilled two holes,\n through which is pushed from one side to the other a U-shaped\n piece of wire, twisted at the base so as to make a tiny ring, to\n which is fastened a piece of fine thread (the same length as the\n distance between the opposite corners of flag), the other end\n of thread is fastened to a corner of the flag, and this corner,\n together with the whole of the thread, is stuffed into the jar\n through the space A, the opposite corner of flag only being\n allowed to stick out of the top of jar so as to be at hand. The\n coins are now placed on the wire and hidden by the corner of\n the flag. The jar can now be shown \u2019round, the coins being\n lept steady by the first finger of the left hand. Now place\n jar on table, still keeping first finger of left hand on coins.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0079/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 263, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 429}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0079/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 526, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 858}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0079/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1053, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1717}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0079/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2107, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3434}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0079/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/br/os/tr/ic/ks/00/do/wn/wehmanbrostricks00down/wehmanbrostricks00down_0079.jp2", "height": 3434, "width": 2107, "levels": 6, "size": 422376}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"79\">\n<p>\n MODERN COIN MANIPULATION.\n</p>\n<p>\n 77\n</p>\n<p>\n and draw out the flag quickly with the right hand, which\n proves indirectly that nothing is concealed in the neck of the\n jar, and having taken up jar horizontally by both ends and\n looked through it, place stopper in and cover with flag, the\n</p>\n<p>\n Fig. 89 (New Glass Coin-Jar).\n</p>\n<p>\n corner with thread attached hanging at back.

In appearance it is as follows:\n Any gentleman is invited to assist you, and is seated in a chair\n in the centre of the stage, facing the audience. You take\n an empty soda-water bottle (one of the round end variety) and,\n standing it upright upon its head, you ask him to steady it\n with both hands so that it does not fall. Now you borrow\n any half-dollar and have it marked by the owner ; taking it\n in your right hand, you, in full view of the audience, make as\n if to throw it towards the bottle. The sound of a falling coin\n is heard, and upon your bidding the gentleman to take down\n the bottle and shake it, a half-dollar is seen to be within.\n You take the bottle down to the audience and turning it over\n it is seen that the neck of same is smaller than the coin.\n You now step to your table, and taking a hammer break the\n bottle over a small box, and picking up the bottom of the\n bottle you pass it, containing the coin, to the owner, who\n identifies his coin. The secret is this : You have two bottles,\n one of which is prepared in this manner : the round bottom is\n sawed off, and a half-dollar placed in it, and the bottom ce-\n mented on again. On the back of the chair (which is solid) is\n fastened a little wire bottle-rack, in which the prepared bottle\n is placed beforehand. Beside this little rack is a cloth bag, and\n as you step up behind the seated subject to place the bottle\n upon his head, you rapidly drop the bottle into the bag, and,\n with the same motion, bring up into view the prepared bottle,\n which you place upon his head, with the request that he hold\n it. As the bottom is round, the coin cannot be seen from a\n distance, and the same reason also necessitates his holding on\n to it, else it will tumble over. After vanishing the coin by\n palming, you request him to shake the bottle, which he does,\n and the coin is seen to be in it. It is then shown that the\n neck is too small to admit the half-dollar, after which yon\n hold it over a box containing sawdust and break it. You then\n pick up the bottom, and at the same time substitute the\n marked coin for the one that was first in it, and pass bottom\n aud coin to the owner.\n</p>\n<p>\n NEW COINS AND DIE,\n</p>\n<p>\n This is an improvement on a trick that is as old as our\n grandfathers, and explained in the first books of magic.

The\n trick from time immemorial has been worked with either the\n English penny or American two-cent piece. Now the use of\n a two-cent piece is not advisable, for it is not an easy matter\n to borrow them from an assembly, and for a conjuror to take\n them from his pocket himself is bad taste and also suspicious.\n It is best to get a stack of ten half-dollars, and the only real\n coin is the top one, the rest are manufactured coins, for sale at a\n reasonable price by the magical dealers. Now over this set of\n coins make a shell to represent a like number of coins, the\n top being a real coin turned down thin, and the rest of the\n fake a tube of German silver or brass, silver-plated and\n grooved and milled. The first stack of coins are each one sin-\n gle, but connected with a rivet through all of them, this al-\n lows them to be moved a trifle on each other, which helps to\n dispel any suspicion that might arise as to their genuineness.\n To prepare the trick, place the shell stack over the first or\n hollow stack. For abbreviation\u2019s sake, we will call it stack i,\n and the other, stack 2, is the outside shell ; both look now as\n one. Inside of interior of No. 1 place a die or ball ; we will\n suppose we have a cork ball. Now place over the open euds\n a real silver coin, and have this in a place of concealment\n easily got at. You now have a stack of ten imitation coins and\n one real one. Ask for a number of half-dollars, starting by\n using one of your own, and after you have borrowed ten you\n place them on the table and then stack them up, one at a\n time, counting them. Suppose now the fake coins are con-\n cealed in the left-tail coat pocket. Pick up the pile of coins from\n the table in left hand, and remark that you will try to send\n the coins through the table, pretending to take them 111 the\n right hand, but really retaining them in the left, strike the ta-\n ble with the right hand, and advance the left hand with concealed\n coins under the table, as you do so allow the coins to escape from\n your hand quickly but singly into the left-hand pocket, and\n grasp the concealed fake set. The pocket should be double,\n so the real coins can be dropped and not interfere with the\n coniuror obtaining the other set in portion of pocket, or this\n set can be in pants pocket. The falling of the coins in the\n pocket sounds to the spectators like coins falling into the con-\n luror\u2019s hands, after passing through the table. Bringing up\n the fake set he places them on the table witn real com and\n open side of fake down. Again counting the coins as they set\n 011 the table, he remarks he has eleven instead of ten, which\n is all he requires, he pushes away the bottom or real coin and\n places it in his pocket, then takes out a little cork ball, placing\n it on the table. Taking up a piece of paper, he makes into a\n little cap or cone to fit over the coins, but remarks that it fits\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0082/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 255, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 426}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0082/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 510, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 853}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0082/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1021, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1707}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0082/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2042, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3415}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0082/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/br/os/tr/ic/ks/00/do/wn/wehmanbrostricks00down/wehmanbrostricks00down_0082.jp2", "height": 3415, "width": 2042, "levels": 6, "size": 427173}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"82\">\n<p>\n 8 o\n</p>\n<p>\n MODERN COIN MANIPULATION.\n</p>\n<p>\n too tight; he removes it, and says he will use it to cover the\n cork ball, which he does ; he then makes another cover for\n the coins, and this seems to be all right.

This will not be found at all difficult of accom-\n plishment, but will, on the other hand, probably create in\n the mind of the artist a sense of originality hitherto absent.\n In conjuring, as in all other professions, originality stands\n pre-eminent as the root of success, and, unless the aspirant\n for honors in the magical world possesses a certain amount of\n absolute originality, the author fears his chances of making\n even a respectable livelihood are very remote indeed.\n</p>\n<p>\n When a particular performer introduces a new idea, the\n same is immediately copied and imitated ad lib., but the imi-\n tators and copyists never do much, for the simple reason that\n they are looked upon as not possessing sufficient originality to\n produce a novel act.\n</p>\n<p>\n Almost without exception, all the imitators of \u201cThe Miser\u2019s\n Dream \u201d that the author has witnessed have, in the course of\n their entertainment, used his original patter, word for word.\n This can be excused in young conjurors, starting up the lad-\n der, but when certain performers, each with something of a\n reputation, not only perform the identical tricks but use ex-\n actly the same boniment , it certainly does not add to their\n reputation, but, on the contrary, undoubtedly does it injury.\n</p>\n<p>\n The author was present, a few weeks siuce, at one of the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0084/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 255, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 426}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0084/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 510, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 853}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0084/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1021, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1707}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0084/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2042, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3415}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0084/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/br/os/tr/ic/ks/00/do/wn/wehmanbrostricks00down/wehmanbrostricks00down_0084.jp2", "height": 3415, "width": 2042, "levels": 6, "size": 661903}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"84\">\n<p>\n 82\n</p>\n<p>\n MODERN COIN MANIPULATION.\n</p>\n<p>\n most popular places of entertainment in London, where a\n certain \u201cgreatest one that ever lived,\u201d etc., was \u201cdoing\u201d\n \u201cThe Miser\u2019s Dream,\u201d with some of the additional effects de-\n jcribed in this book, and for each particular experiment the\n performer spoke the exact patter as used by the writer during\n his extensive Palace Theatre engagement.\n</p>\n<p>\n The author does not wish to appear egotistical, but simply\n mentions the foregoing facts to show the amateur how a repu-\n tation is \u201c not \u2019 made.\n</p>\n<p>\n Aspiring coin manipulators and conjurors have the writer\u2019s\n best wishes for their success, and should one ever do him the\n pleasure of calling upon him in any city where he is perform-\n ing, he will be only too pleased to give him any personal ad-\n vice in his power. But he impresses upon them the fact that\n they must invent and originate new ideas. Sit down and\n think, and think, and think again, until an idea occurs to you ;\n then start to work to elaborate your idea, not only into a sin-\n gle trick, but, if possible, into a complete act. Cards, billiard\n balls, handkerchiefs, cigars, eggs, flags, etc., are each quite ca-\n pable of being made into a\u2019 whole act. Whatever your perform-\n ance may consist of, endeavor to have as little as possible\n on the stage in the way of apparatus or preparation. In fact,\n the sleight-of-hand performer that appears on practically a\n bare stage, stands much more chance of \u201c being talked about \u201d\n than the one that has an elaborate and even costly \u201cfit up.\u201d\n The latter, of course, may be pleasing to the eye, but it always\n savors of mechanism. A plain stage, with perhaps a single\n tripod gueridon , looks far more difficult for a conjuror to\n work upon than the \u201c boxed-iu \u201d curtain arrangement now so\n frequently adopted by performers.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, having originated a new act, the next thing for the\n performer to do is to practise and learn the proper manner in\n which to present it to the public. If the performer is at all\n \u201c heavy\u201d and too serious, no matter how clever his dexterity\n is, the audience feel the same, whereas, on the other hand, if\n the artist possesses a pleasing manner, fluent speech, and ex-\n hibits the appearance of being quite at home, doing nothiug\n in a stiff or awkward manner, the audience likewise are\n pleased. Of course, it will be said, \u201cYes, that\u2019s all very well,\n but enormous practice and public performance are essential to\n a perfect stage manner.\u201d This may, perhaps, be true to a\n certain extent, but, nevertheless, if the novice sets his mind\n on presenting an act in .a certain manner, and always sticks to\n that manner, he will find that he will not have much further\n trouble about stage presence.\n</p>\n<p>\n The conjuring professiou is exactly like a business of any\n other description.

Mr. Golden, who\n is now billed as \u201cThe Great Golden,\u201d owes his success to his\n original methods. Aside from his marvelous tricks, nature\n endowed him with a \u201cfunny dialect,\u201d which adds greatly to\n his success. Golden\u2019s \u201cbag of funny tricks\u201d never fails to\n \u201cmake good\u201d with all classes of audiences, as he has a pecu-\n liar and original style of his own. The writer has always ad-\n mired Mr. Golden\u2019s performance, and oredicts for him a grea\u2018\n fnture in the magical world.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another American conjuror and mystifier, who is now cre-\n ating a sensation in Europe, is Harry Houdini. Mr. Houdini\n is styled the \u201c King of Handcuffs,\u201d and justly, too. Houdini\n has completely baffled the police authorities all over the\n world by releasing himself from all kinds of handcuffs , leg-\n shackles , and prison irons. In Dresden, Germany, Houdini\n was locked securely by the police authorities with over 90\n pounds of prison irons, and succeeded in releasing himself\n from all the locks in less than eight seconds, returning all of\n the irons, etc., unlocked. Houdini does not use \u201c trick cuffs,\u201d\n and claims he does not use keys to unlock the locks. We un-\n derstand that a certain dealer of magical apparatus in Ger-\n many (who, by the way, seems to be very jealous of the suc-\n cess of American conjurors), undertook to unmask and expose\n Houdini during his recent and most successful engagement in\n Berlin.

Great\n care has been exercised by the author to in-\n clude in this book only such tricks as have\n never before appeared in print. This as-\n sures the performer a secret and almost\n endless fund for suitable material to be\n used on all occasions. With little practice,\n almost any one can perform the more sim-\n ple tricks, and with more practice, becom-\n ing more adept, be can perform the most dif-\n ficult ones.

Barriers have been thrust aside, and this great knowledge has '\n been grasped from the hands of those who wished to keep it from the\n people. No greater wealth can be gained than through a knowledge of\n Hypnotism. He who can control the body and mind of whomsoever he\n chooses, to him every hour is rich with love, every moment jeweled with\n joy, and the world\u2019s purse-strings are at his command.

The first\n</p>\n<p>\n recorded business transaction wherein actual money was used\n was when Abraham purchased the cave of Machpelah for a\n burial place for his wife at a cost of \u201c400 shekels of silver,\n current money with the merchants.\u201d This was 2,000 years\n before Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n Since then money has been in demand continuously and\n today, when husbands find it hard to get or hold steady jobs,\n when wives are at their wits ends to buy all the things they\n need, and every child is eager to earn extra money, the uni-\n versal question is: \u201cHow can I earn more money?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This book answers that question. Whether you live in the\n country or the city, you will find a dozen or more ways in\n which you can make money, by a careful reading of the pages\n of this book. Each of the hundred and ond ways are actual\n instances of persons in ordinary walks of life who have used\n these means of adding to their incomes. Facts and figures\n are given in most cases and though costs of raw materials dif-\n fer in some communities \u2014 the difference is very small \u2014 while\n the margin of profit increases according to your skill.\n</p>\n<p>\n The reader is warned that there are no get-rich-quick or\n \u201cmiraculous\u201d schemes in this book. These plans are bona\n fide, practical ways of making money. Choose your way,\n begin gradually and work hard. The result is assured.\n Others have done these things.\n</p>\n<p>\n Price Fifty Cents\n</p>\n</page>\n"}]], "djvu_text_file": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/br/os/tr/ic/ks/00/do/wn/wehmanbrostricks00down/wehmanbrostricks00down_djvu.txt", "epub_file": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/br/os/tr/ic/ks/00/do/wn/wehmanbrostricks00down/wehmanbrostricks00down.epub", "url": "https://www.loc.gov/resource/dcmsiabooks.wehmanbrostricks00down/", "image": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:we:hm:an:br:os:tr:ic:ks:00:do:wn:wehmanbrostricks00down:wehmanbrostricks00down_0003/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "representative_index": 2, "fulltext_file": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/br/os/tr/ic/ks/00/do/wn/wehmanbrostricks00down/wehmanbrostricks00down_djvu.xml", "pdf": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/we/hm/an/br/os/tr/ic/ks/00/do/wn/wehmanbrostricks00down/wehmanbrostricks00down.pdf"}]}
