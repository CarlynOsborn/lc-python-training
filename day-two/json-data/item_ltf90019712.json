Such things frighten the gentle and\n lovely spirit of the gospel, and oftentimes misguide a whole peo\u00ac\n ple. Religion loves full investigations, and scorns those which\n are partial. Says the excellent Foster, \u201c first impressions are\n fallacious guides to right actions.\u201d I believe, that I have com\u00ac\n mitted more mistakes for want of investigation, before I decided,\n especially on novel subjects, than from any other cause, during\n my whole life. And it is submitted also, whether the evil has\n not considerable extent among ministers at large. I am also\n convinced from observation, that this church and people have\n oftener misjudged, and thrown themselves into unhappy results,\n from the same cause, than from any other whicli can be named.\n These sudden impulses, and partial examinations, are the false\n inductions, against which, logicians, and the best of theologians,\n have warned in every age, more than against any one thing in\n all their writings. The evil has been the foundation of error in\n every generation, and the bane of truth.

Not only the truth de\u00ac\n mands this, but the age in which we live. One truth is plain,\n that no minister can communicate to an audience, what he\n himself does not know. No man ever despised learning, but he\n who did not possess it. Education enables a man to investigate,\n simplify, arrange and make plain the truths of salvation, or any\n truths which he aims to communicate. It is designed to furnish\n the mind with knowledge, and to assist the thoughts and ex\u00ac\n pression, so that the sense will be clear, and the truth forcible.\n On the other hand, how painful it is to see a grand doctrine of\n salvation, in the management of a preacher, who cannot inves\u00ac\n tigate, nor arrange, nor express himself clearly; but who sur\u00ac\n rounds his subject with some affected pompous expressions,\n which rather shed darkness than light on the noble truth. Your\n numbers, in this place, are such, and your degree of education,\n that no uneducated, superficial man is sufficient to meet the\n wants of this people, though he may be pious, and labor with\n zeal. Besides, an educated minister is a continual help to the\n improvement of the rising generation, and at the same time,\n disciplines the minds of the whole church and congregation\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0005/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 148, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 262}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0005/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 524}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0005/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1048}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0005/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1186, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2097}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0005/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2373, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4195}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0005/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/fa/re/we/ll/se/rm/on/pr/00/bu/sh/farewellsermonpr00bush/farewellsermonpr00bush_0005.jp2", "height": 4195, "width": 2373, "levels": 6, "size": 590656}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"5\">\n<p>\n into just modes of estimating the truth, and shows them, when\n a tiling is proved, and when not proved. Your future minister,\n therefore, should be a man of solid education.\n</p>\n<p>\n He should be a man of simple verily. This looks lovely in\n any man, but in a minister, it has great force on the conscien\u00ac\n ces of a guilty world. It has opened a passage, and carried\n many a nsinister through a host of evils. Preachers of the\n gospel are under great temptations to depart from it, owing to\n the desire of mankind for extravagant accounts, and fondness\n in ministers to be thought favored instruments. But if a minis\u00ac\n ter is not careful on this point, God will send leanness into his\n soul, and he will even learn his people to make light, both of\n truth and falsehood. No man who indulges in this habit, will\n be able long to be unseen. All a minister\u2019s preaching there\u00ac\n fore, all his narratives, all his conversations, should be simple\n verit} ' . It should shine in his very features, and in every ex-\n pr(3Ssion of his whole being. If he finds hi/nself at any time, to\n have been under a mistake, he should correct it before his peo\u00ac\n ple, that he .may stand before them unsuspected, as an honest\n man. President Edwards resolved, that he would always\n speak simple verity.\u201d Such a man will find support in his own\n bosom, and lift up his face to God. He need not, and he will\n not be afraid of his own pulpit. But the moment, that he\n begins to vary from simple verity, he brings trouble into his own\n conscience, if he has one, and if he has none, he will soon sac\u00ac\n rifice his influence in the confidence of the people. May simple\n verity, theiefore, be on the breast-plate, and in the whole life of\n your future minister. A single detection of a departure frem\n this, will remain on the minds of his hearers, many years.\n</p>\n<p>\n He should be a man of studious habits. No man can avoid\n being superficial, when this is not the case. In such cases the\n human mind loses its discipline and balance, and becomes\n diffuse and irregular in its communications. Some men of\n native talents, who hate study, sometimes nearly smile at the\n studious habits of others, and seem to pride themselves in being\n able to command attention without it. But the effect is inva\u00ac\n riably seen, in their own leanness, and in the poverty of knowl\u00ac\n edge among their people. Such pastors educate a people to\n be like themselves, whose latter end is usually leaner than their\n beginning; and what is worse still, they are left to be carried\n about by every wind of doctrine. The bible has put this partic\u00ac\n ular beyond a doubt. God commanded the priests of old to\n carry beaten oil into the sanctuary. Paul directed Timothy\n to \u201c give attendance to reading,\u201d and to \u201cstudy to show him\u00ac\n self approved unto God, a workman that needeth not to be\n ashamed, rightly dividing the word of truth.\u201d Ministers also\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0006/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 144, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0006/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 288, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 514}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0006/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 577, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1028}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0006/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1154, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2057}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0006/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2309, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4115}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0006/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/fa/re/we/ll/se/rm/on/pr/00/bu/sh/farewellsermonpr00bush/farewellsermonpr00bush_0006.jp2", "height": 4115, "width": 2309, "levels": 6, "size": 594557}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"6\">\n<p>\n G\n</p>\n<p>\n are farther charged to biing out of the treasure of God\u2019s word,\n things new and old, and to give to every one their portion of\n meat in due season.

He should study to make study a pleasure,\n and carry the pleasure down to his old age.\n</p>\n<p>\n He should be a man well versed in systematic theology; one\n who can trace and connect the relative proportions of the\n truths of the bible, and present them in the beauty of their\n moral harmony, giving to each its due place and importance.\n Truth thus seen, powerfully affects and charms the mind. Such\n a preacher will interest and impress an audience more in six\n months, than others, unaquainted with the symmetry and rela\u00ac\n tive proportions of bible truth, can in years. To illustrate this,\n an ignorant man sees some beauty,* when he looks upon the\n starry heavens, and imagines, he discovers some signs of order\n and harmony there. But he vvilf never feel that charm, and\n deep awe at the sight, that an astronomer will, who has inves\u00ac\n tigated that system of worlds, in their connection and relative\n proportions, and has discovered how they \u201cstand or move\u201d\n in obedience to their Maker\u2019s will. The reason is plain ; parts\n only, and those obscurely, are presented to the mind of the\n ignorant man. Whereas the whole comes down to the astron\u00ac\n omer\u2019s mind in all its proportions, beauty and grandeur, which\n convince, charm and overwhelm him with astonishment and\n wonder. A thousand other similitudes of a like nature might\n be adduced as illustrations. So a man, ignorant ot the system\u00ac\n atical connection of bible truth, may be a good man, and\n preach not much else but truth, and sometimes render some\n branch of truth striking, and may do good in this apostate world.\n But such a man will never be able to preach the doctrine of\n justification by faith without the deeds of the law in its connec\u00ac\n tions with the other great truths of the bible. He will even be\n exposed to falter on the doctrines of atonement, regeneration,\n and many others. It is plain also, that the preacher cannot\n carry his audience beyond where he goes himself. But when\n the preacher has investigated, and gone into the system himself,\n and seen its beauty and felt its power, he can bring it out to his\n people in all its proportions, charms, and majesty. May such a\n man be your future minister. Ignorance may smile here, but\n wisdom and grace never can. If a preacher would have solid\n heat in his own bosom, it niust be drawn from such sources as\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0007/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 148, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 262}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0007/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 524}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0007/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1048}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0007/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1186, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2097}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0007/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2373, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4195}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0007/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/fa/re/we/ll/se/rm/on/pr/00/bu/sh/farewellsermonpr00bush/farewellsermonpr00bush_0007.jp2", "height": 4195, "width": 2373, "levels": 6, "size": 652663}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"7\">\n<p>\n 7\n</p>\n<p>\n these.

They do not invite him to associate with all the separate\n interests of the community, which often clash one with another,\n and which in the present tense, cannot be associated directly\n with the object of his calling. But his object is specific, and of\n a heaven-born nature. His oath to God, at the time of h ' m\n consecration, is of the same nature. He there engaged to\n remove hindrances, and waste his powers, and consume his\n life, to carry forward the objects of his ministry. For this end\n also was he clothed by God with his commission. Here there\u00ac\n fore, should he fix, and never be moved by this tumultuous\n world. We have some fine examples of this. Christ\u2019s was\n the most luminous; he let Caesar take care of his sepa\u00ac\n rate interests. He let the Jews take care of their worldly\n economy, while he was engaged about his Father\u2019s business;\n for this he lived, and for this he died. The attention and spirit\n of all the apostles to their calling were the same. Paul said to\n his hearers, \u201c 1 determined not to know anything among you,\n save Jesus Christ and him crucified, and was with you in weak\u00ac\n ness, and in fear, and in much trembling.\u201d The same has been\n the spirit of the best ministers on the whole theatre of provi\u00ac\n dence. A minister, therefore, must be a man, who has an\n opinion of his own, formed on his best judgment of the bible,\n from which he should not be easily moved. He should be no\n party man. Every party will endeavor to enlist him, and make\n a draft of his influence to their separate interests. But on such\n subjects he should hold no conference with flesh and blood, lest\n his own work should cease. In short, he should be a man, who\n can be neither tempted, frowned, flattered, led, or driven from\n his appropriate calling. No man, but such a man,can ever safely\n manage this church and people, or any other, in things which\n pertain to the kingdom of God. How afflicting the case, when\n a minister has not moral courage enough to stand at his post,\n and work in his own vineyard, but through fear or covetousness\n is driven all ways. He usually has, however, his reward in\n contempt to his person, and in the distractions of his people.\n</p>\n<p>\n He should be a zealous preacher ; a cold one is not of much\n service in this sleepy world. To speak of God\u2019s love, of sin,\n of heaven, of hell, and of the death of Christ with a dull heart,\n and frozen lips, will never move apostate nature, nor much\n enliven a Christian.

Elijah was a fine example of this, when the moral\n death around him was nearly universal, he burnt hke a constant\n fiame. So Christ was ever shining in holy zeal. The apostles\n were other examples.

Fitful zeal is animal, and\n usually selfish, it cannot be divine ; and all people, who have\n this only, should suspect themselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n He should not be a man greedy of the world. If worldly things,\n however, are communicated to him, he should direct them to\n be managed with economy, that nothing be lost.

For the love of money is the root of\n all evil.\u201d In view of this passage, the apostle says to Timothy,\n \u201cO man of God, flee these things.\u201d The priests of old were\n not permitted to expect much wealth in this world, but it was\n added for their consolation, that the Lord was their inheritance.\n</p>\n<p>\n He should not be a man fond of debate^ and yet be able when\n duty calls to contend earnestly for the faith once delivered to\n the saints. Some ministers seek opportunities to enter the lists\n with all they find. But it is a great unhappiness; their people\n partake of the same spirit, and usually both minister and peo\u00ac\n ple are alternately filled with pride and mortification. God\n judges the practice. The apostle calls it \u2018 vain jangling,\u201d and\n warns ministers most solemnly against it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Your minister should be no boaster.

Perhaps, there is no particular in which ministers\n of the gospel oftener fail.\n</p>\n<p>\n Your minister should not be abrupt and rough in his man*\n ners. This in a minister stops the ears of all classes of people,\n both good and bad, vulgar and polished. He must be kind,\n modest, gentle. Says the apostle, \u201c we were gentle among\n you, even as a nurse cherisheth her children.\u201d Again, he says,\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c gentle, showing all meekness to all men.\u201d He must also be\n a lover of good men^ given to hospitality, and full of the Holy\n Ghost, and of faith, and hope in the exercise of his whole minis*\n try ; and, if he cannot do great things, he should be happy to\n do small. If I recollect right, Mr Newton in some of his works\n has something to the following amount, though not in the exact\n words. He states, that George Whitefield and some others\n were enabled sometimes to let down their nets, and draw thou\u00ac\n sands of souls to the shores ofsalvation, in a short time. But\n as for myself, and others, he remarks, we angle about the\n streets of London, and catch one here, and one there, and bring\n them to God, after much toil and labour. Then adds, \u201c while\n others do great things, we are happy to do small.\u201d Among the\n solitary instances thus brought to Christ by the instru\u00ac\n mentality of John Newton, were Wilberforce, Dr Scott, and\n some others of great note in the Christian world. When the\n influence, which these men have had on the salvation of man\u00ac\n kind, is duly estimated, how great will appear the instrumental\u00ac\n ity oi that one man in the conversion of souls. J^et ministers,\n therefore, when they conclude that they cannot do great\n things, be happy to do small.\n</p>\n<p>\n To close this head, your minister should be a promoter of rc*\n vivals of Religion^ and a supporter of all the benevolent institu\u00ac\n tions of the day, which in his judgment are so managed, as to\n advance the common interests of mankind.\n</p>\n<p>\n Such a minister, as we have defined, should be your pastor,\n May the Lord, the God of the spirits of all flesh, set such a man\n over this church and congregation^\n</p>\n<p>\n Here it may be proper for me to remark, that this first head\n of discourse has doubtless brought to your minds many faults,\n which have attended my own ministry among you. The head,\n which is to follow, will bring to your rememberance your mis\u00ac\n takes, as far as any have prevailed.

His\n office is to take you by the hand, and guide you out of this apos*\n tate world, to heaven. In this work he must honor God, or be\n guilty of perjury to his glory. He must probe your wounds,\n however, painful to him or you. He must administer the balm\n of life, whether accepted, or not. His very occupation is to\n eradicate lusts, and plant in the subdued soil the seeds of eter\u00ac\n nal life. He must watch, instruct, reprove, warn and rebuke,\n with all long suffering and doctrine. His location and work\n will be acknowledged to be difficult above all others in this\n world, and to demand the co-operation of all his people.

This will\n sustain his courage more than your money. From a people,\n there is nothing like it to a minister\u2019s bosom on earth. He will\n be happy on brown bread, if you will mingle your souls affection\u00ac\n ately with his. He will take hold of hands with you, and be\n willing to live and die with you. Such affection oils the wheels\n of his whole ministry, and emboldens his soul to every enterprise\n for your good. It is the sweetest thing, that exists between the\n heart of a minister, and those of his people : it to him is solace,\n yea, energy and power on his mind. But cold and distant feel\u00ac\n ings in this relation, and, what is worse, hypocritical profes\u00ac\n sions of friendship, have directly a counter effect, and are mil\u00ac\n dew and death on the soul. A. good minister in the State of\n Connecticut, with whom 1 once had some acquaintance, from\n whom his people for a season seemed to with-hold their affec\u00ac\n tions, endeavored for a while to pursue his labors among them,\n and to love the more, though the less he were beloved. But at\n last he sunk under his discouragement. One day, in his de\u00ac\n pressed state of mind, meeting one of his deacons, he said to\n him in the bitterness of his soul, \u201cdo feel with me, or I cannot live. '\n My hearers, you should not forget any thing due to your pastor,\n but if you do forget some things, do not forget to be affection-\n ate to him.\n</p>\n<p>\n You should respect your pastor for his office sake: this is put-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0012/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 144, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0012/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 288, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 514}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0012/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 577, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1028}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0012/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1154, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2057}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0012/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2309, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4115}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0012/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/fa/re/we/ll/se/rm/on/pr/00/bu/sh/farewellsermonpr00bush/farewellsermonpr00bush_0012.jp2", "height": 4115, "width": 2309, "levels": 6, "size": 576527}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"12\">\n<p>\n 1 *\n</p>\n<p>\n 4ing an honor upon Christ, remember, he is not his own mes\u00ac\n senger, but Christ\u2019s embassador: to disrespect him is to disres\u00ac\n pect Christ, who sent him.

The words of Nicodemus to the Jewish Sanhe\u00ac\n drim on this subject should be engraven on the heart of every\n parishioner, ' \u2019^does our law judge any man before it hear him^ and\n know what he doeth? ' \u2018^\n</p>\n<p>\n Do not make your minister an offender for a word, or some\n small mistakes. The prophet in his complaint to God, against\n Israel says, \u201cthey make a man an offender for a woid.*\u2019 Men,\n while in this imperfect state, who speak and act as much as\n ministers, w ' ill be always guilty of such trespasses. Even Mo\u00ac\n ses, who probably was the most holy man, that ever lived, spoke\n unadvisedly with his lips. Elijah was a man subject to like\n passions with us. Failings also are recorded of nearly all the\n inspired writers. It must be so, that the excellency of the\n power of the ministry may be of God. Occasional failings\n blemish, but do not destroy a Christian character. Habitual\n sins persisted in will bring any man\u2019s character down to the\n grave. Moses\u2019 sins were occasional, his general character,\n therefore was sustained. King Saul\u2019s were habitual, his there\u00ac\n fore, perished. In your carriage, therefore, to your pastor, in\n this particular, consider, that you yourselves are also in the\n body.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Never repeat your pastors failings, if you discover any, to your\n families. It is believed, that some parents for so doing have\n been the cause of the damnation of their children. A worse\n practice in parents can hardly be named. It should be\n remembered, that children or domestics are imperfect, and\n inexperienced on the subject of character, and where par\u00ac\n ents state to them such failings, they are exposed to conclude,\n that the whole character is bad. Where parents and guardians\n take this liberty, the minister will soon be looked upon with\n jealousy, his person held in contempt, and become a subject of\n cant and joke in the domestic circle, and his instructions lost to\n all their minds. The practice in its effects is awful, it hardens\n children to the whole gospel, has a powerful tendency to make\n infidels, and comes very near to banishing all religion from the\n household. Let parents and guardians therefore beware how\n they rehearse their pastor\u2019s failings to their families.\n</p>\n<p>\n Do not devour too much of your minister ' ^s time in your inter\u00ac\n course with him. You should visit him, but your visits should\n be well timed. Long visits at a minister\u2019s study are for a gener\u00ac\n al rule too great a draft on his time. Besides, short visits are\n much more effective than long ones. Long visits almost always\n become tiresome, and the ideas sparse.

On this subject, it seems, our world has never learned to\n reason. Would they divide a minister\u2019s time, after just deduc\u00ac\n tions were made for ill health, and the sickness of his family, and\n other domestic avocations indispensible, between his studies,\n and public labors at home and abroad, which are numerous\n beyond all common calculation, they never would draw the\n conclusions, which they do. I do here advise every parishion\u00ac\n er to inquire into this subject, and make a just division of the\n time, and ascertain how great a share of it belongs to him, in\n one year. It is true, a minister must visit his people, Paul went\n \u201cfrom house to house.\u201d But there must be limits to this duty,\n or his pulpit will be shockingly lean; yea, if he have a stated\n charge, he will soon be an affliction to all the sensible part of\n his congregation. It it is utterly impossible to satisfy the pres\u00ac\n ent demands of people on this subject without a pastor \u2019s neg\u00ac\n lecting more than half of his other duties. It is conceded the\n people are sincere in their demands, but it is desired, that they\n would make deductions, divide and subdivide a minister\u2019s time,\n and learn to reason. As this visiting according to scripture\n must be done, the people should help their pastor in this service.\n It is every person\u2019s duty to carry eternal life to his neigh\u00ac\n bors : in this way, a great amount of labor to gather in the lost\n sheep of the house of Israel, may be socially done. I think,\n that President Edwards\u2019 course for himself was a good one: he\n assembled his congregation in groups, in different parts of the\n town, preached some, and conveised some with them, and\n thereby made a saving of much time; cases which, he could\n not reach on these occasions, he reserved for personal visita\u00ac\n tions. It is said by some, that President Edwards had not a\n talent for parochial risitiations.

Many\n years ago, at a time of religious depression among this people,\n when my mind and those of others, sunk in some measure in\n view of the moral state of our affairs ; one evening, as I sat in\n my house, rather pensive, some persons knocked at my door ;\n they were introduced, and having taken their seats, one of them\n said to me, \u201cwe feel in trouble for our souls, and we meet with\n difficulties, and have come to ask for your counsel and pray\u00ac\n ers.\u201d I could hardly believe my own eyes, and ears. The\n sight of their persons, however, and the sound of their voices,\n and the agony of their feelings, rushed on to my mind with pow\u00ac\n erful emotions, and under God, my slumbers were broken, and\n my courage was raised. They told me also of several others,\n who had been impressed, at the house of God, on the proceed\u00ac\n ing sabbath. This, when communicated to my people had the\n like effect on their minds. A glorious reformation followed,\n which terminated in an addition of more than one hundred\n members to this church.

I noticed, when he entered the\n door, something a little luminous in his countenance, but could\n not tell just what it was : the thought, however, struck my mind,\n can he have come to converse with me on religion. As soon,\n as he took his seat, he said to me, \u201cI have come to tell you\n something, should it prove to be true, I trust, will make you\n glad.\u201d He then said to me, \u201cI have a hope that I am new\n born.\u201d The suddenness of the event, the appearance of the\n man, and the modesty with which he related what God\n done for him, under God, diffused an influence throu^\\i my\n whole mind. Suffice it to say, it raised my courage and That of\n my people, when it was stated to them. Anotb/gr blessed work\n of God followed, which resulted in the add-^tion of nearly one\n hundred more persons to our eoinm ' :inion, There is nothing\n \u00abmong mere men like such spiritual facts to move ministers,\n and move people forward \\n the work of the Lord. Here I add,\n that It is no small shtire of the wisdom of a pastor, and his\n church, to duly improve such occurrences of Providence to pro\u00ac\n mote revivals of religion. In such gracious works, God im\u00ac\n proves exciting causes, when they are of a solemn scriptural\n character. I would, therefore, say to this assembly, let vour\n minister have the advantage of the moral state of your minds,\n</p>\n<p>\n I concisely add, pratj much for your rninister, stay up his\n hands to God, the apostle trusted, that he should be brought\n forward, through the instrumentality of the prayers of saints.\n Gladden his heart by your uniform and punctual attendance on\n his ministrations. Remember if it be your minister\u2019s duty to\n preach, it is your duty to assemble to hear him. Associate and\n help him in every thing good, which he undertakes ; and the\n Lord give you understanding in all things.\n</p>\n<p>\n To close this head of discourse, ij ' your pastor sins, proceed\n regularly against him as the gospel directs, and let him be heard\n and tried at ci regular tribunal. Thus proceeding, if he has done\n wrong, and is stubborn in his offence,you have him in your pow-\n pr. But if you adopt the opposite course, and slander and\n jjudge hirn unheard, you may commit much sin, make yourselves\n much trouble, and suffer much in public opinion. Fix it in your\n minds, therefore and never depart from it, that every man on\n earth has a right to a regular tribunal, to a fair process and a\n full hearing, before judgment is rendered. Now may the Lord,\n the God of the spirits of all flesh, grant that such may be your\n carriage to your future minister.\n</p>\n<p>\n It now remains for me to take my leave of you, as your pas\u00ab\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0017/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 148, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 262}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0017/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 524}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0017/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1048}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0017/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1186, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2097}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0017/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2373, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4195}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fa:re:we:ll:se:rm:on:pr:00:bu:sh:farewellsermonpr00bush:farewellsermonpr00bush_0017/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/fa/re/we/ll/se/rm/on/pr/00/bu/sh/farewellsermonpr00bush/farewellsermonpr00bush_0017.jp2", "height": 4195, "width": 2373, "levels": 6, "size": 635241}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"17\">\n<p>\n 17\n</p>\n<p>\n tor, which, all things considered, I readily do. I commenced\n preaching the gospel thirty-eight years ago last February, The\n five first years of ministry, except a few weeks, 1 labored in the\n new settlements of our country, most of the time an itinerant\n missionary in behalf of the missionary society of Connecticut. I\n have always considered, that as the most happy and useful\n period of my whole life. I have been the pastor of this church\n and people, thirty-three years, on the day ofiny dismission. I\n have generally been happy with my people. I rejoice that 1\n have been located here in providence, and am well satisfied\n with my dismission, at the present time. I think the time has\n fully come for that event. I thank you for all the respect,\n which you have shown me through a long ministry, and for all\n the assistance, you have afforded to my person, and familj^, and\n to the cause placed under my labors. We all have had our\n faults. I liave had many. I thank you for the courtesy with\n which you have overlooked my mistakes through many years.\n It is true, and not too much to be said, at this time, that you\n liavo been inclined to bury my faults, rather that ludd them up to\n public view. This has been much to your tredit, and for my\n comfort. I thank you also, for the donation, which you gener\u2122\n otesly voted me, at the close of the silting of ihe council for my\n dismission, as expressive of your respect and kindness to me.\n Suffice it to say, that I am entirely satisfied with the adjustment\n of my dismission, and of all things in the settlement of our af\u00ac\n fairs, ' and am this day happy,\n</p>\n<p>\n I earnestly desire, that our affections may continue to be mutu\u00ac\n al, and our intercourse free and happy, while we live. It would\n be easy for me, though dismissed, to make you some unhappy,\n and for you to make me and my family, so ;\u2019l ul I pray God, that\n this may never be the case ; but that we may live together, as\n those engaged in the same holy cause, and bound to the same\n happy world, where so many are gone, who now rejoice in their\n once mutual fellowship here below\u2019.\n</p>\n<p>\n Live, my dear people, together in love.
