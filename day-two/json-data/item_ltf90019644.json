under heavy\n embarrassments, and marked by such usefulness as,\n under grace, we have been able to accomplish, we\n realize, as perhaps never before, the value of prac\u00ac\n tical Christian literature.\n</p>\n<p>\n Next to the Bible, the formative forces of our\n early religious life were very largely the biogra\u00ac\n phies of Carvosso, Bramwell and Summerfield\n Later, in the active work of the ministr}^, Upham\u2019s\n \u201cInterior Life,\u201d his \u201cLife of Faith,\u201d and his \u201cDi\u00ac\n vine Union\u201d guided the analytical tendencies of\n our mind in those channels of practical Godliness\n from which a large part of personal satisfaction\n and a measure of ability to help others in the per\u00ac\n plexed stages of their experience have sprung.\n</p>\n<p>\n Hence, if we were to advise the Christians of to\u00ac\n day as to their reading, we would speak with\n emphasis in commendation of the volume before\n us as a valuable addition

It is therefore essential in every instance\n that divine wisdom be imparted in order to take the\n first step in a genuine experience. It is related of\n Noah Webster\u2014one of the most intellectual and\n learned men of his day, that for many years he\n endeavored to serve God, according to the best\n light which his reason alone afforded, without\n realizing the necessity of a change of heart, or\n understanding the nature of the new birth; and it\n was not until he had been awakened and enlight\u00ac\n ened by the Spirit of God that he became truly\n converted. This is only one of a thousand instances\n which might be cited to prove that man by wisdom\n knows not God. A salvation which is of divine\n origin can be received only by divine revelation.\n</p>\n<p>\n But let it not therefore be supposed that this\n wisdom is made manifest only to those who will be\n ultimately saved; for it is written, \" The grace of\n God which bringeth salvation hath appeared unto\n all men.\u201d And Christ says,* \" I am the light of the\n world. He that followeth me shall not walk in\n darkness, but shall have the light of life.\u201d And\n John testified concerning Christ, saying, \" That\n was the true Light which lighteth every man that\n cometh into the world.\u201d God will so enlighten\n every man that the responsibilty of his salvation\n will rest upon himself. No man can be eternally\n lost until he deliberately, wilfully, * and finally,\n rejects the light which shines upon him. \" This is\n the condemnation that light is come into the world,\n and men loved darkness rather than light because\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0063/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 441}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0063/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 536, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 882}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0063/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1072, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1765}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0063/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2145, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3531}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0063/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/de/mp/ti/on/or/li/vi/00/ha/wk/redemptionorlivi00hawk/redemptionorlivi00hawk_0063.jp2", "height": 3531, "width": 2145, "levels": 6, "size": 379801}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"63\">\n<p>\n THE LIVING WAY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 57\n</p>\n<p>\n their deeds were evil.\u201d \" He came unto his own\n and his own received him not.

Godly sorrow. Scriptural awakening\n produces an apprehension of the sinfulness of sin,\n a deep sense of regret for sins committed, and a\n feeling of contrition before God.\n</p>\n<p>\n Second. Confession. All sins must be con\u00ac\n fessed to God.

It is not enough that we\n confess our sins ; we must forsake them. Sin must\n be relinquished. It is erroneous to teach that we\n should bring our sins to Christ. We must separate\n from them, and renounce them wholly, to come to\n Christ aright. \" He that covereth his sins shall not\n prosper; but he that confesseth and forsaketh them\n shall have mercy.\u201d Prov. 28 113.\n</p>\n<p>\n Fourth. Restitution. Evangelical repentance\n is accompanied and followed by amendment of\n life. We must bring forth fruits meet for repen\u00ac\n tance. Godly sorrow leads men to make wrongs\n right.

Holiness is a Saxon\n word, which literally means wholeness, complete\u00ac\n ness, perfection. Sanctification then is the act of\n cleansing, or purifying, for the purpose of making\n holy.

In con\u00ac\n tradistinction, righteousness is the conformity of all\n the faculties to that condition of uprightness of\n which God\u2019s righteousness is the standard : holi\u00ac\n ness is the intrinsic purity and perfection of these\n faculties.\n</p>\n<p>\n In a ceremonial sense sanctification is, either the\n separation of that which is clean from a common\n to a sacred use ; or the setting apart of that which is\n unclean for purification, and its dedication to a\n holy purpose. In this sense it is sometimes spoken\n of as preceding justification. Paul, in writing to\n the Corinthians concerning some who were great\n sinners, says, tf And such were some of you: but\n ye are washed, but ye are sanctified , but ye\n are justified in the name of the Lord Jesus, and\n by the Spirit of our God.\u201d i Cor. 6 :11.

This quali\u00ac\n fying term is used to distinguish faith as the proxi\u00ac\n mate condition of sanctification, from faith in a\n general sense. Orthodox theologians, in speaking\n critically, teach faith as the only condition of sal\u00ac\n vation ; which is true if it be understood in its\n comprehensive sense: but all persons are not\n aware that faith in its theological meaning includes\n repentance, and fruits meet for repentance; con\u00ac\n secration and all the works necessary to fulfil the\n conditions of a consecration. The argument is\n this: None of these acts will take place unless\n preceded and accompanied by faith : No man will\n begin to repent unless he has faith, and all the con\u00ac\n ditions he fulfils, beside the special act of appro\u00ac\n priating faith, are in consequence of the faith\n which actuates him: therefore, faith is the only\n condition. All this is true. It is true also, with\n regard to the relation of faith and works, that faith\n alone without works is the condition of salvation :\n but every theologian understands that this assertion\n is made in considering the meritorious cause of\n salvation. The atonement of Christ and that alone\n is the meritorious cause of salvation, and in this\n respect neither faith nor works have anything to do\n with it. For we are justified by or through faith.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0104/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 441}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0104/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 536, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 882}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0104/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1072, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1765}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0104/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2145, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3531}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0104/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/de/mp/ti/on/or/li/vi/00/ha/wk/redemptionorlivi00hawk/redemptionorlivi00hawk_0104.jp2", "height": 3531, "width": 2145, "levels": 6, "size": 417151}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"104\">\n<p>\n 98\n</p>\n<p>\n REDEMPTION.\n</p>\n<p>\n and not for faith.

They\n inquired of the Lord, at the request of the people,\n and he revealed or withheld his purposes as it\n pleased him. The written word is now the revealed\n will of God to man. No further prophecy will be\n given revealing anything as a rule of action, in\n addition, or contrary to it, and whatever transcends\n it is to be rejected as false. But revelations of\n important future events, either of a public or pri\u00ac\n vate character, which are consistent with the\n written word and in harmony with it, may as cer\u00ac\n tainly be made known in the present as they were\n in the past.

This ceremony was in\n great use amony the Jews. In some instances it\n was used symbolically, that is, not as a remedy,\n but merely as an emblem of that ease, and comfort,\n which they prayed God to impart to the sick. But\n in many instances it was used as a remedy. The\n oil in use among the Jews for that purpose was pure\n olive oil, \" which,\u201d says Dr. Clarke, \" was celebrated\n in Judea for its sanative qualities; and was and is\n frequently used in the East as a means of cure in\n very dangerous diseases; and in Egypt it is often\n used in cure of the plague. Even in Europe it has\n been tried with great success in cure of the dropsy.\u201d\n Oil was undoubtedly used both as a symbol and a\n remedy ; but in James 5 114, as quoted above, it is\n evident from the plain reading of the text, that the\n anointing there spoken of is intended merely as a\n symbol. Nevertheless as healing frequently takes\n place without anointing it is important to have the\n mind of the Spirit with reference to its use.\n</p>\n<p>\n With regard to the use of remedies in general,\n we may say, Persons who have no faith for them\u00ac\n selves, and none in the elders, must of course use\n the best natural remedies at their command. The\n same advice may be given to those who have faith\n at one time and not at another.

Yet\n it is not unreasonable to suppose that in the use of\n this means there is a co-operation of the human\n with the Divine. Great prudence is required in\n using this ordinance. The apostle Paul says, \" Lay\n hands suddenly on no man.\u201d 1 Tim. 5 :22. Dr.\n Clarke paraphrases this passage thus : \" Do not\n</p>\n<p>\n hastily appoint any person to the sacred ministry ;\n let the person be well proved before he receives the\n imposition of hands.\u201d This is doubtless the mean\u00ac\n ing in part, but it also refers, (as he admits some\n understand it.) to laying hands on the sick ; and is\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0157/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 441}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0157/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 536, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 882}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0157/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1072, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1765}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0157/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2145, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3531}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0157/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/de/mp/ti/on/or/li/vi/00/ha/wk/redemptionorlivi00hawk/redemptionorlivi00hawk_0157.jp2", "height": 3531, "width": 2145, "levels": 6, "size": 383726}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"157\">\n<p>\n THE LIVING WAY. 151\n</p>\n<p>\n an admonition to be previously well assured that it\n is according to the will of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n VIII.

For if they fall, ' the one will help\n up his fellow : but woe to him that is alone when\n . he falleth ; for he hath not another to help him up.\u201d\n Ecc. 9 :io. Helpers are not usually called to the\n public ministration of the word, but are designed tQ\n assist those who are, by their wisdom, fidelity,\n courage, and endurance.

Now, \" it is required in\n stewards, that a man be found faithful.\u201d 1 Cor.\n 4 :2. Temporal helpers are also those who minister\n to the necessities of the saints.

To believe that the atonement of Christ\n provides as fully for our sanctification as for our\n justification, and that he is just as willing as he is\n able to sanctify us now, looks very much like the\n exercise of faith, but it is only faith in the doctrine.\n The real point in question is, Am I this moment\n exercising appropriating faith?

Reflect a moment.\n If you are indeed believing, you will realize the\n rest of faith : for this is the lowest condition, in\n sanctification, consistent with the exercise of appro\u00ac\n priating faith. Present faith brings present rest.\n If you are not in a state of rest it is because you\n are not believing. But if you are not, begin to\n believe at once. Do not struggle after feeling;\n but act out your faith as you did when first you\n entered into rest. Having the assurance that your\n consecration was complete, you said without hesita\u00ac\n tion, I am the Lord ' s: and then, as you thought\n of his ability and willingness to sanctify you that\n very moment, in the exercise of appropriating\n faith, you exclaimed, He is mine! Repeat that\n act of faith now. Claim Christ as your present\n Sanctifier. Fix your mind and heart upon him.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0176/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 441}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0176/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 536, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 882}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0176/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1072, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1765}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0176/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2145, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3531}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0176/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/de/mp/ti/on/or/li/vi/00/ha/wk/redemptionorlivi00hawk/redemptionorlivi00hawk_0176.jp2", "height": 3531, "width": 2145, "levels": 6, "size": 430420}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"176\">\n<p>\n 170\n</p>\n<p>\n REDEMPTION.\n</p>\n<p>\n and say understanding^, He is mine; and con\u00ac\n tinue to repeat it until you find rest.

The apostle\n in declaring that the wisdom of this world is foolish\u00ac\n ness with God did not refer to that wisdom which is\n the embodiment of scientific and practical truth, but\n to that worldly wisdom which devised and accepted\n human theories of religion, and failed to recognize\n the atonement of Christ, and the preaching of the\n cross, as the divinely appointed means of salvation.\n Such wisdom is indeed foolishness.

But persons in becoming\n acquainted with God\u2019s extraordinary methods some\u00ac\n times forget his ordinary methods, and in narrow\u00ac\n ing down to one way soon fall into confusion or the\n snare of the devil. Many duties connected with\n the various positions in life are self-evident. The\n mother, for example, does not need a new revela\u00ac\n tion daily to teach her to care for her babe, or her\n little children, or to prepare food for her household,\n or to discharge any of the domestic duties which\n make home comfortable and desirable. Nor does\n the farmer need the special manifestation of the\n Spirit repeated daily to know whether he shall care\n for his stock, or repair his fences, or cultivate his\n fields. And the same is true of the particular\n duties of the merchant, the mechanic, the states\u00ac\n man and the minister. \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n In addition to that which is self-evident, the Bible\n is full of plain practical teachings concerning our\n duty in every relation in life. To seek for special\n revelations to determine whether we ought to dis\u00ac\n charge the various social, civil, and religious duties\n enjoined upon us in the word, proves conclusively\n one of two things ; either that we do not understand\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0225/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 441}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0225/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 536, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 882}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0225/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1072, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1765}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0225/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2145, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3531}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0225/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/de/mp/ti/on/or/li/vi/00/ha/wk/redemptionorlivi00hawk/redemptionorlivi00hawk_0225.jp2", "height": 3531, "width": 2145, "levels": 6, "size": 392476}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"225\">\n<p>\n THE LIVING WAY. 21 9\n</p>\n<p>\n the Use of our Bible, or that we are prepared to re\u00ac\n ceive light contrary to it.\n</p>\n<p>\n We should, at the beginning of every day, com\u00ac\n mit ourselves to God, asking for divine direction ;\n and then, unless something special is clearly re\u00ac\n vealed, devote ourselves at once to the plain duties\n of our particular calling ; believing that if it is the\n will of the Lord to change the time or order of our\n regular duties, or call us to go upon any special er\u00ac\n rand of love or mercy, he will reveal it to us by his\n Spirit.

From the use\n of the term in Genesis, which the apostle puts here\n in Greek letters, we may at once see his meaning\n above, and in Eph. 1 : 14, the Holy Spirit being an\n earnest in the heart, and an earnest of the from -\n ised inherita 7 ice means a security given in hand for\n the fulfilment of all God\u2019s promises relative to grace\n and eternal life.\u201d Hence, these desires, in the bur\u00ac\n dened, groaning, exfectant Christian, are not\n merely natural feelings arising from a fear of death,\n and a wish to escape it; but desires in harmony with\n the very purpose and design of God ; yea, begotten\n in him by the Holy Ghost himself, who is also given\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0295/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 441}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0295/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 536, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 882}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0295/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1072, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1765}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0295/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2145, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3531}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0295/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/de/mp/ti/on/or/li/vi/00/ha/wk/redemptionorlivi00hawk/redemptionorlivi00hawk_0295.jp2", "height": 3531, "width": 2145, "levels": 6, "size": 404780}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"295\">\n<p>\n THE LIVING WAY. 289\n</p>\n<p>\n as the -pledge and assurance of their fulfilment, in\n the redemption of the body.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2.

All this\n and more is claimed for it by orthodox believers.\n Not only is it claimed that the atonement makes\n ample provision both for original and actual trails-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0301/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 441}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0301/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 536, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 882}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0301/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1072, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1765}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0301/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2145, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3531}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0301/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/de/mp/ti/on/or/li/vi/00/ha/wk/redemptionorlivi00hawk/redemptionorlivi00hawk_0301.jp2", "height": 3531, "width": 2145, "levels": 6, "size": 414059}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"301\">\n<p>\n THE LIVING WAY. 295\n</p>\n<p>\n gression, but that it opens to man the possibility of\n attaining to a condition immeasurably above and\n beyond his first estate.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Scriptures abound in passages which prove\n that the provisions of salvation are co-extensive\n with the fall.

In his lecture on ' ' Solar Self-Culture\u201d\n he says:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" A very peculiar, commanding light is brought\n into the face by the activity of the upper faculties in\n man. This radiance ought to be by us, as it is by\n natural law, most searchingly distinguished from all\n lesser illuminations. Its specific dijference from\n every other light is that in it God seems to overawe\n beholders and to rejoice. It is scientifically incon\u00ac\n trovertible that there is sometimes seen such a light\n in the present world.

The most curious eye,\n following it upwards, saw nothing. The cloud fell\n and covered it. Just what men wanted to see was\n hid. The work of the ages had no apex. But\n the work begun by Nature is finished by the Super\u00ac\n natural\u2014^as we are wont to call the higher natural.\n As the veil is lifted by Christianity it strikes men\n dumb with wonder. For the goal of Evolution is\n Jesus Christ.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n We argue, therefore, that as Christ is the type of\n man\u2019s ultimate, and as that ultimate is attained at\n the resurrection of the just, so the eternal is not a\n progressive but a fixed state, and to be glorified, to\n be wholly transformed into the likeness of Christ, is\n the goal of human evolution.\n</p>\n<p>\n The concluding subject in our main proposition\n to be doctrinally considered is the transition and\n TRANSLATION OF THE LIVING BEING. The vari\u00ac\n ous terms in that proposition\u2014deliverance from\n the consequences of sin\u2014transformation, transition\n and translation, should be critically distinguished\n from each other.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0327/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 441}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0327/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 536, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 882}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0327/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1072, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1765}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0327/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2145, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3531}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0327/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/de/mp/ti/on/or/li/vi/00/ha/wk/redemptionorlivi00hawk/redemptionorlivi00hawk_0327.jp2", "height": 3531, "width": 2145, "levels": 6, "size": 424200}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"327\">\n<p>\n THE LIVING WAY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 321\n</p>\n<p>\n Deliverance from the consequences of sin is the\n taking away from every part of our nature all the\n effects of sin.\n</p>\n<p>\n Transformation is the change of spirit, soul and\n body, from a lower to a higher condition of being.\n</p>\n<p>\n Transition is a change from one state to an\u00ac\n other.\n</p>\n<p>\n Translation is a change from one lace to an\u00ac\n other.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the work of deliverance and \u2022transforma\u00ac\n tion has been fully accomplished, and the transi\u00ac\n tion from mortality to immortality has taken place,\n redemption is complete regardless of the location\n of the subject.

This is not enthusiasm, but the\n words of truth and soberness ; and it is the running\n away from this enthusiasm that has made so many\n great scholars as useless to the church as tinkling\n cymbals, and Christendom a mere Babel of learned\n confusion.\u201d Tyerman ' s Life of Wesley , 2 vol. p,\n 64.\n</p>\n<p>\n Were a minister in these days of spiritual effem\u00ac\n inacy to speak thus he would probably be\n charged with disregarding the Scriptures; but\n these words were spoken of the living, personal\n God\u2014the Holy Spirit, by whose inspiration all\n Scripture was given. And the utterance of a truth\n so profound, yet so transparent, can well stand\n unqualified without casting a shadow upon the written\n word.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0347/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 441}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0347/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 536, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 882}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0347/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1072, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1765}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0347/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2145, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3531}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0347/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/de/mp/ti/on/or/li/vi/00/ha/wk/redemptionorlivi00hawk/redemptionorlivi00hawk_0347.jp2", "height": 3531, "width": 2145, "levels": 6, "size": 418134}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"347\">\n<p>\n THE LIVING WAY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 34 1\n</p>\n<p>\n But as a direct reply to the foregoing inquiry we\n answer: The word and the spirit are the\n guides into \" the living way\u201d as well as into all the\n other ways of the Lord.

Dr.\n Clarke in commenting upon this passage says:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" The Holy Spirit which is promised to them who\n believe on Christ Jesus, was given to you, and thus\n you were ascertained to be the children of God, for\n God has no child who is not a partaker of the Holy\n Ghost, and he who has this Spirit has God\u2019s seal\n that he belongs to the heavenly family. It was\n customary among all nations, when a person pur\u00ac\n chased goods of any kind, to mark with his seal\n that which he had bought, in order that he might\n know it, and be able to claim it if mixed with the\n goods of others; to this custom the apostle may\n here allude: but it was also customary to set a\n seal upon what was dedicated to God, or what was\n to be offered to him in sacrifice .

So let our\n souls aspire to the Complete image of the heavenly.\n With a consecration which gladly accepts every\n ray of truth endorsed by the Holy Ghost, let us rise\n on wings of love above all transitory things, and\n press toward the mark for the prize of our high\n calling ; fixing our eye of faith upon Christ, the Sun\n of righteousness ; knowing that there are two beings\n in the universe to whom nothing is impossible:\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0503/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 268, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 441}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0503/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 536, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 882}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0503/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1072, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1765}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0503/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2145, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3531}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:re:de:mp:ti:on:or:li:vi:00:ha:wk:redemptionorlivi00hawk:redemptionorlivi00hawk_0503/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/re/de/mp/ti/on/or/li/vi/00/ha/wk/redemptionorlivi00hawk/redemptionorlivi00hawk_0503.jp2", "height": 3531, "width": 2145, "levels": 6, "size": 363745}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"503\">\n<p>\n THE LIVING WAY. 497\n</p>\n<p>\n With God all things are -possible and, \" All\n things are possible to him that believeth .\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The scheme of human redemption has been un\u00ac\n folded in three dispensations :\u2014the Patriarchal, the\n Mosaic, and the Christian :\u2014each succeeding one\n surpassing the farmer in glory.
