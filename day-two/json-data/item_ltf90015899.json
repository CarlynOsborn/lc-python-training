Colored representations\n will necessarily be sold at a considerably higher price,\n while the operation of coloring is at once an agreeable\n and a profitable exercise for the pupils.\n</p>\n<p>\n The author will suggest that good paint, carefully\n discriminating the shades, is indispensable ; and that,\n where expense is to be avoided, one paint-box might\n be purchased for a whole school, to be paid for in\n common.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:li:sh:am:er:ic:an:sy:00:pe:ab:polishamericansy00peab:polishamericansy00peab_0016/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 241, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 439}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:li:sh:am:er:ic:an:sy:00:pe:ab:polishamericansy00peab:polishamericansy00peab_0016/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 483, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 878}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:li:sh:am:er:ic:an:sy:00:pe:ab:polishamericansy00peab:polishamericansy00peab_0016/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 967, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1757}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:li:sh:am:er:ic:an:sy:00:pe:ab:polishamericansy00peab:polishamericansy00peab_0016/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1934, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3514}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:li:sh:am:er:ic:an:sy:00:pe:ab:polishamericansy00peab:polishamericansy00peab_0016/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/po/li/sh/am/er/ic/an/sy/00/pe/ab/polishamericansy00peab/polishamericansy00peab_0016.jp2", "height": 3514, "width": 1934, "levels": 6, "size": 367519}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"16\">\n<p>\n 6\n</p>\n<p>\n ADVERTISEMENT.\n</p>\n<p>\n Paiut-boxes, of small cakes, and yet of the finest\n quality, containing exactly the colors to be used, can\n be had low at the office of publication, 13, West Street,\n Boston.\n</p>\n<p>\n EXPLANATION OF THE METHOD.\n</p>\n<p>\n The mechanism of the Charts is very simple.\n There are two large Charts, one representing the\n twenty-five centuries before Christ, another represent-\n ing twenty centuries after Christ.

Instructors, however, should merely\n require their pupils to say what events occurred in this\n century, without requiring the year.\n</p>\n<p>\n Bern places in this century, 2205 B.

He also places\n the accession of Yu, first emperor of the Chinese\n dynasty Ilia, in 2205 B. C.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Call of Abraham founds the Hebrew nation.\n He left, by religious inspiration, the consolidating\n idolatry and despotism of Babylon to exercise and\n preserve his inherited faith in the invisible God. It\n is evident that the principles of true religion were not\n universally lost in these times.

Of this there is extant\n proof ; for in this century the father of Abraham is said\n to have removed from Ur of the Chaldees, a city in\n Babylonia ; and we know that Babylon was, therefore,\n in existence, and not in its original Arabian state, but\n dominated by the Chaldeans, who came upon it from\n the north.\n</p>\n<p>\n The character of this Chaldaean dominion proves\n that they came from some country highly civilized ;\n for, as soon as they came, they began the astronomical\n tables found by Alexander in Babylon, when he entered\n it, 330 B. C., which already comprised three thousand\n years of observations taken in that latitude. That\n Zoroaster, and consequently a great Persian empire,\n was anterior to the Babylonian, has been demonstrated\n by Heeren, in the first volume of his Researches ( Ideen )\n upon Asia. But Zoroaster also had a great antiquity\n behind him, and instructed his royal pupil by the history\n of a more ancient Persia, whose first king lived, like\n Adam, a thousand years, (if Djemschid was not rather\n a dynasty of kings than a man.)

This throws the antiquity of Upper Egypt, and\n of Ethiopia, far back ; for the researches of Champol-\n lion, Bunsen, Heeren, and others, have demonstrated\n that Lower Egypt was civilized subsequently to Upper\n Egypt ; and that Upper Egypt (the great and ancient\n Thebes) was a colony from Ethiopian Meroe, and that\n Meroe was itself a colony of priests, of Caucasian race,\n which, at some early period, arrived there by sea,\n always preserving their ship as their most sacred em-\n blem. Again, the peculiar institution of castes has\n only been found in Egypt, Ethiopia, Brahminical India,\n and the tradition of the same in Zoroaster\u2019s Bactria ;\n for, according to Zoroaster, Gustasp\u2019s kingdom was\n composed of three orders, corresponding to the three\n upper castes of Egypt, Ethiopia, and India. Is it not\n very reasonable to suppose, that when that invasion of\n Turan upon the Iran of Gustasp took place, of which\n Zoroaster was always warning his royal pupil, it swept\n the old nation entirely out of this locality, and that one\n part of them emigrated upon the Ganges, another into\n Ethiopia by sea, perhaps a colony of priests into\n Babylon, as Chaldeans ; and that the Magians of Medea\n were of the same origin ? It is a fact worthy of note,\n that, in Persia itself, there was, in all that period of\n history known to the Greeks, a great aversion to the\n constitution of society into castes, and that the upper\n race of Persia was a cavalier race, a military nobility,\n bearing the same relation to the lower people that the\n German races do to the Celtic races of France, Spain,\n and Britain.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Chart has no indications of the Pelasgic race\n till the twentieth and nineteenth centuries before\n Christ ; and then only the vague one of the blue tint\n upon the whole representations of these centuries.\n This is a compromise between the common view and\n the doubts of the compiler of this manual.

According to\n Henne, the Pelasgians preceded all other nations, and\n it was to them that the antediluvian traditions recorded\n by Moses belonged. The ages to which the origin of\n the Pelasgian kingdoms of Greece is referred, are the\n ages of their decay, which were signalized probably by\n wanderings, and divisions, and new settlements. In\n the early traditions of Europe, all the nations seem to\n have been in motion, like the tumultuous waves of\n the sea after a great tempest.

Then it fell\n under the power of the descendants of Pelops, as we\n find it in the Trojan war. After the Trojan war, the\n Dorians, from the north of Greece, penetrated into Pel-\n oponnesus, and gradually established a predominance\n over all its kingdoms there, driving the old inhabitants\n into different localities, many of them entirely out of\n the peninsula, into the colonies of Asia Minor and\n Magna Grcecia, (for so the south of Italy was named,\n probably on account of this emigration, which studded\n all its coasts with Grecian cities.) Sparta became a\n metropolitan city, as it were, to the Dorians. Its two\n kings, though greatly limited in political power, had a\n kind of divine honor attributed to them, on account\n of their birth. They were the heads of the Heracleidic\n tribe, and took the throne by hereditary right. The\n early history of the Dorian Lacedaemon is little known.\n Karl Otfried Muller, author of the History of the Do-\n rians, criticizes the traditions, and shows that much of\n Plutarch\u2019s life of Lycurgus is a romance. Doubtless\n there was such a person of the royal family, who would\n not abuse his opportunity as guardian of an infant\n king, to take the sacred place. He also, doubtless,\n was especially active in preserving and developing the\n constitution of the state. But most of the laws Plu-\n tarch ascribes to Lycurgus were the current laws of\n all Dorian states, and derived from a higher antiquity,\n while some of the constitutional peculiarities he men-\n tions were the amendments or corruptions of ages\n long subsequent to Lycurgus. Plutarch also does no\n justice to the moral and ' aesthetic character of the Lace-\n daemonians.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Dorians did not subject Messenia so soon as\n they did Laconia, and their recorded history involves\n several wars with the Messenians.

One disappeared in a\n thunder storm, the other was killed by lightning.\n Numa Pompilius and Ancus Martius express the moral\n and peaceful Sabines, who gave that element of probity\n to the Roman character which occasionally shows\n itself. The Etruscan Tarquins express the stately,\n pompous, formal element of Rome ; while Servius\n Tullius, who intervenes between Priscus and Superbus,\n was the people\u2019s king, with whose name was asso-\n ciated every institution and law which the Romans\n valued most while they continued a republic.\n</p>\n<p>\n The kings were at first elected ; but Tarquin the\n Proud came upon the throne by the murder of Servius\n Tullius, and he lost it by his son Sextus\u2019s insult to\n the virtuous Lucretia, who stabbed herself, and gave\n the bloody dagger to her father and husband to avenge\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:li:sh:am:er:ic:an:sy:00:pe:ab:polishamericansy00peab:polishamericansy00peab_0194/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 241, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 439}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:li:sh:am:er:ic:an:sy:00:pe:ab:polishamericansy00peab:polishamericansy00peab_0194/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 483, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 878}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:li:sh:am:er:ic:an:sy:00:pe:ab:polishamericansy00peab:polishamericansy00peab_0194/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 967, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1757}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:li:sh:am:er:ic:an:sy:00:pe:ab:polishamericansy00peab:polishamericansy00peab_0194/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1934, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3514}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:li:sh:am:er:ic:an:sy:00:pe:ab:polishamericansy00peab:polishamericansy00peab_0194/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/po/li/sh/am/er/ic/an/sy/00/pe/ab/polishamericansy00peab/polishamericansy00peab_0194.jp2", "height": 3514, "width": 1934, "levels": 6, "size": 453774}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"194\">\n<p>\n 184\n</p>\n<p>\n SKETCHES OF HISTORY. \u2014 ROME.\n</p>\n<p>\n her wrongs.

Sylla had\n with him an army with which he was closing up the\n social war, and, in his exasperation at this injustice, as\n he deemed it, he marched to Rome, from which Ma-\n rius fled. At this time Sylla did nothing very violent.\n Having arranged affairs at Rome to his mind, he went\n to Greece : while he was gone, the party of Marius ob-\n tained the upper hand, and recalled their leader. Ma-\n rius became consul the seventh time ; and though his\n consulship only lasted seventeen days, he committed\n frightful cruelties, in revenge for his temporary banish-\n ment. He did not proscribe, but he gave orders for\n a terrible butchery. His death brought this to a close ;\n but his party reigned in Rome for three years more.\n Meanwhile Sylla went to Greece, against the generals\n of Mithridates, who held it. Sylla took the city of\n Athens from them by storm, and drove the Pontic\n commander back to Asia. He then proceeded into\n Asia himself, and so treated Asia Minor that he utterly\n impoverished\u2019 its provinces, rich as they were.

Several important military\n leaders took Sylla\u2019s side \u2014 Metellus Pius, Cneus Pom-\n pey, and Lucullus. The civil war now raged.

The\n magnificence of his funeral shows how completely he\n had annihilated, by his exhaustive cruelty, all his\n enemies. The completeness of his power is still more\n strikingly attested by the fact, that, after his death,\n Lepidus in vain endeavored to have his acts rescinded.\n Rome had fallen to the point that it could not rise\n against his terrible rule, even after he was dead.\n</p>\n<p>\n The rest of the history of Rome is hardly any\n thing else than the struggle of its several military\n leaders for supremacy.

S. The above biographical memoranda do not\n exhaust the subject. On the other hand, it is a more\n full record than is necessary for the purposes of com-\n mon-school education. Instructors will find, however,\n that it is a great aid to the memory of historical events\n for their pupils to have a vivid conception of the lives\n and genius of individuals; and it has been found a very\n successful method to distribute to a class the several\n names of the distinguished persons in the history, that\n the members may instruct each other by relating their\n histories after the historical recitation is over. Besides\n the works already mentioned as sources of information,\n Crabb\u2019s Universal Historical Dictionary is a good\n resource. The compiler of the present work cannot\n hope that there may be no typographical errors in so\n many dates as this manual contains; but if any are\n found, a table of errata will be given upon the paper\n covers of the accompanying book of blank centuries.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE END.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":
