The existence of\n fixed social laws makes it easy for those who have not\n been accustomed to the best usages of society to attain\n the knowledge which will enable them to move in the\n most cultivated circles without embarrassment to them\u00ac\n selves or annoyance to others.\n</p>\n<p>\n For centuries men have met in society, and their\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ou:rm:an:ne:rs:at:ho:me:00:un:se:ourmannersathome00unse:ourmannersathome00unse_0028/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 291, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 473}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ou:rm:an:ne:rs:at:ho:me:00:un:se:ourmannersathome00unse:ourmannersathome00unse_0028/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 583, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 946}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ou:rm:an:ne:rs:at:ho:me:00:un:se:ourmannersathome00unse:ourmannersathome00unse_0028/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1166, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1892}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ou:rm:an:ne:rs:at:ho:me:00:un:se:ourmannersathome00unse:ourmannersathome00unse_0028/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2333, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3785}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ou:rm:an:ne:rs:at:ho:me:00:un:se:ourmannersathome00unse:ourmannersathome00unse_0028/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ou/rm/an/ne/rs/at/ho/me/00/un/se/ourmannersathome00unse/ourmannersathome00unse_0028.jp2", "height": 3785, "width": 2333, "levels": 6, "size": 341214}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"28\">\n<p>\n 20\n</p>\n<p>\n OUR MANNERS AT HOME AND ABROAD.\n</p>\n<p>\n oxperienees have been condensed into rules; but expe\u00ac\n rience is a dear teacher, and it is much more speedy, as\n rvell as much less painful, to acquire the desired knowl\u00ac\n edge from books containing the experiences of others.\n Each generation is indebted to the. preceding for the\n assistance it has rendered in forming a code of social\n laws, to secure the recognition of which in early cen\u00ac\n turies may have cost many a man his head.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cA Gentleman of the Old School.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n How often have we heard this remark made of a\n \u2018gentleman in the present generation who is found to\n be courteous in his manner of address, who is always\n on the alert to do a kindly act, who is studiously atten\u00ac\n tive to little acts of politeness without anv apparent effort,\n who is never too much absorbed or abstracted to pick\n up a lady\u2019s fan or handkerchief that may have fallen!\n But what do we mean by calling him \u201ca gentleman\n of the old school\u201d?

This love of ancestry in the American\n heart has been implanted by feeble hands on a foreign\n soil, and, nurtured in a congenial atmosphere, its growth\n has been as rank as it has been rapid; but it is to be-\n hoped that in the near future the conversation as well\n as the lives of Americans will be thoroughly freed from\n the influence of this obnoxious foreign element.\n</p>\n<p>\n Monopoly in Conversation.\n</p>\n<p>\n Being a leader in conversation differs essentially from\n being a monopolist.

Above\n all things, avoid any exhibition of temper; no matter\n how great the provocation may be, try to control your\u00ac\n self in the presence of others. Nothing has such a\n tendency to detract from natural dignity of character\n as a display of passion.\n</p>\n<p>\n Deep grief or great joy should never be displayed in\n public; they are personal feelings in which we cannot\n expect the public heart to sympathize, and they should\n therefore be reserved, under any circumstances, for the\n privacy of one\u2019s fireside.\n</p>\n<p>\n Wit. \u2014Wit is frequently employed in conversation as\n a weapon to ward off unpleasant references, to conceal\n ignorance, or to display self-knowledge.

of\n the face.

She will always\n follow rather than lead the prevailing fashion, and rather\n follow her own fashion than violate good taste or com\u00ac\n mon sense.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c The golden rule in dress is to avoid extremes. Do\n not be so original in your dress as to be peculiar, and do\n not affect fashions that are radically unbecoming to you.\n Ladies who are neither very young nor very striking in\n appearance cannot do better than wear quiet colors.\n Ladies who are not rich can always appear well dressed\n with a little care in the choice and arrangement of ma\u00ac\n terials. Whatever the texture of the dress, it should be\n made by the very best dressmaker you can afford.

He must then see that the horse is prop\u00ac\n erly saddled and bridled, never trusting to the carelessness\n of a groom or a livery-servant. The gentleman is for the\n time being responsible for the safety of the lady, and he\n must take this into consideration in the choice of the\n horse, the gait at which to ride, and the distance to be\n traveled. He must remember, too, that to the lady, en\u00ac\n cumbered as she is by a long riding-habit and required by\n custom to take a position which is at the best only an in\u00ac\n secure seat, the exercise is perilous even for the best of\n riders.

It stands guard over its precious fel\u00ac\n low, and is a confirmation of the first promise.\n</p>\n<p>\n u When the bride and the bridegroom are passing out\n of the church the bridesmaids follow slowly, each upon\n the arm of an usher, and they afterward hasten onward\n as speedily as possible to welcome the bride at her own\n door, and to arrange themselves about the bride and\n groom in the salon , half of the ladies upon her side\n and half upon his, the first bridesmaid retaining the\n place of honor. The ushers at the door of the salon\n offer themselves as escorts to parties who arrive slowly\n from the church, conducting them to the bridal party,\n there presenting them by name. This announcement\n becomes necessary when two families and two sets of\n friends are brought together for the first time. If the\n ladies are present without gentlemen, the ushers are care\u00ac\n ful to accompany them to the breakfast- or refreshment-\n room, or provide them with attendants, after which the\n ladies can easily manage to be comfortable by themselves.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Weddixg-Reception.\n</p>\n<p>\n At the wedding-reception, held at the house of the\n bride\u2019s parents, the guests offer their congratulations.\n</p>\n<p>\n 21\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ou:rm:an:ne:rs:at:ho:me:00:un:se:ourmannersathome00unse:ourmannersathome00unse_0348/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 291, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 473}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ou:rm:an:ne:rs:at:ho:me:00:un:se:ourmannersathome00unse:ourmannersathome00unse_0348/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 583, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 946}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ou:rm:an:ne:rs:at:ho:me:00:un:se:ourmannersathome00unse:ourmannersathome00unse_0348/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1166, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1892}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ou:rm:an:ne:rs:at:ho:me:00:un:se:ourmannersathome00unse:ourmannersathome00unse_0348/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2333, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3785}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ou:rm:an:ne:rs:at:ho:me:00:un:se:ourmannersathome00unse:ourmannersathome00unse_0348/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ou/rm/an/ne/rs/at/ho/me/00/un/se/ourmannersathome00unse/ourmannersathome00unse_0348.jp2", "height": 3785, "width": 2333, "levels": 6, "size": 328505}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"348\">\n<p>\n 322 OUR MANNERS AT HOME AND ABROAD.\n</p>\n<p>\n On going forward to congratulate the happy couple\n they should address the bride first if they have had any\n previous acquaintance with her, then the bridegroom,,\n then the bridesmaids, and after them the parents and\n family of the bride and groom.

lore have\n found not a little pleasure in tracing the\n sources of proper names, and have in many\n cases discovered the apparently meaningless\n name to be the key to interesting historical facts\n and treasured data, the existence of which had\n scarcely been surmised.\n</p>\n<p>\n In many instances the name is derived from the\n classic languages; as Theo , \u201cGod,\u201d and Dora , a \u201cgift,\u201d\n are combined in the expressive names, Dorothea , Theo\u00ac\n dora, and Theodore.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some peculiarity of disposition, grace of manner, or\n beauty of expression frequently gives rise to a name\n that half reveals and half conceals its origin. Places,\n exploits, and associations have each an influence in\n establishing a name that will embody some point of\n interest. The following list of names, with their sig\u00ac\n nification, will be of interest to the general reader:\n</p>\n<p>\n Names of Females.\n Abigail, My father\u2019s joy.\n</p>\n<p>\n A ' da or A '
