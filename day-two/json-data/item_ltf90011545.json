The Presbyter y\n had, or thought they had, serious grounds of complaint against you ;\n especially against your circuit riders. Some things of common occur-\n rence, and others which had lately occurred, showed, in their view,\n such an unfriendly spirit, and such unfair dealing, that, without some\n change or explanation the apparent peace between the two societies\n could be no longer maintained To bring the matter to an issue, they\n resolved to address a Letter to their churches ; stating the causes of dis-\n satisfaction, and, at the same time, defending their doctrines and insti-\n tutions against the perpetual attacks of your society. The Letter was\n not intended for the eyes of Presbyterians alone : it was printed for\n public inspection ; so that you might have full opportunity to know its\n contents, and might take your measures accordingly.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Monroe and others, have called it an abusive letter. But why\n call it so ? It contains no railing ; no sweeping and villifying epithet is\n applied to you. There is, as thei ' e ought to be, an undisguised and\n candid statement of things, which are complained of as unfriendly and\n unfair, and therefore calculated to produce a rupture between our so-\n cieties That statement is followed by a proposal, that you declare\n whether those things are so or not ; and whether it be your desire and\n intention to treat us as brethren to be loved, or as enemies to be des-\n troyed.\n</p>\n<p>\n What would you have ? If they felt aggrieved, must they bear it in\n mute submission ? If they complained, must they conceal the causes of\n dissatisfaction ? If they stated the causes, must they, as has been de-\n manded, specify every particular act, and produce witnesses to prove\n matters of public notoriety ; matters which every man in the country\n knows, or may know, by inquiring for himself?\n</p>\n<p>\n The Presbytery not only express what they have against you, in as\n moderate language as the nature of the case would admit ; but they\n have thrown in several conciliatory sentiments ; forth ' 1 purpose, it ap-\n pears, of inducing you to keep your temper, and to meet them in a\n Christian spiiit. They declare that they aim not to produce an open\n rupture and angry controversy ; but to obtain, if possible, a friendly\n understanding on the subjects oi complaint. They also express a hope,\n that the more candid and liberal among you, may exercise a moderating\n influence over the rest ; & check that course of conduct towards Presby-\n terians, which must otherwise produce the most disagreeable consequen-\n ces This healing sentiment, Mr. Monroe is pleased to construe into a\n design to sow dissensions among you, and in order to deter any of vou\n from acting a moderate part, he brands all who shall do so, with \" the\n character of \u201chalf-hearted and lukewarm in the cause of God.\u201d*\n</p>\n<p>\n *It may be well enough to notice the following specimen of Mr. M\u2019s wit.\n The Presbytery had said that justice to themselves, & e. required them \u201cto\n ]ay aside false delicacy, & c.\u201d To which, Mr. M gives the lollowingturn:\n \u201cI always suspected their delicacy towards us was false, & c.\u201d This is keen\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0005/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 141, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 258}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0005/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 283, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 517}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0005/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 567, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1034}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0005/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1134, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2069}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0005/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4139}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0005/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/le/tt/er/to/me/th/od/is/00/un/se/lettertomethodis00unse/lettertomethodis00unse_0005.jp2", "height": 4139, "width": 2269, "levels": 6, "size": 619790}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"5\">\n<p>\n The acts complained of by the Presbytery, are these: \u2014 the severe\n denunciations frequently heard from your pulpits against the Presbyte-\n rian ministry and church -the violent abuse of their doctrines as\n hellish and ruinous to souls ; ar.d the circulation of scandalous pam-\n phlets, against individuals among our clergy and people. Such conduct,\n connected with friendly professions, they considered not only as injuri-\n ous, but as indicating a double-dealing policy.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Monroe is silent about all these charges except the last. He\n therefore tacitly admits their truth, as he well may, for they are unde-\n niable. Nor does he deny that circuit riders and others among you,\n have zealously circulated personal scandals against Presbyterian min-\n isters and people. He only pretends to find great difficulty in deter-\n mining what scandalous production the Presbytery alluded to. O (one\n at least he was not ignorant, for he professes his knowledge of it ; if\n that was the only one be knew of, whence the difficulty ? But he hap-\n pened to hit on the right one ; \u2014 and so doubtless you all did : \u2014 for the\n eager zeal of the carriers of that scandal soon made you all acquainted\n with it. Yet you had not declared war against us, when your agents\n carried on this underhand scheme, to bring reproach upon us. Out -\n side , all yet wore the face of peace. Mr. Monroe is bitterly offended at\n the charge of \u201cdouble-dealing.\u201d By what name should the Presbytery\n call that piece of conduct ?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Monroe says that the cautious manner in which the Presbytery\n allude to the pamphlet in question, confirms t\u2019ne truth of its scandalous\n statements. As to that matter, I will only say that the reason why\n the Presbytery barely allude to the production, obviously was this,\n that their business was not with the author of the publication, but with\n the officers of your society, who were its God-fathers, and who put out\n the scandal to nurse as the adopted offspring of Methodism.\n</p>\n<p>\n In addition to the forementioned /acts, the Presbytery mention oth-\n ers, which indicate a spirit of hostility in you against all other denomi-\n nations of Christians. Some of these Mr Monroe passes over in si-\n lence. To others he makes reply. The first of these is your \u201c prose -\n lyttng spirit\n</p>\n<p>\n The good man acknowledges that you rejoice to see your own con-\n verts become members of your society : \u2014 and that is all ! But, on the\n other hand, he charges Presbyterians with having, by persuasion and\n by terror, induced many of those awakened under your preaching, to\n join the Presbyterian church.\n</p>\n<p>\n But perhaps your preachers ascribe rather more to their preaching\n than justly belongs to it\u2014 and fancy, if a person have heard them, and\n</p>\n<p>\n wit ; but let us see where the edge cuts. False delicacy in all such case9\n signifies \u201ca tender forbearance to tell another his fault, when he ought to be\n told of it.\u201d If there be any sense in Mr. M\u2019s witty turn, it means, that the\n Methodists ought to have been sooner rebuked for their conduct towards\n</p>\n<p>\n Presbyterians ' !

Indeed, this has been proclaimed\n from your pulpits. The necessary inference is, that Methodists\n ought to make proselytes by all means, in order to make Christians of\n them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Permit me to suggest here, that perhaps proselytes to Methodism, as\n well as other proselytes whether in politics or religion, may be inspired\n with a new zeal from the mere fact that they havechanged sides. They\n may feel anxious to justify the change, by assigning some adequate rea-\n son ; and what reason so good in this case, as conversion ? The distin-\n guishing trait of your religion is, you know, a hot and noisy enthusiasm.\n Were it not for that your religion would be no better than Presbyteri-\n anism. Proselytes, finding that to be a distinction and a test ofyour pi-\n ety, would naturally conclude, that when they began to shout, thev\n bad got ' a new conversion. I do not say that you all make so much of\n that boiling-hot enthusiasm. Many of you seem to judge of religion by\n its moral effects, just as we do ; and to think that empty barrels some-\n times make the loudest sound.\n</p>\n<p>\n The next thing noticed by Mr. Monroe, is the charge that your\n preachers make \u201cconstant attempts to form societies in the heart of\n congregations, fully supplied with means of grace.\u201d Thf* meaning of\n the Presbytery is perfectly evident. They consider such conduct in\n one denomination towards another, as calculated to excitp jealousy, and\n suspicion of hostile intentions. They mention it expressly as a cause\n of such suspicion and nothing mce. But Mr. Monroe will not so un~\n derstand them, lie will have them to mean that the Presbyterians\n possess an exclusive right of dominion over certain tracts of country.\n Having invented this meaning for them, he takes occasion from it to\n launch against them the stale slander, that they are aiming at an esta-\n blishment of religion.

For proof\n I refer to the documents then presented to the General Assembly, and\n published since in pamphlet form, in 1816 ; furnishing a most trium-\n phant refutation of this most groundless and absurd slander.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the next place, let me ask you what are the civil and religious\n liberties of Methodism ? 1 doubt the public do not generally understand\n them ; perhaps many among youi selves are not aware how much the\n Methodist and Presbyterian churches differ in their government and\n rules. Since Mr. Monroe is so hot for civil and religious liberties, and\n sounds so loud an alarm of danger to those liberties ; let us see where\n the danger lies, and whether Methodism or Presbyterianism, tend most\n to exclusive dominion. Mr. Monroe has given us noisy declamation on\n the subject : I shall give you facts and reasons.\n</p>\n<p>\n The government of the Methodist church is exclusively in the hands\n of the itinerating clergy . The people have no part nor lot in the mat-\n ter. The bishops and circuit riders, in conference, make all the rules\n and regulations ' of the society ; and these rules made by the clergy only,\n the people under their care are bound to obey, under pain of the high-\n est punishment that the church can indict. These rules too, the cler-\n gy can alter at pleasure, to suit their own views and circumstances.\n</p>\n<p>\n As the people of your society have no liberty of choice in the forma-\n tion of laws ; so neither have they the liberty of choosing their pastors.\n Your bishops and clergy ordain ministers, without allowing you or\n your delegates to judge of their fitness ; and, then the bishop appoints\n your pastors from among them, according to his own good pleasure.\n</p>\n<p>\n One rule made foryou by your bishops and circuit riders, is, that you\n shall not refer your civil disputes to the civil courts of your country. Paul\n blamed the Corinthian Christians for going to law before their heathen\n persecutors. Your clergy seem to hold the Christian magistrates of\n our country, as unfit to judge Methodists, as if they were heathen ma-\n gistrates and persecutors. If you want some one to judge between\n you, the clergy direct you by the faw they have made, to go to the min-\n ister whom the bishop has appointed you, and to get his permission to\n choose Methodist arbitrators. Though you are allowed, nominally,\n to choose the arbitrators, yet as you must first gain permission to do so\n from the circuit rider, he possesses the power to control your choice.\n He may require what terms he will, as the condition of granting you a\n trial ; \u2014 and for all this, and for all else, he is not responsible to you in\n any way.\n</p>\n<p>\n The same remarks apply with still more force to the trial of your\n members for ecclesiastical offences. You have the form of a hearing\n by the society, or by a select number ; but the circuit rider controls the\n whole business, lie directs who shall hear the case ; he is in fact, the\n supreme judge.

Our civil courts of justice would be broken up, by that rule which\n requires Methodists to bring their differences before the circuit rider,\n and have them decided by his permission, and through his agency in\n the first instance. The circuit rider may indeed permit extraordinary\n cases to go before a civil court. But the history of Popery proves,\n that when clerical power has once got the ascendancy, it can and will\n go the whole length. Will not the same principle that led your bishops\n and circuit riders to bring your civil affairs under the control of the\n circuit riders, lead them also to complete the plan, and to confine all\n decisions to your church courts, as soon as circumstances will admit?\n They now have the power to do so. Even as the rule now stands,\n whenever Methodism prevails, your itinerating clergy will in effect be\n our justices, judges, and chancellors; they will direct all our judicial\n proceedings, and enact the statutes by which they shall be governed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Our state legislature will have nothing left to do except perhaps\n to mind those subordinate affairs, with which the Methodist clergy may\n not choose to trouble themselves. Should a Methodist majority per-\n mit them to pass judicial laws, what force would they have when the\n clerical law of Methodism takes all judicial proceedings under clerical\n jurisdiction? The clerical conference would be the supreme legisla-\n ture ; and would probably vote the civil legislature to be a useless body.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The government of the country would then be in the hands of a\n complete clerical aristocracy ; a self-appointed body, neither chosen\n by the people over whom they rule, nor responsible to them for any\n act whatever. Methodtst bishops and circuit riders would in the ful-\n lest sense be, the Lords of the land.\n</p>\n<p>\n If any one should argue that this system of clerical despotism can\n never be carried into execution, because the people would revolt a-\n gainst it : \u2014 1 answer, by stating the fact, that it has for an age been\n successfully executed on almost the whole body of Methodists,\n Some few have revolted ; but the system is daily gaining strength, and\n spreading through the country.

The fact is unquestionable. Pope-\n ry is a proof of the possibility of such a system becoming universal,\n and of its power to infatuate the understanding, and to bewitch the soul\n with incurable fanaticism.\n</p>\n<p>\n I will mention some of the means by which your clergy gain such am\n ascendancy over your minds.\n</p>\n<p>\n They govern nearly all your reading. Their book system answers\n the double purpose of drawing money from your pockets, and of infu-\n sing bigotry into your minds. They impress you with the belief that\n it is your duty to buy books almost exclusively from them ; and the\n reading which they furnish you with, is mostly controversial, and ah\n most exclusively Methodistical. It is calculated to prejudice you strong*\n ly against all other denominations 5 to give you perverted views of\n their doctrines, and unfavorable opinions of their character. With the\n same view, they generally keep you from associating with other Chris*\n tians in religious charities. They will not generally unite in circula-\n ting the Bible, except Clarke\u2019s Commentaries, or Wesley\u2019s Notes go a\n long, and turn it all into Methodism. The same remark applies to Tract\n Societies, and Sunday Schools. Societies must circulate Methodise\n Tracts, and in the Schools, Methodist doctrines must be taught, else\n your preachers generally will have nothing to do with them. It is not\n enough that those institutions are not sectarian at all : \u2014 they must be\n Methodist Societies, or meet the frowns of your preachers. These\n facts, and others which might be added, shew ihat it is the policy of\n your clergy to control your understandings, and to bring all your\n views and feelings into complete subserviency to their purposes.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another part ofthelr policy is nearly connected with this. It is to\n throw all calm exercise of the understanding into contempt ; to fill the\n minds of their disciples with a wild and shouting enthusiasm, and to set\n them in pursuit of a visionary sort of perfection.\n</p>\n<p>\n By such means they have succeeded in drilling the majority of their\n followers into as slavish devotees as ever the Pope had in the days of\n Iris glory.\n</p>\n<p>\n The public may now judge whether Methodism have a tendency to >\n preserve our \u201ccivil and religious liberties.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n As to Presbyterianism, it is sufficient to state that in all our judica-\n tories the delegates of the people, are, or, if they please may be, a ma-\n jority ; in our church sessions, the elders chosen by the people have,\n in fact, the whole power, and every church has the right of choosing\n its minister. By such a system, clerical usurpation is effectually pre-\n vented : the clergy themselves have no control of any thing, by which\n the rights of the people can be affected.

Let the can*\n did judge.\n</p>\n<p>\n I proceed to the doctrine of\n</p>\n<p>\n ELECTION.\n</p>\n<p>\n The argument of the Pastoral Letter is a very plain one. If God\n alone converts the sinner, then he chooses whom he will convert. He\n first makes choice of a sinner, and then converts him. That being es-\n tablished, the remaining point admits of no dispute; namely, that God\n always purposed, or chose to convert those whom he actually does con-\n vert. This is all that we mean by Eternal Election.\n</p>\n<p>\n This argument carries such evidence with it, that no Arminian can\n meet it with a direct contradiction. He must set out with something\n like an admission of the premises ; and then stir up a dust, under co-\n ver of which he may evade the conclusion. Such is Mr. Monroe\u2019s shift,.\n Let me blow his dust away, and shew you what a twisting and doub-\n ling course he has taken to get out of the scrape.\n</p>\n<p>\n He begins with the admission that \u201cthe efficient power of converting\n sinners is in God alone:\u201d \u201cThis,\u201d he says, \u201chas never been question-\n ed or doubted of among the Methodists.\u201d Nor, ' can he deny that G < d,\n in some sense, determined from all eternity whom he would convert :\n but, if by this we mean that he determined \u201cabsolutely and uncondi-\n tionally whom he would convert,\u201d he says, he does not admit the po-\n sition.\n</p>\n<p>\n He objects not to an eternal determination, provided, it be not abso-\n lute, but conditional, Such a conditional determination is absurd. Take\n a particular sinner, say Paul, God either always knew that he would\n convert Paul, or he knew it not. There is no middle in this case, be-\n tween knowing and not knowing a thing. If God did know it,\n then he had determined to convert Paul ; he had determined it posi-\n tively and unchangeably ; for, how could he know that he would , with*\n out having decided whether he would or not ?\n</p>\n<p>\n If God did not always know that he would convert Paul, then he\n had no determination about it , for, if he had determined the matter he\n must have known it.\n</p>\n<p>\n This Arminian notion of conditional determinations, applies only to\n an ignorant, weak, dependent being.\n</p>\n<p>\n The argument of the Letter is, that if God alone converts sinners*\n then he always knew and determined beforehand whom he would con-\n vert. Mr. M. would not say, whether God knew and determined or\n sot ; but raising a dust with his \u201cif,\u201d and his \u201cabsolute,\u201d he posts a*\n way to another \u201cif.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIf,\u201d says he \u201cby the sovereign grace of God they mean an immedi-\n ate, irresistible act of grace, we are opposed to the sentiment.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Some of our old writers used the term \u201cirresistible\u201d to distinguish\n</p>\n<p>\n that act of God\u2019s \u201cefficient power,\u201d by which the sinner is converted*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0014/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 141, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 258}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0014/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 283, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 517}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0014/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 567, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1034}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0014/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1134, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2069}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0014/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4139}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0014/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/le/tt/er/to/me/th/od/is/00/un/se/lettertomethodis00unse/lettertomethodis00unse_0014.jp2", "height": 4139, "width": 2269, "levels": 6, "size": 717336}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"14\">\n<p>\n it docs no violence to the mind, but delivers the heart from bondage %\n it rices not force the sinner, but creates him anew in Christ Jesus.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. M. has admitted that the \u201cefficient power of converting sinners\n is in God alone.\u201d That efficient power, is, I presume, a power which\n cjfe.cts, decides, and brings to pass the conversion of the sinner.

The first, is, \u201cinitial grace,\u201d by\n which the will is made free, and man is constituted a moral agent ; and\n the second, is, the preaching of the Gospel, in what he calls \u201cdemon-\n stration of the spirit.\u201d This last phrase is put in merely for a blind.\n It cannot mean here, what Paul meant by it, namely, miracles in proof\n of the Gospel. Nor can it mean any influence of the Holy Spirit, which\n decides the sinner\u2019s conversion, or works on the impressed bearers\n more than on the rest : for, the only effect which he ascribes, both to his\n initial grace, and to the demonstration of the Spirit, is, that the sinner\n is thereby enabled \u201cto receive or reject the Gospel.\u201d It amounts to\n nothing more, after all, than constituting man a moral agent ; so that\n he can ciioose, whether he will \u201creceive or reject the Gospel.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Then, he says, \u201cGod has predetermined to convert those who re-\n ceive the Gospel, and yieldto its influence.\u201d Now, if that change of\n mind which is expressed by receiving and yielding to the influence of\n the Gospei, be not conversion ; \u2014 what is conversion ? If there be any\n sense in Mr. M ? s language, it must signify, that God predetermined to\n convert the sinner, after he had converted himself. And, so, this is Mr.\n M\u2019s \u201cefficient converting power of God.\u201d It is exercised as much on\n the unconverted, as on the converted.\n</p>\n<p>\n According to this system, God\u2019s efficient power and grace do noth-\n ing in effect for man, but to constitute him a moral agent, with power\n to receive or reject ; a nd to reveal the Gospel for moral agents to\n preach or not, as they may happen to choose.\n</p>\n<p>\n He says, \u201cit is thus, (by initial grace,) that man is constituted a mo-\n ral agent, and properly accountable for his actions.\u201d Well, what would\n fallen man be by nature , and without this \u201cinitial grace ?\u201d Depraved,\n no doubt, with base passions, and a perverse will, like a natural brute\n beast, but not \u201caccountable for his actions;\u201d that is, not a sinner, not\n liable to guilt and punishment.

They seem to mean by it, almost any\n thing that militates against the sovereign counsels of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n When you Arminians yourselves are not thinking of Decrees, you\n practically admit that moral agency consists only in the power of ration-\n al judgment, and the power of acting according to our judgment.\n</p>\n<p>\n Brutes, ideots, persons in sleep, cannot judge rationally ; therefore,\n they are not moral agents. Persons of weak understanding are deem-\n ed less guilty, than those who have a clear discernment of what is\n right and wrong. Slaves driven by a master, are not so much moral\n agents as their masters ; because they have not so much power to act\n according to the dictates of their own understandings. A crime is great-\n er when deliberately committed, than when the doer of it was hurried to\n action by some sudden excitement : plainly, because he had not in the\n latter case, so much power to form a rational judgment.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nothing destroys moral agency, but what destroys either the power\n of rational judgment, or the power of acting as the judgment dictates.\n</p>\n<p>\n Hence, we are not the less moral agents, because our actions are fore-\n seen, either by God or man. We never, in our practical affairs, think,\n of excusing a criminal, because some discerning person foretold his con-\n duct.

God\u2019s power must blind his dis-\n cernment, before these infinite perfections can harmonize !\n</p>\n<p>\n Not know ing which way to turn himself on this subject, he flies for\n relief to Dr. Adam Clark, and gives us, from his Commentary, along\n extract on the foreknowledge of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Doctor\u2019s theory is two fold. It gives two distinct views of\n the subject. I shall set down so many of his words undereach view,\n as will suffice to show his meaning plainly.\n</p>\n<p>\n First view. \u201cGod cannot have foreknowledge strictly speaking,\n because this would Suppose there was something coming, in what we\n call futurity, which had not yet arrived at the presence of the Deity.\n Nothing can be past to him, because he exists in all past lime : futu-\n rity and pretereity are relative terms to us ; but they can have no rela-\n tion to that God who dwells in every point of eternity ; with whom all\n that is past, all that is present, and all that is future, exists in one infi-\n mite, indivisible and eternal now.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Second view. \u201cBy contingent, I mean such things, as the infinite\n wisdom of God has thought proper to poise on the possibility of being,\n or not being ; leaving it to the will of intelligent beings to turn the\n scale. God foresees nothing as absolutely and inevitably certain,\n which he has made contingent ; and, because he has designed it to be\n contingent, therefore, he cannot know it as absolutely and inevitably\n certain. I conclude, that God, though omniscient, is not obliged, in\n consequence of this, to know all that he can know ; no more, than he\n is obliged, because he is omnipotent, to do all that he can do.\u201d-\u2014 See\n A. Clark, on Acts 2.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, let us for a moment consider this last statement. Dr. C. thinks,\n thai as power to do all things is omnipotence, so, the mere power to\n know all things is omniscience. But the power to know all things is\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0021/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 141, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 258}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0021/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 283, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 517}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0021/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 567, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1034}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0021/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1134, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2069}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0021/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4139}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0021/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/le/tt/er/to/me/th/od/is/00/un/se/lettertomethodis00unse/lettertomethodis00unse_0021.jp2", "height": 4139, "width": 2269, "levels": 6, "size": 640560}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"21\">\n<p>\n * \u2014 21 -* '\n</p>\n<p>\n not knowledge.

This may be a very comfortable conclusion to such\n preachers as sometimes publicly boast that they never rubbed their\n shoulders against a college wall.\n</p>\n<p>\n Out such reasoning you see instantly, is most absurd.

Can any thing more be wanting to ex-\n pose the hollowness of this most Heaven dishonouring sentiment ? Do\n you say you are not yet convinced ? I beg your candid attention to\n some further remarks, then, on Dr. C\u2019s two fold theory of Divine om-\n niscience.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the first view of Dr. C\u2019s theory, I have some plain remarks to\n make. I beg your candid attention to them.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. If there be, as Dr. C. says, no futurity with God, but an eter-\n nal now ; then, no part of our future conduct can be unsettled, or un-\n certain, in any way, to him. Our future acts are not future to hirn,\n but present : even now they are with him. Neither can God\u2019s own\n acts be future to him ; if they were, then there would be a futurity in\n God\u2019s view, and not an eternal now. So, according to Dr. C. all the\n actions of men ; all God\u2019s dealings with men, from the first to the last,\n were as much present with God at the Creation, as they will be at the\n day of Judgment.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Nothing can be uncertain or contingent in God\u2019s view according\n to this theory. If all times and all things be now with God ; if none o &\n them be yet to come, they must be perfectly evident to him, unless we\n suppose him uncertain of what is actually present to his all-seeing mind.\n If the past and the future be all one to God, all an eternal now,\n then the things yet future to us, are as certain to God as the past.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. But suppose that God shuts his eyes on some things, so as to be\n himself uncertain about them ; then he must forever feel the same un-\n certainty. The moment that you admit that God will in future come\n to a certainty about them, that moment you acknowledge a future with\n God. You say he is now uncertain ; but in future that uncertainty\n will pass away, and certainty will come into his mind. But if all\n things be now to God, that certainty can never reach him ; it is not\n now , it is future. Future certainty may come to us, because to us\n there is a futurity : but to God there is none, as Dr. C. says. Future\n certainty has nothing to do with God. All the certainty that God can\n have He has now.\n</p>\n<p>\n So, according to the first part of the Doctor\u2019s theory, all future\n things are present with God, and therefore, fixed and certain with him.\n Consequently, nothing is contingent or uncertain to him ; if any thing\n were uncertain to him now, it would always be uncertain.

Dr. Clark is\n a Predestinarian here.\n</p>\n<p>\n Out, when we come to the second view\u2019 of his theory, all is reversed.\n Earth and heaven are full of uncertainties and contingencies; of things\n merely possible of which God keeps himself in a state of voluntary ig-\n norance. We hear no more of past, present, and future things existing\n to God in one indivisible now? We hear no more that the reason\n why God has no proper foreknowledge, is, that all things are actually\n in present existence to Him, whose presence extends through all eter-\n nity. The reason against foreknowledge now, is, that God looking\n forward to futurity, discovers a multitude of things to be possible ; but\n choosing not to know whether they will ever come into existence ; he\n leaves it to free agents to decide, whether they shall or not ? It follows\n as necessarily, that God knows none of his own future acts in relation\n to free agents.^ for his acts of Providence to be wise , must be adapt-\n ed to the arts . character , and circumstances of his creatures ; of\n which acts , fyc. he knows nothing certainly , $\u2022/\u2022. ; this uncertainty co-\n vers the whob future actions of moral agents, and all their consequen-\n ces ; for Dr. Clark asserts, that so far as God certainly foresees the\n acts of his creatures, he destroys their free agency.\n</p>\n<p>\n Brethren, this is a serious matter; and we ought to consider it with\n the most candid attention. Let me oflV-r you the following view of what\n th^ Doctor\u2019s theory of contingencies, really implies. He says, that\n \u201cGod foresees nothing as absolutely and inevitably certain, which he\n has made contingent.\u201d Front the terms \u201cabsolutely, and inevitably,\u201d\n xve must understand that God may almost foresee what a free agent\n will do. But, if absolute certainty in God, destroys the creature\u2019s ac-\n countability ; almost certainty in God, must have almost the same ef-\n fect. Indeed, the inevitable conclusion from the Doctor\u2019s theory of\n contingencies, is, that God hns no real knowledge of future events at\n all ; so far as free agents are concerned.\n</p>\n<p>\n You know, that in the world, one thing grows out of another ; one\n action gives rise to others which would not have existed, but for the\n action that caused them. Thus, I should not have written this Let-\n ter, had not 1 seen Mr. Monroe\u2019s Reply ; nor would he have written\n that, but for the Pastoral Letter; which itself grew out of a previous\n combination of circumstances, which were links in a continual and\n fttultifar.ious chain of events, that extends back to the creation of man.\n These things have all depended, we may say, one on another, for their\n coming to pass.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, these are acts of free agents, and therefore, as Dr. C. says,\n were foreseen only, as possible, not as certain things. The Deity, then\n may have foreseen, that possibly the Pastoral Letter might be written.\n Then, he saw that the Pastoral Letter might possibly lead to the Re-\n ply 3 and the Reply, by a third possibility to this Letter. You may see.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0023/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 141, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 258}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0023/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 283, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 517}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0023/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 567, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1034}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0023/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1134, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2069}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0023/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4139}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:le:tt:er:to:me:th:od:is:00:un:se:lettertomethodis00unse:lettertomethodis00unse_0023/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/le/tt/er/to/me/th/od/is/00/un/se/lettertomethodis00unse/lettertomethodis00unse_0023.jp2", "height": 4139, "width": 2269, "levels": 6, "size": 728102}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"23\">\n<p>\n on a moment\u2019s reflection, that the second possibility is weaker than\n the first ; because it unites the uncertainty of both in itself Th^ third\n possibility is weaker still ; lor it takes in the uncertainty of all those\n which it depends on.
