This is why:\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. It has ALL local news, and no other paper has.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. It contains FULL accounts of everything, while other papers contain\n only a synopsis. When there is a convention, a banquet or ball game, I want\n to know ALL about it. If it is a sermon, or a prize fight, and I am not interested,\n I read the headlines only; but what I AM interested in I want to know ALL about.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. It is a daily literary and artistic treat, brimming over with wit, wisdom,\n art and common sense.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. It contains such an endless variety of matter that it satisfies my every\n whim, mood and caprice.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5. Its editorial page is a scholarly history and philosophy of the times, and\n broadens my view, though I don\u2019t always agree.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6. It is recognized all over the world as one of the greatest American papers.\n</p>\n<p>\n 7.

J. Carlin Con\u00ac\n struction Company for the sum of\n $174,144. The design was made by\n McKim, Mead & White, 156 Fifth\n avenue, New York, and was said\n to be the last effort of Mr. Stanford White.\n</p>\n<p>\n The site of the Monument is on the high\u00ac\n est part of Fort Greene, and is surrounded by\n a granolithic plaza 220x220 feet, in the center of\n which stands the shaft. The base of the shaft\n contains a double platform, or stylobate, 54 feet\n square, and the two entrances to the shaft are on\n the second platform and face east and west. To\n the north there is a granite approach to the upper\n plaza from the lower level. It consists of three\n flights of 34 steps each, 100 feet wide, with two\n intermediate platforms of granolithic pavement,\n and the two extremities of the flights being of\n granite coping. On the second platform and in\n the center of the flight of steps there is a descent\n to the crypt, which is, therefore, concealed under\n the steps, and wherein are contained the bones of\n the Prison Ship Martyrs.\n</p>\n<p>\n The height of the shaft from the lower plaza\n to the top of the bronze urn is 195 feet 8 inches,\n and from the upper plaza 145 feet 8 inches, the\n height of the urn being 20 feet 8 inches.\n</p>\n<p>\n A glass hemisphere rests in the top of the urn\n</p>\n<p>\n directly over eighty 100-candle power incandes\u00ac\n cent lights, which at night reflect electric rays,\n and on sunny days is visible from great distances.\n The top of the urn is fitted with a gas outlet\n which will produce a flame similar to a torch, and\n the entire Monument is otherwise lighted by in\u00ac\n candescent globes.\n</p>\n<p>\n The diameter of the shaft at the base is 17 feet\n 6 inches from flute to flute, and the interior\n diameter is 9 feet.\n</p>\n<p>\n An electric elevator and two circular flights\n of stairs furnish means of reaching the top, where\n there are two openings on the abacus course, per\u00ac\n mitting a beautiful view of the entire city.\n</p>\n<p>\n Four corners of the upper plaza contain gran\u00ac\n ite standards 3 feet in diameter and 10 feet high,\n in which are placed Toerring lights trained upon\n the Monument, thus furnishing illumination to the\n exterior.\n</p>\n<p>\n The inclosure about the entire plaza consists of\n Japanese hedge. There are four spaces, 25x70\n feet, in which it is intended to ultimately construct\n pergolas.\n</p>\n<p>\n The granite for the shaft and stylobate was\n obtained from the Newport White Granite\n Quarry, located in the northern part of New York\n State, and near the Canada border line. The\n granite for the steps is from Green Island, Maine.\n The interior of the Monument, or the backing\n for the granite, is of brick painted with enamel\n paint.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":

land,\n</p>\n<p>\n The trumpetings of doom;\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Yea, through your sleep ye knew the orphan\u2019s cry,\n The broken hearts\u2019 far clamoring,\n</p>\n<p>\n And the pale heroes plucking deathless wreaths\n From fields o\u2019ershadowed by the buzzard\u2019s wing!\n Oh, in what direful school\n Learned ye the iron rigor of the mind\n Your memory bequeaths?\n</p>\n<p>\n Was it in plague and famine ye did find\n Such right divine to rule\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Such hope in God and man\u2014that double stay\n Of commonwealths to-day?\n</p>\n<p>\n For here, the sponsors for all ages,\n</p>\n<p>\n Ye gave as solemn gages\n Not blood alone\n But very flesh and bone!\n</p>\n<p>\n Nor pledged ye only for the strong and brave,\n</p>\n<p>\n But for the generations yet unborn\n By every strand remote that greets the morn,\n</p>\n<p>\n For the pale despot shackled to his throne\n As for the serf and slave.\n</p>\n<p>\n O stalworth dreamers in the dust,\n</p>\n<p>\n That God who took your young hearts\u2019 trust,\n</p>\n<p>\n Your pangs, the issue of your patriot cause,\n</p>\n<p>\n Still sways the stars and souls of men\n With th\u2019 ancient seals and laws;\n</p>\n<p>\n Nor did He turn and mock your anguish when\n Ye cried His password through eternity\n And died in fetters so ye might be free.\n</p>\n<p>\n O martyrdom of hope!\u2014to lie\n In youth and strength\u2014and die\n ' Mid rotting hulks that once by every sea\n And star swung carelessly\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n To die becalmed in war\u2019s black hell,\n</p>\n<p>\n Where in the noon\u2019s wide blaze your hearts could\n soar\n</p>\n<p>\n With gull and eagle by each cherished shore\n Of home\u2014where ye had sworn to dwell\n The fathers of the free.\n</p>\n<p>\n Doom like to this the Lydian victim bore\n Who clutched at feasts divine\u2014only to starve the\n more.\n</p>\n<p>\n Well might the blue skies and the breeze\n Which once perchance swept Delphi o\u2019er,\n</p>\n<p>\n Well might the star-eyes question:\u2014\u201cWhat are\n these\n</p>\n<p>\n Heaped holocausts on Freedom\u2019s shrine?\n</p>\n<p>\n Not even the dullard ox unto our altars led\n Of old, but walked \u2019mid reverent throng\n Anoint and garlanded!\n</p>\n<p>\n What rite of hate or scorn of law divine\n Strikes down its victims here\n With not a funeral song\n Nor poor libation of a tear?\u2019\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n To-day give answer\u2014ye, who mid the battle\u2019s roar\n Have known the rapture of a patriot\u2019s death,\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Ye, who have seen the aureole trembling o\u2019er\n Your brows as anguish clutched at Life\u2019s fond\n breath,\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Blessed and radiant now!\u2014look down\n In consecration of the solemn deed\n Which here commemorates this iron breed\n Of martyrs nameless in the clay\n As the true heroes of our newer day\u2014\n World-heroes\u2014patterned not on king and demi\u00ac\n god\n</p>\n<p>\n Of charioted splendor or of crown\n Blood-crusted\u2014but on toilers in the sod,\n</p>\n<p>\n On reapers of the sea, on lovers of mankind,\n Whose bruised shoulders bear\n The lumbering wain 6f progress\u2014all who share\n The crust and sorrows of our mortal lot\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Lamps of the soul The Christ hath left behind\n To light the path whereon He faltered not.\n</p>\n<p>\n Yea, now the boom of guns,\n</p>\n<p>\n The scarlet bugles, faint from off the world!\n</p>\n<p>\n Lo, o\u2019er the loftier brows of man, unfurled\n The purer banners of the dawning suns!\n</p>\n<p>\n Banners of God in godlike minds\u2014of hope\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Of faith, to daunt the crafty hordes of greed\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":

them thou Mightest now have been Poor and Destitute\n In all thy Liberties.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was not theirs to Die Peacefully at Home,\n</p>\n<p>\n Surrounded by their Kindred,\n</p>\n<p>\n Which has

Despair.\n</p>\n<p>\n Their Graves were but a Hasty Trench;\n</p>\n<p>\n Deserving Glory, they were Rewarded with Oblivion.\n</p>\n<p>\n For Years Liberty Wandered in Despair,\n</p>\n<p>\n Seeking Recognition for her Martyr Children,\n</p>\n<p>\n But was Driven from all Doors.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Land they had Suffered to Create, and Perished to Enrich\n Trod above their Sacred Dust, Thoughtless and Unknowing.\n</p>\n<p>\n Such are the Elements of Freedom.\n</p>\n<p>\n And Such are the Steps by which She Rises.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is the Glory of Sacrifice to be Unknown,\n</p>\n<p>\n But it is the Lasting Dishonor of Nations not to Care.\n</p>\n<p>\n They Gave to their Captors a Noble but Useless Remonstrance,\n</p>\n<p>\n Refusing to Accept Liberty at the Price of Honor.\n</p>\n<p>\n They

PRISON SHIP MARTYRS\n</p>\n<p>\n The Society of Old Brooklynites look with deep seated satisfaction at the completion of more than twenty years\n of continuous and earnest work for the erection of an appropriate reminder of the heroic sufferings of\n the patriots who were confined in the prison ships in the Wallabout and who died there, because they were not will\u00ac\n ing to sacrifice their consciences and their loyalty to their country. The monument erected to their memory is at\n Fort Greene, within full view of the spot where they gave up their lives after the most horrible suffering at the hands\n of their brutal captors, during the Revolutionary War.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Society of Old Brooklynites deems that a record of the silent, brave sufferings of these heroes, whose bones\n rest under the marble on Fort Greene, demands even more than this in order that the citizens of Brooklyn and the\n younger generation of the borough may learn the lessons of patriotism taught by these humble heroes. Therefore,\n the Society, through its Historian Felix G. Kernan, have collated the following history of the Prison Ship Mar\u00ac\n tyrs for publication as one of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle Library series. It is the only complete history of the Prison\n Ship Martyrs and the events leading up to the placing of the Monument on Fort Greene.\u2014Ed.\n</p>\n<p>\n HAT the present generation\n may better understand the\n purpose of the imposing\n monument that crowns the\n heights of Fort Greene\n Park, and the virtues and\n patriotism of the Prison-ship Martyrs\n whose memory it is designed to honor, a\n short account of their sufferings and pri\u00ac\n vations while incarcerated on board of\n those pestilental hulks in Wallabout Bay,\n is taken from historical records written\n by those who were eye-witnesses and\n victims of the inhuman persecution of\n their merciless captors. And of them\n may we not say in the words of Maxcy,\n \u201cThey are bending from the bright\n abodes. A voice from the altar cries\n \u2018these are they who loved their coun\u00ac\n try; these are they who died for lib\u00ac\n erty.\u2019 W T e reap the fruit of their agony\n and toil. Let their memories be eter\u00ac\n nally embalmed in our bosoms. Let the\n infants of all posterity prattle their fame\n and drop tears of courage for their fate.\n May this memorial swell into the heav\u00ac\n ens and the pillar of divine glory de\u00ac\n scending from God rest forever on its\n summit.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n And may the patriotism which inspired\n them in the \u201ctimes that tried men\u2019s\n souls,\u201d be our highest ambition to emu\u00ac\n late. May their love of country be in-\n shrined in our hearts and teach us to\n preserve the liberty for which they of\u00ac\n fered up their lines as a sacrifice to\n their country in those dungeons of hor\u00ac\n rors\u2014the prison-ships in Wallabout Bay.\n May we preserve the blessings they ob\u00ac\n tained by the incessant labors of eight\n distressful years and transmit to pos\u00ac\n terity our flag unsullied and our liberties\n triumphant.\n</p>\n<p>\n We read in the memoirs of Silas Tal\u00ac\n bot that 20,000 Americans died on board\n of the prison-ships during the Revolution;\n of which vast number 11.644 found relief\n in death on the Jersey alone. Had these\n victims been less arduous in their pat\u00ac\n riotism or less firm in their devotion to\n liberty and had they purchased their\n lives by enlisting in the service of the\n enemy as they were daily importuned to\n do. the struggle of our forefathers would\n have no doubt been indefinitely pro\u00ac\n longed; but, to the credit of American\n manhood, less than one hundred pur\u00ac\n chased life at the expense of honor.\n</p>\n<p>\n The defeats of the patriots at the\n battle of Long Island, in August, 1776,\n and the capture of Fort Washington the\n following November gave the British be\u00ac\n tween 4,000 and 5,000 prisoners, and this\n number was constantly increased by the\n arrest of citizens suspected of complicity\n with the rebellion. The only prisons\n then existing in New York City were the\n \u201cNew Jail,\u201d standing until recently and\n used as the Hall of Records; and the\n Bridewell, whi h was located near the\n corner of Broadwav and Chambers street\n These were entirely inadequate for the\n accommodation of this large number of\n prisoners which was daily increasing by\n the accession of captive patrols. They\n were soon filled to overflowing, so that\n space enough could not be found to lie\n down and rest upon the hard and filthy\n floors. It was found necessary to appro\u00ac\n priate other places for their accommoda\u00ac\n tion. Among the buildings thus used were\n Van Courtland\u2019s sugar house, which stood\n on the corner of Thames and Lumber\n streets, at the northwest corner of Trin\u00ac\n ity churchyard, Rhinelander\u2019s, on the\n</p>\n<p>\n corner of William and Duane streets, and\n one on Liberty street, about the present\n Nos. 34 and 36. The churches so occupied\n were the Middle Dutch Church, which was\n located on the corner of Nassau and Lib\u00ac\n erty streets, which for many years after\n the war was used as the United States\n Post Office; the North Dutch Church,\n which was situated at the corner of Fair\n street and Horse and Cart lane (now\n Fulton and William streets), and the\n Brick Church, which occupied the triangle\n formed by the intersection of Park row.\n Beekman and Nassau streets. Subse\u00ac\n quently this last mentioned, together with\n the Presbyterian Church in Wall street,\n the Scotch Church in Cedar street and\n the Friends Meeting House in Liberty\n street, were converted into hospitals.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHere in these loathsome dungeons, de\u00ac\n nied the light and air of heaven, scantily\n fed on poor, putrid and sometimes even\n uncooked food, obliged to endure the\n companionship of the most abandoned\n criminals and those sick with smallpox\n and other infectious diseases, worn out\n by the groans and complaints of their\n suffering fellows and subject to every\n conceivable insult and indignity by their\n inhuman keepers, thousands of Americana\n sickened and died. Almost preferable by\n comparison was the fate of those who\n without a moment\u2019s warning and at mid\u00ac\n night were hurried by the provost to\n the gallows and an unknown grave\u201d\u2014\n (Stile\u2019s Hist.). The infamous Cunning\u00ac\n ham was at that time the provost marshal\n of the city, a brute by nature and often\u00ac\n times seemed possessed by a demon. The\n sick and dying received no mercy at his\n hands. Healthy men were consigned to\n the same room with those suffering from\n the most loathsome diseases.

Kernan,\n</p>\n<p>\n Historian of the Society of Old Brooklynites.\n</p>\n<p>\n aade the following statement in regard\n o his treatment of the American pris-\n ners: \u2018I shudder to think of the murders\n have been accessory to., both with and\n without orders from government, espe-\n ially while in New York, during which\n ime there were more than 2,000 pris-\n mers starved in the different churches\n ly stopping their rations, which I sold.\u2019\n ffiere were also two hundred and sev-\n nty-five American prisoners and obnox-\n ous persons executed out of all, of which\n lumber there were only about one dozen\n mblic executions, chiefly consisting of\n Jritish and Hessian deserters. The\n node of private executions was thus:\n 1 guard was dispatched from the provost\n</p>\n<p>\n dead cart and carried to the neighbor\u00ac\n hood of Canal street and buried with\u00ac\n out a vestige of ceremony. Great, how\u00ac\n ever, as were the sufferings of those in\u00ac\n carcerated within the prisons of the city,\n they were exceeded, if possible, by those\n unfortunate prisoners who languished in\n the prison ships of the Wallabout. Two\n vessels were in service at a time for the\n reception of prisoners. Those thus used\n either as prison ships or hospital ships\n during the continuance of the war were\n the Whitby, the Jersey, the John,\n the Falmouth, the Chatham, the\n Kitty, the Frederick, the Glasgow,\n the Woodlands, the Scheldt, the\n Clyde, the Transport, the Scorpion,\n</p>\n<p>\n the Hunter, the Strombola, the Prince\n of Wales and the Good Hope.\n These were originally the trans\u00ac\n port vessels in which cattle and other\n supplies were brought over to America\n in 1776 and which had been anchored in\n Sheepshead Bay.\n</p>\n<p>\n Johnson (Nav. Mag. 467-469) says the\n Whitby was the first prison ship an\u00ac\n chored in the Wallabout. She was moored\n near Remsen\u2019s Mill, about October 20,\n 1776, and was then crowded with prison\u00ac\n ers. Many landsmen were prisoners on\n board this vessel and she was said to be\n the most sickly of all the prison ships.\n Bad provisions, bad water and scanty ra\u00ac\n tions were dealt to the prisoners. No\n medical men attended the sick. Disease\n reigned unrelieved and hundreds died\n from pestilence or were starved aboard\n this floating prison. I saw the sand\n beach between the ravine in the hill and\n Mr. Remsen\u2019s dock become filled with\n graves in the course of two months and\n before May 1, 1777, the ravine alluded to\n was itself occupied in the same way. In\n the month of May, 1777, two large ships\n were anchored in the Wallabout where\n the prisoners were transferred to them.\n These vessels were also very sickly from\n the causes before stated. On a Sunday\n afternoon in the middle of October, 1777,\n one of the prison ships, was burned,\n the prisoners\u2014except a few whom it\n was said were burned in the vessel\u2014\n being removed to the remaining ship.\n It was reported at the time that the\n prisoners had fired their prisons which,\n if true, proves that they preferred death\n even by fire to the lingering sufferings\n of pestilence and starvation. In Febru\u00ac\n ary. 1778, the remaining prison ship was\n burning at night when the prisoners were\n removed from her to the ships wintering\n in the Wallabout.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of all these prison ships the Old Jer\u00ac\n sey, or the Hell, as she was called from\n the large number confined on her\u2014often\n more than a thousand at a time\u2014and the\n terrible sufferings they endured, has won\n a terrible pre-eminence in the sad his\u00ac\n tory of the prison ships in which her\n Dame has become a synonym. In 1779,\n she was converted into a prison ship and\n her appearance is graphically described\n by Captain Dring (Dring\u2019s Narrative, p.\n 26): \u201cLeaving New York with 130 prison\u00ac\n ers brought in by the British ship Beli-\n sarius, we proceeded to the place of their\n imprisonment under the charge of the\n notorious David Sproat, commissary of\n prisoners. At length we turned a point,\u201d\n he says, \u201cand came in view of the Walla\u00ac\n bout, where lay before us the hulk of the\n Old Jersey, with her satellites, the three\n hospital ships, to which Sproat pointed\n in an exulting manner and said, \u2018There,\n rebels, there is the cage for you.\u2019 * * *\n While waiting alongside for orders some\n of the prisoners, whose features they\n could not see on account of the increas\u00ac\n ing darkness, addressed them through\n the air holes of the Jersey. After some\n questions as to whence they came and\n concerning their capture, one of the\n prisoners remarked \u2018that it is a lament\u00ac\n able thing to see so many young men in\n full strength, with the flush of health up\u00ac\n on their countenances, about to enter\n this infernal place of abode. Death,\u2019 he\n said, \u2018had no relish for such skeleton\n carcasses as we are, but he will now\n have a feast upon you newcomers.\u2019 \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The newcomers were registered and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pr:og:ra:mo:fd:ed:ic:at:00:un:se:_0:programofdedicat00unse_0:programofdedicat00unse_0_0021/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 329, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 488}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pr:og:ra:mo:fd:ed:ic:at:00:un:se:_0:programofdedicat00unse_0:programofdedicat00unse_0_0021/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 659, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 976}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pr:og:ra:mo:fd:ed:ic:at:00:un:se:_0:programofdedicat00unse_0:programofdedicat00unse_0_0021/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1319, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pr:og:ra:mo:fd:ed:ic:at:00:un:se:_0:programofdedicat00unse_0:programofdedicat00unse_0_0021/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2638, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3907}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pr:og:ra:mo:fd:ed:ic:at:00:un:se:_0:programofdedicat00unse_0:programofdedicat00unse_0_0021/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/pr/og/ra/mo/fd/ed/ic/at/00/un/se/_0/programofdedicat00unse_0/programofdedicat00unse_0_0021.jp2", "height": 3907, "width": 2638, "levels": 6, "size": 892701}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"21\">\n<p>\n HISTORY OF THE PRISON SHIP MARTYRS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 19\n</p>\n<p>\n sent below, but the, intolerable heat and\n foul air rendered sleep impossible, and\n when they sought the air holes in order\n to gain one breath of exterior a\u2019r they\n found them occupied by others who\n seemed to be justified by the law of self-\n preservation in keeping possession and\n could not be induced to relinquish their\n places even for a moment.\n</p>\n<p>\n The first care of a prisoner after arriv\u00ac\n ing upon the Jersey was to be admitted\n into some regular mess. On the day of\n a prisoner\u2019s arrival it was impossible for\n him to procure any food and even on the\n second day he could not procure any in\n time to have it cooked. No matter how\n long he had fasted nor how acute might\n be his sufferings from hunger and priva\u00ac\n tions, his petty tyrants would on no occa\u00ac\n sion deviate from their rule of delivering\n the prisoner\u2019s morsel at a particular hour\n and at no other, and the poor half-fam\u00ac\n ished wretch must wait until the coming\n day before his pittance of food could be\n boiled with that of his fellow captives.\n These messes consisted generally of six\n men each and all numbered. As soon as\n a number was called the person repre\u00ac\n senting it hurried forward to the window\n in the bu\u2019khead of the steward\u2019s room,\n from which was handed the allowance for\n the day. These rations, insufficient and\n miserable, were frequently not given to\n the prisoners in time to be boiled on the\n same day, thus obliging them often to\n fast for another twenty-four hours or to\n consume it raw, as they sometimes did.\n</p>\n<p>\n The cooking was done in what was\n usually called the galley, a copper boiler\n inclosed in brickwork about eight feet\n square. This boiler was large enough to\n contain two or three hogsheads of water.\n</p>\n<p>\n ; it was made in a square form and divided\n into two separate compartments by a\n partition. In one side of the copper the\n peas and oatmeal of the prisoners were\n boiled, which was done in fresh water;\n in the other the meat was boiled. This\n side of the boiler was filled with salt\n water from alongside the ship, by which !\n means the copper became corroded and j\n conseqently poisonous. Fox, in his Ad- j\n ventures, says: \u201cThe inside of the copper I\n had become corroded to such a degree !\n that it was lined with a coat of verdigris j\n and that the effect of this was evident in J\n the cadaverous countenances of the ema\u00ac\n ciated beings who had remained on board\n for any length of time.\u201d He also says:\n \u201cThe Jersey, from her size and lying\n near the shore, was embedded in the mud\n and I do not recollect seeing her afloat j\n during the whole time I was a prisoner, j\n All the filth which accumulated among |\n upward of a thousand men and thrown j\n overboard would remain there until car\u00ac\n ried away by the tide. The impurity of |\n the water may be easily conceived, and |\n in this water our meat was boiled.\u201d The j\n quality of food supplied to the prisoners\n was the worst that could be obtained.\n Sherburne (III) says: \u201cThe bread and\n beef supplied was condemned in the\n British navy. The bread had been so\n eaten by weevils that one might easily\n crush it in the hand and blow it away.\n The oatmeal was scarcely ever sweet, it\n was generally so musty and bitter that\n none but people suffering as we did cou ' d\n eat it.\u201d Andros (p. 17) says of the bread:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI do not recollect seeing any which was\n not full of living vermin, but eat it\n worms and all we must, or starve.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It is related by Coffin that, \u201con the\n</p>\n<p>\n j upper deck of the Jersey hogs were kept\n in pens by those officers who had charge\n I of her, for their own use. They were\n I sometimes fed with bran. The prisoners,\n whenever they could get an opportunity\n undiscovered by the sentries, would, with\n their tin pots, scoop the bran from the\n troughs and eat it with seemingly as good\n an appetite as the hogs themselves.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMemory,\u201d says a survivor, \" still\n brings before me those emaciated beings\n moving from the galley with their wretch\u00ac\n ed pittance of meat, each creeping to the\n spur where his messmates were as\u00ac\n sembled, to divide It with a group of hag\u00ac\n gard and sickly creatures, their garments\n nanging in tatters around their meager\n limbs and the hue of death upon their\n careworn faces. And even from this vile\n fare they would rise up in torments from\n \u2018lie cravings of hunger and thirst.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The daily routine on board these Gol-\n gothas, such as washing decks and gang\u00ac\n ways, spreading awnings, hoisting the\n wood and water, was performed by a\n \u201cworking party\u201d of about twenty of the\n prisoners, who received as a compensa\u00ac\n tion a full allowance of provisions and\n the privilege of going on deck early in\n the morning to breathe the pure air.\n When the prisoners ascended to the upper\n deck in the morning, if the day was fair,\n each carried up his own hammock and\n bedding, which were placed on the upper\n deck, on booms. The cry was then heard,\n \u201cRebels, bring up your dead!\u201d The com\u00ac\n mand was obeyed and all who died during\n the night were brought on deck. Prison\u00ac\n ers were allowed to sew a blanket over\n the remains of their dead companions.\n</p>\n<p>\n Captain Coffin (Hist.

An English seaman reported\n to the officer that one hammock was ob\u00ac\n served to move and told the officer that\n he believed that the man in the hammock\n was not dead. \u2018In with him,\u2019 said the\n officer, \u2018if he is not dead he soon will be.\u2019\n But the honest tar, more humane than his\n officer, swore he never would bury a man\n alive and took his penknife and ripped\n open the hammock, when, behold, the man\n was really alive! The man afterward was\n released and lived for some years.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The beds and clothing were kept on\n deck until two hours before sundown,\n After this was done the prisoners were\n allowed either to retire between decks or\n remain above until sunset. \u201cThe work\u00ac\n ing party,\u201d says Dring, \u201cwere ordered to\n carry the tubs below and we prepared to\n descend to our crowded and gloomy dun\u00ac\n geons, saluted with the obnoxious cry,\n \u2018Down, rebels, down!\u2019 When all had re\u00ac\n tired to the hold the hatchway was closed,\n leaving only a small trap-door open to\n admit air. At this door a sentinel was\n</p>\n<p>\n placed, with instructions to allow only\n one man to ascend at a time during the\n night.\u201d (Burke says, p. 96): \u201cDuring the\n time, among other cruelties which were\n committed, I have known many of the\n American prisoners put to death by the\n bayonet. In particular, I well recollect\n that it was the custom on board the ship\n for but one prisoner at a time to be\n admitted on deck at night besides the\n guards or sentinels. One night, while the\n prisoners were many of them assembled\n at the gate at the hatchway for the pur\u00ac\n pose of obtaining fresh air and waiting\n their turn to go on deck, one of the sen\u00ac\n tinels thrust his bayonet down among\n them and in the morning twenty-five of\n them were found wounded and stuck in\n the head and dead of the wounds they had\n thus received. I further recollect that\n this was the case several mornings,\n when sometimes five, sometimes six and\n sometimes eight or ten were found dead\n by the same means.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It is related in the life of Silas Talbot\n that two brothers belonging to the same\n rifle corps were made prisoners and sent\n on board of the Jersey. The elder was\n attacked with fever and became delirious.\n One night as his end was fast approach\u00ac\n ing reason resumed its sway and while\n</p>\n<p>\n lamenting his sad fate and breathing a\n prayer for his mother, he begged for a\n little water, but the request was brutally\n refused. The sick boy drew near to death\n and his last struggle came. The brother\n offered the guard a guinea for an inch of\n candle to enable him to behold the last\n gasping smile of love and affection. This\n was also refused. \u201cNow,\u201d said he, \u201cif\n it please God that I ever regain my lib\u00ac\n erty, I will be a bitter enemy.\u201d He soon\n after became a free man and to show how\n well he kept his word, it is only neces\u00ac\n sary to say that at the close of the war\n he had eight large and one hundred and\n twenty-seven small notches in his rifle\n stock. These notches no doubt repre\u00ac\n sented eight officers and one hundred and\n twenty-seven privates. The same author\n relates an incident that occurred on the\n Stromboli while he was a prisoner upon\n that ship. \u201cThe prisoners, irritated by\n their ill treatment, rose one night upon\n the guard, the commander being on\n shore, and several, in attempting to es\u00ac\n cape, were either killed or wounded. The\n captain got on board just as the fray was\n quitted, when a poor fellow, lying on\n deck bleeding and almost exhausted by a\n</p>\n<p>\n mortal wound, called him by name and\n begged him \u2018for God\u2019s sake a little water\n for he was dying.\u2019 The captain applied\n a light to his face and directly exclaimed:\n \u2018What! is that you; damn you, I\u2019m glaa\n you\u2019re shot. If I knew the man that\n shot you I\u2019d give him a guinea. Take that,\n you damned rebel rascal,\u2019 and instantly\n dashed his foot in the face of the dying\n man.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Alexander Coffin, who was a prisoner on\n the John, says (Hist. Martyrs, 32) that the\n treatment of the prisoners there \u201cwas\n much worse than on the Jersey. We were\n subject to every insult and injury and\n every abuse that the fertile genius of\n the British officers could invent and in\u00ac\n flict. For more than a month we were\n obliged to eat our scanty allowance, bad\n as it was, without cooking, as no fire was\n allowed.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Sherbourne, who was confined on the\n Frederick in January, 1783, says that it\n \u201cwas very much crowded, so that two\n men were obliged to lie in one bunk. He\n and his bunk-mate were obliged occa\u00ac\n sionally to lie athwart each other for\n want of room,\u201d and the former finally\n died stretched across Sherbourne. He\n says, \u201cI have seen seven dead men drawn\n out and piled together on the lower\n</p>\n<p>\n hatchway, who had died in one night on\n board the Frederick.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The torments of the night on board of\n these dungeons is best described in the\n words of Dring: \u201cSilence was a stranger\n in our dark abode. There were continued\n noises during the night. The groans of\n the sick and the dying, the curses poured\n out by the weary and the exhausted upon\n our inhuman keepers, the restlessness\n caused by the suffocating heat and the\n confined and poisonous air. Mingled\n with the Wild and incoherent ravings of\n delirium were the sounds which every\n night were raised around us in all direc\u00ac\n tions. Frequently the dying, in the last\n mortal throes of dissolution, would throw\n themselves across their sick comrades,\n who, unable to remove the lifeless bodies,\n were compelled to wait until morning be\u00ac\n fore they could be freed from the horrid\n burden.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cDysentery, smallpox, yellow fever and\n the recklessness of despair soon filled the\n hulk with filth of the most disgusting\n character. Humanity would have dictated\n a more merciful treatment to a band of\n pirates who had been condemned and\n were only awaiting the gibbet than to\n have sent them here. Utter derangement\n was a common symptom of yellow fever\n and to Increase the horror of the dark\u00ac\n ness (for we were allowed no lights be\u00ac\n twixt decks) the voice of warning would\n be heard: \u2018Take heed to yourselves; there\n is a madman stalking around the ship\n with a knife in his hand.\u2019 I sometimes\n found the man a corpse in the morning\n by whose side I laid myself down at\n night. While so many were sick with\n raging fever, there was a loud cry for\n water, but none could be had except on the\n upper deck, and but one allowed to as\u00ac\n cend at a time. The suffering then from\n the rage of thirst during the night was\n very great.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Although the prisoners were the vic\u00ac\n tims of the most cruel and inhuman\n treatment that the fiendish nature of\n their oppressors could invent and bestow\n they ever remained faithful to the cause\n of their country and neither threat nor\n promise could drive patriotism from\n their hearts. Ostrander (Hist. Brooklyn\n vol. 1, p. 11) gives the following account:\n \u201cOn the 4th of July, 1782, they deter\u00ac\n mined to celebrate the anniversary in a\n fitting manner. On the morning of that\n day they came on deck with thirteen\n small American flags fastened on brooms.\n The flags were seized, torn and trampled\n under foot by the guards, who looked\n upon the act as an insult. Nothing\n daunted, the prisoners determined to\n have their pleasure and began to sing\n national melodies. The guards became\n enraged, considered themselves insulted\n and drove the prisoners below at an early\n hour at the point of the bayonet and\n closed the hatches. The prisoners again\n commenced to sing. At 9 o\u2019clock in the\n evening an order was given, requiring\n them to cease. This order not being in\u00ac\n stantly complied with, the animosity of\n the guards was aroused, and they de\u00ac\n scended with lanterns and lances. The\n retreating prisoners were sorely pressed\n by the guards, who unmercifully cut\n and slashed away., wounding everyone\n within their reach and inflicting in many\n instances deadly blows. They then re\u00ac\n turned to the deck and closed the hatches\n upon the poor victims of their cruel\n</p>\n<p>\n VIEW OE BROOKLAND, 1775.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pr:og:ra:mo:fd:ed:ic:at:00:un:se:_0:programofdedicat00unse_0:programofdedicat00unse_0_0023/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 329, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 488}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pr:og:ra:mo:fd:ed:ic:at:00:un:se:_0:programofdedicat00unse_0:programofdedicat00unse_0_0023/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 659, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 976}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pr:og:ra:mo:fd:ed:ic:at:00:un:se:_0:programofdedicat00unse_0:programofdedicat00unse_0_0023/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1319, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1953}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pr:og:ra:mo:fd:ed:ic:at:00:un:se:_0:programofdedicat00unse_0:programofdedicat00unse_0_0023/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2638, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3907}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pr:og:ra:mo:fd:ed:ic:at:00:un:se:_0:programofdedicat00unse_0:programofdedicat00unse_0_0023/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/pr/og/ra/mo/fd/ed/ic/at/00/un/se/_0/programofdedicat00unse_0/programofdedicat00unse_0_0023.jp2", "height": 3907, "width": 2638, "levels": 6, "size": 876021}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"23\">\n<p>\n HISTORY OF THE PRISON SHIP MARTYRS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 21\n</p>\n<p>\n rage. Ten corpses were brought on\n deck the following morning, and many\n others were badly wounded, owing to the\n outburst of patriotism on that memorable\n 4th of July.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe motives for such cruelty were\n twofold, and they reflect eternal dis\u00ac\n grace upon the English government. It\n hoped in the first place to induce the\n prisoners to enlist in the Royal service\n as their only refuge from death, but to\n their honor be it said they spurned the\n request as often as it was made. Alex\u00ac\n ander Coffin says he knew of but one\n prisoner entering on board a British\n prison ship that consented to enlist,\n though they knew they should die where\n they were. The prison ships were held\n up in terrorism in other parts of the\n country. In one instance in South Caro\u00ac\n lina, we are told, after every artifice that\n cunning could devise had been used to\n induce the American prisoners to en\u00ac\n list, a British officer called Frazier\n</p>\n<p>\n Daniel C. Whitney, Ex-Mayor of\n Brooklyn.\n</p>\n<p>\n Honorary Life President, Society of Old\n Brooklynites.\n</p>\n<p>\n had in vain attempted to seduce them\n by hope and terrify them with threats.\n He presented to them this ever to be\n remembered denunciation. \u2018Go,\u2019 he then\n said, \u2018to your dungeons in the prison\n ships, where you shall perish and rot,\n but first let me tell you that the rations\n which have been hitherto allowed for\n your wives and children shall from this\n moment cease forever, and you shall die\n assured that they are starving in the\n public streets., and that you are the au\u00ac\n thors of their fall.\u2019 Solemn silence fol\u00ac\n lowed the declaration: they cast their\n wandering eyes upon one another and\n valor for a moment hung suspended be\u00ac\n tween love of family and love of country.\n Love \u2022of country at length rose superior\n to any other consideration and moved by\n one impulse this glorious band of patriots\n thundered in the astonished ears of their\n persecutors, \u2018the prison ship and death,\n or Washington and our country!\u2019 \u2019\u2019\n (Faig\u2019s Address in Historical Account,\n p. 55.)\n</p>\n<p>\n At the close of the war those who sur\u00ac\n vived the awful sufferings of the prison\n ships were released and the old Jersey\n sank in the mud at a point in the Walla-\n bout which is represented by the west\n end of Cob Dock. If Cumberland street\n were continued in a straight line to a\n point between the Navy Yard proper and\n the Cob Dock it would pass over the spot\n where this vessel was anchored. For\n many years the bones of the martyrs lay\n bleaching on the banks of the Wallabout,\n where they were rudely buried by the\n British. The action of the tide upon the\n sandy banks gradually washed away the\n little earth which had been thrown over\n them, thereby causing the sacred relics\n to become exposed to view. The atten\u00ac\n tion of Congress was frequently called to\n the necessity of providing a suitable\n resting place for those honored remains.\n The sight of these bones strewn upon the\n banks of the bay was enough to awaken\n the interest of the nation. At last the\n citizens of Brooklyn became aroused and\n at a town meeting held in 1792 a resolu\u00ac\n tion was passed requesting John Jackson,\n who had collected a large number of the\n bones on his farm, which then included\n the land now occupied by the Navy Yard,\n to allow the relics in his possession to be\n removed to the Reformed Dutch Church\n graveyard for burial, and a monument\n erected over them. General Jeremiah\n Johnson was chairman of that committee.\n The application was bluntly refused,\n Jackson having other intentions as to\n their interment. He had several hogs\u00ac\n heads full of bones, which he had collect\u00ac\n ed upon the beach. To consummate his\n plan he offered to the Tammany Society\n a plot on his farm whereon a suitable\n monument might be erected. Tammany\n accepted the trust and in February, 1803.\n entered actively upon the work. The so\u00ac\n ciety at once proposed and caused to be\n presented to Congress a stirring and\n forcible memorial on the subject. Con- |\n gress, however, came to no conclusion or |\n the subject, and the matter remained j\n quiescent until 1808. Between the time of\n the acceptance of the offer by Tammany j\n and the action of Congress in 1808, Mayor j\n Benjamin Aycrigg, a prominent and influ\u00ac\n ential citizen, became greatly interested\n in the measure. In the summer of 1805,\n noticing the exposed condition of these\n remains, on the beach of the bay, his\n patriotic heart was filled with indignation\n that steps had not been taken to have\n them decently interred. He, in the same\n year, engaged the services of a man\n living at the Wallabout to collect all the\n exposed bones. The remains thus col\u00ac\n lected formed a part of those subsequent\u00ac\n ly placed in the vault erected on the\n Jackson lot by the Tammany Society. In\n 1808 Tammany again renewed its labors.\n At a meeting of the society a committee\n was appointed called the Wallabout com\u00ac\n mittee, consisting of Jacob Yandervoort,\n John Jackson, Burdett Stryker, Issachar\n Cossins, Robert Townsend, jr., Benjamin\n Watson and Samuel Cowdrey. This com\u00ac\n mittee was deeply interested in the work\n and used every available means to enlist\n public sympathy and assistance. Memo\u00ac\n rials were prepared and circulated and\n appeals made through the press and\n otherwise, urging the citizens to come\n forward and aid the sacred cause. In\n their efforts they did not confine them\u00ac\n selves to New York, but sought to create\n</p>\n<p>\n a national interest in the undertaking.\n The patriotism of the people was ap\u00ac\n pealed to and the effort was crowned with\n success. When the subject was thus forci\u00ac\n bly presented the citizens of the young\n republic realized their obligation to pro\u00ac\n vide a proper burial place for the dust\n and bones of her brave sons through\n whose death the nation rose into exist\u00ac\n ence. The measure was presented in a\n way which could not be resisted. The\n inhabitants of all sections became greatly\n interested and nobly responded to the\n call, and the committee, finding so many\n ready to approve and assist, were enabled\n to commence the erection of the struc\u00ac\n ture much sooner than they had at first\n anticipated.\n</p>\n<p>\n The spot given was situated on Jackson\n street, near York, abutting the Navy\n Yard wall. The street was named after\n the owner of the land. The name was\n afterward changed to Hudson avenue.\n The land was formally deeded by Jackson\n to the Tammany Society in 1803. When\n</p>\n<p>\n Edward W. Cooper,\n</p>\n<p>\n President Society of Old Brooklynites, 1901-1903.\n</p>\n<p>\n all things were ready the society caused\n the remains collected by Jackson, with all\n the bones found upon the beach, to be\n committed to the tomb, with appropriate\n ceremonies. The arrangements for laying\n the cornerstone were completed and the\n 13th of April, 1808, fixed for that interest\u00ac\n ing ceremony. The order of exercises was\n as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n At 11 o\u2019clock the procession formed at\n the ferry, foot of Main street, marched\n through that street to Sands street;\n thence to Bridge street, along Bridge\n to York street, to Jackson, and thence to\n the ground.\n</p>\n<p>\n As Major Aycrigg had always mani\u00ac\n fested interest in this labor of love, he\n was properly selected as grand marshal\n of the day. The first division of the pro\u00ac\n cession consisted of a company of United\n States marines under command of Lieu\u00ac\n tenant Commander Johnson. The second\n division was composed of citizens of New\n York and Brooklyn. The third division\n embraced the committees of the various\n civic societies.

The long line was composed\n of cavalry, artillery and infantry, the\n members of the Cincinnati, the clergy,\n the Tammany Society in full and imposing\n regalia of their order, the sailors, mem\u00ac\n bers of the municipal, state and national\n governments, foreign diplomats, societies,\n trades, Masons, etc. The central feature\n of the procession was the \u201cGrand Na\u00ac\n tional Pedestal,\u201d as it was called, con\u00ac\n sisting of an oblong square stage erected\n on a large truck carriage, the margin\n of which represented an iron railing; be\u00ac\n low this dropped a deep festoon which\n covered the wheels; on the stage was a\n pedestal representing black marble, eight\n feet long, six feet high and four feet\n wide, the four panels of which bore the\n following inscriptions:\n</p>\n<p>\n Front:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAmericans! Remember the British!\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Right side:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cYouth of My Country, Martyrdom Pre\u00ac\n fer to Slavery.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Left side:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cSires of Columbia, Transmit to Pos\u00ac\n terity the Cruelties Practiced on Board\n the British Prison Ships.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Rear:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cTyrants dread the gathering storm.\n While freemen freemen\u2019s obsequies per\u00ac\n form.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The orator of the day was Dr. Benjamin\n De Witt, who delivered an able and\n patriotic address to the assembled multi\u00ac\n tude. He feelingly depicted the sufferings\n endured in British dungeons, and drew\n tears to many eyes by his elegant and\n touching remarks referring to the tyranny\n of the oppressors and the fortitude of\n the patriots. The oration concluded, in\n painful silence the coffins were committed\n to their resting place arranged in the\n order observed in the Declaration of In\u00ac\n dependence, as follows: New Hampshire,\n Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut,\n New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,\n Delaware, Maryland, Virginia, North Car\u00ac\n olina, South Carolina and Georgia. Dur\u00ac\n ing many years these relics remained\n forgotten in their sepulcher. The grade\n of Jackson street was altered so as to\n take a part of the sacred ground. Jack-\n son, when he gave the land, was not\n far-sighted enough to have secured the\n passage of an act to preserve its pre\u00ac\n cincts intact, free from invasion of\n streets and exempt from taxation. At\n one time the land was sold for taxes.\n Then it was that Benjamin Romaine\n came forward and purchased the lot. In\n order to preserve it from further dese\u00ac\n cration he adopted it as his own burial\n plot. He resolved to be buried there\n himself, and placed within the vault a\n coffin designed for his mortal remains.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1842 a number of citizens applied to\n the legislature for permission to remove\n the remains to a more private place.\n Romaine vigorously and eloquently ob\u00ac\n jected to any change being made in the\n disposition of the remains which he had\n</p>\n<p>\n so carefully preserved up to that time.\n He said: \u201cI have guarded these sacred\n remains with a reverence, which perhaps\n at this day all may not appreciate, for\n thirty years. They are now in their\n right place, near the Waliabout and ad\u00ac\n joining the Navy Yard. They are my\n property. I have expended more than\n $900 for their protection and preservation.\n I commend them to the protection of the\n general government. I bequeath them to\n my country. This concern is very sacred\n to me. It lies near my heart. I suffered\n with those whose bones I venerate. I\n fought beside them. I bled with them.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n At his death, which occurred in 1844,\n his body was placed in the coffin which\n he had long kept for himself in the\n vault.\n</p>\n<p>\n During the following year attention was\n again called to the forlorn and neglected\n condition of the sepulcher. Henry C.\n Murphy was then in congress represent\u00ac\n ing Kings and Richmond counties. He\n introduced a resolution which was re\u00ac\n ferred to the military committee. That\n committee submitted the following re\u00ac\n port: \u201cThat they have carefully investi\u00ac\n gated the subject committed to them by\n the resolution in connection with the aid\n afforded by the history of the eventful\n period of the War of Independence. It is\n equally incredible that such barbarities\n should have been perpetrated as in\u00ac\n dubitable testimony establishes to have\n been committed upon the Americans who\n fell into the power of British cruisers,\n and that congress should have delayed\n so long to perform its duty to the country\n to give a proper resting place to the\n remains of the martyrs who thus cruelly\n perished rather than enlist in the British\n service and take up arms against their\n country.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n That committee also recommended an\n appropriation of $20,000 to secure a per\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n manent tomb and monument. The effort,\n however, was not successful. Samuel\n Boughton, John T.

In 1855 a\n meeting was held and a martyrs monu\u00ac\n ment association formed. This associa\u00ac\n tion was intended to have representatives\n from each state and territory. The com\u00ac\n mittee started with commendable energy.\n They early took the ground that Fort\n Greene was the proper site. Plans were\n prepared and subscriptions solicited, but\n nothing further appears to have been ac\u00ac\n complished. The next important move\n made in behalf of these almost forgotten\n patriots was the transferring of their\n remains to Fort Greene under the direc\u00ac\n tion of the Park Department in 1873, by\n resolution of the Common Council. From\n time to time martyrs monument associa\u00ac\n tions were formed and nothing was ac\u00ac\n complished until the Society of Old\n Brooklynites made the cause its own,\n with a determination to succeed where\n others failed.\n</p>\n<p>\n During the fall meetings of the society,\n in 1887, the project of erecting a mem\u00ac\n orial occupied the attention of the mem\u00ac\n bers and resulted in the appointment of\n a committee to draft a bill calling for\n an appropriation of $100,000 from the\n federal government towards the erection\n of a monument. The bill was presented\n in Congress by the late Felix Campbell\n in 1888. Mr. Campbell in an earnest and\n patriotic appeal portrayed the privation\n and sufferings of the prison ship mar\u00ac\n tyrs and prayed for favorable considera\u00ac\n tion of a measure that was intended to\n perpetuate their memory. The society, to\n emphasize its determination to obtain\n favorable action by Congress, prepared\n and forwarded a monster petition, con\u00ac\n taining 30,000 names of representative\n citizens of Brooklyn, all actuated with a\n desire to have a measure of justice done\n to these patriotic sons of America, whose\n devotion to the cause of their country en\u00ac\n titles them to the warmest sentiments of\n remembrance and gratitude. The senti\u00ac\n ments that animated the patriotic citi\u00ac\n zens of Brooklyn in urging Congress to\n do honor to the memory of the prison\n ship martyrs were those which inspired\n the great Webster in speaking of the pur\u00ac\n pose of the Bunker Hill Monument whan\n he said: \u201cLet it not be supposed that\n our object is to perpetuate national hos\u00ac\n tility, or even to cherish a mere mili\u00ac\n tary spirit. It is higher, purer, nobler.\n We consecrate our work to the spirit of\n national independence, and we wish that\n the light of peace may rest upon it for\u00ac\n ever. We rear a memorial of our con\u00ac\n viction of the unmeasured benefit which\n has been conferred on our land, and of\n the happy influences, which have been\n produced by the same events on the gen\u00ac\n eral interests of mankind. We come, as\n Americans, to mark a spot which must\n be forever dear to us and our posterity.\n We wish that whosoever in all coming\n time shall turn his eyes hither may be\u00ac\n hold that the place is not undistinguished\n where the great battle of the Revolution\n was fought.

The State of New York has already\n appropriated $25,000 and has authorized\n the Cicy of New York to appropriate\n $50,000, and there have been raised $25,-\n 000 by private subscriptions; in all $100,-\n 000. The appropriation authorized in the\n resolution does not take effect until the\n other $100,000 has been paid in.\n</p>\n<p>\n During the Revolutionary War nearly\n 20,000 naval and military prisoners, con\u00ac\n fined in hulks anchored at Wallabout\n Bay, the present site of the United\n States Navy Yard, Brooklyn, N. Y., died\n because of the cruelties they suffered\n at the hands of their British jailers.\n They were buried on the shore near the\n hulks. In 1808 they were given Chris\u00ac\n tian burial by the Tammany Society or\n Columbian Order, and in 1873 they were\n moved to Fort Greene Park, where they\n now lie. Similar resolutions or bills have\n been reported to the House in the Forty-\n ninth, Fiftieth, Fifty-first, Fifty-second,\n</p>\n<p>\n Fifty-fourth, Fifty-fifth and Fifty-sixth\n Congresses, and the Committee on the\n Library is unanimous in thinking that it\n is only right that the resolution should\n be agreed to.\n</p>\n<p>\n The resolution was introduced by my\n colleague, the gentleman from New York\n (Mr. Fitzgerald), who has labored un\u00ac\n ceasingly for the success of this patriot\u00ac\n ic project, with which his name will al\u00ac\n ways be most appropriately associated.\n I yield five minutes to my colleague (Mr.\n Fitzgerald).\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Fitzgerald\u2014Mr. Speaker, unless\n further explanation is needed I will not\n occupy the time of the House, but will\n ask for a vote.\n</p>\n<p>\n The question is on agreeing to the\n motion of the gentleman from New\n York (Mr. McClellan).\n</p>\n<p>\n The question was taken; and two-thirds\n having voted in favor of the motion, the\n amendment was agreed to, and the reso\u00ac\n lution as amended passed.\n</p>\n<p>\n The briefness of the proceedings is thus\n explained by Mr. Fitzgerald.\n</p>\n<p>\n An examination of the record of the\n previous occasions where similar bills\n had been defeated determined the friends\n of the bill to adopt an entirely new plan\n of procedure. Upon a motion to suspend\n the rules the time allowed for debate is\n forty minuteSi twenty minutes in favor\n of the motion and twenty minutes in op\u00ac\n position.\n</p>\n<p>\n In order to assure as far as possible\n the passage of the bill, eight or nine of\n the most prominent members of the\n House of both parties had been requested\n and had agreed to occupy a few minutes\n in advocacy of the bill. The chief oppo\u00ac\n nent on previous occasions had been Mr.\n Cannon, the chairman of the committee\n on appropriations. After Mr. McClellan\n had finished his brief remarks he yielded\n to Mr. Fitzgerald five minutes. The\n temptation to speak was very great, but\n the situation was such that it seemed as\n if the bill could be passed if a vote could\n be had at once. Mr. Fitzgerald realized\n the importance of haste and action in\u00ac\n stead of words, and simply said, \u201cMr.\n Speaker, unless further explanation is\n needed I will not, occupy the time of the\n House, but will ask for a vote.\n</p>\n<p>\n The question was immediately taken,\n and without division the bill was passed.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Society of Old Brooklynites ac\u00ac\n knowledges its indebtedness to Mr. Fitz\u00ac\n gerald, to whose untiring efforts is mainly\n due the passage of the bill that made pos\u00ac\n sible the erection of the monument that\n for all time will commemorate the vir\u00ac\n tues and patriotism of the prison ship\n martyrs.

Governor Charles\n Evans Hughes was the principal speaxer.\n</p>\n<p>\n For the ceremonies a more ideal day,\n from a weather standpoint, could not\n have been obtained. The open air was\n crisp and delightful. On the plaza in\n front of the park a detachment from the\n Third Battery was stationed. A nation\u00ac\n al salute of twenty-one guns broke the\n stillness when the signal was given that\n the stone was in place. Governor Hughes,\n when he reached the park, also received\n a salute of twenty-one guns from the\n battery.\n</p>\n<p>\n The ceremonies were held under the\n auspices of the Prison Ship Martyrs As\u00ac\n sociation and the Society of Old Brook\u00ac\n lynites. In front of the slab of granite\n which now forms the base of the monu\u00ac\n ment a grandstand had been erected. On\n the grass beside the stand were benches\n and chairs to accommodate the invited\n guests. Seated well in front of the\n grandstand with Mr. White, who pre\u00ac\n sided as the president of the associa\u00ac\n tion, were Major General Frederick Dent\n Grant, who was designated to represent\n the President and the War Department;\n Governor Hughes, the Rev. Newell\n Dwight Hillis, former Park Commission\u00ac\n er Elijah R. Kennedy, the Rev. Father\n E. W. McCarty, Stephen M. Griswold and\n many members of the association and\n the Society of Old Brooklynites. Mayor\n McClellan, who was on the programme\n to respond for the City of New York,\n was not present, and Mr. White ex\u00ac\n plained that other duties had called him\n elsewhere. Rear Admiral Caspar Good\u00ac\n rich, the commandant of the Brooklyn\n Navy Yard, was also an interested spec\u00ac\n tator. He, Governor Hughes and Gen\u00ac\n eral Grant were accompanied by aids in\n full-dress uniform. Music was furnished\n by Shannon\u2019s Twenty-third Regiment\n band.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. White opened the proceedings by\n introducing the Rev. Dr. Hillis, who of\u00ac\n fered prayer. Mr. White made the in\u00ac\n ti oductory address in which he reviewed\n at length the sufferings of the martyrs\n who had died on the prison ships and\n the work which had been done to com\u00ac\n memorate their martyrdom with a mon\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n ument. In opening his remarks he\n graphically told of the fate of the Brit\u00ac\n ish soldiers in the Black Hole of Cal\u00ac\n cutta.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe have no record of any one con\u00ac\n crete act of hellishness in the treat\u00ac\n ment of prisoners which equaled this in\u00ac\n describable tragedy of Calcutta. But\n to the shame of the Anglo-Saxon race\n be it said that for the six years in\n which the British forces held New York\n City, there were enacted continuously\n scenes of barbarism which in the ag\u00ac\n gregate, in comparison with that bar\u00ac\n barism of India, was as the deluge of\n Deucalion to a Colorado cloudburst.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe only available means of caring\n for them was to confine them on certain\n old hulks, for the most part cattle ships\n used in carrying supplies, which were\n so nearly worn out that they were no\n longer available for even that low grade\n of commerce, and the British anchored\n the hulks where the prisoners would not\n dare jump overboard and expose them\u00ac\n selves to the double risk of bullets and\n of drowning in the swift and swirling\n tide.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" I omit the names of the different\n ships and emphasize one only\u2014the Old\n Jersey, of which the prisoners at that\n time knew enough of General Sherman\u2019s\n definition to stigmatize it as the \u2018Old\n Hell.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe fidelity of these men to their\n newly forming country and to our estab\u00ac\n lished nation is without a parallel in\n the history of the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n Would Not Accept King\u2019s Terms.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThey were all the time offered rations\n and freedom in the open air if they would\n enlist in George the Third\u2019s army for\n service in foreign wars, which would not\n compel them to fight against their coun\u00ac\n try; but would relieve other soldiers who\n would. There is a tradition that one man\n accepted the conditions, and, while this is j\n not entirely certain, it is entirely certain j\n that there were not more than one or two\n at the most.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBrave soldiers in what seemed a hope\u00ac\n less cause! Theirs was the bravery ot\n Leonidas and his three hundred Spartan\n compatriots at the Pass of Thermopylae.\n Theirs was the heroism of Arnold Win-\n kelreid, when, with bared bosom, he mo\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n nopolized a dozen Austrian spears and\n held that corner in spears unbroken till\n his Swiss comrades had swept through the\n defile and led Switzerland to liberty.\u2019\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n To Elijah R. Kennedy, Mr. White gave\n the honor of laying the stone. With a\n silver trowel in hand he performed the\n solemn ceremony. In the center of the\n stone was placed a copper box containing\n coins of the present day, a programme of\n the ceremonies and copies of the Brook\u00ac\n lyn papers. As soon as Mr. Kennedy an\u00ac\n nounced that the stone had been truly\n laid the band struck up \u201cThe Star Span\u00ac\n gled Banner\u201d and the battery down on\n the plaza fired a national salute.\n</p>\n<p>\n Remarks of General Grant.\n</p>\n<p>\n The address of General Grant, who was\n the next speaker, was a glowing tribute\n to the men who had sacrificed their lives\n in the old prison ships. He praised the\n sentiments which inspired the erection\n of the beautiful monument, saying that\n in the heart of every true American the\n monume.nt inculcated a feeling of rever\u00ac\n ence, respect and admiration for the he\u00ac\n roes who died for their country and whose\n deeds the shaft of granite would always\n keep alive in the minds of the genera\u00ac\n tions to come. Frequently during the\n course of his remarks General Grant was\n interrupted with applause.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sullivan\u2019s \u201cLost Chord\u201d was played\n by the band. Then Mr. White introduced\n Governor Hughes. The reception which\n the governor got amounted almost to a\n demonstration.\n</p>\n<p>\n Governor Hughes said;\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMr. Chairman and Fellow Citizens\u2014\n Gratefully, though tardily, the nation,\n the state and the city, with the co-opera\u00ac\n tion of private benevolence, have made\n this preparation for suitable recognition\n of the heroic sufferings of the Prison Ship\n Martyrs.

Character is not meas\u00ac\n ured by acquisition, but by sacrifice, and\n whenever we see a man giving himself\n unreservedly to a cause which he be\u00ac\n lieves, there is that in our manhood\n which is so superior to all the tempta\u00ac\n tions of civilization, which has made it\n possible for humanity again and again\n to rise up to the summit\u2014there is that\n in our common manhood which recognizes\n that the man who gives his life for a\n i cause in which he believes is above all\n kings and all rulers and all men who ac- ,\n j quire wealth, and every possible distinc- !\n tion of ambition.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBut, fellow citizens, this was devotion\n to our cause, this was not devotion to\n superstition, this was not self-abnega\u00ac\n tion which was the result of some blind\n fault.

They\n were New England lads largely, young\n men that went from home with the spirit i\n of adventure and filled with zeal for lib\u00ac\n erty, and frequently in their very first:\n efforts on their first voyage were cap\u00ac\n tured and brought to this prison hell. !\n We see them with hunger unappeased, |\n with thirst unassuaged, in loathsome as\u00ac\n sociations, waging remorseless conflict\n with disease, bearing their comrades,\n morning by morning, to graves on the\n beach and waiting their own turn, but,\n as I have said, with spirit unbroken.\n Those whom we revere were men that\n could have had their freedom at any\n moment had they been willing to take\n service for the British cause. These\n poor souls, crushed in a manner that no\n one injured on the battlefield and left\n there wounded to die, terrible as may\n have been his sufferings, could well\n imagine\u2014these poor souls, even in their\n agony, held their celebration on the\n</p>\n<p>\n Fourth of July and laughed in the faces\n of their guards as they vowed that they\n would die rather than serve the king.\n (Applause.)\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cNothing that we can do can relieve\n their sufferings. The panegyric of epi\u00ac\n taph, the adulation of eulogy does noth\u00ac\n ing to assist the hero to fortitude in his\n fall. This, fellow citizens, we owe to\n ourselves. This, fellow citizens, we do in\n order that we may preserve what they\n gave us, because we can never hold the\n liberties, our priceless possessions, unless\n we preserve inviolate that same spirit,\n that same readiness to sacrifice, that\n same devotion to ideals which conquers\n all thought of personal comfort, or of\n individual achievement; that same in\u00ac\n tense ljve of liberty and of our institu-\n</p>\n<p>\n C.

Halsey, son of the late Harlan 1\n P. Halsey and the late Henrietta A. Hal\u00ac\n sey, founder of the Colonial Daughters\n of the seventeenth century, while exam\u00ac\n ining some old family papers discovered\n one, describing the part the Tammany So\u00ac\n ciety took in raising a monument and\n burying the prison martyrs of the Walla-\n bout. Mr. Halsey\u2019s great great grand\u00ac\n father, Garret Sickles, was grand mar\u00ac\n shal of the procession that took the\n bones of the martyrs to the tomb.\n</p>\n<p>\n The following is a description of the\n Tammany Society\u2019s part in the burial of\n the martyrs:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIn 1808, after repeated calls upon Con\u00ac\n gress, which had no effect, the Tammany\n Society determined to perform a duty of\n patriotism, which will ever be an honor\n to the institution. Since the Revolution,\n the bones of those who had died on board\n the prison ships at Wallabout had been\n permitted to bleach upon the shore. The\n inhumanity with which they were treated,\n has been so often described, that it has\n become a hackneyed theme.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe will say that from the most reli\u00ac\n able accounts, which can be gathered,\n not less than 11,500 souls perished on\n board the various prison ships, which\n were moored in the East River.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cPaine predicted that before America\n would submit to the unjust demands upon\n her, the bones of three million citizens\n</p>\n<p>\n would whiten on the shores of their\n country.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cTammany took the subject up as\n early as 1803, and finally, in. 1807, when\n it became evident that Congress would\n do nothing about it, a committee, called\n the Wallabout Committee, reported in\n February, 1808. and immediately mea\u00ac\n sures were taken to carry in effect their\n suggestions.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe Legislature of New York contrib\u00ac\n uted a small sum. The cornerstone of a\n monument was laid on the thirteenth of\n April, 1808, when a grand and imposing\n procession was formed under the direc\u00ac\n tion of Major Ayerigg, grand marshal.\n The military and civic societies united\n with Tammany and proceeded to the\n spot. Joseph Fay was the orator of the\n day.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe vault being completed, the socie\u00ac\n ty fixed, -on the twenty-fifth of May,\n 1808, for consigning the bones to their\n final resting place, but the weather prov\u00ac\n ing stormy, the ceremony was postponed\n until the twenty-sixth, when one of the\n largest and most magnificent funeral\n pageants which the city ever witnessed\n took place.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cGarret Sickles was the grand mar\u00ac\n shal of the day. The first feature in\n the procession was a trumpeter, mounted\n on a black horse, carrying in his hand\n</p>\n<p>\n a black flag, on which was inscribed in\n gold letters, these lines:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u2018Mortals Avaunt; 11,500 spirits of\n Martyred Brave! Approach the Tomb of\n Honor, Glory and of Virtuous Patriot\u00ac\n ism.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThen followed the military, under\n command of Brigadier General Morton,\n and immediately after, the Wallabout\n Committee, each member with a bucktail\n :n his hat. Then came the Tammany So\u00ac\n ciety, headed by Benjamin Romaine,\n Grand Sachem. The members wore all\n the insignia of the order, making an im-\n press ! ve display.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe Municipal Governments of New\n York City and Brooklyn, the Governor\n of the state, D. D. Tompkins, Lieuten\u00ac\n ant Governor John Broome; the Mayor\n of the City of New York, De Witt Clin\u00ac\n ton; members of Congress, military and\n naval officers of the United States, and\n finally the various civic societies of the\n city took part.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe procession marched through the\n principal streets, crossed to Brooklyn\n and moved to the vault in Hudson ave\u00ac\n nue, near York street, which was to con\u00ac\n tain the dead.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cDr. Benjamin De Witt delivered the\n oration, which he had prepared at the\n request of the Tammany Society.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAt its conclusion the coffins were de\u00ac\n posited in the tomb, and the procession\n returned to the city.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n HOW THE \u201cLITTLE MEN AND WOMEN OF \u201976\u201d RAISED\n</p>\n<p>\n FUNDS FOR THE MONUMENT\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs Stephen V. White organized the I\n first society of the \u201cLittle Men and\n Women of \u201976, Children of the American\n Revolution,\u201d from among the children\n of the old families of Brooklyn and Long\n Island. The officers for the year were:\n President, Mrs. Franklin W. Hopkins;\n vice president, Mrs. Glentworth R. But\u00ac\n ler; registrar, William L. Long; color\n bearer, Stephen V. Hopkins; treasurer.\n Miss Antoinette R. Butler; secretary\n (Flatbusli) John Christie Giles, jr.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. S. V. White was a delegate and\n attended the annual congress of the\n Daughters of the American Revolution in\n Washington, D. C., February 22, 1899.\n She was very much interested in the\n success of the Prison Ship Martyrs\n Monument, to be erected in Fort Greene\n Park, Brooklyn, and also in the \u201cLittle\n Men and Women of \u201976,\u201d and, hoping to\n awaken an interest in both societies,\n she, at the meeting, offered as a prize\n to the member collecting, during the\n year, the largest amount for the monu\u00ac\n ment fund, a membership in the Martha\n Washington Memorial Association of Vir\u00ac\n ginia and a gold insignia.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some time after her return home she\n sent for me and we talked about the\n fund. Mrs. White expressed a wish that\n one of the members of her society, \u201cThe\n Little Men and Women of \u201976,\u201d should\n win the prize so the society would get\n the credit. I offered to try for it, if\n</p>\n<p>\n By JOHN C. GILES, Jr.\n</p>\n<p>\n she would give me her aid, and this was\n cheerfully agreed to.\n</p>\n<p>\n We started out with the help of the\n \u201cLittle Men and Women of \u201976,\u201d and\n succeeded in collecting enough for a\n dance, to be held at the Knickerbocker\n Club, in Flatbush, February 13, 1900,\n but had only a few dollars above the\n expenses remaining. On the afternoon of\n the entertainment it commenced to snow,\n and we had about the deepest snow\u00ac\n storm of the winter. When the hour\n arrived, the snow had drifted so that\n it was waist deep, and only five per-\n 1 sons came.\n</p>\n<p>\n The officers of the club very kindly\n gave us another evening without extra\n charge. We then renewed our efforts,\n and this time were very successful and\n were able to give the fund over $200.\n</p>\n<p>\n J had the pleasure of being called to\n Washington on February 22, 1900, to\n</p>\n<p>\n attend the congress of the Daughters of\n the American Revolution, and w r as pre\u00ac\n sented with the prize offered by Mrs.\n Stephen V. White the previous year, for\n the person collecting the largest amount\n ! for the fund. On the bar of the insig\u00ac\n nia was engraved the following:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cPrize offered by Mrs. S. V. White to\n member of the Children of the American\n | Revolution securing the largest sum for\n | the Prison Ship Martyrs Monument.\u2014\n j John Christie Giles, jr., Washington,\n 1 February 22, 1900.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Just before the close of the meeting\n the president of the Bemis Heights So\u00ac\n ciety said it was not right for all the\n glory to go to the \u201cLittle Men and\n Women of \u201976,\u201d in Brooklyn, and offered,\n for the following year, a prize for col\u00ac\n lecting the largest amount for the fund,\n a $20 gold piece, and hoped some other\n state society would win it and not have\n all the honor go to New York.\n</p>\n<p>\n Still having her heart and soul in the\n success of both societies, Mrs. S. V.\n White wished me to again try for the\n prize and so help the fund. I could not\n give as much attention to it as before,\n but again took hold, and, with the usual\n ups and downs, succeeded in giving a\n dance in the Farm House in Prospect\n Park on February 8, 1901, which netted\n $300, which was the donation for the\n fund of the Martyrs Monument.\n</p>\n<p>\n At the meeting of the National Society\n of the Children of the American Revolu\u00ac\n tion, held in Washington, D. C., February\n 22, 1901, I was presented with the prize\u2014\n a $20 gold piece. On the bar is the fol\u00ac\n lowing:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cPrize for collecting the largest sum\n for the Prison Ship Martyrs Monument\n Fund.\u2014John Christie Giles, jr., Washing\u00ac\n ton, D. C., 1901.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Too much praise cannot be given to\n Mrs. Stephen V.
