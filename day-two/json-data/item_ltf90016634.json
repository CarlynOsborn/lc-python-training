Now that the return to peace and order per\u00ac\n mits us to come back at last to the pure joys of literature,\n the moment seems opportune to recall public attention to\n the beautiful and elevating writings of Lamartine. After\n so many severe trials and so many painful humiliations, it\n is necessary for France to reinvigorate herself with the\n reading and the study of her great authors; to recount\n her glories, and to behold her genius shining once more\n in those who have carried highest and furthest her sym\u00ac\n pathetic brilliance and splendor. Of those authors La\u00ac\n martine is universally and justly acknowledged to be one\n of the greatest.\n</p>\n<p>\n In less troubled and less unhappy times, although him\u00ac\n self saddened also by the remembrance of revolutions\n and wars, he gave out, for the first time, his songs of\n love, of sympathy, and of hope.

She was afraid that\n Rousseau might be intent on throwing this coming child\n into the foundlings\u2019 hospital, where, as was well known, he\n had already thrown three of his other illegitimate children.\n So she went to see Monsieur Tronchin, of Geneva, a par\u00ac\n ticular friend of Rousseau, and begged him earnestly to\n have this child when born brought to her, as she wished\n to adopt and rear it. Monsieur Tronchin spoke of it to\n Rousseau, who apparently gave his consent without hesi\u00ac\n tation. He also had an interview with the mother of the\n child about it, and she was filled with joy at the idea.\n As soon as she was confined, the poor woman caused in\u00ac\n formation of the fact to be conveyed to Tronchin. He\n came; he saw a beautiful child, a boy full of life and\n promise. He made arrangements with the mother as to\n the hour at which he was to come and take the child the\n next morning; but at midnight, Rousseau, wrapped in a\n sombre-colored cloak, approached the bed of the pros\u00ac\n trate and helpless mother, and, in spite of her cries, car\u00ac\n ried away his own child to an infant asylum, and there\n left it forever, without any mark of recognition or dis\u00ac\n tinction !

This pension was\n designed to supply the insufficiency of the salary as Sec\u00ac\n retary of Legation.

In\n a - public session of the Academy of Macon, three weeks\n ago, there was in attendance an immense concourse of\n people, the General Council and all the notabilities of\n the city and surrounding country being present. It was\n a very imposing assemblage. A great many interesting\n papers were read, among others a chapter from the * His\u00ac\n tory of the Restoration,\u2019 by Monsieur de Lacretelle, and\n a fragment of \u2018A Journey through Greece,\u2019 by Monsieur\n Quinet, a young man justly distinguished for his vast fund\n of knowledge. Alphonse was to recite some poetry, and\n his appearance was looked forward to with much impa\u00ac\n tience. When his turn came, they applauded in advance,\n and cried out that they wished to see him. He arose in\n a deferential and becoming manner, and began to deliver\n a brief and extemporaneous speech in prose, in order to\n gain the sympathy of his fellow-citizens and to tell them\n truly how appreciative he was of their approval. His\n exordium pleased them very much, and the applause which\n followed was, for a time, perfectly deafening.

Let us leave ourselves entirely to\n Him. Briefly, and in truth, all human wisdom consists\n in humbly and worshipfully resigning ourselves to His\n gracious will. I am very busy here just now, in putting\n my old journals in order; and this requires me to read\n them over and over again, which I am doing with much\n interest. I always rise from these readings with more\n profound and heartfelt gratitude for all the blessings\n which I have received from God, and with more regret\n and self-reproach for the little advancement which I have\n made in holiness, notwithstanding all my good reflections\n and resolutions, which have so rapidly come and gone,\n and gone and come, with so little profit. But there is\n yet time, always time, so long as God leaves us life, for\n us to take advantage of, in order to gain heaven. That\n is what I entreat of Him with all my heart and soul,\n while finishing these books and while humbly beseeching\n Him to shed abundantly upon me and mine all kinds of\n spiritual blessings. As for temporal blessings, I ask for\n them only as they may be necessary aids and supports in\n a regular yet sure way to heaven; but I abandon myself,\n without the least reserve, to His fatherly wisdom and pur\u00ac\n poses. May He bless me in my children, in my friends,\n and in all those whom I have loved and who have loved\n me. May He also bless my enemies, in so far as I may\n have been wrong in looking upon them with ill feeling\n or hatred, or in so far as they themselves may, at any\n time, have done me any unintentional injustice, or yet\n in so far as they may ever have been at fault in honestly\n misconstruing or misunderstanding my character and\n motives.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:my:mo:th:er:sm:an:us:cr:00:le:ma:mymothersmanuscr00lema:mymothersmanuscr00lema_0257/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 251, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 435}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:my:mo:th:er:sm:an:us:cr:00:le:ma:mymothersmanuscr00lema:mymothersmanuscr00lema_0257/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 502, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 871}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:my:mo:th:er:sm:an:us:cr:00:le:ma:mymothersmanuscr00lema:mymothersmanuscr00lema_0257/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1005, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1742}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:my:mo:th:er:sm:an:us:cr:00:le:ma:mymothersmanuscr00lema:mymothersmanuscr00lema_0257/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2011, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3484}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:my:mo:th:er:sm:an:us:cr:00:le:ma:mymothersmanuscr00lema:mymothersmanuscr00lema_0257/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/my/mo/th/er/sm/an/us/cr/00/le/ma/mymothersmanuscr00lema/mymothersmanuscr00lema_0257.jp2", "height": 3484, "width": 2011, "levels": 6, "size": 345173}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"257\">\n<p>\n MY MOTHER ' S MANUSCRIPT.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2 5 x\n</p>\n<p>\n These, the last foregoing, are the last words which she\n wrote upon the last page of her last volume.\n</p>\n<p>\n CXLIII.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here, then, is all that is proposed to be recorded among\n the archives of earth of the soul of this eminently lovely\n and holy woman.

He is pronounced\n by a competent German critic to be\n deservedly \u201c the most popular German\n miter of the last half century.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Reuter is especially noted as the\n rare humorist , the genuine poet and\n the fascinating delineator of the lives\n of his Platt-Deutsch neighbors, and\n as such is probably more beloved than\n any other German author of the day.\n The tale in question is one of his best\n and most important works, giving its\n readers, with its other entertainment\n and profit, a charming acquaintance\n with the quaint, interesting Platt-\n Deutsch people.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Fritz Reuter is one of the most\n</p>\n<p>\n popular writers in Germany. . . . The\n charm of his stories lies in their sim '\n plicity and exquisite truth to Nature\n He has * the loving heart\u2019 which Car\u00ac\n lyle tells us is the secret of writing;\n and Reuter is not graphic merely, nt\n is photographic. His characters im\u00ac\n press one so forcibly with their reality\n that one need not to be told they are\n portraits from life. Even the villain*\n must have been old acquaintances.. . .\n It (\u2018 During my Apprenticeship\u2019) is one\n of the best of Reu ter\u2019s stories, exhibit\u00ac\n ing his turn for the pathetic as well as\n for the humorous.\u201d\u2014 New York Eve\u00ac\n ning Post.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c It has a freshness and novelty that\n are rare in these times. \" \u2014 Philadel\u00ac\n phia Everting Bulletin.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Sylvestres; or, The Outcasts.
