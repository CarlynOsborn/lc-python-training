As the mists of the morning are dispelled by the\n rising sun, and the invalids creep forth from the city to breath\n the fresh country air, they pour their morning devotion before\n the statue of Christ the Great Physician.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is \" doubtless much of superstition in the worship of\n these people ; but you will notice that each one worships before\n the statue of the Saviour which brings Him the nearest to his\n own individual need and thought.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is the glory of the Christ that He can be everything to\n everybody everywhere. I am glad that I have such a one to\n present to you, a complete Saviour; one who is our \u201call and\n in all,\u201d and who has been tempted in all points like as we are,\n and who says to us all: \u201c Come unto Me, all ye that labor and\n are heavy laden, and I will give you rest.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Author.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:je:su:so:ur:fr:ie:nd:li:00:te:nn:jesusourfriendli00tenn:jesusourfriendli00tenn_0013/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 512}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:je:su:so:ur:fr:ie:nd:li:00:te:nn:jesusourfriendli00tenn:jesusourfriendli00tenn_0013/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1025}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:je:su:so:ur:fr:ie:nd:li:00:te:nn:jesusourfriendli00tenn:jesusourfriendli00tenn_0013/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2051}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:je:su:so:ur:fr:ie:nd:li:00:te:nn:jesusourfriendli00tenn:jesusourfriendli00tenn_0013/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4103}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:je:su:so:ur:fr:ie:nd:li:00:te:nn:jesusourfriendli00tenn:jesusourfriendli00tenn_0013/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/je/su/so/ur/fr/ie/nd/li/00/te/nn/jesusourfriendli00tenn/jesusourfriendli00tenn_0013.jp2", "height": 4103, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 249102}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"13\">\n<p>\n INTRODUCTION\n</p>\n<p>\n To introduce the book and the writer of the same is the\n purpose and plan of the usual introduction.

Cut your strips an\n inch and a quarter wide and the length desired, cutting the\n corners, so they will match smoothly (see cut below), then\n fasten with screws or screw-headed bolts.\n</p>\n<p>\n Make the frame three-fourths of an inch smaller all around\n than the cloth. Spread the cloth on the floor, black side down,\n and fasten it upon the frame by tacking the center of the sides\n and ends first, drawing the cloth very tightly, then tack on all\n around.
