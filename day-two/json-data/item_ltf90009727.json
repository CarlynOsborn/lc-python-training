And while a\n cold and partial discharge of this duty characterizes Christians,\n it is as evident that but little good can be accomplished ; and that\n no millennial reign can ever arrive untill all who love the Lord\n Jesus Christ are found labouring for Him, and not for themselves,\n and freely distributing to His cause, all their possible means.\n</p>\n<p>\n In my former articles I proved, to the satisfaction, I believe, of\n all who read them, that charitable collections are an instituted\n means of grace, and a part of the public worship of Hod, and\n therefore an essential part of Christian faith and practice. No\n one, therefore, can possibly \u201c fulfil the work of the ministry,\u201d\n who does not endeavour to train up his people in the habit of\n Christian liberality, so that they shall be found as \u201c ready to\n distribute, and as willing to communicate,\u201d as to pray, to read\n the Scriptures, to be humble, to be holy, and to add to their\n faith every other grace.

Now, the fulness and variety of Scripture on the\n subject of Christian charity, is very remarkable.

A less amount may thus\n be the greater charity; and where there is nothing to give, God\n accepts the will, when, in Ilis judgment, it is sincere.

To be really virtuous\n and Christian, charity must, in the first place, be voluntary. Our\n character lies in our will, which is endued with authority to com\u00ac\n mand, control and regulate all the other powers both of soul and\n body. In point of action, therefore, the will, as has been said, is\n the whole man; and a man is a moral agent, and to be regarded\n as acting either rightly or wrongly, only as he does, or does not,\n act by the free and cheerful dictate of his own will.\n</p>\n<p>\n But in the second place, the outward act of giving in order\n to be trul$ charitable, must be performed from a principle of\n duty. An action done for amusement; for the gratification of\n taste; under the impulse of any of the appetites of our nature ; or\n from a regard to the pride of station and of character ; is not\n virtuous , much less Christian. To become virtuous, an action must\n be performed, not only voluntarily, but also on the ground that it\n ought to be done. And it is only therefore when principle, that is,\n a sense of duty, operates on the will, and constrains it to deter\u00ac\n mine to bestow any given amount of money or of goods, that the\n action is truly virtuous. Then only is such a contribution given\n on virtuous grounds, and in opposition to all the difficulties and\n the hostile inclinations that stand in the way;\u2014and then only is\n the act of giving true charity.\n</p>\n<p>\n But in the third place, there is something still wanting to consti\u00ac\n tute such an act of liberality, Christian charity. To be Christian\n charity, our gifts must be set apart not only willingly and because\n we think we ought to part with them,\u2014they must be given also\n from a principle of love to Christ and regard to His will. If our\n charity is Christian, the Scriptures will be our standard, and the\n measure of giving there prescribed, will be our rule of beneficence.\n The Christian is one who realizes that \u201c he is not his own,\u201d that\n he \u201c is the Lord\u2019s,\u201d that body soul and spirit have been redeemed\n by Christ, and are to be consecrated to Him ;\u2014and that he is no\n longer, therefore, to live as his own master or for his own ends, or\n by his own opinions and rules, but unto \u201c Him who died for him 5 \u2019\n and by whose blood he has been redeemed.

Professors of religion, in general, give nothing\n in comparison to what they ought to give. Some literally give\n nothing, or somewhere in that immediate neighbourhood. I shall\n not inquire whether such persons are really Christian men. One\n might almost question whether they are human.\n</p>\n<p>\n I have used the word give ; I must correct my language. De\u00ac\n liver up , I ought to say, when speaking of Christians who have\n so often acknowledged themselves as not their own, but themselves\n and their ' s to be the Lord\u2019s. Not a farthing, or not much more,\n will some of these deliver up, of all that their Lord has given\n them in trust. What stewards we Christians are! We act as\n if we were undisputed owners and sovereign proprietors of all;\n when we know, and, if pressed, acknowledge, it is no such thing.\n The infidels know that we profess to be but stewards, and in our\n devotional hours, we write on everything we have, \u201c This is the\n Lord\u2019s;\u201d and they naturally expect to see some correspondence\n between our profession and practice; and when they perceive it\n is but bare profession, and that we do not mean anything by it,\n they are very apt to conclude that this is true of our religion\n generally. Moreover, these shrewd characters see common\n humanity constraining men of the world to greater liberality than\n the love of Christ constrains his reputed disciples to exercise ; and\n that, though they hear Christians continually saying that there\n is no principle which has such power to carry men out to deeds\n and sacrifices of benevolence as the love of Christ. What must\n they conclude from this ? Either that there is no such princi,\n pie, or that Christians do not feel the force of it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Again : Infidels hear us speak of giving, as lending to the\n Lord. Now, they don\u2019t believe any such thing; but since we\n do, they are astonished that we do not lend more liberally to such a\n paymaster, and on such security. They are in the habit of\n lending liberally, and they wonder Christians do not. They\n hear us also repeating and admiring that sentiment, \u201c It is more\n blessed to give than to receive.\u201d Must they not think us insincere\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ru:le:me:as:ur:eo:fc:hr:00:sm:yt:rulemeasureofchr00smyt:rulemeasureofchr00smyt_0022/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 154, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 269}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ru:le:me:as:ur:eo:fc:hr:00:sm:yt:rulemeasureofchr00smyt:rulemeasureofchr00smyt_0022/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 308, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 539}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ru:le:me:as:ur:eo:fc:hr:00:sm:yt:rulemeasureofchr00smyt:rulemeasureofchr00smyt_0022/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 616, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1079}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ru:le:me:as:ur:eo:fc:hr:00:sm:yt:rulemeasureofchr00smyt:rulemeasureofchr00smyt_0022/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1233, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2159}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ru:le:me:as:ur:eo:fc:hr:00:sm:yt:rulemeasureofchr00smyt:rulemeasureofchr00smyt_0022/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2467, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4318}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ru:le:me:as:ur:eo:fc:hr:00:sm:yt:rulemeasureofchr00smyt:rulemeasureofchr00smyt_0022/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ru/le/me/as/ur/eo/fc/hr/00/sm/yt/rulemeasureofchr00smyt/rulemeasureofchr00smyt_0022.jp2", "height": 4318, "width": 2467, "levels": 6, "size": 672469}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"22\">\n<p>\n 22\n</p>\n<p>\n in our commendations of this sentiment, or else that we have\n very faint aspirations after the more blessed part, when they look\n on, and see with how much more complacency and good humour\n we receive a great deal, than give a little.\n</p>\n<p>\n But about the parsimony of Christians.

They only stop\n giving; commencing retrenchment with their donations, and\n generally ending it with them. They are liberal still for every*\n thing but charity. You could never suppose, to look at their\n dress, equipage, furniture, table, & c., that the times were any way\n hard. No; they forget that, till they are called on to give ; then\n they feel the pressure of the times.\n</p>\n<p>\n The manner in which some persons give is worthy of no very\n commendatory notice.

It is no such\n thing. The man is no beggar. He is not asking any thing for\n himself. He has himself given to the same object; and more\n than money\u2014his time and thought, his cares and efforts ;\u2014nay,\n perhaps, has given his own person to the service which he\n asks others to aid by their pecuniary contributions. Christians,\n so called, talk of giving to the support of missionaraies, as if they\n laid the missionaries under some obligations to them. Prepos*\n terous ! How it sounds to hear a real Christian indulge such\n a remark in reference to the richly gifted, and profoundly learned\n Martyn, who, when he might have shone at home, went into the\n sickly East, to hold up the light of life in those dark places 1\n To call men who give themselves to the work of the Lord, and\n to labour and die for their fellow-men, the proteges, beneficiaries,\n and obligated dependants of us who live and luxuriate at home,\n is really too bad ; men, who, when the alternative is to go or\n send, consent to the weightier branch of the alternative, and go ;\n that they should be looked upon as inferior to us, who choose\n the lighter part of the alternative, and only send ! I say it is\n too bad. \u201cI must give you something !\u201d Really !\n</p>\n<p>\n I do not wonder, for my part, that God does not give \u201c the\n kingdom and dominion, and the greatness of the kingdom under\n the whole heaven,\u201d to the present generation of saints.
