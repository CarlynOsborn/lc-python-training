It has developed freedom of\n thought, starting out as it did upon the idea, that it was\n man\u2019s right to interpret Scripture for himself. This prin\u00ac\n ciple, which is the great idea of freedom, has overcome civil\n and ecclesiastical despotisms, since it obtained a foothold at\n the time of the Reformation; and is marching on, a resist\u00ac\n less power, destined to overcome everything that opposes it.\n It prevails by virtue of the tendency of the human mind to\n reason for itself on principles, and establish principles to\n guide its action. Freedom of thought signifies liberty to choose\n the principles by which one shall be guided ; not the liberty to\n disregard all opinions and principles, and remain devoid of\n any. The doctrines of sects are to be judged of by their\n merits or demerits; and received or rejected, as different\n minds measure their worth. The statement of a creed, is a\n presentation to the world of certain principles or propositions of\n which mankind are asked to judge. If this is heresy to the\n principles of Reform and Progress which Spiritualism\n teaches, then Spiritualism , as it is taught , is heresy to true pro -\n gressive ideas.\n</p>\n<p>\n The attitude Spiritualism assumes, in view of the most\n consistent of its opposers, is that of a ship without a helm.\n It has thus far proved itself a staunch vessel, able to breast\n terrific storms, even, without such an important safeguard ;\n yet there are storms which threaten it, more terrific than\n any it has yet braved ; and to believe that it can outride\n these unprovided with something it has, so far, lacked, is\n to overlook the threatening dangers\u2014to disregard premoni\u00ac\n tions which tell that a change of policy is necessary.

It only asks its votaries to\n adhere to certain principles while they can conscientiously;\n to maintain membership with an association having a set\n of principles, only while they adhere to those principles.\n It is somewhat in advance of a certain Association of Spir\u00ac\n itualists, that adopted a resolution to the effect that a cer\u00ac\n tain article adopted by the Association should never be\n amended; so far assuming to fix a permanent dogma, or\n tenet of a creed, to bind the Association for all the future.\n This is surely unprogressive Spiritualism, if there can be\n said to be any such anomalous thing. Binding people\u2014\n associations or societies, to disavow creeds or tests of mem\u00ac\n bership, is after the same sort as binding them to any\n other doctrine.
