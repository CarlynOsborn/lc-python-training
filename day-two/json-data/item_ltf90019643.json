Visitors from Germany, who\n were traveling in Switzerland, wished to see and\n converse with the self-denying Dorothea, with the\n hope of deriving blessing from an interview with\n her: from this cause she was often obliged to post\u00ac\n pone her visits to the sick in her house until quite\n late at night.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the commencement of the summer, a new\n house was added, which was designed as a refuge\n for the mentally afflicted, and also to be used as\n a place of meeting: this house required so much\n superintendence from Dorothea, that she was\n obliged to give up most of her classes at the\n parent institution. Work brought work; much\n in the same way as an avalanche becomes larger\n and larger, as it rushes on its onward course, so\n did engagements of various kinds crowd so thickly\n upon her, that the continuance of a life of such un\u00ac\n ceasing activity could scarcely be anticipated. She\n prayed to be particularly strengthened for the\n salvation and conversion of souls, as that was her\n greatest joy; and soon after her prayer, a person\n came to her with the assurance that she had been\n led by her to a knowledge of the forgiveness of\n her sins, and was truly happy in the love of\n God.\n</p>\n<p>\n Any one who looked at her as she spoke so\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:do:ro:th:ea:tr:ud:el:or:00:un:se:dorotheatrudelor00unse:dorotheatrudelor00unse_0099/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 237, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 389}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:do:ro:th:ea:tr:ud:el:or:00:un:se:dorotheatrudelor00unse:dorotheatrudelor00unse_0099/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 475, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 779}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:do:ro:th:ea:tr:ud:el:or:00:un:se:dorotheatrudelor00unse:dorotheatrudelor00unse_0099/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 951, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1559}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:do:ro:th:ea:tr:ud:el:or:00:un:se:dorotheatrudelor00unse:dorotheatrudelor00unse_0099/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1903, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3118}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:do:ro:th:ea:tr:ud:el:or:00:un:se:dorotheatrudelor00unse:dorotheatrudelor00unse_0099/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/do/ro/th/ea/tr/ud/el/or/00/un/se/dorotheatrudelor00unse/dorotheatrudelor00unse_0099.jp2", "height": 3118, "width": 1903, "levels": 6, "size": 301265}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"99\">\n<p>\n NEW YEAR ' S MOTTOES.\n</p>\n<p>\n 93\n</p>\n<p>\n earnestly and zealously, must have wondered at\n the love which beamed forth from her countenance.\n She once spoke on 1 Chron. xxix., her New-Year\u2019s\n text: the following are some of her observa\u00ac\n tions : \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c My text is clearer to me now than it was on\n New Year\u2019s Day.

The differ\u00ac\n ent opinions among Christians deeply harassed\n me for some years. I did not mind the Babel in the\n world, but the Babel among Christians, who chat\u00ac\n ter about the various ways and leadings of God\u2019s\n grace as revealed in Christ to sinners, and yet\n neither possess nor understand it. If God had\n not given me grace not to attach myself to the\n Moravians, or to any other sect, I should have been\n a reed shaken hither and thither by the wind.\n Yet, though I am sure that if I had looked to any\n body of persons, I should never have reached the\n goal, I do not think that they can not find the\n way as well as we, if they suffer themselves to be\n led by the Spirit of Christ, and give themselves up\n entirely, learning that the followers of Jesus are no\n high people, but \u201c dust,\u201d and so humbling them\u00ac\n selves in everything.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are few fishers who understand what is\n meant by letting down the net on the right side,\n and I think we have such a poor in-gathering,\n because in many places men seek money rather\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:do:ro:th:ea:tr:ud:el:or:00:un:se:dorotheatrudelor00unse:dorotheatrudelor00unse_0155/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 237, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 389}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:do:ro:th:ea:tr:ud:el:or:00:un:se:dorotheatrudelor00unse:dorotheatrudelor00unse_0155/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 475, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 779}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:do:ro:th:ea:tr:ud:el:or:00:un:se:dorotheatrudelor00unse:dorotheatrudelor00unse_0155/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 951, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1559}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:do:ro:th:ea:tr:ud:el:or:00:un:se:dorotheatrudelor00unse:dorotheatrudelor00unse_0155/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1903, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3118}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:do:ro:th:ea:tr:ud:el:or:00:un:se:dorotheatrudelor00unse:dorotheatrudelor00unse_0155/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/do/ro/th/ea/tr/ud/el/or/00/un/se/dorotheatrudelor00unse/dorotheatrudelor00unse_0155.jp2", "height": 3118, "width": 1903, "levels": 6, "size": 317280}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"155\">\n<p>\n TEE LOVE OF GOD.\n</p>\n<p>\n 149\n</p>\n<p>\n than souls, while in others they concern themselves\n about the wool, and not about the sheep.
