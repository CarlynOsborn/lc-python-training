With the resignation of Vice President Agnew on October 10, 1973, Speaker of the House Albert became next in line for the presidency.  On October 12, Nixon quickly nominated House  Minority Leader Gerald Ford to succeed Agnew as Vice President, but the issue became acute after October 20 with widespread calls for Nixon's own resignation after his firing of the Special Prosecutor.  The cartoonist suggests that the Democratic-controlled Congress may stall on confirming Ford as Vice President in order to have their own Speaker named as President.
