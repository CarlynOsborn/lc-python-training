Three little boys and two\n little girls were playing among the grass, which\n reached their chins ; the girls every now and\n then fighting voluntarily with the boys. The\n ages of all five could not amount to more than\n fifty years. Beyond the long grass were trees\n loaded with fruit. In the midst of the leaves\n were two scare-crows, dressed like Lubins of the\n Comic Opera; and although, perhaps, they had\n the effect of frightening the birds, they failed to\n do that to the bergeronettes. In all corners of\n the garden were flowers glittering in the rays of\n the sun, and round these flowers were swarms of\n bees and butterflies. The bees hummed, the\n children chattered, the birds sang, and at a little\n distance were two doves billing.\n</p>\n<p>\n After having admired till night-fall this charm-\n ing little garden, I took a fancy to visit the ruin\n of the old church, which is . dedicated to St.\n Werner, who suffered martyrdom at Oberwesel.\n I reached the first flight of steps, which were\n covered with grass, looked round, admired the\n heavens, from which sufficient light came to en-\n able me to see the old palatine castle in ruins;\n then my eyes fell upon my charming garden of\n children, birds, doves, bees, butterflies, and music\n \u2014my garden of life, of love, and of joy, \u2014 and I\n discovered that it was a cemetery.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:rh:in:et:ou:rf:ro:mp:ar:00:hu:go:_0:rhinetourfrompar00hugo_0:rhinetourfrompar00hugo_0_0179/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 262, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 439}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:rh:in:et:ou:rf:ro:mp:ar:00:hu:go:_0:rhinetourfrompar00hugo_0:rhinetourfrompar00hugo_0_0179/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 524, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 878}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:rh:in:et:ou:rf:ro:mp:ar:00:hu:go:_0:rhinetourfrompar00hugo_0:rhinetourfrompar00hugo_0_0179/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1049, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1757}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:rh:in:et:ou:rf:ro:mp:ar:00:hu:go:_0:rhinetourfrompar00hugo_0:rhinetourfrompar00hugo_0_0179/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2099, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3514}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:rh:in:et:ou:rf:ro:mp:ar:00:hu:go:_0:rhinetourfrompar00hugo_0:rhinetourfrompar00hugo_0_0179/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/rh/in/et/ou/rf/ro/mp/ar/00/hu/go/_0/rhinetourfrompar00hugo_0/rhinetourfrompar00hugo_0_0179.jp2", "height": 3514, "width": 2099, "levels": 6, "size": 405465}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"179\">\n<p>\n Lorch .\n</p>\n<p>\n 157\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER XIX.\n</p>\n<p>\n < <\n</p>\n<p>\n fire! fire!\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Lorch. \u2014 An Incident. \u2014 Combat of the Hydra and Dragon.\u2014\n The Hotel P at Lorch.\n</p>\n<p>\n HEN twelve strikes at Bacharach we go\n</p>\n<p>\n to bed \u2014 we shut our eyes \u2014 we try to\n</p>\n<p>\n dispel the thoughts of day \u2014 we come to that\n state when we have, at the same time, some-\n thing awake, and something asleep \u2014 when the\n fatigued body reposes, and when the wayward\n mind is still at labor.
