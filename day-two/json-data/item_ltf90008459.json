Most failures occur in the last;\n the want of skill,\u2014and this generally arises from neg\u00ac\n lect to improve talents already possessed. Hence, in a\n Sunday school teacher, moral qualities are those most\n requisite. The teacher of ordinary attainments and\n powers, but anxious to do good, will study to improve.\n</p>\n<p>\n To teach faithfully in a Sunday school for a series of\n years, and not to become distinguished for something\n really valuable, is scarcely possible. No teacher can\n teach what he does not know; hence, he is constantly\n progressing in knowledge. To commit to memory\n weekly, a single hymn, or a few texts of scripture; to\n study a single paragraph of the Bible, so as to be able\n clearly to expound it; to read a single chapter so as to\n read it well (a rare attainment even among professed\n scholars);\u2014these will in time accomplish wonders.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:nt:so:fb:es:tm:et:ho:00:ke:el:hintsofbestmetho00keel:hintsofbestmetho00keel_0009/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 239, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 410}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:nt:so:fb:es:tm:et:ho:00:ke:el:hintsofbestmetho00keel:hintsofbestmetho00keel_0009/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 479, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 820}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:nt:so:fb:es:tm:et:ho:00:ke:el:hintsofbestmetho00keel:hintsofbestmetho00keel_0009/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 958, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1640}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:nt:so:fb:es:tm:et:ho:00:ke:el:hintsofbestmetho00keel:hintsofbestmetho00keel_0009/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1916, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3281}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:nt:so:fb:es:tm:et:ho:00:ke:el:hintsofbestmetho00keel:hintsofbestmetho00keel_0009/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/nt/so/fb/es/tm/et/ho/00/ke/el/hintsofbestmetho00keel/hintsofbestmetho00keel_0009.jp2", "height": 3281, "width": 1916, "levels": 6, "size": 409365}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"9\">\n<p>\n 7\n</p>\n<p>\n Qualification of Teachers.\n</p>\n<p>\n However simple the lesson, the faithful teacher carefully\n studies it, ere he ventures into the presence of the small\u00ac\n est class.

Why should Sunday schools be ex\u00ac\n pected to be exempt? We mention only a few of the\n worst, to shew that most, if not all, may be made pro\u00ac\n motive of the object.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. The absence of regular worship , except for one or\n two Lordts-days in each month. This is seriously felt\n in large portions of the southern and western states,\n where the population is sparse. The answer is, that a\n Sunday school is the best possible substitute for the min\u00ac\n istrations of the gospel, if indeed it is not one form of\n the thing itself. And wealthy members, who ride from\n home, six or seven miles, in various directions, on suc\u00ac\n cessive Lord\u2019s-days, to listen to popular preachers, leav\u00ac\n ing their domestics, their children, the poor of their\n neighborhood, and even the wealthy who are disinclined\n to go so far, destitute of the means of public worship,\n would do well to consider whether they might not be\n more usefully employed. A single Lord\u2019s-day spent in\n giving and receiving religious instruction in a Sunday\n school, would be a greater blessing than a score occu\u00ac\n pied in these weekly journeys.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Sparsity of population , distance , vicissitudes of\n season , < ^c., < 5pc. These should affect Sunday schools,\n no more than they should general education, courts of\n justice, social intercourse, or anything else that requires\n absence from one\u2019s own premises.

Besides, moral coercion is the strongest con\u00ac\n ceivable. The severest punishment of the sternest mas\u00ac\n ter we ever knew, was, \u201cAre you dull, Jim ? \u201d And the\n remark, \u201c I thought you had better taste,\u201d is a keener\n rebuke to a child, whose sensibilities are awakened in a\n Sunday school, than all the rods and dunce-caps in\n Christendom.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Either the Sunday school must obliterate castes in\n society , or it is doomed yet to suffer great hindrances\n from them. It must be acknowledged that the petted\n child of a rich man, may avoid the approach of the\n poor, and that the latter may be ashamed of his inferior\n garb: but the same objection weighs with as much force\n against all other associations of men. When this diffi\u00ac\n culty is felt in the Sunday school, it is the province of\n the teacher\u2019s wisdom and goodness to inculcate a more\n excellent way, and to assure the confidence of the poor.\n Distinctions in the conditions of men will always exist;\n but the Bible teaches that the rich and the poor meet\n together, and the Lord is the Maker of us all. The\n man who resolves to associate for no purpose, with any\n who are in any sense inferior to himself, or from whom\n he is not to receive benefit instead of conferring it, does\n by this very resolution, insult his own understanding,\n and rebuke his own impertinence. Since his associates\n must be superior to himself, he demands of them what\n he concedes to none. If there be any one place on\n earth, above all others, adapted to originate and cherish\n the most exalted principles and the finest moral feelings,\n it is the Sunday school. If it fails to do this, the teach\u00ac\n ers are in fault.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:nt:so:fb:es:tm:et:ho:00:ke:el:hintsofbestmetho00keel:hintsofbestmetho00keel_0021/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 239, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 410}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:nt:so:fb:es:tm:et:ho:00:ke:el:hintsofbestmetho00keel:hintsofbestmetho00keel_0021/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 479, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 820}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:nt:so:fb:es:tm:et:ho:00:ke:el:hintsofbestmetho00keel:hintsofbestmetho00keel_0021/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 958, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1640}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:nt:so:fb:es:tm:et:ho:00:ke:el:hintsofbestmetho00keel:hintsofbestmetho00keel_0021/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1916, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3281}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:nt:so:fb:es:tm:et:ho:00:ke:el:hintsofbestmetho00keel:hintsofbestmetho00keel_0021/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/nt/so/fb/es/tm/et/ho/00/ke/el/hintsofbestmetho00keel/hintsofbestmetho00keel_0021.jp2", "height": 3281, "width": 1916, "levels": 6, "size": 385101}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"21\">\n<p>\n Miscellaneous Items.\n</p>\n<p>\n 19\n</p>\n<p>\n 5.

Those parents who rely on a Sun\u00ac\n day school, a substitute for family religion, are high\u00ac\n ly censurable; but equally great is the mistake of those\n who neglect the Sunday school.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. Are you a professional man ? What your profes\u00ac\n sion may be, matters not. Let not the mechanic send\n but bring his journeymen and apprentices ; the merchant\n his clerks ; the learned advocate at the bar, his students\n of law; the physician his medical classes; the college\n professor, and the classic, and the common school teach\u00ac\n er, their classes respectively; and let them be them\u00ac\n selves the teachers of those they bring. One of the\n most melancholy spectacles of this evangelized country\n is, that in all the various professions, there are so many\n men, with youth committed to their care, who know\n nothing of their Sunday pursuits. If the apprentice\n or the clerk, perform his duty six days in the week, the\n employer or master, knows not even his whereabouts on\n Sunday. If youth thus trained, or thus neglected,\n avoid the vortex of destruction, it approaches a miracle.\n If the Sunday school were for the ignorant, the pauper,\n the degraded\u2014then were it noble to enlist in this cause.\n But this is not the view taken in these pages. It is for\n all. Its benevolence is boundless as the light; its diffu\u00ac\n siveness as vast as the atmosphere itself.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. Are you a wife,\u2014a mother ,\u2014 a sister,\u2014a daugh\u00ac\n ter? Then teaching is your appropriate business. The\n education of man as a race, devolves for the first ten\n vears, almost wholly upon woman. Such is, by the re\u00ac\n gulation of heaven, the constitution of the world. Our\n race comprehends but two classes,\u2014adults and children.\n By whom are the latter to be taught, if not by the form\u00ac\n er? And for this ennobling and refining employment,\n who has the taste and the heart, if woman has not ?\n But whether you choose it or not, you do the work.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:nt:so:fb:es:tm:et:ho:00:ke:el:hintsofbestmetho00keel:hintsofbestmetho00keel_0026/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 229, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 403}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:nt:so:fb:es:tm:et:ho:00:ke:el:hintsofbestmetho00keel:hintsofbestmetho00keel_0026/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 459, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 806}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:nt:so:fb:es:tm:et:ho:00:ke:el:hintsofbestmetho00keel:hintsofbestmetho00keel_0026/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 918, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1612}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:nt:so:fb:es:tm:et:ho:00:ke:el:hintsofbestmetho00keel:hintsofbestmetho00keel_0026/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1836, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3225}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:nt:so:fb:es:tm:et:ho:00:ke:el:hintsofbestmetho00keel:hintsofbestmetho00keel_0026/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/nt/so/fb/es/tm/et/ho/00/ke/el/hintsofbestmetho00keel/hintsofbestmetho00keel_0026.jp2", "height": 3225, "width": 1836, "levels": 6, "size": 404482}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"26\">\n<p>\n 24\n</p>\n<p>\n Appeal to the Reader.\n</p>\n<p>\n You may try to shun the responsibility by paying the\n salary of the day-school teacher, or by shifting off your\n little charge to the Sunday school; but the character of\n every generation of our species is moulded by wives,\n mothers, daughters, sisters.

If your parents\n are not convinced of the utility of our enterprise; if\n your friends, the church, and your minister, are insensi\u00ac\n ble to what we consider your highest wants; listen to\n one who knows what he says; who can have no inter\u00ac\n est in deceiving you ; and who sincerely loves you.\n</p>\n<p>\n Obtain permission from those to whom you owe sub\u00ac\n jection, to attend a Sunday school.

Ascribe your want of interest to yourself, to\n this particular school, to any thing rather than to the\n system. Your curiosity will become awakened, only\n to be gratified that it may be again excited. In propor\u00ac\n tion to the frequency with which you drink at her crys\u00ac\n tal fountains will you thirst and pant for knowledge.\n Your taste for the beautiful, the refined, the true, will\n become cultivated in a degree, inperceptible to yourself,\n except by comparing some antecedent with some subse\u00ac\n quent period. In a few years at most you will be un\u00ac\n happy on Lord\u2019s day, except at a Sunday school. And\n God\u2019s providence will in time open to you a theatre in\n which you may shew his glory, and render to your\n friends, and perhaps to the world, untold service. Were\n the days of infancy and childhood of the author of these\n \u201chints\u201d to be again passed over, he would prefer as\n an alternative, if only one were possible, rather to be\n brought up in a Sunday school, than at the feet of Ga\u00ac\n maliel, or in the schools of the prophets.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":
