The fact cannot be\n doubted, that very much in the works of Pagan antiquity, is cal\u00ac\n culated to mislead and corrupt the incautious reader. It is equal\u00ac\n ly undeniable, that the spirit which they contain, has been exten\u00ac\n sively transfused into English, French, Italian, and in a word all\n modern literature. Oral instruction, furnished by parents and\n teachers, has been thought the best antidote to the poisonous\n draughts which flow from Castalian fountains. My object at pre\u00ac\n sent is, to offer a few brief remarks in reply to this great and well\n founded objection to classical literature, and then pass to some\n other objections, equally popular, but far less substantial. My first\n remark is, that the knowledge derived from this source, is a mo\u00ac\n ral engine of great power, which may be used for salutary purpo\u00ac\n ses. If it be conceded that classical learning refines the taste, en\u00ac\n larges the mind, and stores it with useful science, it follows of\n course, that in these respects it may be turned to the promotion\n of valuable objects; and most certainly, it can never be the dic\u00ac\n tate of wisdom in the virtuous part of the community, to abandon\n the tremendous operations of this power, to the enemies of truth\n and righteousness.

In pronouncing his eulogium on let\u00ac\n ters, he says; \u201cSome will ask whether all those excellent men,\n who are mentioned in history, were instructed in that learning\n which you so much extol. It is difficult to say this of all, and\n yet I have a ready reply. I confess that many men of un\u00ac\n common strength of mind, have become distinguished without\n learning, and I add too that genius oftener prevails without learn\u00ac\n ing, than learning without genius. But yet I contend, that when\u00ac\n ever to extraordinary and brilliant powers, are added the ac\u00ac\n complishments of learning, there usually results from the combi\u00ac\n nation, a character of peculiar and indescribable excellence.\u201d\n The same objection to learning which Cicero so triumphantly re\u00ac\n futes, has been felt by some at all subsequent periods. But in\n our own country it seems to me to have prevailed, to an uncom\u00ac\n mon degree. It may be, that here the spirit of liberty has open\u00ac\n ed the avenues to our highest offices, to all those who can gain\n the favour of the populace\u2014and that favour is not always gained\n by merit; or it may be, that in the infancy of a country, there\n are examples of greatness without advantages, which cannot af\u00ac\n terwards exist, and are therefore wTongfully pleaded as examples.\n Whatever may be the cause, the fact is certain. We are con\u00ac\n tinually pointed to those national benefactors, w ' ho have sprung up\n and flourished, without the assistance of liberal education. We\n are told of physicians, and divines, and jurists. We are remin\u00ac\n ded of Rittenhouse, and Henry, and Franklin, and Washington.\n It was perhaps from the prevalence of this feeling, that the trus\u00ac\n tees of a respectable College, some years since, called for a vote\n to exclude the languages from that Seminary, and lost it by a\n bare majority. Need I ask you what all this amounts to, when\n you remember that those very men, who are brought up as pre\u00ac\n cedents to disparage the worth of classical literature, were them\u00ac\n selves deeply sensible of its high importance, and of their own\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:cl:em:addressdelivered00clem:addressdelivered00clem_0017/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 137, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 257}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:cl:em:addressdelivered00clem:addressdelivered00clem_0017/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 515}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:cl:em:addressdelivered00clem:addressdelivered00clem_0017/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1030}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:cl:em:addressdelivered00clem:addressdelivered00clem_0017/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2061}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:cl:em:addressdelivered00clem:addressdelivered00clem_0017/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4123}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:cl:em:addressdelivered00clem:addressdelivered00clem_0017/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ad/dr/es/sd/el/iv/er/ed/00/cl/em/addressdelivered00clem/addressdelivered00clem_0017.jp2", "height": 4123, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 502022}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"17\">\n<p>\n 17\n</p>\n<p>\n misfortune in being ignorant of it.

Think of\n this, ye who would plead his example, in justification of that\n stinted course of education, which has cost him so much mortifi\u00ac\n cation. It may be stated as a confirmation of our views, that\n those very men referred to, have almost uniformly educated their\n sons in polite literature, if circumstances permitted.

Be\u00ac\n cause, in the first place, they could not have been furnished with\n those works in their own language, which had so much to do in\n the formation of their minds ; and in the next place, they could\n not have come in contact with those educated men, who were\n constantly enlightening their minds with their own knowledge,\n and by drawing them into collision with themselves, exciting\n them to the most strenuous exertions, in order to maintain\n their place in public debate.

For the very reason that the author is\n respectable, his opinions concerning the Classics are the more to be re\u00ac\n gretted. It may not be inappropriate to add, that, in the state, to which\n he belongs, a Review has been established, which controverts his views and\n is noticed in the following manner by the Editor of the N.

Spectator.\n u The first article is an able vindication of the utility of Classical education,\n and is obviously written by one who is himself a scholar.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Note C.\n</p>\n<p>\n That the grammatical art may be learned as perfectly from an English\n or French, as from a Greek or Latin grammar, no person will affirm, who\n attends to the subject, and can state the comparison. Classical learning ,\n therefore t, is necessary to grammatical skill, Beattie.\n</p>\n<p>\n Note D.\n</p>\n<p>\n I agree with Rousseau, that the aim of education should be, to teach us\n rather how to think, than what to think ; rather to improve our minds so as\n to enable us to think for ourselves, than to load the memory with the\n thoughts of other men.\n</p>\n<p>\n A mind prepared by proper discipline for making discoveries of its own,\n is in a much higher state of cultivation, than that of a mere scholar who\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n < .\n</p>\n<p>\n * o\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:cl:em:addressdelivered00clem:addressdelivered00clem_0022/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 267, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 505}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:cl:em:addressdelivered00clem:addressdelivered00clem_0022/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 535, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1010}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:cl:em:addressdelivered00clem:addressdelivered00clem_0022/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1070, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2021}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:cl:em:addressdelivered00clem:addressdelivered00clem_0022/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2140, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4043}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:sd:el:iv:er:ed:00:cl:em:addressdelivered00clem:addressdelivered00clem_0022/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ad/dr/es/sd/el/iv/er/ed/00/cl/em/addressdelivered00clem/addressdelivered00clem_0022.jp2", "height": 4043, "width": 2140, "levels": 6, "size": 476703}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"22\">\n<p>\n 22\n</p>\n<p>\n knows nothing- but what he has been taught.

Now this peculiar advantage seems to\n attend the study of the classic authors, that it not only stores the mind\n with useful learning, but also begets a habit of attention and wonderfully\n improves both the memory and the judgment.

It has been already observed, that oral in\u00ac\n struction on the part of parents and teachers, is the best antidote to the im\u00ac\n moral tendency of the Classics. It gives me pleasure to say that the foun\u00ac\n ders of Phillips Academy attached very special importance to religious in\u00ac\n struction.
