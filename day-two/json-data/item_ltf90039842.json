States for\n the Use of Schools and Academies. In reducing\n the quantity of matter to such a compass as will\n place the volume within the reach of thq common\n schools, no pains have been spared to preserve all\n that is essential to a clear and comprehensive\n history of the country. No event of importance,\n noticed in the larger history, is passed over in this,\n although many of the minor details are considerably\n condensed ; and some circumstances and observa-\n tions having a comparatively unimportant bearing\n \u00a3 > n the main story, are entirely omitted.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Author\u2019s design in accomplishing the\n condensation of his former work, has been to\n furnish the common schools of the country with a\n history, in a cheap and convenient form, which\n would be complete and sufficient for the purposes\n of sound instruction, not only in the plan and ar-\n rangement, but in the amount of solid information\n which it should comprise. How far he may have\n succeeded in this attempt it remains for the friends\n of popular education to determine.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 *\n</p>\n<p>\n 5\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fu:ni:te:ds:00:fr:os:_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2_0006/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 208, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 350}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fu:ni:te:ds:00:fr:os:_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2_0006/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 416, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 701}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fu:ni:te:ds:00:fr:os:_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2_0006/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 833, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1403}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fu:ni:te:ds:00:fr:os:_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2_0006/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1666, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2807}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fu:ni:te:ds:00:fr:os:_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2_0006/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fu/ni/te/ds/00/fr/os/_2/historyofuniteds00fros_2/historyofuniteds00fros_2_0006.jp2", "height": 2807, "width": 1666, "levels": 6, "size": 226718}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"6\">\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n -\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n &\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n r\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2022*\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n t\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n \u25a0\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n r \u2022r *\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n j\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n >\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n '\n</p>\n<p>\n \u25a0 \" \u2666. n -

At a time\n when geographical science had long slept in Europe,\n when distant voyages were rare, and discoverers were\n few, timid, and ignorant, this extraordinary man formed\n the noble design of crossing the Atlantic Ocean in search\n of new regions. His opinion, that such an enterprise\n would be attended with success, was not unsupported by\n plausible facts and reasonings. Though, in the fifteenth\n century, the information of geographers was incorrect as\n well as scanty, certain observations had been recorded\n which supported his theory. From the form of the earth\u2019s\n shadow on the moon in an eclipse, it had been inferred\n that its shape was globular; and tolerably accurate ideas\n had been conceived of its magnitude. It was, therefore,\n apparent that Europe, Asia, and Africa could occupy but\n a small portion of its surfac^, and it seemed highly im-\n probable that the remaining portion was one vast ocean.\n Travellers in the east had reported that Asia extended\n very far in that direction, and the rotundity of the earth\n being known, it was inferred that the East Indies might\n be reached by holding a course directly west from Europe.\n</p>\n<p>\n These reasonings were not unsupported by striking\n facts.

A tree of an unknown species\n had been taken out of the ocean near the Azores ; and\n the bodies of two men, of strange colour and unusual ap-\n pearance, had been found upon the coast.\n</p>\n<p>\n From these circumstances Columbus inferred the exist-\n ence of the regions which he afterwards discovered, and\n the possibility of reaching them by sailing to the west.\n</p>\n<p>\n At this period the favourite object of discovery was a\n passage to the East Indies by sea. To find a shorter and\n more direct route to these regions, than that around Africa,\n was the immediate object of Columbus in proposing to\n undertake a voyage of discovery. The rich returns of\n oriental commerce formed the chief inducement which\n he urged upon those sovereigns, to whom he submitted\n his project, with a view to gain their support and patron-\n age.\n</p>\n<p>\n He first applied to the government of Genoa, his native\n umntry ; but here his offer was rejected., probably in con-\n sequence of the decline of commercial enterprise among\n ate Genoese. He then made application to King John II,\n of Portugal, a monarch who had liberally encouraged\n voyages of discovery. Here he met with no better suc-\n cess, and he left the country in disgust.

By keeping possession of\n his favourite child as a hostage, the English hoped to\n dictate to Powhatan what terms of alliance or submission\n they pleased. In this they w r ere aisappointed. \u2018 Pow-\n hatan,\u2019 says Marshall, * offered corn and friendship, if\n they would restore his daughter; but with a loftiness of\n spirit which claims respect, rejected every proposition\n for conciliation which should not be preceded by that act\n of reparation.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n While she was detained at Jamestown, Mr. John\n Rolfe, a young -Englishman, gained the favour of the\n princess, and desired her in marriage. Powhatan con-\n sented ; and w T ith his daughter, the noble-spirited prince\n gave his heart. He was ever after the firm and sincere\n Friend of the colony.

This charter was of a liberal character,\n affording ample guarantees for the freedom of the colo-\n nists, and the rights and privileges of the proprietary.\n The boundaries which it prescribed were the Atlantic\n Ocean, the fortieth parallel of north latitude, the meridian\n of the western fountain of the Potomac, the river itself\n from its mouth to its source, and a line drawn due east\n from Watkin\u2019s Point to the ocean. The name given to\n the new colony was Maryland, in honour of Henrietta\n Maria, daughter of Henry IV of France, and wife of\n Charles I of England.\n</p>\n<p>\n The charter assigned the country to Calvert, Lord\n Baltimore, his heirs and assigns, as absolute lord and\n proprietary, on payment of a feudal rent of two Indian\n arrows and one-fifth of all gold and silver ore which\n might be discovered. The right of legislation was given\n to the emigrants who should settle on the soil. They\n were also protected from injury by the proprietary, to\n their lives, liberty, or estates.\n</p>\n<p>\n Although Sir George Calvert was a Roman Catholic,\n he allowed the most perfect religious liberty to the colo-\n nists under his charter; and Maryland was the first\n state in the world in which complete religious freedom was\n enjoyed. All English subjects, without distinction, were\n allowed equal rights in respect to property and religious\n and civil franchises. .A royal exemption from English\n</p>\n<p>\n UnilerAvhose auspices was a distinct colony formed ?\u2014 Who was Sir\n George Calvert?\u2014 What prevented his settling in Virginia ! \u2014 For wha.\n country did he obtain a charter? \u2014 From whom ?\u2014 What did it afford ?\u2014\n What were the boundaries of the new colony ?\u2014 What was its name ?\u2014\n What were the terms of the charter ' /\u2014What religious rights were\n allowed bv Calven \u2018\u2018\u2014What is observed of Maryland 1\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fu:ni:te:ds:00:fr:os:_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2_0047/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 208, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 350}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fu:ni:te:ds:00:fr:os:_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2_0047/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 416, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 701}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fu:ni:te:ds:00:fr:os:_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2_0047/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 833, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1403}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fu:ni:te:ds:00:fr:os:_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2_0047/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1666, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2807}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fu:ni:te:ds:00:fr:os:_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2_0047/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fu/ni/te/ds/00/fr/os/_2/historyofuniteds00fros_2/historyofuniteds00fros_2_0047.jp2", "height": 2807, "width": 1666, "levels": 6, "size": 439685}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"47\">\n<p>\n SETTLEMENT OF ST.

The expedition against\n Quebec was equally unsuccessful.\n</p>\n<p>\n Leisler, transported with rage when he was informed\n of the retreat, caused Winthrop to be arrested, but was\n instantly compelled, by the indignation of all parties, to\n release him. This man was intoxicated with his eleva-\n tion, and began to betray his utter incapacity for the su-\n preme controul of a colony.

But for the removal\n of the settlers into Virginia, Carolina would have been\n the first permanent English colony in America.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was not till the year 1630, that Sir Robert Heath,\n attorney general of Charles I, obtained a patent for the\n region south of Virginia, bounded north by the 36th de-\n gree of north latitude, and extending to Louisiana.

They reached Lake Champlain\n in the night of the 9th of May. With a detachment of 83\n men, Allen and Arnold crossed the lake, and succeeded\n in surprising and capturing the fort without firing a gun.\n Colonel Warren was then sent off with a small party, and\n took possession of Crown Point, which was garrisoned\n only by a sergeant and twelve men. At both these places\n a considerable amount of cannon and military stores were\n taken.\n</p>\n<p>\n While these events were passing, Generals Howe, Bur-\n goyne, and Clinton arrived at Boston ; and, soon after,\n General Gage sent forth a proclamation, declaring martial\n law to be in force; and offering pardon to all who would\n submit to the king, excepting Samuel Adams and John\n Hancock.\n</p>\n<p>\n In Virginia, the royal governor, Lord Dunmore, seized\n some powder belonging to the colony, and conveyed it on\n board an armed vessel, lying in the harbour of Williams-\n burg.

In that city the British interest-\n had been more powerful than in any other place in the\n provinces, and the struggle between the friends of British\n domination, and of American freedom, had been more\n doubtful than in any other quarter. But by superior num-\n bers, and more daring activity, the adherents of congress\n had gained the ascendancy. On his arrival in the city,\n Washington endeavoured to put it in a state of defence;\n and as the British, by means of their fleet, had the com-\n mand of the waters, he attempted to obstruct the navi-\n gation of the East and North fiivers, by sinking vessels\n in the channels. He also raised fortifications at New\n York, and on Long Island; and made every preparation\n in his power for giving the British army a vigorous\n reception.\n</p>\n<p>\n General How r e remained some time at Halifax ; but,\n after the recovery of his troops from the fatigue and sick*\n</p>\n<p>\n VVhen was the declaration signed and proclaimed 7\u2014 What city had\n Washington to defend, after relieving Boston 7\u2014 How did he prepare loi\n the reception of the British 7\n</p>\n<p>\n * See Appendix\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fu:ni:te:ds:00:fr:os:_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2_0155/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 208, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 350}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fu:ni:te:ds:00:fr:os:_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2_0155/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 416, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 701}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fu:ni:te:ds:00:fr:os:_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2_0155/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 833, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1403}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fu:ni:te:ds:00:fr:os:_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2_0155/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1666, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2807}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fu:ni:te:ds:00:fr:os:_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2:historyofuniteds00fros_2_0155/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fu/ni/te/ds/00/fr/os/_2/historyofuniteds00fros_2/historyofuniteds00fros_2_0155.jp2", "height": 2807, "width": 1666, "levels": 6, "size": 471831}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"155\">\n<p>\n ARRIVAL OF LORD HOWE AT NEW YORE.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15h\n</p>\n<p>\n ness occasioned by the siege of Boston, he embarked,\n sailed to the southward, and on the 2d of July landed,\n without opposition, on Staten Island, which lies on the\n coast of New Jersey, and is separated from Long Island\n by a channel called the Narrows.

General Washington,\n who had been diligent in preparing the minds of the\n officers for the occasion, addressed the assembly, strongly\n combated the address, and, by his sound reasoning and\n high influential character, succeeded in dissipating the\n storm.\n</p>\n<p>\n These proceedings of the officers induced congress to\n pay some regard to its promises, and to grant their request\n for a commutation of half ' pay for a sum equal to five\n years\u2019 full pay. The disbanding of the army, which was\n still in a state of irritation, from having large arrears of\n pay, and many of them not money enough to supply their\n most pressing wants, was a dangerous experiment.\n Other armies disbanded under such circumstances had\n often formed themselves into companies of freebooters,\n and ravaged the country they had previously defended.\n But congress understood tn\u00ab true character of their\n patriot army, and boldly ran the risk of dismissing it\n unpaid. No convulsion followed. The soldiers quietly\n returned to their homes, and resumed the arts of peace,\n content with the humblest lot in the land, which they had\n \u25a0ust freed from foreign enemies, and placed among the\n most highly favoured nations of the earth. Previous to\n this event, however, on the 19th of April, 1783, the day\n which completed the eighth year of the war, the cessa-\n tion of hostilities with Great Britain was, by order of\n General Washington, proclaimed in the American cam;v.\n</p>\n<p>\n The American forces still remained at their posts,\n awaiting the entire removal of the enemy\u2019s troops from\n the country.

To effect\n this, it w r as essential to gain the command on Lake Onta-\n rio. Sackett\u2019s Harbour, on the east end of the lake, near\n its outlet, was selected as a naval depot; and Commodore\n Chauncey had been occupied since the month of October,\n 1812, in building and equipping a squadron sufficiently\n powerful to cope with that of the enemy, which consisted\n of six vessels, mounting in all eighty guns. In this he\n was successful ; and having made several captures in the\n autumn of \\812, he was enabled, in the spring of the next\n year, to acquire the complete ascendancy on the lake,\n confining every British ship to the harbour of Kingston.\n</p>\n<p>\n General Dearborn had now under his command a re-\n spectable- force of six thousand men, composing the army\n of the north ; and as Montreal was in a comparatively\n defenceless state, and could receive no reinforcements\n until June, it was his proper policy to have made an im-\n mediate descent upon that city. Unfortunately his exer-\n tions were directed to a much less important object. On\n the 23d of April he embarked at Sackett\u2019s Harbour with\n sixteen hundred men, on an expedition against York, the\n capital of Upper Canada, situated at the head of Lake\n Ontario. On the 27th he arrived at his destination, and\n immediately commenced a disembarkation.

The intelligence of Captain Porter\u2019s exploits in\n the Pacific had at length occasioned a force of the enemy\n to be sent in pursuit of him. While the Essex and\n Essex Junior were lying in the harbour of Valparaiso,\n the Phoebe, a British frigate of 38 guns, and a sloop of\n war, appeared off the port. Having entered the harbour\n and obtained provisions, they cruised off the port for six\n weeks. Their united force was much greater than\n Captain Porter\u2019s. On the 28th of March, the Essex\n attempted to escape to sea, but in rounding the point she\n was struck by a squall which carried away her main top\n mast, and unable to regain the harbour, Captain Porter\n ran into a small bay and anchored within pistol shot of\n the shore. Here, in violation of the rights of neutrality\n he was attacked in a most unfavourable position by a\n superior force, consisting of both the British ships above\n mentioned, and after gallantly maintaining the unequal\n contest for three hours, was compelled to surrender.\n The disregard of the British for the rules of warfare\n relating to an enemy under the protection of a neutral\n nation, was, subsequently referred to by the Americans\n in justification of General Jackson\u2019s retaliatory proceed-\n ings in Florida.\n</p>\n<p>\n The sloop of war Peacock, of 18 guns, commanded by\n Captain W T arrington, on the 29th of April, fell in with,\n and after an action of 42 minutes, captured the British\n brig of war Epervier of 18 guns ; the Peacock and her\n priz?, with 120,000 dollars in specie, arrived safely in\n the United States.

On the 11th of March,\n the troops moved from Corpus Christi, by order of the\n president, and advanced toward the Rio Grande, the\n disputed boundary between Texas and Mexico.
