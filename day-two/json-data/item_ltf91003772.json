They were so\n dreadfully bruised and battered about the head, that\n only two or three of them could be recognized. At\n this time a man had just counted them, and was report\u00ac\n ing the number to the chief, who sat in the hammock-\n nettings ; immediately after which they began to throw\n them overboard. Mr. Mariner and the cooper were\n now brought into the presence of the chief, who looked\n at them awhile and smiled, probably on account of their\n dirty appearance. Mr. Mariner was then given in\n charge to a petty chief to be taken on shore, but the\n cooper was detained on board.\n</p>\n<p>\n In a little while Mr. Mariner was landed, and led to\n the most northern part of the island, a place called Co-\n oolo, where he saw, without being much affected at the\n sight, the cause of all that day\u2019s disasters, Mr. Brown,\n the whaling master, lying dead upon the beach: the\n body was naked, and much bruised about the head and\n chest.

Here he found\n several of his country-people, and among them some\n ladies, whose anxiety to view this sublime spectacle\n near at hand had overcome their fears. From the\n hermitage he advanced nearer to the cone, and then\n descended into a hollow through which the great river\n of lava was flowing. As he approached it, he saw it\n come in contact with a fine large vineyard. The low,\n dried \u2019vines were immediately set on fire, and blazing\n all over in an instant, the destructive element spread\n to another and another vineyard, until considerable\n mischief was done. The lava, as in every eruption he\n has seen, so far from being rapid, was exceedingly\n slow in its course, flowing only a few feet in a minute.\n At this time it seemed tending directly to the unfortu\u00ac\n nate town of the Torre del Greco, which it threatened\n to overwhelm; but it aft erwards turned aside, and\n following another hollow, rolled into a wide and deep\n chasm of the mountain. He then attempted to ascend\n by the side of this burning river towards the cone; but\n its heat, which set fire to brushwood and little trees at\n several feet distance, became insupportable.

Bulls,\n notwithstanding the fierceness of their looks, nevei\n attack any body. Mr. Ramond, in his notes on Coxe\u2019s\n Travels, tells an interesting story concerning these\n animals, which, if it should happen not to be quite\n true, at least deserves to he so. Speaking of their\n antipathy for bears\u2014 4 It is impossible,\u2019 he says, 4 to\n restrain a bull when he scents a bear in the neighbour\u00ac\n hood ; he comes up to him, and a running fight begins,\n which often lasts for several days, and till one of the\n two is killed.

Now once more I found myself very\n uncomfortably situated; having lost the friendship I\n had gained, the whole household despised me; as they\n passed me they made signs, giving me to understand\n that if I did not become a Mussulman, I should have\n my head taken off. In this miserable state I did not\n remain long, the Almighty being merciful and hearing\n my prayers, and I was soon delivered from the hands\n of those Turks. One of the officers belonging to Soly\u00ac\n man Aga being taken ill of a disorder, it was thought\n necessary to consult a European doctor, and to my\n great astonishment I recollected him to have been in\n Bonaparte\u2019s army. I approached the doctor, and\n addressed him by his name, but he had no recollection\n of me. I told him my name, and in whose service I\n had been; he seemed greatly astonished, as he had\n heard Colonel Broune say many times that I had been\n killed. I then acquainted him how I came in my\n present situation, and how cruelly they had used me.\n He then asked me if-1 had changed my religion ; I\n replied no, but that I expected every moment to be\n forced to do so. This gentleman filled my heart with\n rapture, saying that if I could keep myself from doing\n so for twenty-four hours, he would apply to the grand\n vizier for my liberty, he being under his protection.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:ri:lo:us:ad:ve:nt:ur:00:fr:os:perilousadventur00fros:perilousadventur00fros_0109/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 261, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 440}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:ri:lo:us:ad:ve:nt:ur:00:fr:os:perilousadventur00fros:perilousadventur00fros_0109/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 522, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 880}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:ri:lo:us:ad:ve:nt:ur:00:fr:os:perilousadventur00fros:perilousadventur00fros_0109/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1045, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1761}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:ri:lo:us:ad:ve:nt:ur:00:fr:os:perilousadventur00fros:perilousadventur00fros_0109/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2090, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3522}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:ri:lo:us:ad:ve:nt:ur:00:fr:os:perilousadventur00fros:perilousadventur00fros_0109/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/pe/ri/lo/us/ad/ve/nt/ur/00/fr/os/perilousadventur00fros/perilousadventur00fros_0109.jp2", "height": 3522, "width": 2090, "levels": 6, "size": 503787}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"109\">\n<p>\n CAVALIERO\u2019S ADVENTURES IN EGYPT.\n</p>\n<p>\n 105\n</p>\n<p>\n The twenty-four hours had not expired before this\n humane gentleman came with a Turkish officer, and a\n letter from the grand vizier for Solyman Aga.

A coach, with an eye painted on the\n panels, and drawn by six mules, conveys the Host to\n the houses of dying Catholics who are rich enough to\n pay for the privilege; before this equipage a bell\n tinkles, which warns the orthodox to fall on their\n knees; and wo to the unfortunate who neglects this\n ceremony, either from accident or design. On one\n occasion, being suddenly surprised by the approach of\n one of these processions, I had but just time to doff my\n hat and run behind a corner of a building, when I was\n spied by a fat priest, who, shouldering an image,\n brought up the rear of the procession. As he was at\n the head of a vast crowd who were just rising from\n their knees, he thought it a good opportunity of venting\n an anathema against a vile heretico. Turning first to\n the crowd, as much as to say, \u201cJust see what a dress\u00ac\n ing I am going to give this fellow,\u201d he, with a most\n severe frown, addressed me:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMan,\u201d said he, \u201c do you refuse to kneel to your\n God?\u201d \u201cNo, mi padre,\u201d I answered, \u201cpero al imagen\n de mad^ra\u201d\u2014but to an image of wood.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cVaya,\u201d muttered the padre; \u201clo te pagara el\n demonio\u201d\u2014the devil will pay thee\u2014and marched away.\n</p>\n<p>\n Tacubaya is the Richmond of Mexico: villas and\n country residences abound, where the aristocracy resort\n during the hot months.

On returning from\n Tacubaya, I visited the hill of Chapultepec, celebrated\n as being the site of Montezuma\u2019s palace, on which,\n toward the close of the seventeenth century, the viceroy\n Galvez erected a huge castle, the remains of which are\n now occupied by the military school.*\n</p>\n<p>\n Far more interesting than the apocryphal tradition\n of the Indians\u2019 palace, the viceroy\u2019s castle, or the exist\u00ac\n ing eyesore, is the magnificent grove of cypress, which\n outlives all the puny structures of man, and still in the\n prime of strength and beauty, looks with contempt on\n the ruined structures of generation after generation\n which have passed away.

The woman of the house, who was\n Irish, was peeling for dinner some large white turnips,\n which her husband had grown in their garden. The\n Indian had never seen a turnip before, and the appear\u00ac\n ance of the firm, white, juicy root gave her such a keen\n craving to taste it that she very earnestly begged for\n a small piece to eat. She had purchased at Peter\u00ac\n borough a large stone-china bowl, of a very handsome\n pattern, (or, perhaps, got it at the store in exchange\n for a basket ,) the worth of which might be half-a-dollar.\n If the poor squaw longed for the turnip, the value of\n which could scarcely reach a copper, the covetous\n European had fixed as longing a glance upon the china\n bowl, and she was determined to gratify her avaricious\n desire and obtain it on the most easy terms. She told\n the squaw, with some disdain, that her man did not\n grow turnips to give away to \u201cInjuns,\u201d but she would\n sell her one. The squaw offered her four coppers, all\n the change she had about her. This the woman\n refused with contempt. She then proffered a basket;\n but that was not sufficient; nothing would satisfy her\n but the bowl. The Indian demurred; but opposition\n had only increased her craving for the turnip in a ten\u00ac\n fold degree; and, after a short mental struggle, in\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:ri:lo:us:ad:ve:nt:ur:00:fr:os:perilousadventur00fros:perilousadventur00fros_0252/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 261, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 440}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:ri:lo:us:ad:ve:nt:ur:00:fr:os:perilousadventur00fros:perilousadventur00fros_0252/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 522, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 880}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:ri:lo:us:ad:ve:nt:ur:00:fr:os:perilousadventur00fros:perilousadventur00fros_0252/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1045, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1761}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:ri:lo:us:ad:ve:nt:ur:00:fr:os:perilousadventur00fros:perilousadventur00fros_0252/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2090, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3522}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:pe:ri:lo:us:ad:ve:nt:ur:00:fr:os:perilousadventur00fros:perilousadventur00fros_0252/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/pe/ri/lo/us/ad/ve/nt/ur/00/fr/os/perilousadventur00fros/perilousadventur00fros_0252.jp2", "height": 3522, "width": 2090, "levels": 6, "size": 511390}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"252\">\n<p>\n 248\n</p>\n<p>\n PERILOUS ADVENTURES.\n</p>\n<p>\n which the animal propensity overcame the warning of\n prudence, the squaw gave up the bowl, and received\n in return one turnip!

paddling up the Rohan, I saw what appeared to be a\n half-burned log of wood lying on a sand-bank. I pad-\n died close up to it. To my astonishment, it proved to\n be a huge reptile. The old stories of dragons, griffins,\n and monsters, seemed no longer fables ; the specula\u00ac\n tions of geologists concerning, mososaurians , hyldesau-\n rians , and plesiosaurians , were no longer dreams.\n There, in all his scaly magnificence, was a real saurian,\n nearly eighteen feet long. For a while I stood gazing\n at this, to me, new fellow-citizen of the world, and\n speculating on his mental constitution. The monster\n was, or pretended to be, asleep. I wondered if he\n dreamt, and what his dreams or reveries might be\n about; possibly he was dreaming of the same old world\n with which I had associated him\u2014possibly of the fish\n who were swimming in the waters below: or, he might\n be thinking of the men and women he had swallowed\n in the course of his existence. There was a snort;\n perhaps that was occasioned by the bugles and heavy\n brass ornaments which had adorned the limbs of some\n Hindoo beauty he had eaten, and which were lying heavy\n and indigestible on his stomach. But presently the brute\n lay so still, and seemed so tranquil and placid in his\n sleep, that it was difficult to imagine him guilty of such\n atrocities. He did not appear to be disturbed by re\u00ac\n morse, or the twitchings of a guilty conscience: it may\n have been all a slander.

The harm, however, was not so great as the\n fright; and, thanks to my gallant devotion, the whole\n party were wrapped and blanketed, till they looked\n like a party of wild Indians; we stood now on com\u00ac\n paratively firm ground, and had leisure to look about\n us. Don Marzio\u2019s garden was open and spacious, being\n bounded on three sides by the half-crumbling wall of\n the town. On the fourth side was the house\u2014a good,\n substantial fabric, but now miserably shaky and rickety.\n Close by the house was the chapel of the Ursuline con\u00ac\n vent, and above that its splendid spire rose chaste and\n stainless, \u201c pointing the way to heaven.\u201d Any rational\n being might have deemed himself sufficiently removed\n from brick and mortar, and, in so far, out of harm\u2019s\n way.

This weed is spread upon the sands\n to dry, then collected into heaps resembling hay-cocks,\n and covered with matting, until the time arrives for\n loading the vessels which carry it to Niphon.
