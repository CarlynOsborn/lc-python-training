How to cherish the passion.\n</p>\n<p>\n Chapter IV.\n Misfortunes.\n</p>\n<p>\n I T was said in the last chapter that Mar}\u2019\n loved her husband, infirm and feeble as he\n was both in body and in mind. This love was\n probably the effect, quite as much as it was the\n cause, of the kindness which she showed him.\n As we are very apt to hate those whom we have\n injured, so we almost instinctively love those\n who have in any way become the objects of our\n kindness and care. If any wife, therefore, wish-\n es for the pleasure of loving her husband, or\n which is, perhaps, a better supposition, if any\n husband desires the happiness of loving his wife,\n conscious that it is a pleasure which he does\n not now enjoy, let him commence by making\n her the object of his kind attentions and care,\n and love will spring up in the heart as a con-\n sequence of the kind of action of which it is\n more commonly the cause.\n</p>\n<p>\n About a year passed away, when at length\n another great celebration took place in Paris, to\n honor the marriages of some other members of\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fm:ar:yq:ue:00:ab:bo:_0:historyofmaryque00abbo_0:historyofmaryque00abbo_0_0087/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 227, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 373}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fm:ar:yq:ue:00:ab:bo:_0:historyofmaryque00abbo_0:historyofmaryque00abbo_0_0087/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 455, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 747}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fm:ar:yq:ue:00:ab:bo:_0:historyofmaryque00abbo_0:historyofmaryque00abbo_0_0087/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 911, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1495}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fm:ar:yq:ue:00:ab:bo:_0:historyofmaryque00abbo_0:historyofmaryque00abbo_0_0087/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1822, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2991}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:yo:fm:ar:yq:ue:00:ab:bo:_0:historyofmaryque00abbo_0:historyofmaryque00abbo_0_0087/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/yo/fm/ar/yq/ue/00/ab/bo/_0/historyofmaryque00abbo_0/historyofmaryque00abbo_0_0087.jp2", "height": 2991, "width": 1822, "levels": 6, "size": 334939}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"87\">\n<p>\n 1559.]\n</p>\n<p>\n Misfortunes.\n</p>\n<p>\n 77\n</p>\n<p>\n Grand tournament.

He was on such terms\n with the nobles and lords in attendance upon\n Mary that he was not willing to go to Holy-\n rood House.

So Mary sent\n forward to Edinburgh to have a house provided\n for him.\n</p>\n<p>\n The situation of this house is seen near the city\n wall on the left, in the accompanying view of\n Edinburgh.
