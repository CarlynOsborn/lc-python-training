Thus the office\n of wood is to rear aloft that stupendous tree-top, and hold it there in\n spite of all the surgings of powerful winds upon its vast canvas of\n trunk, limbs, leaves, and fruit. Now this requires an immense\n amount of power, especially considering the great mechanical disad\u00ac\n vantage involved.

And the more solid its structure, the more\n powerful its function, as seen in comparing oak with pine, and lignum\n vitae with poplar.

And when he roars, a city trembles.\n The structures of the white and grizzly bear, of the tiger, hyena, and\n all powerful animals, and, indeed, of all weak ones, in like manner\n correspond equally with their functions. All quickness of function is\n put forth by quick-acting organs, all slowness by the slow ; and thus\n of all organs and functions throughout every phase and department of\n universal life and nature. Indeed, in and by the very nature of things\n this correspondence must exist. For how could weak organs possibly\n put forth powerful functions, or slow organs quick functions? In\n short, this correspondence between organic conditions and functions\n Is fixed and absolute\u2014is necessary, not incidental\u2014is universal, not\n partial\u2014is a relation of cause and effect, and governs every organ and\n function throughout universal life and nature.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0017/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 260, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 432}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0017/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 521, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 864}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0017/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1042, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1728}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0017/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2084, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3457}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0017/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wi/ll/us/tr/at/ed/se/00/un/se/newillustratedse00unse/newillustratedse00unse_0017.jp2", "height": 3457, "width": 2084, "levels": 6, "size": 452976}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"17\">\n<p>\n c\n</p>\n<p>\n AS AFFECTING MENTALITY. 11\n</p>\n<p>\n Gk > \\ eras, reader, you and I.

That is, given\n forms of body indicate and accompany special talents, dispositions,\n and mental proclivities; and the art in delineating phrenological\n character depends in a great degree on reading correctly the tempera\u00ac\n ment and organic conditions, and their controlling influence on char\u00ac\n acter ; for they exert, as it were, the ground-swell as to the direction\n and action of the phrenological manifestations. Thus Causality, with\n the vital temperament predominant, takes on the phase of planning,\n of common sense, of reasoning on matter, of adapting ways and\n means to ends, etc. But with the nervous or mental predominant,\n ne same sized Causality manifests itself in logic, metaphysics,\n investigation, the origination of ideas, in intellectual clearness and\n power, etc. And it requires the sharpest eye and clearest head in th\n examiner to discern the bearings and influences of these temperament\n and organic conditions on the intellectual and moral manifestations\n And the mistakes of amateurs, of connoisseurs even, arc more tem\u00ac\n peramental than phrenological.

It is usually brought\n on by eating very fast right after working very hard, and then work\u00ac\n ing very hard right after eating too fast and too much, which allows\n so little energy to go to the stomach, so that its contents ferment instead\n of being digested, which inflames the whole system, and causes the\n Yiorbid action of both the mental and physical functions. This\n inflammation creates a morbid, craving, hankering appetite, as well\n as a general irritable state of mind. But the more food is eaten the\n more it re-inflames the stomach, and thereby re-increases these morbid\n hankerings ; while denying appetite diminishes thi^nflammation and\n consequent hungering and irritability. Sometimes eating gives tem\u00ac\n porary relief right at first, before what has just been eaten fer\u00ac\n ments, but only re-increases the pain soon afterward. Starvation is\n the cure in all cases of a craving appetite, but a poor appetite needs\n pampering, by providing any dainties that may relish. Or, perhaps\n the system is pining for want of some special aliment. If so, the\n appetite will hanker after it, and should be gratified, however seem\u00ac\n ingly unnatural, provided it be an alimentary article. See Aliment-\n Iveness. Above all, avoid alcohol and tobacco in all their forms,\n and also tea and coffee, using, instead, a coffee made by browning\n wheat, rye, peas, corn, sweet potatoes, bread, etc., and prepare the\n same as Java.\n</p>\n<p>\n Next, rub and pat, or lightly pound the stomach, liver, and bowels.\n While in college, a graduate came around advertising a specific panacea\n for dyspepsia, but requiring secrecy.

And this\n deficiency grows on them. J. Q. Adams always rose before the sun to\n take his exercise, and as he became o}d took much of it in swimming,\n which he said gave the required exercise without heating his blood.\n Benton took a great amount of exercise.

Wasnington was a robust, hard-working\n farmer and soldier. Physical exercise is as indispensable to greatness as\n the intellectual organs themselves.

But where the quality is the same, whatever is largest,\n is proportionally the most powerful. And this undisputed law of\n things is equally true of the brain, and that mental power put\n forth thereby. All really great men have great heads\u2014merely smart\n ones, or those great only in certain faculties or specialties of character,\n not always. The brains of Cuvier, Byron, and Spurzheim were among\n the very heaviest ever weighed. True, Byron\u2019s hat was small, doubt\u00ac\n less because his brain was conical, and most developed in the base *,\n but its great weight establishes its great size. So does that of Bona\u00ac\n parte. Besides, he wore a very large hat\u2014one that passed clear over\n the head of Col. Lehmenouski, one of his body-guard, whose head\n measured 23i inches, so that Bonaparte\u2019s head must have measured\n nearly or quite 24 inches. Webster\u2019s head was massive, measuring\n over 24 inches, and Clay\u2019s 23\u00a3 ; and this is about Van Buren\u2019s size;\n Chief Justice Gibson\u2019s, the greatest jurist in Pennsylvania, 24^ ; and\n Hamilton\u2019s hat passed over the head of a man whose head measured\n 23|. Burke\u2019s head was immense, so was Jefferson\u2019s, while Franklin\u2019s\n hat passed over the ears of a 24-inch head. Judge McLean\u2019s head\n exceeds 23\u00a3 inches. The heads of Washington, Adams, and a thou\u00ac\n sand other celebrities, were also very large. Bright, apt, smart, liter-\n ary, knowing, even eloquent men, etc., often have only average,\n even moderate-sized heads, because endowed with thp very highest\n organic quality , yet such are more admired than commanding; more\n brilliant than powerful; more acute than profound; though they may\n show off well in an ordinary sphere, yet are not the men for great\n occasions ; nor have they that giant farce of intellect which molds and\n sways nations and ages. The phrenological law is, that size, other things\n being equal , is a measure of power ; yet these other conditions, such as\n activity, power of motive, health, physiological habits, etc., increase\n or diminish the mentality, even more than size. Quality is more\n important than quantity, but true greatness requires both cerebral\n quantity and quality.\n</p>\n<p>\n Still, those again who have very large heads, are sometimes dull,\n almost foolish, because their organic quality is low 2 . As far, then,\n as concerns Phrenology itself, this doctrine of size appertains to the\n different organs in the same head , rather than to different heads. Still\n this doctrine, that size is the measure of power, is no more a special\n doctrine of Phrenology than of every other department of nature. And\n those who object to this science on this ground are objecting to a\n known law of things. If size were the only condition of powei, theii\n eavils might be worthy of notice ; as it is, they are not.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0046/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 265, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0046/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 531, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 850}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0046/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1062, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1700}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0046/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2124, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3401}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0046/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wi/ll/us/tr/at/ed/se/00/un/se/newillustratedse00unse/newillustratedse00unse_0046.jp2", "height": 3401, "width": 2124, "levels": 6, "size": 506080}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"46\">\n<p>\n THE ORGANIC CONDITIONS\n</p>\n<p>\n iO\n</p>\n<p>\n Though tape measurements, taken around the head, from Individu\u00ac\n ality to Philoprogenitiveness or Parental Love, give some idea of the\n size of the brain, the fact that some heads are round, others long,\n ome low, and others high, so modifies these measurements that they\n lo not convey any very correct idea of the actual quantity of brain.\n Yet these measurements range somewhat as follows in adults :\n</p>\n<p>\n 7 or Very Large, 23$ inches and upward ; 6 or Large, from 22$ to\n 23$ ; 5 or Full, from 22 to 22$ ; 4 or Average, from 21\u00a3 to 22; 3 or\n Moderate, from 20$ to 21 \\ ; 2 or Small, from 20 to 20$ ; 1 Below, 20\n Female heads are half an inch to an inch below these measurements.\n</p>\n<p>\n Very Large. \u2014With quality good, are naturally great; with quality\n and activity 6 or 7, and the intellectual organs 6 or 7, are a natural\n genius, a mental giant; even without education, will surmount all\n disadvantages, learn with wonderful facility, sway mind, and become\n pre-eminent; with the organs of practical intellect and the propelling\n powers 6 or 7, will possess the first order of natural abilities ; mani\u00ac\n fest a clearness and force of intellect which will astonish the world,\n and a power of feeling which will carry all before them; and, with\n proper cultivation, become bright stars ir^ the firmament of intellec\u00ac\n tual greatness, upon which coming ages will gaze with delight and\n astonishment.

Thus, eloquence accompanies breadth combined\n with sharpness. They create that gushing sympathy, that spontaneous\n overflowing of soul, that high-wrought, impassioned ecstacy and in\u00ac\n tensity of emotion in which true eloquence consists, and transmit it\n less by words than look, gesture, and those touching, melting, soul\u00ac\n stirring, thrilling intonations which storm the citadel of the soul.\n Hence it can never be written, but must be seen, heard, and felt.\n This sharpness and breadth produce it first by giving great lungs to\n exhilarate the speaker, and send the blood frothing and foaming to\n the brain, and secondly, by conferring the utmost excitability and\n intensity of emotion, and it is in this exhilaration that real eloquence\n mainly consists. This sharp and broad form predominates in Bascom,\n whom Clay pronounced the greatest natural orator he ever heard ; in\n Chapin and Beecher, to-day confessedly our finest speakers in the pul\u00ac\n pit or the rostrum ; in Everett; in \u201c the old man eloquent/ ' indeed,\n both the Adamses; in Dr. Bethune and a host of others.

Whenever the muscles about the mouth are distinct, the char\u00ac\n acter is correspondingly positive, and the reverse.

Thus the terrific roar of the lion,\n and the soft cooing of the dove, correspond exactly with their respect-\n i e dispositions ; while the rough and powerful bellow of the bull, the\n rerce yell of the tiger, the coarse, guttural moan of the hyena, the\n swinish grunt, the sweet warblings of birds, in contrast with the\n raven\u2019s croak and owl\u2019s hoot, each corresponds perfectly with their\n respective characteristics. And this law holds equally true of man.\n Hence human intonations are as superior to brutal as human character\n exceeds animal. Accordingly, the peculiarities of all human beings\n are expressed in their voices and mode of speaking. Coarse-grained\n and powerful animal organizations have a coarse, harsh, and grating\n voice, while in exact proportion as persons become jefined and elevated\n mentally, will their tones of voice become correspondingly refined and\n perfected. We little realize how much of character we infer from this\n source. Thus, some female friends are visiting me transiently. A\n male friend, staying with me, enters the room, is seen by my female\n company, and his walks, dress, manners, etc., closely scrutinized, yet\n he says nothing, and retires, leaving a comparatively indistinct im\u00ac\n pression as to his character upon my female visitors, whereas, if he\n simply said yes or no, the mere sound of his voice communicates to\n their minds much of his character, and serves to fix distinctly upon\n their minds clear and correct general ideas of his mentality.\n</p>\n<p>\n The barbarous races use the guttural sounds more than the civilized.\n Thus Indians talk more down the throat than white men, and thus of\n all, whether lower or higher in the human scale. Those whose voi ces\n are clear and distinct have clear minds, while those who only half\n form their words, or are heard indistinctly, say by deaf persons, are\n mentally obtuse. Those who have sharp, shrill intonations have cor-\n respondii igly intense feelings, and equal sharpness both of anger and\n kindness, as is exemplified by every scold in the world ; whereas thosa\n with smooth or sweet voices have corresponding evenness and goodness\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0061/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 260, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 432}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0061/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 521, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 864}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0061/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1042, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1728}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0061/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2084, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3457}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0061/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wi/ll/us/tr/at/ed/se/00/un/se/newillustratedse00unse/newillustratedse00unse_0061.jp2", "height": 3457, "width": 2084, "levels": 6, "size": 493003}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"61\">\n<p>\n AS AFFECTING MENTALITY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 55\n</p>\n<p>\n t > t character.

Nature paints her coarse pro\u00ac\n ductions in coarse drab, but adorns all her finer, more exquisite pro\u00ac\n ductions with her most beautiful colors. Thus, highly-colored fruits\n are always highly-flavored; the birds of the highest quality are\n arrayed in the most gorgeous tints and hues.\n</p>\n<p>\n So, also, particular colors signify particular qualities. Thus, through\n out all nature black signifies power, or a great amount of character ;\n red, the ardent, loving, intense, concentrated, positive; green, imma\u00ac\n turity ; yellow, ripeness, richness, etc. Hence all black animals are\n powerful, of which bear, Morgan horse, black snake, etc., furnish\n examples. So black fruits, as blackberry, black raspberry, whortle\n berry, black Tartarian, cherry, etc., are highly-flavored and full tf\n rich juices. So, also, the dark races, as Lilian and African, are strong,\n muscular, and very .tough. All red frdRs are acid, as the strawberry ;\n but the darker they are the sweeter, as the Baldwin, gillifieur, etc. ;\n while striped apples blend the sweet with the sour. But whatever is\n growing, that is, still immature, is green; but all grasses, grains,\n fruits, etc., pass, while ripening, from the green to the yellow, and\n sometimes through the red. The red and yellow fruits are always\n delicious. Other primary colors signify other characteristics.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, since coarseness and fineness of texture indicate coarse and\n fine-grained feelings and characters 2 , and since black signifies power,\n and red ardor, therefore coarse black hair and skin signify great power\n of character of some kind, along with considerable tendency to the\n Bensua! ; yet fine black hair and skin indicate strength of character,\n along with purity and goodness. Dark-skinned nations are always\n behind the light-skinned in all the improvements of the age, as well\n as in the higher and finer manifestations of humanity. So, too, dark\u00ac\n haired persons, like Webster, sometimes called \u201cBlack Dan,\u201d possess\n great power of intellect and propensity, yet lack the finer and more\n delicate shadings of sensibility and purity.

When the moral\n and intellectual faculties greatly predominate over the animal, redness\n may not cause coarse animality, because, while it heightens the animal\n nature, it also increases the intellectual and moral, which, being the\n larger, hold them in check; but when the animal about equals or\n exceeds the moral and intellectual, this inflammation evinces a greater\n increase of animality than intellectuality and morality, ^ross sensu\u00ac\n alists and depraved sinners generally have a fiery red countenance.\n Stand aloof from them, for their passions are all on fire, ready t < ?\n ignite and explode on provocations so slight that a healthy physiology\n would scarcely notice them.

Since, therefore, some of the states of some of the internal\n organs express themselves in the face, of course every organ of the\n oody must do the same. The magnetic pole of the heart is in the\n chin. Hence, those whose circulation is vigorous, have broad and\n rather prominent chins ; while those who are small and narrow-chinned\n have feeble hearts; and thus all the other internal organs have their\n magnetic poles in various parts of the face. Now, since the beard\n covers these facial poles of the internal organs, of course it helps to\n guard heart, viscera, etc., from atmospheric changes. Obviously, it\n was not created for naught, and can not be amputated with impunity.\n It also protects the throat and chest, especially of elderly men. And\n why shave off this natural sign of masculinity ? Shaving is, to say\n the least of it, rather barbarous.\n</p>\n<p>\n So all the phrenological organs have likewise their facial poles,\n some of which are as follows : That of Acquisitiveness is on each side\n of the middle portion of the nose, at its junction with the cheek,\n causing breadth of nose in proportion to the money-grasping instincts,\n as in Jews, while a narrow nose indicates a want of the speculative\n turn. Firmness is indicated by length, prominence, and a compression\n of the upper lip. Hence, when we would exhort to determined perse\u00ac\n verance, we say, \u201cKeep a stiff ' upper lip.\u201d Self-Esteem has its pole\n externally from that of Firmness, and between the outer portion of\n the nose and the mouth, causing a fullness, as if a quid were under\n the upper Up. The affections have their poles in the edges of the lips ;\n hence the philosophy of kissing. The pole of Mirthfulness is located\n outward and upward from the outer corners of the mouth ; hence the\n drawing up of these corners in laughter. Approbativeness has its pole\n directly outward from these corners, and hence the approbative laugh\n does not turn the comers of the mouth upward, but draws them\n straight back, or outwardly. Like locations are assigned to all the\n \u00a9ther organs. That physiognomy has its science\u2014that fixed and abso\u00ac\n lute relations exist between the phrenological organs and given por\u00ac\n tions of the face\u2014is an unquestionable truth. By these and other\n means the inherent character of every living being and thing gushes\n out thiough every organ of the body, every avenue of the soul; and\n both brute and man have a character-reading faculty, to take intuitive\n sognizance of the mental operations.

Its simple yet comprehensive definition is this:\n every faculty of the mind is manifested by means of a particular por\u00ac\n tion of the brain, called its organ, the size of which, other things\n being equal, is proportionate to its power of function. For example :\n it teaches that parental love is manifested by one organ, or portion of\n the brain ; appetite by another, reason by a third, etc., which are th\u00ab\n larger in proportion as these corresponding mental powers are stronger.\n</p>\n<p>\n Are, then, particular portions of the brain larger or smaller in pro\u00ac\n portion as particular mental characteristics are stronger or weaker*\n Our short-hand mode of proof is illustrated by the following anecdote .\n A Mr. Juror once summoned to attend court, died before its sitting.\n It therefore devolved upon Mr. Simple to state to the court the reason\n of Iris non-appearance. Accordingly, when Mr. Juror\u2019s name was\n called, Mr. Simple responded, \u201c May it please the court, I have twenty-\n one reasons to offer why Mr. Juror is not in attendance. The first is,\n he is dead. The second is\u2014\u201d \u201cThat one will answer,\u201d replied the\n judge. \u201c One such reason is amply sufficient.\u201d But few of the many\n proofs that Phrenology is true will here be stated, yet those few ara\n decisive.\n</p>\n<p>\n Firstly. The Brain is the Organ of the Mind. This is assumed, be*\n cause too universally admitted to require proof.\n</p>\n<p>\n Secondly. Is the brain, then, a single organ, or is it a bundle of organs 1\n Does the whole brain think, remember, love, hate, etc., or does om\n vortion reason, another worship, another love money, etc. ? This is the\n determining point. To decide it affirmatively, establishes Phrenology;\n negatively, overthrows it. It is proved by the following facts .\n</p>\n<p>\n The Exercise of Different Functions Simultaneously. \u2014We can\n walk, think, talk, remember, love and many other things, all together\n \u2014the mind beffig, in this respect, like a stringed instrument, with\n \u2022everJu strings vibrating at a tim* instead of like a flute, which stop*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0067/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 260, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 432}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0067/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 521, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 864}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0067/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1042, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1728}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0067/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2084, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3457}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0067/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wi/ll/us/tr/at/ed/se/00/un/se/newillustratedse00unse/newillustratedse00unse_0067.jp2", "height": 3457, "width": 2084, "levels": 6, "size": 485959}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"67\">\n<p>\n AS INDICATING CHARACTER.

In short, the brain is the organ of the\n body in general, and of all its organs in particular. It sends forth\n those nerves which keep muscles, liver, bowels, and all the other bod\u00ac\n ily organs, in a high or low state of action ; and, more than all other\n causes, invites or repels disease, prolongs or shortens life, and treats\n the body as its galley-slave. Hence, healthy cerebral action is indis\u00ac\n pensable to bodily health, while a longing, pining, dissatisfied, fretful,\n or troubled state of mind is most destructive of health, and productive\n of disease; so is violence in any and all the passions; indeed, the\n state of the mind has mainly to do with that of the health. Even\n dyspepsia is more a mental than physical condition, and to be cured\n first and mainly by banishing that agitated, flashy, eager, craving\n state of mind, and securing instead a calm, quiet, let-the-world-slide\n state ; nor will any physical appliances avail much without this men\n tal restorative. Hence, too, we walk or work so much more easily\n and efficiently when we take an interest in what we do. Therefore,\n those who would be happy or talented must first and mainly keep\n their brain vigorous and healthy 8 .\n</p>\n<p>\n The brain is subdivided into two hemispheres, the right and left, by\n the falciform process of the dura mater\u2014a membrane which dips down\n one to two inches into the brain, and runs from the root of the nose\n over to the nape of the neck. This arrangement renders all the\n phrenological organs double. Thus, as there are two eyes, ears, etc.,\n so that when one is diseased, the other can carry forward the functions,\n so there are two lobes to each phrenological organ, one on each side\n The brain is divided thus : the feelings occupy that portion commonly\n covered by the hair, while the forehead is oceunied hv the intellectual\n organs. These greater divisions are subdivided into the animal brain\n located between and around the ears; the aspiring faculties, which\n occupy the crown of the head ; the moral and religious sentiments,\n which occupy its top ; the physico-perceptives, located over the eyes;\n ana the reflectives, in the upper portion of the forehead.

When on first taking a general survey of the\n phrenological organs, thinking to improve the classification somewhat,\n I adopted this rule, beginning at the lowest posterior organs in the\n head, and classifying them in accordance with the geographical position\n upward and forward in the head; and have seen since no chance to\n improve on this general principle.\n</p>\n<p>\n And what is more, all those organs are in groups whose faculties\n perform analogous functions. Thus, all the social affections are\n grouped in one portion of the head\u2014the back and lower; and their\n position is beneath and below all, just as their function is basilar, yet\n comparatively unseen.

I 1\n</p>\n<p>\n animal organs are placed at the top of the spinal column.and base o!\n the brain, or just where the nerves from the various portions of th\n body ramify on the brain. Now the olice of these organs is to carry\n forward the various bodily wants This, nature fulfills, by placing\n them right at the head of those nerves which enable them to commu\u00ac\n nicate with the body in the most perfect manner possible. So the\n organs in the top of the head, being the highest of all, fulfill the most\n exalted functions of all. By a law of structure, as we rise from the\n sole of the foot to the crown of the head, at every inch of our ascend\u00ac\n ing progress we meet with functions more and more important as their\n organs are located still higher up. Feet, located lowest of all, perform\n the menial services of all; while the organs in the lower part of tho\n body proper, higher in position, are also higher in function; for\n whereas we can live without feet, convenient though they be, yet we\n can not live long without the visceral organs. Yet longer and better\n without these than heart or lungs, which, located highest of all in the\n body proper, fulfill its most important functions, their suspension\n causing simultaneous death. But even these perform functions less\n elevated than head, which, located highest of all, fulfills the crowning\n function of all\u2014 mind : that for which the entire body, as well as uni\u00ac\n versal nature, was created. And we might therefore infer that the\n various parts of this brain would fulfill functions more important,\n according to their position upward from the base to the top. And so\n it is. For while the animal and social organs are to man what founda -\n tions are to house\u2014absolutely indispensable, yet that there is o\n higher quality or grade to man\u2019s moral faculties than animal\u2014to thos*\n which ally him to angels and to God, than to matter, to immortality\n than mortality\u2014is but the common sentiment of mankind. Is not\n the good man higher in the human scale than those of powerful ani\n mal functions ? Are not those great intellectually greater than those\n great animally? The talented above the rich? or reason above\n acquisitiveness ? Does not the philosophy involved in this position of\n the respective organs both absolutely, and as regards each other,\n evince a divine hand in its construction ?\n</p>\n<p>\n Secondly. Equally philosophical and perfect is the analysis of the\n phrenological faculties, considered both in reference toman\u2019s necessary\n life-requisitions, and as regards universal nature. Man, having a\n material department to his nature, must needs be linked to matter,\n and possessed of all its properties. He is so. Then might we not\n expect some department of his nature to inter-relate him to each prop\u00ac\n erty of matter ? These phrenological faculties furnish that relation.\n And it so is that each phrenological faculty is adapted and adapts man\n to some great element in matter and arrangement in nature, as also to\n lome special want or requisition of his beirg.

Nature must needs provide for the rearing of every individual\n child; and this she effects by creating in all parents- vegetable, ani\u00ac\n mal, human\u2014the parental sentiment, or love of their oivn young,\n particularly as infants, thus specifying what adult shall care for each\n particular child, thus absolutely providing for the rearing of all.\n Hence, whatever concerns the relations of parents to their children\n comes under this faculty; and its correct analysis unfolds whatever\n concerns parents and their children. So Constructiveness adapts man\n to his need of clothes, houses, and materials for creature comforts,\n and is adapted to nature\u2019s mechanical institutes. And each of the\n other phrenological organs has a like adaptation to some great fact or\n provision in the economy of things.\n</p>\n<p>\n And what is more yet, each phrenological faculty is found to run\n throughout all animal, all vegetable life, and to be an inherent prop\u00ac\n erty of things\u2014of nature, of matter. Thus, the phrenological faculty\n of Firmness expresses a principle which runs throughout every phase\n of nature, as seen in the stability of all her operations\u2014the perpetual\n return of her seasons, the immutability of her laws, the stability of\n her mountains, the uniformity and reliability or firmness of all her\n operations. Time, too, expresses a natural institute* For it not only\n appertains to man and all his habits\u2014the natural period of his life\n included\u2014but all plants are timed, observe each its own times and\n seasons. Each seed, fruit, animal, everything has its time. Some\n things begin and end their lives, as it were, in a day\u2014others a year;\n while the cedars of Lebanon or California live through many centuries.\n But even they have their germination, adolescence, maturity, decline,\n death, and decay. Given fruits ripen each at its given season; and\n even flowers and vegetables, transplanted from a southern to a north\u00ac\n ern latitude, keep up their periodical function in spite of opposite sea\u00ac\n sons. Has not every rock, even, its age ? that is, a time element\u2014\n appertaining to the earth, and every one of its productions and theii\n functions, as well as to every star\u2014is a universal institute of nature.\n So is Order. For are not eye, foot, heart, spine, always in their re\u00ac\n spective places?

But we\n have already discussed the influence of various temperaments upon\n the direction of the faculties.\n</p>\n<p>\n Your second observation should be to ascertain what faculties con\u00ac\n trol the character, or what is the dominant motive, desire, object, or\n passion of the person examined. In phrenological language, what\n faculties predominate in action. And it should here be observed that\n the relative size of organs does not always determine this point. Some\n faculties, though very dominant in power, can not, in their very na\u00ac\n ture, constitute a motive for action, but are simply executive func\u00ac\n tions, simply carrying into effect the dominant motives. For example,\n Combativeness rarely ever becomes a distinct motive for action. Few\n men love simply to struggle, quarrel, or fight for fun, but exercise\n Combativeness merely as a means of obtaining the things desired by\n the other dominant faculties. Few men have for their motive the\n mere exercise of will. That is, Firmness is generally exercised to\n carry into effect the designs of the other faculties; and instead of\n subjecting the other faculties to itself, simply keeps them at their\n work, whatever it may be.

The organ is usually about an inch\n and a half long.\n</p>\n<p>\n Self-Esteem (see cuts No. 66, 67) is an inch and a half back of Firm\n ness. Its upper part gives a lofty, aspiring air, magnanimity, and a\n determination to do something worthy; while half an inch farther\n back is that part of Self-Esteem which gives will, love of liberty, and\n a determination not to be ruled.\n</p>\n<p>\n Approbativeness (see cut No. 65) is located on the two sides of Self-\n Esteem, about an inch outwardly. These two lobes run backward\n toward Friendship, and upward toward Conscientiousness.\n</p>\n<p>\n The relative size of Approbativeness and Self-Esteem may be found\n thus: Race one hand, say the left, upon the forehead, to steady the\n head ; point the finger from above directly down upon Firmness; then\n move it two inches directly backward, and place the balls of the second\n and third fibers upon the points just found. When Self-Esteem is\n small, these balls will fall into the hollow which indicates its defi\u00ac\n ciency, while the ends of the fingers will strike upon the swells caused\n by Approbativeness, when this organ is large ; and the middle of the\n second joint of these fingers will apprehend the size of that lobe of\n Approbativeness which is next to it. Or thus : Stand behind the pa\u00ac\n tient, and so place your fingers upon his head that the second finger\n 6hall reach upward to the back part of Firmness; then lay the first\n and second joints of that finger evenly with the head, and place the\n first and tliiri fingers upon the head alongside of it. When Self-\n Esteem is larger than Approbativeness, the second finger will be pushed\n up farther than the others ; but when the two lobes of Approbative\u00ac\n ness are larger than Self-Esteem, the second finger will fall into a\n hollow running up and down, while tho first and third fingers will\n re\u00bb 5 t upon the two lobes of Approbativeness.

When, therefore, the middle of the\n top-head rounds out and rises above Firmness and Benevolence, Ven\u00ac\n eration is larger than either of these organs ; but when there is a swell\n at Benevolence, and a depression as you pass backward in the middle\n of the head, and another rise as you pass still farther back to Firm\n ness, Veneration is smaller than Benevolence or Firmness. The back\n of Benevolence experiences philanthropy and a desire to do good and\n remove evil on a large scale, while the fore part sympathizes and\n bestows minor gifts in the family and neighborhood. The fore part\n of Veneration gives respect for our fellow-men, while the back part\n supplicates and depends upon the Deity. The fore part of Firmness,\n working with Conscientiousness, gives moral decision ; while the lat\n ter, acting with Self-Esteem, gives physical decision, determination to\n accomplish material objects, and what we commonly call perseverance.\n</p>\n<p>\n Spirituality is located on each side of Veneration.

It runs from Benevolence downward toward\n Constructiveness. The upper part, toward Benevolence, mimics; the\n lower part, toward Constructiveness, makes after a pattern, copies, etc.\n</p>\n<p>\n We are now brought to the intellectual lobe. Take the root of the\n nose as your starting-point; the first organ met in passing upward is\n Individuality (see cuts No. 88, 89). It is between the eyebrows, and\n when large causes them to arch downward at their inner termination,\n and that part of the head to project forward.\n</p>\n<p>\n Eventuality (see cuts No. 94, 95) is three quarters of an inch up\n ward, and slightly below the center of the forehead, which in children\n is usually large, and in adults frequently small. From this center of\n the forehead. Comparison (see cuts No. 102, 103) extends upward to\n where the head begins to slope backward to form the top of the head;\n at which point, or between Benevolence and Comparison, Human Na\u00ac\n ture is located, which is usually large in the American head, as is also\n Comparison. Agreeableness is located about an inch on each side of\n the organ of Human Nature, and is usually small, so that we can\n ascertain its location by observing its deficiency. When both of these\n organs are large, the forehead will be wide and full as it rounds back\u00ac\n ward to form the top-head, or where the hair makes its appearance.\n Causality (see cuts No. 100,101) is located about an inch on each side\n of Comparison, and Mirthfulness (see cuts No. 84, 85) about three\n quarters of an inch still farther outwardly, toward Ideality. Form\n (see cuts No. 90, 91) is located internally from Individuality, just\n above and partly between the eyes, so as to set them wider apart, in\n proportion as it is the larger.\n</p>\n<p>\n Size is located just in the turn between the nose and eyebrowB, o*\n beneath the inner portion of the eyebrows; and when large, causes\n their inner portions to project outward over the inner portion of th*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0180/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 249, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 425}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0180/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 499, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 850}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0180/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 998, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1700}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0180/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1996, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3401}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ne:wi:ll:us:tr:at:ed:se:00:un:se:newillustratedse00unse:newillustratedse00unse_0180/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ne/wi/ll/us/tr/at/ed/se/00/un/se/newillustratedse00unse/newillustratedse00unse_0180.jp2", "height": 3401, "width": 1996, "levels": 6, "size": 461476}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"180\">\n<p>\n 174\n</p>\n<p>\n RULES FOR FINDING THE ORGANS,\n</p>\n<p>\n eyes, like the eaves of a house, giving to the eyes a sank\u00ae\u00ae abear\u00ac\n ance. Size can generally be observed by sight, yet if you would tesJ\n your sight by touch, proceed as follows: Place the end of your thumb\n against the bridge of the nose, with the lower part of your hand\n turned outward, and your thumb lying nearly parallel with the eye\u00ac\n brows, and the ball of your thumb will be upon Size. When this\n organ is large, there will be a fullness in this region, as if half a bean\n tfere beneath your thumb.\n</p>\n<p>\n To find Weight and Color, proceed as follows: Let the eyes be\n directed straight forward, as if looking at some object; draw an imag\u00ac\n inary line from the middle of the eye to the eyebrow; Weight is\n located internally from this line beneath the eyebrows, while Color is\n located beneath the eyebrows, just outwardly from this line. Order\n is located just externally to Color, and Time partly above and between\n Color and Order.\n</p>\n<p>\n Calculation (see cuts No. 92, 93) is located beneath the outer ter\u00ac\n mination of the eyebrows, and in proportion as they are long and\n extend backward of the eye, will this organ be more or less developed.\n Three fourths of an inch above the outer angle of the eyebrow, Tune\n is located. Spurzheim\u2019s rule for finding it is this:.Stand directly\n before the subject, and if the head widens over the outer eyebrow as\n you rise upward, Tune is large ; but if you observe a hollow at this\n point, Time is small. I have generally found this organ small in\n adults, so that it is difficult to find its relative size, but in children it\n is very easily found. Its decline is consequent on its non-exercise.\n Time and Tune join each other, while Time, Tune, and Mirthfulness\n occupy the three angles of a triangle, nearly equilateral, the shortest\n side being between Time and Tune.\n</p>\n<p>\n Language (see cuts No. 96, 97) is located partly above and partly\n behind the eyes. When it is large, it pushes the eyes downward and\n outward, and of course shoves them forward, which gives them a full\n and swollen appearance, as if they were standing partly out of their\n sockets, and causes both the upper and under eyelids to be wide and\n broad. When the eyes are sunken, and their lids narrow, Language\n will be found small.\n</p>\n<p>\n By following these rules exactly and specifically, the precise location\n of the organs can be ascertained, and a few observations upon heads\n will soon teach you the appearance of the respective organs when they\n are large, small, or midway in size. Some slight allowances are to be\n made, however, in calculating the size of the head, or the relative\n size of the organs..
