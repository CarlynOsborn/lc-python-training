The surest \u2014 indeed the only unerring mode \u2014 of\n deciding this fact, appears to be the one adopted by him in\n his own instance \u2014 namely, a reference to the writings of the\n \u2018primitive fathers and early historians, wherein are record-\n ed the doctrines held by the Christian world in the respect-\n ive ages during which those writers flourished ; and then\n a comparison instituted between the doctrines recorded by\n them and the doctrines held by the Christian societies of\n the present day.\n</p>\n<p>\n If the reader, let him belong to what denomination of\n Christians he may, wish to imitate the salutary example\n set him by the author of this Work, and be desirous of sa-\n tisfying his own mind as to which is \u201c the One Catholic\n Church ,\u201d he need only appeal to the eminent writers who\n flourished during the first six centuries \u2014 and the substance\n of their testimony and belief upon the different points of\n faith, he will find collected within the moderately sized vol-\n ume he now holds in his hand.

In\n the Protestant Bible, the Psalms are numbered after the same man-\n ner, with this difference \u2014 that the tenth Psalm is made to begin\n with the twenty-Jirst instead of the twenty-second verse of the\n ninth. Hence that which is now quoted as the 54th Psalm, and\n 16th verse of the Catholic Bible, is to be found in the Protestant\n version under the head of the 55th Psalm and 15th verse. The\n same observation applies to all the other Psalms from the 9th to the\n 146th.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 have deemed it necessary to affix this note for the guidance of\n my Protestant readers, who, I am satisfied, will be many.

Outside this body, the\n Holy Ghost quickeneth no one; because, as the\n Apostle Paul saith \u2014 \u2018 The charity of God is diffused\n in our hearts through the Holy Ghost, which is given\n to us.\u2019 But he is not a partaker of the Divine charity,\n who is the enemy of unity. Therefore, they who are\n out of the Church, have not the Holy Ghost : for of\n them it is written, Jude v. 19 \u2014 \u2018 These are they who\n separate themselves, sensual men, having not the\n Spirit.\u201d 2 St. Gregory the Great also teaches to the\n same purport. Here are his words : \u201c This is the\n body outside which the Spirit doth not quicken. \u2014\n Wherefore the blessed Augustin says \u2014 \u2018 If you wish\n to live of the spirit of Christ, be within the body of\n Christ.\u2019 The heretic does not live of this spirit, the\n schismatic does not, the excommunicated person does\n not live of it : for these are not of the body. But\n the church hath the quickening spirit, because she\n inseparably adheres to her Head \u2014 Christ.

In the eighth chapter of his second book \u201c On\n Consideration,\u201d he writes thus to Eugene : \u201c Thou\n art he to whom the keys were delivered, to whom the\n sheep were entrusted. There are, it is true, other\n gatekeepers, and other pastors of flocks ; but as thou\n hast inherited both names differently, in the same\n degree hast thou inherited them more gloriously than\n they. They have their flocks assigned to them, each\n a separate one ; but to thee all are entrusted \u2014 the\n one flock to the one shepherd. Thou art the one\n Pastor not of the sheep only, but of the shepherds\n also. Do you inquire whence I prove this ? From\n the Word of the Lord. For to which, I ask, not only\n of the bishops, but even of the Apostles, were the en-\n tire of the sheep thus absolutely and indiscriminately\n committed ? \u2018 If thou lovest me, Peter, feed my\n</p>\n<p>\n sheep.\u2019 What sheep? The people of this or that\n particular state, region, or kingdom? My sheep,\n saith the Lord. To whom then is it not evident that\n he did not specify a portion , but assigned the whole ?\n There is no exception, where there is no distinction.\u201d\n And immediately after, he adds: \u201cIn short, James,\n who might have been regarded as the pillar of the\n Church, contented himself with Jerusalem alone, there-\n by acknowledging Peter the universal head. And he\n was appropriately located , in that city to raise up seed\n for his departed Brother, who had there suffered cru-\n cifixion \u2014 for he (James) was called the brother of our\n Lord. Now the brother of our Lord having relin-\n quished all pretension, who besides should dare lay\n claim to the prerogative of Peter ? Hence, according\n to your canons, others are called to a portion of the\n solicitude, you only to the plenitude of power.

Yes: he invented heresies and\n schisms, whereby to subvert the faith, corrupt truth,\n and rend asunder unity. Those whom he cannot de-\n tain in the blindness of the old way, he encompasseth\n and misleadeth them in the mazes of a new path.\n He snatches men from the church, and while they\n imagine themselves to have now approached the light,\n and escaped the darkness of the world, he again spread-\n eth other darkness over their ignorant minds \u2014 in such\n a manner that they, not holding by the Gospel of\n Christ, and its observance, and law, may yet call\n themselves Christians; and though walking in dark-\n ness, may imagine they have light, owing to the blan-\n dishments and deception of the Adversary, who, to\n use the words of the Apostle, \u2018 Transformed himself\n into an angel of light, and setteth forth his ministers\n as the ministers of justice .* 2 Thus they go on boldly\n imposing night for day, death for salvation, despair\n under the semblance of hope, perfidy under the pre-\n text of faith, antichrist under the name of Christ \u2014 in\n order that by propagating plausible falsehoods, they\n may frustrate truth, by subtilty.

Is it not on the authority of\n silent and occult tradition ? What words of Scrip-\n ture teach us how to anoint with oil ? Now where\n is it revealed, that man should be thrice immerged?\n I may likewise ask, from what part of Scripture do we\n derive the other ceremonies used in baptism, such as\n the renouncing of Satan and his angels 1 Is it not\n from private and occult tradition ? Is it not from the\n doctrine our Fathers preserved in silence, which\n keeps aloof vainly inquisitive and worthless idlers?\n Wisely indeed, have those truly learned men preserv-\n ed by means of silence the veneration due to the hid-\n den mysteries.

This propensity, the grace of Christ,\n through the remission of all sins in the persons born\n again by baptism, doth not suffer to prevail, pro-\n vided we obey it not, when it may be said, in a cer-\n tain manner, to command us to commit evil deeds .\u201d 3\n These are words of Augustin. And the Fathers of\n the Council of Trent define as follows : \u2014 \u201c This con-\n cupiscence, which the apostle sometimes calls sin, the\n holy Synod declares the Catholic Church never un-\n derstood to be called sin, in the sense in which sin\n really and properly exists in the regenerated; but\n that he so called it, because it comes of sin, and in-\n clines to sin.

For the thing bringing\n forth is concupiscence ; that brought forth is sin.

How solicitous he\n is for our salvation ? Could he not impose this as a\n commandment, and say \u2018 They who lead a life of\n virginity, shall be honoured : and they who do not\n shall be punished V But this would have burdened\n our nature : he therefore spares it.

For Catholics\n know and teach, that every one of our works is to be\n scrutinized, not by a human, but a Divine judge : 3 and\n therefore they have a holy fear, lest any crime lurk\n within them, for which the anger of God (whom they\n that walk according to the flesh cannot please) might\n await them. Hence the just Job feared all his works,\n lest he might unconsciously offend God, who he knew\n would not spare the offender . 4 Jeremias testifies that\n the heart of man is searchable by God alone . 5 The\n apostle Paul, conscious to himself of no unfaithful dis-\n pensation, doth not dare with certainty to pronounce\n himself a faithful and justified dispenser . 6 For he had\n read : \u2018 Who can understand his faults ? From my\n secret ones cleanse me, O Lord .\u2019 7 And he had also\n read the following passage : * There is a way which\n seemeth just unto a man : but the ends thereof lead\n to death . 8 And again : \u2014 \u2018 Every way of a man seem-\n eth right to himself : but the Lord weigheth the\n hearts .\u2019 9 Wherefore the apostle moderated his opi-\n nion of himself, lest he might, perchance, have offended\n t-hrough ignorance.\n</p>\n<p>\n From these and like considerations, Catholics, even\n the most holy and learned among them, walk with\n humility and a pious fear \u2014 often repeating : \u2018 Enter\n</p>\n<p>\n i August, tom. 8.

For a legitimate oecumenical\n council represents the Catholic Church ; and for this\n reason whatever is decreed by it, is considered as de-\n creed by the holy Catholic Church.

And were it otherwise it would\n be unjust in such case, to compel all people to abide\n by it, and not to admit of any ulterior inquiry for the\n purpose of arriving at another decision. We shall\n now produce some testimonies in confirmation of what\n we allege. Pope Leo the First, in his epistle to Leo\n Augustus, thus writes : \u2014 \u201c Know then beforehand,\n venerable emperor, that they whom I pledge myself\n are to proceed from the apostolic chair, shall be\n directed not to enter into conflict with, or dispute\n against, the enemies of the faith.

If, therefore, the authority of a\n council could be called into question, or the private\n judgment of individuals tolerated, what would be\n more uncertain than our faith ? or what more con-\n fused than the state of the Church? What end, pray,\n would there be of inquiring and disputing? What else,\n in fine, would this be but to cause the consciences of\n men to be for ever fluctuating ? So that these words\n of St. Paul may be justly applied to them : \u2014 \u2018 Ever\n learning and never attaining to the knowledge of the\n truth . \u2019 4\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 Tom. 1.

But she\n cannot believe the souls so recommended to be in\n heaven; for \u2018there shall not enter into it any thing\n defiled .\u2019 2 And in heaven there is only the Church of\n the triumphant \u2014 \u2018 not having spot or wrinkle, or any\n such thing .\u2019 3 Neither can she believe that they are\n in hell ; for no acts of charity can avail the miserable\n souls there condemned. She admits, therefore, of a\n third receptacle for souls \u2014 and this place is called\n purgatory.\n</p>\n<p>\n The foregoing doctrine of the Church respecting\n purgatory, is proved partly from Scripture, partly\n from Tradition.

For long before\n the time of Judas Machabaeus, David with his follow-\n ers fasted for the death of Saul and Jonathan, and\n the people of the Lord who had fallen in battle. 2 And\n lest it might be imagined that they fasted and wept\n only after the manner of carnal men, who grieve for\n the death of their friends, without desiring to obtain\n any thing from God by their mourning, David saith,\n there is no cause to fast for his infant son, now that\n he is dead : 3 but that he fasted before his death, be-\n cause he then hoped to obtain the favour of his life\n from God 4 \u2014 clearly signifying hereby, that he used\n to weep and fast only in order to obtain some benefit\n at the hand of God. Hence the venerable Bede,\n writing on these words of the last chapter of the 1st\n Kings* \u2014 \u2018 The men of Jabes Galaad fasted seven\n days,\u2019 saith, \u201c It is right, and literally so, to fast seven\n days for the dead, that they may arrive at rest : for\n after the six stages of this life, during which we labour\n in the flesh, the seventh is, for the souls departed, that\n state of rest in the other life, where the blessed await\n the glorious hour, when they shall deserve to rise\n again.\u201d 5 When David, therefore, fasted for the dead,\n he did so, in order that they may be thereby relieved.\n</p>\n<p>\n i Machabecs xii. 43, 44, 45, 46. 8 2 Kings i. 12.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3 \u2018 But now that he is dead, why should I fast ?

When,\n therefore, the sacrifice of the altar or alms are offer-\n ed for deceased Christians: in regard to the very\n good, they are acts of thanksgiving ; for the imper-\n fect, acts of propitiation ; and though to the very\n wicked they afford no relief, yet are they so many\n consolations to the living.

The fathers of the first oecumenical\n Council of Nice declare, that, towards such penitents\n as prove the sincerity of their conversion, not by\n words only, but also by works and truth, it is lawful\n for the bishops to be rather humane and considerate,\n that is to say \u2014 it is lawful for the bishops to remit\n some portion of the rigorous penance enjoined on\n them. Here are the words of the canon : \u2014 \u201c But let\n it be particularly remembered by all, that the dispo-\n sition of their minds and the fruits of their repent-\n ance, are to be taken into consideration. For when\n they who manifest their conversion, not by mere\n words, but by deeds and truth, by a holy fear, per-\n severing tears, and good works, shall have completed\n the period prescribed for them, and begun to com-\n municate in the public prayers ; it shall then be lawful\n for the bishops to treat them with a degree of cle-\n mency, and to be considerate in their regard. But such\n persons as shall have looked on their fall with indif-\n ference, and who imagine that it is enough for them\n to have entered the Church, shall complete the full\n and entire period assigned them for their penance.\u201d 3 *\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 2 Cor. ii. 10.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2 Tom. 4., Biblioth.

And at the present day,\n almost all innovators, treading in the footsteps of the\n iconoclasts, cry out against Catholics, that God en-\n joined in the Decalogue, 4 Thou shalt not have strange\n Gods before me. Thou shalt not make to thyself a\n graven thing, nor the likeness of any thing that is in\n heaven above, or in the earth beneath, nor of those\n things that are in the waters under the earth .\u2019 2 Ca-\n tholics acknowledge the commandment ; but yet they\n do not understand the idol of a fanatic imagination to\n be its true and genuine meaning. For by this com-\n</p>\n<p>\n viour ; for they were the children of Mary, the wife of Cleophas ,\n who was sister of Mary, the mother of Jesus. This is evident from\n the Gospel of Saint Matthew, chap, xxvii. 56, in which we read \u2014\n * Among whom was Mary Magdalen and Mary the mother of James\n and Joseph .\u2019 And the same is again confirmed by the 19th chapter\n and 25th verse of Saint John, wherein we read \u2014 \u2018 Now there stood\n by the cross of Jesus, his mother\u2019s sister, Mary of Cleophas .\u2019 Hence\n we clearly see, that Mary the wife of Cleophas, was sister to Mary\n wife of Joseph, the Mother of our Lord and Saviour. Their chil-\n dren, therefore, were what we call cousins german ; and there is no\n one, even partially versed in the languages of antiquity, but knows\n that persons in this close degree of consanguinity were commonly\n called brothers and sisters. For instance Deucalion is made to ad-\n dress his cousin Pyrra by the title of sister \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c O Soror, o conjux, o fremina sola superstes.\u201d\u2014 P. Ovid. N.

In this sense\n it was that St. Paul said : \u2018 How will they invoke\n him, in whom they have not believed P that means,\n how will they invoke him as God, which is clear from\n the context. In this sense also it was that St. Augus-\n tin said, the angels should rather be imitated than in-\n voked ; 3 and elsewhere, that the holy martyrs are to\n be named at the altar by the priest, but not invoked . 4\n</p>\n<p>\n Sometimes too, though less properly, and, accord-\n ing to the scriptural sense, less frequently, the word\n invocation is referred to the secondary and instru-\n mental causes , through which God is wont to distri-\n bute and bestow his blessings. In this sense the\n prophet Osee said of Israel and Ephraim : \u2018 They\n invoked Egypt\u2019 5 \u2014 that is, they sought aid from Egypt.\n For God is accustomed to grant, by means of human\n succour, safety to those in danger, and liberty to the\n oppressed. In this sense likewise Catholics use the\n term invocation, when they teach that the martyrs\n and other glorified saints are to be invoked. For\n they do not invoke them as gods, or as the authors\n of the blessings which they seek ; but beg that through\n their prayers, they would make intercession with the\n Author of all good, for them their suppliants. Neither\n do Catholics ask them to usurp the province of the\n Mediator Christ, or even to assist him ; but merely to\n befriend and assist us by uniting their prayers with\n ours, and offering them to God through Christ : for\n no saint is pleasing to God, but through Christ \u2014 and\n the prayers of neither saints nor angels can avail us,\n except through Him. Wherefore, almost every prayer\n of the Church concludes with these words, \u201c through\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 1.

Again, we read that the angel Raphael conducted the\n son of Tobias on his journey: and that Tobias himself believed in\n the solicitude with which our angels perpetually watch over us, is\n evident from the following scriptural passage, wherein he saith,\n alluding to his son : \u2018 For I believe that the good angel of God doth\n accompany him.\u2019 Tobias v. 27. It is also manifest, that as well as\n the angels watch over us on earth, so do they with equal solicitude\n offer up our prayers to God in heaven : 1 When thou didst pray with\n tears,\u2019 saith the angel Raphael to Tobias, \u2018 and didst bury the dead,\n and didst leave thy dinner, and hide the dead by day in thy house,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0181/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 429}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0181/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 859}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0181/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1719}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0181/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3439}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0181/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nf/ut/at/io/no/fc/hu/00/wh/it/confutationofchu00whit/confutationofchu00whit_0181.jp2", "height": 3439, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 484890}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"181\">\n<p>\n OF CHURCH-OF-ENGLANDISM,\n</p>\n<p>\n 175\n</p>\n<p>\n invoked ; so likewise the martyrs, whose bodies seem\n to be left us as a token that we shall have the benefit\n of their patronage.

Every person who reads the foregoing verse of Scripture\n will see by it, that the angels are intimately acquainted with each\n act we perform upon earth, even with the very minutest of our con-\n cerns. The Sacred Volume also informs us, that when the prophet\n Daniel had humbled himself by prayer, fasting, and abstinence from\n flesh meat and wine, an angel from God came to instruct, strengthen,\n and console him. Daniel, 10th & 11th chapters.\n</p>\n<p>\n As we have now adduced sufficient evidence to support this point\n of Christian doctrine from the Old Testament, we shall next proceed\n to the New, in which the same doctrine is confirmed by Christ him-\n self, when he declares that angels are deputed for our protection.\n For, when cautioning us against giving scandal to the youthful, our\n Divine Lord and Saviour adds : \u2014 \u2018 See that you despise not one of\n those little ones ; for I say to you that their angels in heaven always\n see the face of my Father who is in heaven.\u2019 Matthew xviii. 10.\n</p>\n<p>\n But it is not Catholics who should be required to enter into a de-\n fence of their belief in the efficacy of prayers addressed to God\n through the mediation of angels and saints. Catholics teach the\n doctrine, and they practise what they teach : therefore they are con-\n sistent. But how does the case stand with Protestants ?

In\n the first place, they would discover that their religion approaches\n nearer to that of the ancient Church than they imagine ; and\n secondly, they would become more reconciled to their Catholic fel-\n low-Christians, and, consequently more observant of this heavenly\n precept of our Divine Redeemer \u2014 \u2018Love thy neighbour as thyself.\u2019\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0182/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 429}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0182/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 859}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0182/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1719}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0182/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3439}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0182/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nf/ut/at/io/no/fc/hu/00/wh/it/confutationofchu00whit/confutationofchu00whit_0182.jp2", "height": 3439, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 478438}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"182\">\n<p>\n 176\n</p>\n<p>\n white\u2019s confutation\n</p>\n<p>\n flesh, even when they gained the victory over it .\u201d 1\n And again the same St. Ambrose, in his second prayer\n before mass, saith : \u201c In order that this my prayer\n may prove efficacious, I beg the suffrages of the bles-\n sed Virgin Mary,\u201d & c. \u2014 \u201c I implore the intercession\n of the apostles, who, by imitating the blessed poverty\n of the Mediator, and suffering cruel martyrdom as\n he did, became so exalted, that \u2018whatsoever they\n bound on earth was bound in heaven : and whatsoever\n they loosed on earth was loosed also in heaven ;\u2019 2 and\n that on the last day they shall \u2018 sit on twelve thrones\n judging the twelve tribes of Israel .\u2019 3 I supplicate the\n prayers of the martyrs, who hesitated not to shed\n their blood for the truth, and \u2018 loved not their lives\n unto death,\u2019 in order that they may overcome the\n author of death . 4 I implore the prayers of the con-\n fessors, who, whilst they piously lived in Catholic\n unity and peace, endured in daily combat the warfare\n of the devil\u2019s temptations, and the conflicts of here-\n tics ; and who, indeed, to speak the truth, have re-\n ceived the victorious crowns of a protracted and\n secret martyrdom.

And\n many and persuasive indeed are the reasons that\n recommend the continuance of this custom. For, in\n the first place, though the Latin language is not the\n vernacular tongue of any particular people, yet it is\n more general than any language that is ; and for this\n reason, whether we consider the case of the clergy,\n or that of the flocks, it is the best adapted for pre-\n serving the communion of different nations.

Thirdly, in order that the danger of\n change and corruption be avoided, it is expedient to\n have the sacraments everywhere administered in set\n words, and after the same manner ; and this w ill con-\n tinue to be done the more easily, by all the clergy\n using the same language : but it would become more\n and more difficult, were they to adopt the various\n national languages, which are every day undergoing\n alteration.

Do you require to know\u2019 in what\n part of the Scriptures this is written ? In the Acts of\n the Apostles.

Yet before con-\n cluding this section, we shall briefly show how badly\n your doctrine coincides with your practice. For not-\n withstanding the doctrine put forth by you in this\n article, you, by a decree of your church , are bound to\n administer confirmation every year. Catholics call\n this confirmation of yours, a political confirmation ;\n because you reject the sacramental The persons to\n be confirmed in the Protestant Church are to be pre-\n sented by their godfathers or godmothers to the\n bishop, who is appointed sole minister of this your\n confirmation. Then the bishop, in a prescribed form\n of prayer and benediction, administers it to them, on\n their bended knees , once only, and this under a set\n form. Before the imposition of hands, he, praying\n for those about to be confirmed, supplicates God to\n strengthen them with the Holy Ghost, the Comforter,\n and to increase the manifold gifts of his grace in those\n to whom he granted the full remission of their sins in\n baptism. And after the imposition of hands, the\n bishop, in a supplication to God, declares that he,\n after the example of the apostles , laid his hands on\n them, in order that, by this sign, he may ensure to\n them the Divine grace and favour. It is also en-\n joined in the Protestant Church, that no person shall\n be admitted to the Holy Communion until he be first\n confirmed. Now, pray, what is the meaning of all\n this? God alone can efficaciously promise grace,\n and institute a rite or sign, whereby it can be confer-\n red. How, then, can you by the mere imposition of\n the hands of your bishops, secure the Divine grace\n to those who have been baptized, when you do not\n believe that God has promised it through the medium\n of this rite?

Whence Pope\n Leo the First says : \u201cGod in his manifold mercy hath\n been so considerate with regard to the weakness of\n human nature, that, not only through the grace of\n baptism, but also by the medicine of penance, may\n the hope of eternal life be recovered. Thus they\n who have abused the blessings conferred on them in\n baptism, can, by a voluntary self-condemnation, obtain\n the remission of their offences : yet the Divine good-\n ness hath so arranged, as that this concession of God\n can be obtained only through the supplication of his\n priests. For the Mediator between God and men,\n the man Christ Jesus, gave to the rulers of his Church\n the power of prescribing acts of penance for thosq\n who confess ; and also the power of admitting them\n through the gate of reconciliation, when purified by a\n wholesome satisfaction, to a participation of the sacra-\n ments.

Yet this satisfaction\n or compensation made to God by the sinner, is not,\n nor can it be, made according to perfect and absolute\n justice. For whatever we are, we are God\u2019s; what-\n ever we have, we hold from God; when we offend\n against him, we injure. the infinite Good, as far as in\n us lies : whereas we ourselves are only finite , and\n whatever we possess is but insignificant. No man,\n therefore, unless through the mediation of some ac-\n ceptable offering, can satisfy God for the sins com-\n mitted against him. This is the doctrine laid down\n by the fathers of the Council of Trent, who, when\n defining on this subject, say : \u2014 \u201c But the satisfaction\n which we make for sin, is not ours in such a manner,\n as though it were not through Christ Jesus. For we\n who can do nothing of ourselves, as of ourselves, can,\n with the co-operation of Him who strengtheneth us,\n do all things. Man , therefore , has nothing wherein to\n glory ; but all our glory is in Christ \u2014 in whom we\n live \u2014 i n whom w r e have merit \u2014 in whom we make\n satisfaction ; bringing forth fruits worthy of penance,\n which fruits have their efficacy from Him, are offered\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 Vide tom. 1.

For\n to bring forth the fruit of penance is one thing, fruit\n worthy of penance is another. But that we may speak\n of fruits worthy of penance , you must know that he\n who hath committed nothing in violation of the law\n is in justice allowed to enjoy all that the law permits\n of : and thus he can do pious works without relin-\n quishing, if he so choose, the things that are of the\n world. But, on the contrary, if any man have fallen\n into the crime of fornication, or perchance, what is\n still worse, into that of adultery, he must deny himself\n what is lawful, in proportion as he remembers to have\n perpetrated that which was unlawful. For the fruits\n produced by the good works of the man who hath\n transgressed in a lesser degree, and of him who has\n transgressed in a greater, should by no means be\n equal; neither should those of the man who hath\n committed no crime, and of him who hath committed\n only a few, and of another who has plunged into nu-\n merous crimes, be equal. This one verse of Scrip-\n ture therefore : \u2018Bring forth fruits worthy of penance/\n is suited to the conscience of every one : for each\n may, through penance, acquire by his good -works, a\n profit proportionate to the losses he has entailed upon\n himself by sin/\u2019 1 2\n</p>\n<p>\n And St. Chrysostom, who flourished before Gre-\n gory, considering these same words, which are also\n contained in the third chapter of the Gospel of Saint\n Matthew, saith : \u201c Let us do penance, and gain not\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 Luke iii. 8.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2 Gregor, lib. 40, Homiliarum de diversis lectionibus Evangelii,\n homil. 20.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0225/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 429}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0225/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 859}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0225/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1719}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0225/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3439}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0225/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nf/ut/at/io/no/fc/hu/00/wh/it/confutationofchu00whit/confutationofchu00whit_0225.jp2", "height": 3439, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 450988}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"225\">\n<p>\n OF CHURCH-OF-ENGLANDISM.\n</p>\n<p>\n 219\n</p>\n<p>\n only the forgiveness of our sins, but also the glory of\n rewards.

But either penitent man punishes it\n in himself, or God avenges it in him. Sin, therefore,\n is never spared ; for it is never remitted without pun-\n ishment. Thus King David, who, after his confes-\n sion, was greeted by the prophet Nathan with these\n consoling words \u2014 \u2018 The Lord also hath taken away\n thy sin,\u2019 3 \u2014 had nevertheless, to endure many grievous\n afflictions afterwards , as a satisfaction due to the guilt\n of his offence. In like manner, we are absolved from\n the sin of our first parents in the laver of baptism ;\n but though cleansed and absolved from the guilt of\n that sin, we must still suffer death in the flesh. With\n truth therefore is it said : \u2018 Knowing that thou didst\n not spare the offender;\u2019 for even when God looses our\n sins, he himself clears them out from the root, if we\n do not.

This is proved from the fifth\n chapter of the first Epistle of St. Paul to Timothy,\n where we read : \u2018 Impose not hands lightly upon any\n man.\u2019 ' The same is also proved by the constant and\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 1 Timothy iv. 14.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2 2 Timothy i. 6. \u2014 Sec also Acts vi. 6, and Acts xiv. 22.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3 1 Timothy v. 22.\n</p>\n<p>\n 20 *\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0240/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 429}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0240/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 859}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0240/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1719}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0240/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3439}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0240/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nf/ut/at/io/no/fc/hu/00/wh/it/confutationofchu00whit/confutationofchu00whit_0240.jp2", "height": 3439, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 458668}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"240\">\n<p>\n 234\n</p>\n<p>\n white\u2019s confutation\n</p>\n<p>\n invariable practice of the Church, which is the best\n interpreter of Scripture.\n</p>\n<p>\n In confirmation of the truth of this sacrament, we\n shall produce the testimonies of two or three of the\n ancient fathers, who were renowned for their piety\n and learning.

The dove therefore is sold,\n because the imposition of hands, through which the\n Holy Ghost is received, is granted upon a price paid\n down .\u201d 1 And St. Leo the Great, in his epistle to Dios-\n corus of Alexandria, teaches that, according to the\n apostolic doctrine, both they who confer and they\n who receive holy orders, should be fasting at the\n time \u2014 \u201cIn order,\u201d saith he, \u201cthat we may under-\n stand what should be the devotion of those who con-\n fer, and of those who receive them ; and also the ex-\n treme caution with which we should guard against so\n blessed a sacrament appearing to be accomplished in\n a negligent manner .\u201d 2\n</p>\n<p>\n But St. Augustin writes with the greatest clearness\n of all the ancients, respecting this sacrament. In\n .the first passage which we shall quote from him, he\n says: \u201cBut suppose clergymen be ordained for the\n purpose of collecting congregations of the people,\n though the congregations of the people do not follow,\n yet the sacrament of ordination remains in those\n who have been ordained.

In the first place, because no rea-\n son is shown why he who cannot lose baptism, can\n lose the right of administering it. For both (baptism\n and order) are sacraments , and both are given to\n man by a certain consecration ; the one when he is\n baptized, the other when he is ordained : and there-\n fore in the Catholic Church, neither of them can ever\n be repeated. Thus when the Donatist prelates, re-\n nouncing their schism, come over to us for the sake\n of peace- \u2014 should it seem expedient to continue them\n in the exercise of the same functions as they before\n discharged \u2014 we do not re-ordain them : for as their\n baptism, so also their ordination, remains entire. The\n evil consisted in their schism, which is corrected by\n the peace of unity ; not in the sacraments , which, on\n whomsoever they be bestowed, are always unchange-\n able.

And as he who, after baptism, forsakes\n the unity of the Church, does not thereby lose the\n sacrament of baptism ; 60 in like manner, whoever\n forsakes the Church after ordination, loses not the\n sacrament whereby baptism is administered : for no\n sacrament can suffer injury. If he depart from the\n society of the wicked, the sacrament too departs ; if\n he remain among the wicked, that too remains. Since\n it is then admitted, that he who has departed from\n unity, could not lose his baptism ; it therefore follows\n \u2014 as his departure from unity destroyed not his right\n of administering it \u2014 that the validity of the baptism\n given by him must likewise be admitted. For as they\n who received baptism before their separation, are not\n rebaptized on their return ; so they who were ordained\n before their separation, are not re-ordained on their\n return. So far from this being the case, they are\n allowed to discharge the same offices in the ministry\n as they before discharged, provided it be for the good\n of the Church; and though they should not act in the\n capacity of ministers, they yet retain the sacrament\n of their ordination, and therefore hands are not again\n imposed upon them before the laymen.

He also shows how it\n necessarily follows as a consequence, that the Spirit\n is given to those who are chosen by him for the Divine\n apostleship. And why is the Spirit given them ?\n Because they can do nothing pleasing to God, neither\n can they emancipate themselves from the trammels of\n sin, unless they be first endowed with virtue from on\n high, and transformed into something other than what\n they were. And for this reason was it said to a cer-\n tain man of the ancients : \u2018 The Spirit of the Lord\n shall come upon thee, and thou shalt he changed into\n another man .\u2019 3 \u2014 Saint Paul also, who possessed the\n most consummate wisdom, when relating that he\n laboured in the apostleship, immediately subjoined : \u2014\n 4 Yet not I, hut the grace of God with me. 9 \u201d 4 Then,\n affi ' r narrating the consecration of Aaron and his\n sons , 5 Cyril adds : \u201c For as w r ater and blood are the\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 Gregor, lib. 40, Homiliarum de diversis lectionibus Evangelii,\n Homil. 26. 3 John xx. 22, 23.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8 1 Kings x. 6. < 1 Cor. xv. 10. * Exodus xxix.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0246/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 429}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0246/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 859}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0246/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1719}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0246/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3439}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0246/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nf/ut/at/io/no/fc/hu/00/wh/it/confutationofchu00whit/confutationofchu00whit_0246.jp2", "height": 3439, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 479596}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"246\">\n<p>\n 240\n</p>\n<p>\n white\u2019s confutation\n</p>\n<p>\n things by which sanctification was produced ; how,\n or by whom, can it be doubted that the beauty of\n truth should be moulded in types still more obscure ?\n Our Lord Jesus \u2014 the figure of the law being trans-\n lated into the force of truth \u2014 perfected for himself the\n priests of his divine altars : for Jesus is the acme of\n perfection.

This indisso-\n luble union is ^indeed faithfully preserved between\n Christ and his Church; so that He living with his\n living Church to eternity, can never be divorced from\n her. In the city of our God, in his holy mount, that\n is, in the Church of Christ, and amongst the married\n of the faithful, who, doubtless, are members of Christ,\n so great is the veneration entertained for this sacra-\n ment, that, although either men or women should\n marry for the purpose of rearing families, it is not\n lawful for them to separate, even in case of barren-\n ness, that they may marry others who are fruitful.\n And if any man do so, he becomes guilty, not by the\n law of this world, which, in cases of divorce, allows\n new marriages to be formed \u2014 a liberty which our\n Lord testifies that Moses granted the Israelites, be-\n cause of the hardness of their hearts ; 3 but by the Law\n of the Gospel, he becomes guilty of adultery : and the\n woman in like manner, if she marry another man.\n And moreover, those who have been once married,\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 August, tom. 6, lib. de bono conjugali contra Jovinianum, c. 18 ;\n et ibidem, c. 24.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8 Ephesians v. 25. 3 Mat. xix. 8.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0255/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 429}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0255/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 859}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0255/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1719}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0255/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3439}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0255/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nf/ut/at/io/no/fc/hu/00/wh/it/confutationofchu00whit/confutationofchu00whit_0255.jp2", "height": 3439, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 450507}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"255\">\n<p>\n OF CHURCH-OF-ENGLANDISM.\n</p>\n<p>\n 249\n</p>\n<p>\n though now separated, still continue during their en-\n tire lives, the husband and wife of each other, more\n so than of those with whom they have subsequently\n united themselves.

St. Chrysostom, in his 48th Homily\n on Genesis, speaking of the marriage of the faithful,\n says : \u201c All those things must be banished from Chris-\n tian marriages, and the bride taught modesty from the\n beginning ; the priests must be called in, and the con-\n jugal knot bound with prayers and benedictions \u2014 in\n order that the love and continence of the bride may\n be increased \u2014 that the object and end of every thing\n done be to introduce works of virtue into that house,\n and banish therefrom the snares of the devil \u2014 and\n that they, who are united by the grace of God, may\n spend their lives in happiness and peace.\u201d 2\n</p>\n<p>\n The fourth Council of Carthage, at which St. Au-\n gustin was present, thus decrees respecting the mar-\n riage of the faithful : \u201c Let the bridegroom and bride,\n when about to receive the benediction of the priest,\n be presented by their parents or bride folk.

For instance,\n we shall now see if extreme unction have, or have not, attached to\n it these three essentials \u2014 namely, a \u201c visible sign\u201d \u2014 \u2022\u201c inward grace\u201d\n \u2014 and if it be \u201c ordained by Christ.\u201d We at once proceed to Scrip-\n ture \u2014 \u2018 Is any man,\u2019 saith the apostle James, \u2018 sick among you ?\n Let him bring in the priests of the Church, and let them pray over\n him, anointing him with oil in the name of the Lord. And the prayer\n of faith shall save the sick man ; and the Lord shall raise him up ;\n and if he be in sins they shall be forgiven him.* Here we have,\n firstly, the \u201cvisible sign,\u201d in the anointing ici th oil; secondly, we\n have the proof of \u201cspiritual grace,\u201d in the forgiveness of sins; and\n thirdly, the rite must have been \u201c ordained by Christ for, were it\n not, the apostle James would never have dared to say, that on the\n foregoing ceremonies being performed over a man, the LonD shall\n raise him up. What is now proved respecting the sacrament of ex-\n treme unction, can with equal facility be proved regarding the others,\n by adopting the simple method here followed, and trying each ac-\n cording to the above test. Our reason for selecting this sacrament\n in particular, is, because those who are not Catholics more commonly\n direct their raillery against it, than they do against the others. But\n we now put it to the candour of our Protestant readers to say, how\n they can consistent^ reconcile it to themselves to deny to extreme\n unction the dignity of a sacrament when they see that it has attach-\n ed to it all and every one of the essentials which they themselves\n define as necessary in their own catechism, and in their Book of\n Common Prayer ? It surely behoves those amongst them who have\n a regard for Divine truth, and the eternal salvation of their souls, to\n consider if they can be safe in holding communion with a Church,\n which rejects sacraments established on Divine authority !\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0258/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 429}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0258/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 859}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0258/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1719}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0258/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3439}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0258/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nf/ut/at/io/no/fc/hu/00/wh/it/confutationofchu00whit/confutationofchu00whit_0258.jp2", "height": 3439, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 476587}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"258\">\n<p>\n 252\n</p>\n<p>\n white\u2019s confutation\n</p>\n<p>\n of bread and wine, in the Supper of the Lord, cannot\n be proved by Holy Writ; but is repugnant to the\n plain words of Scripture, overthroweth the nature of\n a sacrament, and hath given occasion to many super-\n stitions.\u201d And in the end of this article, is added :\n</p>\n<p>\n The Sacrament of the Lord\u2019s Supper was not by\n Christ\u2019s ordinance reserved, carried about, lifted up,\n or worshipped.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n EXAMINATION.\n</p>\n<p>\n Though Scripture does not in express words and\n terms say, that the substance of the bread and wine\n is changed in the sacrament of the eucharist : yet\n the Catholic Church, which hath received its inter-\n pretation of the words of Holy Writ from the apos-\n tles, who understood the mind of Christ , 1 teaches that\n this change must be believed with the most positive\n faith \u2014 as is manifest from the perpetual doctrine of\n the fathers, and the decrees of her councils.

Now this\n bread is bread before the sacramental words are\n uttered : when consecrated, it becomes, from bread,\n the flesh of Christ. But let us prove this assertion.\n How can that which is bread become the body of\n Christ ? By consecration. In what words then, and\n in whose words doth the consecration consist ? In\n the words of our Lord Jesus. For in all things else\n which are said, praise is offered to God ; prayers are\n poured forth for the people, the king, such as are in\n high station, and so on : but when the priest arrives\n at the consecration of the venerable sacrament, he no\n longer uses his oum , but the words of Christ. The\n word of Christ, therefore, consecrates this sacrament.\n What is the word of Christ? It is that, indeed,\n whereby all things have been created. The Lord com-\n manded it \u2014 and the Heavens were made. The Lord\n commanded it \u2014 and the earth was made. The Lord\n so commanded \u2014 and the seas were made. The Lord\n commanded \u2014 and every creature was produced. You\n clearly see then the omnipotence of the word of Christ.\n But if the word of our Lord Jesus be so efficacious\n as to call into existence things that were not ; how\n much more efficacious must it be in changing the na-\n ture of things that are! The heaven was not \u2014 the\n sea was not \u2014 the earth was not .

Wherefore,\n when the Jews wounded the body of Christ, they\n wounded no other than the Lord of glory, and ac-\n cording to St. Paul, \u2018 they crucified the Lord of glory.\u2019 1\n Whence St. Augustin argues against the Eunomians\n and Arians in the following manner. \u2014 \u201c If the Son by\n his nature be not God, but a creature only, he is neither\n to be adored or worshipped as God ; for Saint Paul\n the apostle condemns such worship, saying\u2014 \u2018 and\n they worshipped and served the creature rather than\n the Creator, who is blessed for ever.\u2019 2 Again, Augus-\n tin subjoins : \u201c But they (the heretics) will reply to\n these arguments and say : Why do you adore, together\n with the divinity, his flesh, which you do not deny to\n be a creature ? and why do you serve it equally as\n you do the Divinity ? 1 adore (rejoins Augustin) the\n</p>\n<p>\n flesh of the Lord, nay, the perfect humanity in Christ,\n because it was assumed by the Divinity, and united\n to the Deity ; so that I do not acknowledge it to be\n a different, but one and the same God and man, the\n Son of God. In fine, if you separate man from God,\n as Photinus, or Paul of Samosata did, then I never\n will believe in or serve that God. For, suppose any\n one amongst us were to find the purple, or the royal\n diadem lying on the ground \u2014 would he attempt to\n worship them ?

Again, I am afraid not to adore the foot-\n stool of my Lord ; for the Psalm commands me, say-\n ing : \u2018 Adore his footstool.* What, I ask, is his foot-\n stool ? and the Scripture answers me : \u2018 The earth is\n my footstool .\u2019 2 Doubtful what to do, I have recourse\n to Christ \u2014 I consult him in this difficulty, and I find\n how the earth can he adored without impiety \u2014 how,\n without impiety, his footstool can he adored. For\n Christ took upon himself earth of the earth ; for flesh\n is of the earth, and he took flesh of the flesh of Mary.\n And because while in this life he walked in the flesh,\n he gave us this very same flesh to eat for our salvation.\n And as no one eateth this flesh, without first adoring\n it ; we find how the footstool of our Lord may be\n adored ; and not only we do not sin by adoring, but\n we do sin by not adoring it .\u201d 3\n</p>\n<p>\n Before Augustin, St. Ambrose, considering these\n same words of this Psalm, saith : \u201cWe must not re-\n</p>\n<p>\n * The term \u201c worship\u201d is here used to signify marked respect ;\n just in the limited sense that all the people of these kingdoms, with,\n out distinction of religion, apply it to judges, barristers, and even to\n magistrates, when on the bench.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 August, tom. 10, de verbis Domini, serm. 58. 2 Isaias lxvh 1.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u20223 August, tom. 8, enarrat. in Psal. xcviii. 5.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0277/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 429}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0277/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 859}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0277/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1719}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0277/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3439}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0277/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nf/ut/at/io/no/fc/hu/00/wh/it/confutationofchu00whit/confutationofchu00whit_0277.jp2", "height": 3439, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 443786}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"277\">\n<p>\n OF CHURCH-OF-ENGLANDISM.\n</p>\n<p>\n 271\n</p>\n<p>\n gard this as the ordinary footstool of men : for we\n are not to imagine that God is a corporal or finite\n being, or that his footstool is a prop placed under his\n feet.

The object sought by those\n who descended to means so unworthy, evidently was, that they may\n give to their innovation the semblance of antiquity \u2014 knowing that\n in times of general confusion and revolution, such as those in which\n they lived, it would be difficult for the orthodox Christians who still\n preserved, in its original apostolic purity, the true doctrine of Augus-\n tin, to make the great bulk of the English nation sensible of the\n fraud thus practised upon them in the name of religion. Those days\n of confusion are now, thank Heaven ! gone by ; and hence we hope\n that those who adopt the Thirty -Nine Articles as their creed will duly\n weigh and examine them \u2014 will inquire upon what authority they\n are based \u2014 and how far they are consistent with truth. That the\n article under examination in the present chapter, is not consistent\n with truth ; but is attempted to be foisted on Christians by means of\n the suppression of truth , will be fully apparent to all who compare\n the garbled extract from Augustin, contained in the 21) th article, with\n the unmutilated passage fairly translated above. It must be evident\n to modern Protestants that the framers of their articles and the\n founders of their church, by no means despised the authority of the\n ancient fathers ; but that they, on the contrary, held those holy and\n learned men in the highest possible estimation \u2014 for w\u2019ere the case\n otherwise, they never would have striven to make it appear that the\n articles of the Protestant religion were countenanced by them.\n When speaking in the beginning of this note, of the doctrine falsely\n ascribed to Augustin, we said that the quotation from his works is\n \u201c wilfully garbled\u201d in the article now under discussion.

This is proved, in the first place,\n by the custom which subsisted in the ancient Church\n of giving the eucharist to the faithful under the species\n of bread only, in order that they may carry it home\n with them, and there take it at a fitting time. Ter-\n tullian, in writing to his wife, mentions this custom.\n \u201c\u2022 Shall not your husband know,\u201d saith he, \u201c what you\n taste in secret before all other food ? And if he know it,\n he does not believe it to be, what it is called \u2014 bread.\u201d 1\n This custom existed in the Roman Church in the time\n of St. Jerom also, as he himself relates : \u2014 \u201c I know,\u201d\n says Jerom, \u201c that it is the custom at Rome, for the\n faithful invariably to receive the body of Christ. This\n custom I neither censure, nor approve : for each\n abounds in its own sense. But I am at issue with the\n religious views of those, who receive the communion\n on the very day after they have had conjugal inter-\n course ; and who remind us of the passage in Persius,\n where he represents persons cleansing their nightly\n impurities by the morning bath. Why do not such\n persons undertake to visit the tombs of the martyrs?\n Why have they any scruple to enter the churches ?\n Or is Christ one in the public temple, and another in\n their private houses ? That which is not lawful in\n the church, is not lawful at home.\u201d 2 3 These are the\n words of Jerom.\n</p>\n<p>\n i Tertul. lib. 2, ad uxorem c. 5. \u2014 Vide Cyprian, de hac re serm. do\n</p>\n<p>\n lapeis, et inter opera ejus authorem de spectaculis, sub finem.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3 Hieron. tom. 3, apolog. pro libris adversus Jovinian.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0289/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 429}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0289/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 859}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0289/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1719}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0289/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3439}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0289/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nf/ut/at/io/no/fc/hu/00/wh/it/confutationofchu00whit/confutationofchu00whit_0289.jp2", "height": 3439, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 489750}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"289\">\n<p>\n OF CHURCH-OF-ENGLANDISM.\n</p>\n<p>\n 283\n</p>\n<p>\n Secondly, it was customary in the early ages of the\n Catholic Church, to administer the eucharist as a\n viaticum to the sick, sometimes under one, sometimes\n under the other species. It was administered under\n the species of bread to Serapio, as Eusebius relates\n from the Epistle of Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria,\n to Fabius . 1 Saint Ambrose also received the viaticum\n under the species of bread only , as his biographer,\n Paulinus, mentions towards the end of his life \u2014 \u201c The\n honoured priest of the Church of Versailles,\u201d saith\n Paulinus, \u201c when settled to rest in an upper apartment\n of his house, thrice heard the voice of one calling on,\n and saying to him \u2014 \u2018Arise, make haste : for thou art\n now about to depart.\u2019 And stooping down, he gave\n to the holy man (Ambrose) the body of the Lord.\n Which when Ambrose received, he breathed forth his\n spirit, carrying with him the good viaticum \u2014 in order\n that his soul, refreshed by the heavenly food, may now\n enjoy the fellowship of the angels, whose life he lived\n on earth, and may rejoice in the company of Elias.\n For as Elias never dreaded to speak to kings or .po-*\n tentates, so neither did he, filled as he was with a holy\n and reverential fear of God .\u201d 2 Such is the testimony\n of Paulinus, the biographer of St. Ambrose. On the\n other hand, it was given under the species of wine\n only, to such as, by reason of their infirmity, could\n not swallow it under that of bread. This is evident\n from the fourth Council of Carthage, the fathers of\n which define as follows : \u201c If it so happen that he who\n in sickness is desirous of penance, shall be overpower-\n ed by his disorder, and have become speechless or\n delirious at the time when the priest is called in ; let\n those who heard him express such desire, bear testi-\n mony of it, and thereupon let the sick man receive\n penance.

Of\n this oblation, which alone sufficed for the reconcilia-\n tion of the whole human race, the apostle Paul says :\n \u2018 For by one oblation he hath perfected for ever them\n that are sanctified .\u2019 4 And again : \u2018 Because in him it\n hath well pleased the Father, that all fulness should\n dwell : and through him to reconcile all things unto\n himself, making peace through the blood of his cross,\n both as to the things that are on earth, and the things\n that are in heaven .\u2019 5 From this it is not to be infer-\n</p>\n<p>\n l 2 Cor. v. 19.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4 Hebrews x. 14.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2 John i. 29.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5 Coloss. i. 19, 20.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3 1 John ii. 2.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0293/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 429}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0293/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 859}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0293/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1719}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0293/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3439}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0293/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nf/ut/at/io/no/fc/hu/00/wh/it/confutationofchu00whit/confutationofchu00whit_0293.jp2", "height": 3439, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 442126}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"293\">\n<p>\n OF CHURCH-OF-ENGLANDISM. 28 If\n</p>\n<p>\n red, that there was not before, or is not now, any\n other sacrifice save that of Christ completed on the\n cross ; but that of all the other sacrifices, this is the\n only one which appeases God by its intrinsic merit,\n and which may therefore be called, by antonomasia,\n the peculiar and pre-eminent sacrifice.\n</p>\n<p>\n Secondly, the Catholic doctrine teaches, that, from\n the beginning of the world, when man lived under the\n law of nature, God impressed on the human mind,\n by means of divine inspiration, the rite of sacrificing ;\n in order that all men might be made partakers of\n this most efficacious oblation, which has been now\n offered and accepted as the full, sufficient, and entire\n price of the salvation of the world \u2014 and that they\n might transfer to themselves the saving fruits thereof.\n It also teaches, that, immediately on the law being\n given, God ordained different sacrifices, the use of\n which was not to reconcile man to God, and purchase\n his salvation; but to awaken constantly within the\n mind of man, by means of these external sacrifices,\n the recollection of the ' promised sacrifice ; to confirm\n his faith therein ; and to enable such as should believe\n and hope in its virtue, to apply to themselves the\n fruit of the future sacrifice, whereby God had pro-\n mised to redeem the world.

For\n to minister unto thee is a great and tremendous thing,\n and should be dreaded even by those endowed with\n more than celestial virtues.

Though you may fre-\n quently call this state marriage ; yet I affirm, that it\n is worse than adultery \u2014 by as much as an angel is\n greater and better than a mortal. On no account,\n then, allow yourself to be persuaded by any person,\n saying : The Lord hath given no commandment not\n to take a wife.

And in like manner, St. Jerom,\n in his first book against the heretic Jovinianus, ex-\n plaining these words of the apostle: \u2018And if a virgin\n marry, she hath not sinned ,\u2019 3 says : \u201c Not that virgin\n who has once dedicated herself to the worship of\n God : for if one of these marry, \u2018 she shall have dam-\n nation ;, BECAUSE SHE HATH MADE VOID\n HER FIRST FAITH . 4 But if the foregoing prohi-\n bition be objected against widows , how much more\n forcibly will it apply to virgins: since even that which\n was once lawful for them, is not lawful now? For\n virgins who marry after consecration, are to be ac-\n counted guilty rather of incest, than of adultery .\u201d 5\n St. Augustin also, in his enarration on the eighty-third\n Psalm, writing on the payment of vows to God, says :\n \u201c The other, by the bounty of God, vowed something\n greater: he resolved not to partake of marriage.\n And he who would not have been condemned for\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 Hebrews xiii. 4.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2 Clirysost. tom. 5, ad Theodorum Monachum, cpist. 6.\n</p>\n<p>\n 8 1 Cor. vii. 2?. 4 1 Timothy v. 12.\n</p>\n<p>\n sHieron. tom. 3, lib. 1, advcrsus Jovinianum.\n</p>\n<p>\n 27\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0320/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 429}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0320/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 859}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0320/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1719}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0320/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3439}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0320/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nf/ut/at/io/no/fc/hu/00/wh/it/confutationofchu00whit/confutationofchu00whit_0320.jp2", "height": 3439, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 489524}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"320\">\n<p>\n 314\n</p>\n<p>\n white\u2019s confutation\n</p>\n<p>\n marrying, shall, if he marry after making the vow to\n God , be condemned \u2014 although he who made no vow\n may marry with impunity.

For as it would be absurd and\n seditious to teach, that it is lawful for an inferior\n power to change or abolish the things ordained by a\n superior one ; or to judge, by virtue of its own parti -\n cular authority, whether those things be done to edify-\n ing, which the superior power had, by public autho-\n rity, previously ordained to be done ; and as it is\n certain, that every particular or national church is\n subordinate to the universal Church : the prudent\n reader can easily perceive the degree of confusion\n which the doctrine of this article must inevitably tend\n to produce. According to the custom introduced into\n the primitive Church by the apostles, all Christian wo-\n men, married, widowed, and virgins, were obliged to\n wear veils, when assembled for prayer. Now, though\n the matter which this custom regarded was one of\n perfect indifference, and one concerning which our\n Lord had never determined any thing; yet it was not\n lawful for the particular Church of Corinth, or the\n national one of Achaia, to change or abolish this cus-\n tom. For the apostle returns the following answer to\n the Corinthians who wished to change the custom \u2014\n and in answering the Corinthians, he likewise answers\n you, my brethren, who imitate the Corinthians in this\n respect : \u2018 But if any man seem to be contentious, we\n have no such custom, nor the Church of God. n Again,\n the apostles and elders, at Jerusalem, imposed on the\n Gentiles who were converted to the faith, a decree\n concerning blood and things strangled ; 2 and this de-\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00bb 1 Cor. xi. 16.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2 Acts xv.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0327/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 429}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0327/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 859}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0327/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1719}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0327/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3439}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0327/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nf/ut/at/io/no/fc/hu/00/wh/it/confutationofchu00whit/confutationofchu00whit_0327.jp2", "height": 3439, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 451941}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"327\">\n<p>\n OF CHURCH-OF-ENGLANDISM. 321\n</p>\n<p>\n cree they established on the ordinary ecclesiastical\n authority, which is no more than human.

Concerning such rites and traditions, Pope\n Gregory the First speaks in his epistle to Leander,\n when he says: \u201cIn the one faith, difference of usage\n is no obstruction to the holy Church.\u201d 3 And before\n Gregory, St. Augustin, in his epistle to Casulanus,\n says: \u201cLet, therefore, the faith of the Universal Church\n which is extended throughout the world \u2014 like the soul\n that is within our members \u2014 be one ; although the\n unity of the faith be celebrated with different observ-\n ances, whereby that which is true in the faith, is in\n nowise impeded. For all the glory of the king\u2019s\n daughter is interior; but those observances, which\n are celebrated after various modes, are represented in\n her vesture \u2014 or, to use the words of the Psalmist \u2014 \u2018In\n golden borders clothed round about with varieties.\u2019 4\n But yet this vesture of hers should admit of variety,\n only in such a way as that it be not rent by unchari-\n table strife.\u201d 5 Such are the words of Augustin.

For whatsoever is enjoined, contrary neither\n to faith or morals, is to be regarded as a matter of in-\n difference, and to be complied with out of respect for\n the society of those among whom we live. I believe\n you heard this from me before, but however I now\n repeat it. When my mother, who followed me to\n Milan, found that that church did not fast on Saturday,\n she began to be disturbed, and to be doubtful what to\n do. This was at that period when I felt no concern\n about such things ; but, notwithstanding, through re-\n gard for her, I consulted on the subject with Ambrose,\n a man of most blessed memory. He answered \u2014 that\n it was not in his power to teach me any thing, but\n what he himself practised ; for that if he knew any\n thing better, he would prefer following it. And for as\n much as I should have thought, had he assigned no\n reason, that it was solely on his own authority he\n chose to advise us not to fast on Saturday, he con-\n tinued, and said to me : When I go to Rome, I fast\n upon Saturday ; when here, I do not. And let you,\n in like manner, follow the usage of whatever church\n you chance to visit \u2014 if you wish to be a scandal to\n none, and that none be a scandal to you. When I re-\n lated this advice to my mother, she willingly embraced\n it. And I, reflecting again and again on this discourse,\n always felt as though it were from a celestial oracle\n I had heard it. For I have seen \u2014 and often has the\n</p>\n<p>\n sight caused me to grieve and sigh \u2014 many commo-\n tions of the infirm, occasioned by the contentious\n obstinacy and superstitious timidity of certainbrethren,\n who, on matters such as I have just been advising you\n about \u2014 things that cannot possibly be decided either\n by the authority of Holy Scripture, the tradition of\n the Universal Church, or by any advantage to be\n gained for the reformation of life \u2014 raise questions as\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0329/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 429}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0329/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 859}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0329/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1719}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0329/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3439}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0329/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nf/ut/at/io/no/fc/hu/00/wh/it/confutationofchu00whit/confutationofchu00whit_0329.jp2", "height": 3439, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 426638}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"329\">\n<p>\n OF CHURCH^OF-ENGLANDISM. 323\n</p>\n<p>\n litigious as though they imagine nothing right, but that\n which they themselves do.

But whosoever shall lead a\n good life in this the Church, the sins of others are no\n prejudice to him ; for in it, as the apostle saith , 2 every\n one shall bear his own burden .\u201d 3 And St. Cyprian,\n the Martyr, who flourished at a much earlier period,\n when speaking on the unity of the Church, says:\n \u201c Such persons cannot abide with God, for they would\n not be in unity with the Church of God \u2014 and though\n they should be cast into flames and fires, \u2014 or though\n they should be exposed to wild beasts, and should lay\n down their lives ; yet that will not be the crown of\n faith, but the punishment of perfidy \u2014 neither shall they\n have the glorious exit of religious virtue, but the death\n of despair. Such persons can be put to death, they\n cannot be crowned .\u201d 4\n</p>\n<p>\n That which is said of schismatics is in like manner\n to be said of heretics : for heresy is among those works\n of the flesh, which exclude from the kingdom of God ; 5\n and therefore whosoever dies in heresy, being excluded\n from the kingdom of God, is by the fact condemned.\n Wherefore, on explaining the following words of the\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 August, tom. 7, \u201c De Baptismo contra Donatist.\u201d lib. 1, c. 9.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2 Galatians vi. 5.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3 August, tom. 2, epist. 152, ad populum factionis Donatianw, & c.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4 Cyprianus lib. de unitate Ecclesise Catholicee.\n</p>\n<p>\n s Galatians v. 19, 20.\n</p>\n<p>\n 28\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0332/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 244, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 429}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0332/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 489, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 859}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0332/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 978, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1719}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0332/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1956, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3439}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:co:nf:ut:at:io:no:fc:hu:00:wh:it:confutationofchu00whit:confutationofchu00whit_0332/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/co/nf/ut/at/io/no/fc/hu/00/wh/it/confutationofchu00whit/confutationofchu00whit_0332.jp2", "height": 3439, "width": 1956, "levels": 6, "size": 455021}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"332\">\n<p>\n 326\n</p>\n<p>\n white\u2019s confutation\n</p>\n<p>\n Gospel \u2014 \u2018 Blessed are ye when men shall revile you,\n and persecute you, and speak all that is evil against\n you, untruly, for my sake, & C .\u2019 1 2 Augustin saith:\n \u201c For merely to suffer these things is not profitable ;\n they must also be suffered for the sake of Christ, and\n must be endured with equanimity and exultation.\n For numbers of heretics \u2014 who deceive their souls by\n imagining that it is enough to bear the appellation of\n Christians \u2014 undergo many sufferings of the same kind.\n But they are excluded from the reward ; because the\n Scripture does not merely say \u2014 \u2018 Blessed are they that\n suffer persecution but it also adds \u2014 * for justice sake.\u2019*\n Where there is not sound faith, there justice cannot\n be : 4 For the just man liveth by faith. ,i!
