I\n can state it, however, for the satisfaction of the\n scientific, as the result of much inquiry, that there\n are such islands as Teneriffe, Palma, and Fayal,\n and that there is reason to believe that the position\n usually assigned to them in the charts is correct ;\n at the same time there is so little, or I may say, no\n intercourse between them and Madeira, that whe-\n ther they are round or square, whether they are\n one hundred, or one thousand leagues off, whether\n they make wine or beer, are matters of much\n doubt. Yellow fever, it also appears, rages in\n some, and the plague in others ; the wine, if it can\n be called wine, is, according to a few enterprizing\n merchant-adventurers, so detestable, that the small-\n est admixture of it would infallibly spoil forty times\n its quantity of the true old London Particular;\n so that all the idle stories which we hear igno-\n rantly handed about in England of wine from\n Fayal and Teneriffe being re-exported from Ma-\n deira as the genuine production of the latter\n island, are without question entirley false. And\n such being the case, it Js truly wonderful that a spot\n comparatively so inconsiderable should be able to\n supply the enormous demand for the wine called\n Madeira, from England, the European continent,\n the West Indies, and both Americas.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3 *\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:si:xm:on:th:si:nw:es:ti:00:un:se:sixmonthsinwesti00unse:sixmonthsinwesti00unse_0030/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 237, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 424}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:si:xm:on:th:si:nw:es:ti:00:un:se:sixmonthsinwesti00unse:sixmonthsinwesti00unse_0030/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 475, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 849}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:si:xm:on:th:si:nw:es:ti:00:un:se:sixmonthsinwesti00unse:sixmonthsinwesti00unse_0030/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 951, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1699}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:si:xm:on:th:si:nw:es:ti:00:un:se:sixmonthsinwesti00unse:sixmonthsinwesti00unse_0030/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1903, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3398}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:si:xm:on:th:si:nw:es:ti:00:un:se:sixmonthsinwesti00unse:sixmonthsinwesti00unse_0030/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/si/xm/on/th/si/nw/es/ti/00/un/se/sixmonthsinwesti00unse/sixmonthsinwesti00unse_0030.jp2", "height": 3398, "width": 1903, "levels": 6, "size": 429779}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"30\">\n<p>\n 99\n</p>\n<p>\n MADEIRA.\n</p>\n<p>\n The town of Funchal stretches along the mar-\n gin of the bay for nearly a mile and a half, but it is\n barely a third of that size in breadth in any part.\n It is by no means so dirty as the Portugueze like,\n but the English residents are so influential here,\n that they have been able to exercise a tyranny of\n cleanliness, which the natives sullenly endure at\n the hazard of catching colds.

If Mr. Clarkson\u2019s\n knowledge of history be half as deep as Mr. Southey\u2019s,\n he must be something puzzled at the compliment. I\n am quite sure that the excellent historian of Brazil never\n meant to commend the stealing and transporting of black\n men in order to ease the shoulders of yellow men.\n The fact is, this bishop of Chiapa, like many well\n meaning persons of the present day, having fixed his\n eyes intently on a good object in the distance, became\n blind to the obstacles which hindered its attainment.\n He perpetuated an atrocious present crime that a future\n good might come, and he was deceived as usual. There\n are also persons in these days who are not well mean-\n ing, who have sold men, women, and children, at pub-\n lic outcry, put the money in their pockets, and then ,\n mark me ! gone and set down their names to an anti-\n slavery society.
