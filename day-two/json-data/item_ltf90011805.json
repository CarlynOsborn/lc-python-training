It has been thought\n proper by them to put it in print, \u2014 first, that each of their fellow-members\n in the church may have the opportunity of a more careful acquaintance\n with its contents than would otherwise be practicable; secondty, to gratify\n the desires of numerous friends who, having known somewhat of the mat-\n ters therein referred to, have solicited copies; and lastly, to afford to any\n others who may wish to learn of \u201cthe wonderful works of God,\u201d which are\n transpiring in this \u201clatter day,\u201d the benefit of the experience and conclu-\n sions which are therein set forth. This letter has been prepared neces-\n sarily with much haste, and in such fragments of time as could be secluded\n in the midst of most pressing and laborious occupations; but imperfect as it\n is, the offering is gratefully laid upon the altar of Progressive Truth. The\n result is left in the hands of Him who has sometimes seen fit to choose \u201cthe\n foolish things of the world to confound the wise, and the weak things of\n the world to confound the mighty.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n A few words of explanation will show the occasion and .appositeness of\n the title \u2014 \u201cThe \u2018Ministry of Angels\u2019 Realized\u201d \u2014 which has been pre-\n fixed to this Letter. A short time previous to the writing of it, the Rev.\n Mr. Pond, Pastor of the Edwards Church, in the ordinary course of his\n duties, and without any suggestion from the writers, (but very much to\n their surprise as well as gratification,) preached a discourse from Hebrews\n 1 : 14, in which he presented in a very clear and interesting light the com-\n mon doctrine of the \u201c Ministry of Angels,\u201d as theoretically held by the\n Christian world \u2014 going so far, even, as to advocate with much force the\n belief that our departed friends become, in the spirit-world, angels or mes-\n sengers of God, to minister unto us. With him, however, it appeared to\n be a merely speculative conviction, resting chiefly on evidences furnished\n to the world eighteen hundred years ago. The authors of this letter simply\n claim to have realized, in most joyful experience, the truth of what was\n thus taught, in theory, by their \u201cregularly constituted\u201d and orthodox spirit-\n ual guide.\n</p>\n<p>\n Boston, May, 1853.\n</p>\n<p>\n [Entered according to Act of Congress, in the year 1853, by A.

There seemed to be nothing absurd or im-\n possible in the supposition, since it was the almost universal sen-\n timent of Christendom, not only that angels are \u2018ministering\n spirits\u2019 to human beings in the body, (Ileb. 1 : 14,) \u2014 having\n \u2018charge over them in all their ways,\u2019 (Ps. 91 : 11, 12,) and \u2018en-\n camping round about to deliver them,\u2019 (Ps. 34: 7,) \u2014 but that\n our departed friends, also, having become \u2018os the angels,\u2019 (Matt.\n 22 : 30) are among that \u2018great cloud of witnesses\u2019 who \u2018encom-\n pass us about,\u2019 (Iieb. 12 : 1,) watching over us with undiminished\n love, and endeavoring to lead us upward toward the realms of\n purity and bliss. That they should wish to make us sensible of\n their presence and love, that we might more fully realize the\n benefits of their ministration, seemed extremely probable; and\n that the means of gratifying this wish might be granted them in\n this latter day, when advancement seems to be the order of God\u2019s\n providence in every department of human interest, appeared by\n no means impossible.\n</p>\n<p>\n The results, however, of this investigation, at that time, were\n (for reasons then not apparent, but which have since been\n made plain to us) far from satisfactory. Though we witnessed\n some striking evidences of invisible intelligent agency, there was\n nothing by which this agency could be positively identified ; and\n the conclusion seemed most in accordance with our previous opin-\n ions, that if any agency beyond that of human beings was con-\n cerned, it was that of evil and seducing spirits.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0007/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 450}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0007/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 528, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 901}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0007/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1056, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1803}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0007/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2113, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3606}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0007/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/mi/ni/st/ry/of/an/ge/ls/00/ne/wt/_0/ministryofangels00newt_0/ministryofangels00newt_0_0007.jp2", "height": 3606, "width": 2113, "levels": 6, "size": 548770}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"7\">\n<p>\n 5\n</p>\n<p>\n Some months subsequently to this, we were led again to at-\n tempt the investigation, under circumstances more favorable to\n arriving at a satisfactory conclusion. At this time, public atten-\n tion was beginning to be turned somewhat extensively to the\n subject, and many were yielding credence to these marvels, as the\n precursors or attestations of a new dispensation of divine truth.\n We felt that if these things were from the Spirit of Evil, that fact\n could and ought to be ascertained and exposed ; and that it did\n not become those who profess to have had their minds enlightened,\n and their spiritual perceptions quickened to discern between truth\n and error, between evil and good, to sit by with folded hands, and\n not attempt to rescue from this new \u2018snare of the devil,\u2019 those\n who were being \u2018taken captive by him at his will.\u2019 It must first,\n however, be proved to be a snare of the devil, lest, in our efforts at\n rescue, we should \u2018be found even to fight against God\u2019 (Acts 5: 39.)\n This proof could not be obtained without a candid personal exami-\n nation, and such we resolved to make, as the only basis of a rational\n conviction.\n</p>\n<p>\n The results of the first interview were of the most surprising,\n yea, astounding character. An intelligence, claiming to be the\n spirit of a venerated parent, who had long since passed within the\n veil, manifested its presence, and addressed to one of us a come\n munication glowing with parental affection, and breathing the\n very spirit of the upper realm. This was accompanied by the\n statement of a number of facts pertaining to his earthly life, non t e\n of which, we were fully satisfied, could have been known to any\n person bodily present, except the inquirer, and some of them un-\n known even to him. Although the investigation bad been ap-\n proached with minds on the alert, and perceptions sharpened, to\n detect collusion, imposture, deception, or diabolism in any of its\n forms, no trace of them could be perceived ; all was conducted\n with evident frankness and candor, on the part of those con-\n cerned ; and no solution of the mystery was then arrived at, and\n no adequate one has since been offered, which does not recognize\n the agency of invisible intelligent beings. A trumpet-blast from\n the clouds could scarcely have been more startling to our pre-\n judices and unbelief, than was that message from the hidden\n world. For days it seemed as if a voice from heaven was indeed\n ringing in our astonished ears, and never were our souls more\n deeply stirred than by that solemn exhortation to \u2018lead a life of\n holiness and sobriety on earth,\u2019 that we might receive the \u2018crown\n of glory\u2019 and the Divine benediction when we should enter upoti\n the life to come.\n</p>\n<p>\n As may be well supposed, the interest awakened by this occur-\n rence, was sufficient to lead to a further investigation. But a\n truth so novel and startling could not at once be received, however\n demonstrative and convincing the evidence on which it rested.

Or were there both good and\n evil? Some people were ready to decide at once, that, if spirits,\n they must be evil, and therefore wholly to be avoided. But this\n was a condemnation without a trial.

We can mention only the general features of\n our experience, with the results to w r hich we have been led.\n</p>\n<p>\n First, that there are false and wicked spirits seeking in this\n way to communicate with men, is as fully evident as that there\n are false and wicked men in this life, \u2014 and they are to be judged\n in the same manner, by their words and works. The fact that the\n human body may be possessed and controlled by evil spirits, is, to\n us, no longer a fact of history, but of observation ; and more than\n once have we been called upon to \u2018cast out devils* in the name of\n Christ.\u2019 Through the earlier part of our experience, it was a matter\n of perplexing inquiry, how we might be secure from the annoy-\n ances and deceptions practiced upon us by these ill-disposed intel-\n ligences. At length, the whole question was solved in a manner\n so plain, that we wondered it should have caused us any difficulty.\n We were taught that the great law of attraction, or affinity, holds\n as universally in the spiritual as in the physical world \u2014 that we\n draw around us spirits like ourselves, those whose motives, feel-\n ings, aspirations, are most in affinity with our own ; and that if\n we would attract only the good, the pure, the exalted, we must\n ourselves be pure-minded, sincere, devout ; and the channel of\n communication must also be pure and elevated.\n</p>\n<p>\n The operations of this law are evident, to an imperfect degree,\n in the world about us. Who has any fear that the debased and\n polluted denizens of the haunts of vice, will intrude themselves\n into our meetings of devotion, and endeavor to instill the poison\n of their irreligion into our hearts, under the guise of religious dis-\n course? They have no affinity there, \u2014 neither are the good at-\n tracted to the assemblies of evil men, except for offices of benevo-\n lence and pity. We are not then left, as some suppose, wholly at\n the mercy of the evil-disposed ; but if we \u2018resist the devil, he will\n flee from us.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n The following advice, from our invisible attendants, shows the\n tenor of their instructions on this point ; judge for yourselves,\n whether it is from above or beneath :\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMeet with us often. Come with confidence. Come with ele-\n vated thoughts and purity of purpose. Come with the Lord\u2019s\n Prayer engraved upon your minds and hearts. Come with con-\n trite and devout hearts, and God\u2019s declaration, that \u2018where two\n or three are met together in my name, there will I be in the midst\n of them,\u2019 shall not be void ; but you then shall hear glad tidings\n from on high through God\u2019s messengers.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Acting in accordance witli instructions so proper, and secluding\n ourselves from all associations tending to an opposite direction, we\n have, found no further reason to suspect that this method of com-\n municating with the invisible world has been wholly usurped by\n the great adversary of souls.

(Matt 12 : 28.)\n</p>\n<p>\n But we have as yet said nothing as to the manner in which\n these celestial visitants have manifested their presence, and com-\n municated with us. At first, the only token of unseen agency was\n the production of slight sounds, apparently upon material objects ;\n and these sounds, by indicating letters of the alphabet as pointed\n out, were made to spell words and sentences. This has given\n rise to the term \u2018spirit-rappings.\u2019 In a short time, movements\n were made of physical substances, as articles of furniture, & c.,\n often with great force. The presence of some person, believed to\n possess a certain peculiarity of physical constitution, was found to\n be necessary for the production of these manifestations. Of\n course, w T e satisfied ourselves at the outset that these things were\n produced by no human contrivance, but by some power operat-\n ing without visible means; and, that it was an intelligent power,\n and not a blind force, was demonstrated by its intelligent results.\n How spirits can thus operate upon matter, we will undertake to\n explain when he who questions their ability to do so, will explain\n how the angels rolled away the stone from the door of the sepul-\n cher, (Matt. 28 : 2,) or how his own mind can act upon the mat-\n ter of his physical body, or how the Omnipotent Mind can operate\n upon, set in motion and control the universe of matter. That it\n is done, in all these cases, is sufficient proof that it can be done.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0015/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 450}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0015/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 528, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 901}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0015/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1056, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1803}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0015/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2113, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3606}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0015/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/mi/ni/st/ry/of/an/ge/ls/00/ne/wt/_0/ministryofangels00newt_0/ministryofangels00newt_0_0015.jp2", "height": 3606, "width": 2113, "levels": 6, "size": 566202}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"15\">\n<p>\n 13\n</p>\n<p>\n As these manifestations have advanced, however, higher and\n more perfect methods of communication have been employed.\n The hand of some person who possesses the proper physical and\n mental requisites, is taken under control by an intelligent power\n foreign to the possessor of it, and thus writing is performed \u2014\n thoughts, sentiments and statements flow from the pen \u2014 of which\n the person acting as instrument often has no knowledge or concep-\n tion till his astonished eyes behold them traced on the paper before\n him.

He concludes that the movement \u2018is essentially\n one with the demonic possession whereof the Gospels often speak \u2014\n that is, the control and use of the bodily organs of the living, by\n human spirits, incorrectly termed \u201cdevils\u201d in our English version\n of the scriptures.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n This position, remarkable as it is, is unquestionably correct\n as regards a great portion of the manifestations which have been\n made in various parts of the country ; and you will not fail to\n notice certain important results which must inevitably follow from\n it \u2014 namely, that the spirits of the departed, bad as well as good,\n instead of being shut away in some distant corner of the universe,\n as many imagine, are still about us, capable of influencing us, and\n communicating with us ; while the \u2018devils,\u2019 which have been so\n long the bugbears of the Christian world, and especially of those\n who have undertaken to investigate this subject, are suddenly\n transformed, as by a touch of Ithuriel\u2019s spear, into their true\n characters, namely, the departed spirits of men , some of whom are\n ignorant and wicked!

We are all aware that this age of enlightenment, of\n science, of civilization, of the useful arts, and of the compara-\n tive reign of reason, benevolence and justice, has been reached on-\n ly by successive steps from the lowest conditions of barbarism,\n ignorance and savageness. And even those individuals who in\n their times have stood in some respects preeminent over their fel-\n lows, are now seen to have been on the whole greatly below our\n highest idea of human perfection.\n</p>\n<p>\n This law has been recognized and acted upon in all the commu-\n nications and revelations of Himself which God has made to the\n race. The rays which shone upon man during the patriarchal\n dispensation were few and feeble ; yet they were all he was able\n to bear, or that his condition demanded. Under Moses the light\n was measurably increased, and also through successive stages, un-\n der the ministration of seers and prophets, until Christ came,\n and \u2018brought life and immortality to light,\u2019 pouring a flood of\n heavenly truth on the expanding intellect and heart of man.\n But even Christ had \u2018many things\u2019 to teach which the most\n enlightened of his day \u2018could not bear,\u2019 and he left them to be\n communicated by \u2018the Spirit of Truth,\u2019 who should \u2018abide for-\n ever\u2019 with his followers, guiding them \u2018into all truth,\u2019 as they\n should be prepared to receive it, and showing them \u2018things to\n come.\u2019 (John 16: 12, 13. 14: 16, 17.)

And instead of there be-\n ing here and there one or two in an age specially raised up and\n qualified, as seers, prophets, apostles or teachers, to be the me-\n diums through whom God\u2019s truth can be communicated to the\n race, all shall become so advanced that they will have no need of\n such mediumship on the part of others. \u2018After those days, saith\n the Lord, I will put my law in their inward parts, and write it in\n their hearts ; and will be their God, and they shall be my people.\n And they shall no more teach every man his neighbor, and every\n man his brother, saying, Know the Lord ; for they shall all know\n me, from the least of them unto the greatest of them, saith the\n Lord.\u2019 (Jer. 31: 33, 34.

The l eviV that we see in man arises only from\n an imperfect or incomplete development of what was made to be,\n and what will be when completed, \u2018 good .\u2019 (Gen. 3: 31.)\n</p>\n<p>\n That this process of development is confined to the earthly\n life, we see no reason to believe ; but that, on the contrary, after\n the spirit has thrown off the earthly tenement, and arisen to a\n higher form of life, it must still continue to advance, seems to be\n inevitable from the law of its constitution. Moreover, we find no\n evidence, either from reason, from scripture rightly interpreted, or\n from the nature of God, that He will withhold from any soul, in\n the future life, the means or opportunity of advancement. The\n Father\u2019s paternal heart yearns after the repentant, returning prodi-\n gal, whenever and wherever he repents and returns; and the time\n shall come when all His wandering offspring \u2014 \u2018for we are also His\n offspring\u2019 (Acts 17 : 28) \u2014 shall come back to the Father\u2019s House\n \u2014 when \u2018all things shall be subdued unto Him .... that\n God may be all in all.\u2019 (1 Cor. 15 : 28.)\n</p>\n<p>\n A most important step in individual progression, and one which\n is taken alike by all, is the casting off of the earthly body, and the\n arising to a higher form of life in the spirit-world. This is the\n scripture doctrine of the \u2018 resurrection \u2019 \u2014 it was clearly taught by\n Christ and his apostles \u2014 but it has become strangely misunder-\n stood and perverted throughout all Christendom. That doctrine\n is, \u2014 not that ages hence, when these physical bodies shall have\n crumbled into dust, and been resolved into their original elements,\n and entered into the constituents of other human bodies, perhaps\n many times over, \u2014 that then our spirits, which have been all this\n time we know not where, shall be brought back and re-united\n with the gathered particles of matter with which they were once\n associated, then to arise to the higher life, \u2014 it is no such crude,\n contradictory and impossible speculation ; \u2014 but it is plainly\n this, that the resurrection in all cases shortly succeeds the death of\n the body \u2014 that \u2018the dead are raised,\u2019 and the process has been\n and is constantly going forward under the great universal law that\n evolves the plant from the seed, the butterfly from the worm, the\n spiritual body from the physical.\n</p>\n<p>\n That this was the teaching of Christ is evident from his argument\n with the Sadducees : \u2018Now that the dead are raised\u2019 [not shall\n he], \u2018even Moses showed at the bush, when he calleth the Lord the\n God of Abraham, and the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob ; for\n He is not ' a God of the dead but of the living ; for all live unto Him.*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0024/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 450}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0024/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 528, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 901}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0024/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1056, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1803}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0024/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2113, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3606}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0024/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/mi/ni/st/ry/of/an/ge/ls/00/ne/wt/_0/ministryofangels00newt_0/ministryofangels00newt_0_0024.jp2", "height": 3606, "width": 2113, "levels": 6, "size": 635383}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"24\">\n<p>\n 22\n</p>\n<p>\n (Luke 20 : 37, 38.) How does this argument prove the doctrine\n of the resurrection, unless Christ means to assert that Abraham,\n Isaac and Jacob were \u2018living,\u2019 at the time of Moses, in the resur-\n rection-state ? Nothing can be more evident than that such is his\n meaning ; and if the patriarchs had been raised to a state of equali-\n ty with and likeness to the angels (Luke 20 : 36. Mark 12 : 25.\n Matt. 22 : 30), so had been all other men who had died.\n</p>\n<p>\n So taught Paul in his letter to the Corinthians, making indeed\n the resurrection of Christ himself to be in accordance with and de-\n pendent upon this universal law. \u2018For if the dead rise not,\n THEN IS NOT CHRIST RAISED.\u2019 (1 Cor. 15 t 16, & C.)\n</p>\n<p>\n But some will say, How are the dead raised up 1 and with what\n body do they come ? This identical question was asked and fully\n answered eighteen hundred years ago ; but how strangely blind\n have we been to the meaning of that answer ! If the apostle\n termed him a \u2018fool\u2019 who made the inquiry, what would he have\n thought of us who have failed for so long to comprehend the re-\n ply 1 He points to the natural world, ever teeming with its my-\n riad transformations and resurrections before our eyes, and bids us\n view the process there. When we deposit the grain of seed in\n the earth, it is not that same grain which is to come up again in\n the new plant \u2014 \u2018thou so west not that body that shall be ;\u2019 \u2014 but\n the germ, the life-principle encased within, this springs up, un-\n folds in a new life, and develops a new creation of beauty. So the\n germ, the life-principle, the spirit or \u2018spiritual body\u2019 of man\n emerges from its clayey tenement into an incorruptible, spiritual\n existence. \u2018For there is a natural [physical] body, and there is\n a spiritual body \u2014 the physical being first developed, afterwards\n he spiritual. \u2018For this corruptible must put on incorruption, and\n this mortal put on immortality. . . . And then shall be brought to\n pass the saying that is written, \u2018Death is swallowed up in victory 1*\n (1 Cor. 15 : 36\u201454.)\n</p>\n<p>\n Such, then, we conceive to be the true Christian doctrine\n of the resurrection.

Hence it is that we find indubitable evidence of the same\n gradations of character and attainment, both mental and moral,\n in the spirit-world, that are exhibited in this world ; hence the vari-\n ety of opinion, the contrariety of statement, and the evident want\n of wisdom on the part of many who have undertaken to commu-\n nicate to men ; and hence, also, the absolute necessity of purity\n of motive, simplicity of heart, and an earnest desire for the wis-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0025/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 264, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 450}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0025/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 528, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 901}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0025/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1056, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1803}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0025/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2113, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3606}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:mi:ni:st:ry:of:an:ge:ls:00:ne:wt:_0:ministryofangels00newt_0:ministryofangels00newt_0_0025/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/mi/ni/st/ry/of/an/ge/ls/00/ne/wt/_0/ministryofangels00newt_0/ministryofangels00newt_0_0025.jp2", "height": 3606, "width": 2113, "levels": 6, "size": 605966}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"25\">\n<p>\n 23\n</p>\n<p>\n dom which is from above on the part of those who would attract\n to them teachers of exalted wisdom and goodness.\n</p>\n<p>\n Having said thus much of the great law of progression, we\n would glance at what appears to be the chief instrumentality\n through which spiritual advancement is carried forward. That\n God works by means, or instrumentalities, in all His operations, in\n all departments of the universe, agrees with all that we know\n of His method of working. Hoes he sustain our physical life and\n health ? \u2014 He does it by means of food, air, and other conditions,\n either of which being wanting, life or health will cease. Does\n he give us our daily bread ? \u2014 It is done, not by His own hand\n extended to place it in our mouths, but through the operation of a\n chain of instruments which prepare and supply it to us. So if\n He sustains our spiritual life, and works in us to advance and per-\n fect it, He does it by instrumentalities ; and among those instru-\n mentalities are spiritual beings \u2014 \u2018angels who excel in strength,*\n \u2018ministers of His who do His pleasure\u2019 \u2014 appointed to be the chan-\n nels of communication between our spirits and the Infinite Fountain\n from whence emanate all life and love. \u2018Are they not all ministering\n spirits, sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salva-\n tion?\u2019 (Heb. 1: 14.)\n</p>\n<p>\n But who are these \u2018angels,\u2019 and what are their relations to us?\n Are they a distinct and higher order of intelligences, having no\n affinities or relationship with man ? or are they human spirits, the\n spirits of \u2018just men made perfect,\u2019 our \u2018elder brothers,\u2019 exalted to\n a higher sphere of usefulness, and still actively employed as mes-\n sengers of the Highest, in doing His will? We answer unhesita-\n tingly, the latter ; and again we appeal to the scriptures to bear\n testimony to this most interesting truth. Jesus declared to the\n Sadducees that in the resurrection-state, men become \u2018as the an-\n gels of God\u2019 (Matt. 22 : 30) \u2014 \u2018as the angels which are in heaven\u2019\n (Mark 12 : 25) \u2014 \u2018 equal unto the angels.\u2019 (Luke 20 : 36.) Being\n made, in the present rudimental form, \u2018a little lower than the an-\n gels\u2019 (Ps. 8 : 5), we are, in that next stage of our being, advanced\n to an equality of grade with them; and \u2018if like them, why\n should we not be engaged in like employment?\u2019 This question\n will not be new to your ears \u2014 it having been propounded\n from our own pulpit, by our own pastor, not many weeks since.*\n Moreover, angels who have appeared on earth have always ap-\n peared in the human form ; and Daniel, in the passages to which\n we have already referred, repeatedly terms those who were sent\n unto him, \u2018men,\u2019 not excepting Gabriel himself, whom he calls\n \u2018the man Gabriel.\u2019 (9: 21.) But there is one other passage, already\n quoted, which is sufficient to place this matter in a most unques-\n tionable light, namely, the direct avowal of the angel who com-\n municated to John the revelations of the Apocalypse \u2014 \u2018I am thy\n fellow-servant, and of thy brethren the prophets.\u2019 (Rev.\n 22 : 9.)\n</p>\n<p>\n It seems probable therefore, that with the exception, perhaps, of\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2666Rev.

We have shared with you all these\n imaginings, and can fully sympathize with your fears. But you\n will remember that it has been the fate of every new truth, or\n rather of every truth when newly developed to mankind, to meet\n with the same objections, and to be compelled to force its way into\n .the convictions of men in spite of their theological systems and\n their accustomed ' interpretations of scripture. Thus was it with\n Christianity itself ; and thus with its revival under the name of Pro-\n testantism, in the days of the Reformers. Thus has it been with\n the developments of Astronomy, Physiology, Phrenology, and lat-\n terly Geology. Each in its turn has been anathematized as the\n enemy of revelation and the foe of true religion. But each has\n become demonstrated truth, and then it has been found an easy\n matter for theologians to adjust their religious philosophy and them\n scripture interpretations to these truths. The same process will\n continue to be required, till men shall see the folly of attempting\n to confine their expanding natures within the infantile garments of\n the past, or to crowd a universe of truth into the meagre limits of\n a creed.\n</p>\n<p>\n But we cannot expect you at once to perceive these truths as we\n see them. It has cost us many months of investigation, of earnest\n thought, of agonizing prayer, and of painful struggles against the\n advancing light ; and we can well afford to allow you at least an\n equal amount of time. Indeed, it will be no matter of surprise\n should you judge us to have become apostates from the truth, and\n unworthy of your continued fellowship, or of the Christian name.\n Yet much as we should regret the interruption of the fraternal re-\n lations which have subsisted between us, there is another thing\n which we should still more regret, and that is, being compelled to\n stifle the deepest and most earnest convictions of our souls, and to\n withhold from our fellow men the \u2018glad tidings of great joy\u2019 which\n have been sounded in our ears. And even though the fate awaited\n us which in former days was the portion of all who were so fortu-\n nate (or wnfortunate) as to be made the recipients of a truth not\n recognized in the canons of the church \u2014 even though the dungeon,\n the rack and the faggot were staring us in the face \u2014 we could only\n say with Luther as he stood before his persecutors , \u2018May God help\n</p>\n<p>\n US : WE CAN SPEAK NO OTHERWISE.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n In conclusion, therefore, we feel in duty bound to request a re-\n lease from all obligations or limitations, either expressed or im-\n plied in our relationship with you, which are inconsistent with the\n views and convictions herein laid before you, or with whatever truths\n may yet be opened before us in our ascending life and the unfolding\n universe of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n Yours in the love of Christ,\n</p>\n<p>\n and the light of the New Dispensation,\n</p>\n<p>\n A.

We are thus prepared to take what they say as the\n</p>\n<p>\n utterance of truthful, conscientious, religious persons, of the soundest orthodox\n faith; and though expressing no opinion as to the revelations\u2014 because, of our-\n selves, we know nothing of the subject\u2014 are willing to accept them as opening\n glimpses of a new and wonderful science which many deeply feel is dawning upon\n mankind.\u201d \u2014 Boston Commonwealth.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe writer of this Letter, Mr. Newton, defends the spirit-theory, and if his\n brethren in the church can answer him to their own satisfaction, let them do so.\n lie has made an able defence of his belief, in courteous and Christian language. \u2014\n So.
