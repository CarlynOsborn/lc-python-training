It is after the\n funeral rites, with their first grief and their first gloom, have\n been duly observed, that a life which is closed renews itself to\n our thoughts. It is not merely from the prompting of affection,\n nor for the purpose of mere eulogy, but rather as in discharge\n of an obligation of our own for what we have received of good,\n of influence, of public and helpful service, from those who have\n just left us. So we note in constant succession gatherings of\n groups of friends and associates in all the ranges and fellow-\n ships of life, \u2014 political, legal, military, mercantile, financial, pro-\n fessional, \u2014 to follow the departed with something more pre-\n cious and enduring than the flowers upon their bier.

If others were not to share in this service, I\n should recall and trace, with some of their incidents and good\n services, the fifty years of his life at home, and in distant\n scenes, which are so familiarly known to me. Among the\n more than three hundred families on my parish list during my\n long ministry, that of his parents was always one whose home\n and inmates were most attractive to me. He was away among\n the Islands of the Pacific when first I knew of him through his\n letters. Occasional visits home divided the twenty years of\n his foreign residence. What was he doing there ? His em-\n ployment comes under that wide title of a business life. He\n had opportunities fair and full enough for doing what is usually\n thought the most of in a business life, \u2014 the making a fortune,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:se:si:nm:em:or:00:un:se:addressesinmemor00unse:addressesinmemor00unse_0009/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 167, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 275}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:se:si:nm:em:or:00:un:se:addressesinmemor00unse:addressesinmemor00unse_0009/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 335, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 550}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:se:si:nm:em:or:00:un:se:addressesinmemor00unse:addressesinmemor00unse_0009/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 670, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1101}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:se:si:nm:em:or:00:un:se:addressesinmemor00unse:addressesinmemor00unse_0009/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2202}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:se:si:nm:em:or:00:un:se:addressesinmemor00unse:addressesinmemor00unse_0009/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2681, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4405}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ad:dr:es:se:si:nm:em:or:00:un:se:addressesinmemor00unse:addressesinmemor00unse_0009/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ad/dr/es/se/si/nm/em/or/00/un/se/addressesinmemor00unse/addressesinmemor00unse_0009.jp2", "height": 4405, "width": 2681, "levels": 6, "size": 467645}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"9\">\n<p>\n 7\n</p>\n<p>\n the gathering of wealth.

When the war was over, the conflict was not\n over, as God knows. It is not over to-day. It was the business\n of the people who believed in freedom to see that the right\n elements were thrown into that conflict. The Emigrant Aid\n Society that planted Kansas engaged itself in filling Florida\n with Northern emigrants. There happened, as we choose to\n say, in this web of history, that that winter in Minnesota they\n had a fuel famine, and men did not care to stay there. Three\n or four thousand of those men and women passed from Minne-\n sota into Florida, under the direction of the Emigrant Aid\n Association in Pemberton Square. It made the difference that\n Florida is particularly a free State to-day, and I do not know\n that that can be properly said of any other of the States then\n in rebellion. It made the difference that Florida gave her vote\n fairly for President Hayes. Who directed that emigration ?\n This same General Marshall, who was serving the public as a\n private citizen, as Secretary of the Emigrant Aid Association.\n He happened to know what was the thing to be done. He\n was always ready to give his service to the country.
