An Ethio\u00ac\n pian may change his skin, and a leopard his spots,\n as soon as one born in sin and shapen in iniquity,\n may make himself fit for heaven.

Now, engender\u00ac\n ing, begetting, birth, etc., each in its way, indicates\n the beginning of a life. So being born of God, be\u00ac\n ing born again, being begotten through the gospel,\n must indicate a new spiritual life,\u2014a new course\n and habit of life, in one who is its subject. This\n with the related thought that by this change one\n enters into a relation to God like that of a son to a\n father, shows clearly why these terms are used. One\n cannot doubt that the purpose of their use is to im\u00ac\n press it upon us that those who have experienced\n this change are special objects of God\u2019s care and\n love, and that they will\u2014not ought to, but will\u2014\n live a new, a godly life, a life radically and thor\u00ac\n oughly different from that which they have lived\n heretofore.\n</p>\n<p>\n This thought can hardly be too fully impressed\n upon our minds, can hardly be too often repeated in\n our thought.

The wilderness must mean the same\n that it does in the quotations from Isaiah, and may\n well be taken to stand for the mass of unredeemed\n humanity.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The growth of this stream is not like that of\n other streams. It has no tributaries, and flows\n through a desert and yet it steadily grows wider and\n deeper. It evidently has a reproductive power\n within itself. Just so it has been with the truth\n and influence of the gospel;\u2014they have flowed on\n through the world growing wider and deeper as the\n centuries have passed by.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. This river gives life wherever it flows. Even\n in the barren desert, there springs up at once all\n along its course a living verdure ; and soon its banks\n are shaded everywhere by trees\u2014trees, too, that in\n their turn become life giving, for they are trees\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:rn:of:wa:te:rs:pi:ri:00:ho:ug:bornofwaterspiri00houg:bornofwaterspiri00houg_0222/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 255, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 438}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:rn:of:wa:te:rs:pi:ri:00:ho:ug:bornofwaterspiri00houg:bornofwaterspiri00houg_0222/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 511, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 876}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:rn:of:wa:te:rs:pi:ri:00:ho:ug:bornofwaterspiri00houg:bornofwaterspiri00houg_0222/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1023, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1752}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:rn:of:wa:te:rs:pi:ri:00:ho:ug:bornofwaterspiri00houg:bornofwaterspiri00houg_0222/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2047, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3505}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:rn:of:wa:te:rs:pi:ri:00:ho:ug:bornofwaterspiri00houg:bornofwaterspiri00houg_0222/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/rn/of/wa/te/rs/pi/ri/00/ho/ug/bornofwaterspiri00houg/bornofwaterspiri00houg_0222.jp2", "height": 3505, "width": 2047, "levels": 6, "size": 389395}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"222\">\n<p>\n 216\n</p>\n<p>\n BORN OF WATER AND SPIRIT.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Whose fruit is for meat,\u201d and whose \u201c leaves are\n for medicine.\u201d One can hardly fail to connect with\n this idea of the trees growing by the river, what is\n said in the first Psalm,\u2014\u201c And he shall be like a\n tree planted by the rivers of water, that bringeth\n forth his fruit in his season : his leaf also shall not\n wither, and whatsoever he doeth shall prosper.\u201d\n God\u2019s children are the trees, and the waters are the\n waters of life to them.\n</p>\n<p>\n The sea also\u2014the Dead Sea, in whose salt bitu\u00ac\n minous waters, nothing can live, is healed so that\n its waters, too, become waters of life, and swarm\n with fish of every kind.

He had backslidden\u2014and yet, not\n so far as to lose hope, or give up resolving and pray\u00ac\n ing against sin.\n</p>\n<p>\n From this time on for many years there came,\n more or less often, revival seasons, times of more\n than usual religious interest and enjoyment. These\n were sometimes in connection with revivals in the\n church, sometimes not. They were pleasant, happy\n times, but they would not last. Often while they\n did last they were marred by an uneasy restless fear\n lest something should happen or be done, that\n should grieve the Spirit, and throw him back into\n the old deadness. Of course he wished such seasons\n to last\u2014he was happier than at other times, and had\n a vague, half-recognized idea that he was also bet\u00ac\n ter, holier ; and he used to try to be very watchful\n against anything calculated to disturb his frame of\n mind, and to pray more than ordinarily, because\n prayer, he was taught, was a means of safety.
