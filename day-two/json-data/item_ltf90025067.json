People in\n their ignorance today are afraid to do right and\n take their chances, but the future will see right\n becoming more and more popular as its great\n blessings are more and more realized and exem\u00ac\n plified. \u201cI have been young and now am old,\n yet have I not seen the righteous forsaken nor\n his seed begging bread.\u201d Such was David\u2019s tes\u00ac\n timony. It is righteousness, not an imputed\n righteousness nor a righteousness in the future,\n but a righteousness of our own, here and now.\n Take a hand in it and see if you are not more\n than satisfied.

First, after writing the foregoing\n I had a conversation with one of the Providence\n pastors on the subject. He said, have you writ\u00ac\n ten out your views on the subject. I said yes,\n but I hardly think you could read it. After\u00ac\n ward I found it was quite readable, and I brought\n the first writing in to him. He said he read it\n with interest and said he would buy a copy if I\n had it printed. He also made the remark that\n no one could be expected to bring out a whole\n and complete theory or plan of things.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is this remark of his to which I take excep\u00ac\n tions. I have said in another place that I did not\n claim Infinitism as complete, but that it could\n be added to or taken from as truth and knowl\u00ac\n edge in their advancement seemed to make neces\u00ac\n sary, but whereas that statement is correct, I\n still believe that the secret of Infinitism is com\u00ac\n plete and whole in itself and, like the law of\n gravity in the physical world, which accounts for\n many things, still has some inconsistencies. So\n Infinitism, in the spiritual and religious world,\n when once comprehended will rightly account\n for all things, and that consistently, even if, as\n in the natural, some things seem to revolve in\n the opposite direction from what would be ex\u00ac\n pected. It is a saying that \u201cA few exceptions\n are needed to prove the rule.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:fi:ni:ti:sm:or:vi:ew:00:wi:ns:infinitismorview00wins:infinitismorview00wins_0050/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 243, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 405}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:fi:ni:ti:sm:or:vi:ew:00:wi:ns:infinitismorview00wins:infinitismorview00wins_0050/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 486, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 810}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:fi:ni:ti:sm:or:vi:ew:00:wi:ns:infinitismorview00wins:infinitismorview00wins_0050/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 972, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1621}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:fi:ni:ti:sm:or:vi:ew:00:wi:ns:infinitismorview00wins:infinitismorview00wins_0050/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1944, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3243}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:fi:ni:ti:sm:or:vi:ew:00:wi:ns:infinitismorview00wins:infinitismorview00wins_0050/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/fi/ni/ti/sm/or/vi/ew/00/wi/ns/infinitismorview00wins/infinitismorview00wins_0050.jp2", "height": 3243, "width": 1944, "levels": 6, "size": 438403}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"50\">\n<p>\n 4 o\n</p>\n<p>\n The second thing I wish to consider is the\n fact that there is much said about the second\n coming of Christ. I recognize that the introduc\u00ac\n tion of Infinitism and its acceptance will put on\n foot changes which will be somewhat similar to\n those which attended the coming of Christ at the\n beginning of our era.\n</p>\n<p>\n While considering these things in their true\n light, I was impressed by my pastor saying,\n \u201cChrist has not come the second time; we hear\n no on esaying T am Christ/ \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n While weighing all these things in their true\n light, and considering just what place I occupied\n and what part the teachings of Infinitism had, I\n will admit that I became much exercised. I\n seemed to see and understand things in a clearer\n light than usual. Some might say that they heard\n a voice and not very much overstate the matter.\n But it was conveyed to my mind this intelligence,\n \u201cThis is all that there ever will be to the second\n coming of Christ.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n These two considerations of this subject are\n both recent, and from modesty or a fear of over\u00ac\n stating things have thus far been withheld, but\n I think that the circumstances of the case require\n that they should be known, even at the expense\n of an unsolicited prominence of your humble\n servant.\n</p>\n<p>\n The third and last thing which I will mention\n is a remarkable incident. Some ten or twelve\n years ago, when, for the protection of my throat,\n I allowed my beard to grow, one day while sit\u00ac\n ting at a table eating dinner where I at that time\n was taking some meals away from my home, the\n lady of the house, a devout Catholic lady, said\n to me, \u201cMr. Winsor, you look like my blessed\n Lord.\u201d I of course was surprised, but have kept\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:fi:ni:ti:sm:or:vi:ew:00:wi:ns:infinitismorview00wins:infinitismorview00wins_0051/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 243, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 405}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:fi:ni:ti:sm:or:vi:ew:00:wi:ns:infinitismorview00wins:infinitismorview00wins_0051/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 486, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 810}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:fi:ni:ti:sm:or:vi:ew:00:wi:ns:infinitismorview00wins:infinitismorview00wins_0051/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 972, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1621}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:fi:ni:ti:sm:or:vi:ew:00:wi:ns:infinitismorview00wins:infinitismorview00wins_0051/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1944, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3243}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:in:fi:ni:ti:sm:or:vi:ew:00:wi:ns:infinitismorview00wins:infinitismorview00wins_0051/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/in/fi/ni/ti/sm/or/vi/ew/00/wi/ns/infinitismorview00wins/infinitismorview00wins_0051.jp2", "height": 3243, "width": 1944, "levels": 6, "size": 293521}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"51\">\n<p>\n 4i\n</p>\n<p>\n the saying in my mind all these years, and the\n other day I called on the lady and asked her if\n she remembered the incident, and she said, \u201cI\n most certainly do.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n And she went on to say that she had an ideal\n of what Christ looked like and that I reminded\n her of that ideal.\n</p>\n<p>\n I do not know whether Infinitism and the\n truth will be strengthened by the mention of\n these three supplementary incidents, but they\n seemed so germane to the general subject that\n I did not consider the presentation of the sub\u00ac\n ject complete without them, hence their insertion\n in Infinitism.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus we will leave this little book with one\n large subject in a needy world.\n</p>\n<p>\n IRVING WINSOR.\n</p>\n<p>\n Greenville, R.
