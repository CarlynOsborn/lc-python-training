Though this must be regarded\n as mainly an ecclesiastical discussion, it cannot be wholly\n devoid of interest and value in an historical point of view.\n Correct opinions on this subject were considered as of the first\n importance by our* Pilgrim ancestors ; and a knowledge of\n what one, with the experience, position, and character of Gov-\n ernor Bradford, thought and felt concerning the religious sects\n of his own day, will not be regarded with indifference by\n any student of our early history. Bradford was sweet-tem-\n pered and heavenly-minded in his youth. Forming his\n religious opinions at an early age, the sincerity of his con-\n victions was soon put to the test. The singular purity of\n his character received its seal in the ordeal of persecution\n through which he passed. He well knew what it meant to\n be compelled to leave his native land and the associations\n there dear to him, that he might worship God according to\n the dictates of his conscience. A firm opponent of all religious\n hierarchies and spiritual domination, he belonged to that sect\n of Christians sometimes nicknamed \u201c Brownists,\u201d which had\n wholly separated from the Church of England. Brought up\n under the teachings of the famous Robinson (who, though a\n rigid Separatist at first, so far modified his views as to admit\n that good men might be found in all the reformed commun-\n ions), Bradford became a man of large and generous views,\n singularly forgiving, and tolerant in his judgment of others.\n In treating of the Papists, his language may seem severe : he\n has no qualifying words ; but probably his estimate of that\n stupendous hierarchy would not differ materially from that of\n the great body of Protestants to-day throughout the world, \u2014\n and he cites abundant authority for his historical statements.\n</p>\n<p>\n Congregationalism was the central thought which animated\n the minds of the Pilgrims, and around which clustered their\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:al:og:ue:or:th:ir:dc:00:br:ad:dialogueorthirdc00brad:dialogueorthirdc00brad_0013/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 164, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 291}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:al:og:ue:or:th:ir:dc:00:br:ad:dialogueorthirdc00brad:dialogueorthirdc00brad_0013/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 328, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 583}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:al:og:ue:or:th:ir:dc:00:br:ad:dialogueorthirdc00brad:dialogueorthirdc00brad_0013/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 657, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1167}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:al:og:ue:or:th:ir:dc:00:br:ad:dialogueorthirdc00brad:dialogueorthirdc00brad_0013/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1315, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2335}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:al:og:ue:or:th:ir:dc:00:br:ad:dialogueorthirdc00brad:dialogueorthirdc00brad_0013/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2631, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4671}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:al:og:ue:or:th:ir:dc:00:br:ad:dialogueorthirdc00brad:dialogueorthirdc00brad_0013/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/di/al/og/ue/or/th/ir/dc/00/br/ad/dialogueorthirdc00brad/dialogueorthirdc00brad_0013.jp2", "height": 4671, "width": 2631, "levels": 6, "size": 506561}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"13\">\n<p>\n V\n</p>\n<p>\n hopes of securing a pure faith and worship. Firm in his convic-\n tions of the validity of that form of church government, Brad-\n ford ably defends it throughout this little treatise, as agreeing\n alike with the Word of God, and with the examples of the first\n Christians.

This shows how fully at\n this time the religious opinions of the founders of the Massa-\n chusetts Colony, composed chiefly of Puritans within the\n Church of England who never would admit that they had left\n her communion, harmonized with those of the Separatists of\n Plymouth.\n</p>\n<p>\n Bradford seems not to have been unmindful of the influence\n of his own colony in moulding the ecclesiastical constitution of\n the neighboring settlement. The good Plymouth physician,\n Deacon Samuel Fuller, had more than once been called pro-\n fessionally to administer to the necessities of the Massachu-\n setts colonists in times of sickness ; and on such occasions\n the opportunities for conferences on higher themes were not\n lost. He was in Charlestown in the summer of 1630, soon\n after the arrival there of Winthrop and his company ; and in\n one of his letters to Governor Bradford from that place, dated\n June 28th, he says : \u201c I have been at Mattapan, at the request\n of Mr. Warham, and let some twenty of those people blood ; I\n had conference with them till I was weary. Mr. Warham\n holds that the visible church may consist of a mixed people, \u2014\n godly, and openly ungodly, \u2014 upon which point we had all our\n conference, to which I trust the Lord will give a blessing.\n Here is come over with these gentlemen one Mr. Phillips (a\n</p>\n<p>\n a *\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:al:og:ue:or:th:ir:dc:00:br:ad:dialogueorthirdc00brad:dialogueorthirdc00brad_0014/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 162, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 291}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:al:og:ue:or:th:ir:dc:00:br:ad:dialogueorthirdc00brad:dialogueorthirdc00brad_0014/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 325, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 583}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:al:og:ue:or:th:ir:dc:00:br:ad:dialogueorthirdc00brad:dialogueorthirdc00brad_0014/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 651, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1166}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:al:og:ue:or:th:ir:dc:00:br:ad:dialogueorthirdc00brad:dialogueorthirdc00brad_0014/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1302, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2332}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:al:og:ue:or:th:ir:dc:00:br:ad:dialogueorthirdc00brad:dialogueorthirdc00brad_0014/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2605, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4665}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:di:al:og:ue:or:th:ir:dc:00:br:ad:dialogueorthirdc00brad:dialogueorthirdc00brad_0014/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/di/al/og/ue/or/th/ir/dc/00/br/ad/dialogueorthirdc00brad/dialogueorthirdc00brad_0014.jp2", "height": 4665, "width": 2605, "levels": 6, "size": 578278}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"14\">\n<p>\n VI\n</p>\n<p>\n Suffolk man), who hath told me in private, that if they will\n have him stand minister by that calling which he received\n from the prelates in England, he will leave them.

Certainly there was much\n in common in their public career, and in the estimation in\n which they were held by their contemporaries. Perhaps\n Bradford\u2019s popularity in Plymouth was even more firmly\n grounded than that of Winthrop in Massachusetts. From\n 1621 to 1657, the year of his death, he had but five years\u2019\n release from the office of Chief Magistrate.

He afterward went to Rome, where he became a Jesuit, and was a\n great ornament to that illustrious body. He afterwards resided in his native country,\n Lancashire, where he was highly esteemed for his preaching, and admirable character.\n He was the author of, 2. \u2018 The Progeny of Catholics & Protestants,\u2019 4to, Rouen, 1632.\n 3* A Treatise entitled \u2018One God, one Faith,\u2019 with the letters W B. prefixed, 8vo;\n 1625.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This note is continued on a leaf at the end of the volume: \u201c The Rev. Dr. Oliver, in\n his Collections for the Biography of the Members of the Society of Jesus, states that the\n author had been a minister of the Protestant Church before his conversion. He became\n a novice in 1604, ajt. 28, and shone in the sequel amongst the most exalted names in the\n English Provence. He died on the 17th of April, 1643, aged 67. In speaking of the\n work, The I riple Cord, Dr. Oliver says: I suspect [the author of] this is the chaplain\n of the Earl of Essex, whom F. Gerard received into his house in London, and who\n assigned 3 reasons for adopting the Institute of St. Ignatius. 1. Because it was detested\n more than the other religious orders by Heretics and the wicked of all classes. 2. Be-\n cause it foreclosed all hopes of church preferment. 3.

I recite them in the order in which they appear. First is \u201cA Word to\n New Plymouth,\u201d which, so far as I am aware, has never been published, and is now\n printed here. Then follows \u201cA Word to New England,\u201d and \u201cOf Boston in New\n England,\u201d which are published as above named. Then comes apiece called \u201cEpita-.\n phium Meum,\u201d which was printed by Morton in his Memorial, at pages 2G4, 265, of\n Judge Davis\u2019s edition; but omitting, very properly, some quotations from Scripture, in\n Hebrew, Greek, and Latin. The concluding verses are entitled \u201cSome observations of\n God\u2019s merciful dealing with us in this wilderness ; and his gracious protection over us\n these many years. Blessed be his name.\u201d This is the piece printed by Dr. Belknap, in\n a fragmentaiy form, in 1794, above referred to, and to which he prefixed a title of\n his own; the first part, consisting of seventy-nine lines , being wanting. As these can now\n be supplied from this early transcript, the whole has been printed here. Some omissions\n and errors in the part before printed have been corrected by collation with the original\n manuscript, as well as with the early copy.\n</p>\n<p>\n Prefixed to these verses of Bradford, in the little volume referred to, is a much longer\n piece, also in verse, on the subject of the religious sects which abounded in England and\n on the Continent during the period of the Long Parliament. The first part of it is\n wanting. I am not sure that this was penned by Bradford, and it is of little historical\n importance. It is possible that the little book, which has been bound within, I should\n say, twenty-five years, may be part of a Commonplace Book, in which the verses of\n different authors were collected by its owner. At the foot of the page which concludes\n the \u201cEpitaphium Meum,\u201d is written in the same handwriting as that of the body of the\n book, \u201c Johannis Williss Hick Libour Ano Dorn 1657\u201d; and at the end of the book is\n this: \u201cLiber meus Ano Dorn 1657 John Willette.\u201d The name is written, in both cases,\n in the same hand, with great clearness. The date is the year of Bradford\u2019s death.\n</p>\n<p>\n As the verses here printed are not taken entirely from Bradford\u2019s own manuscript, I\n have thought it best to modernize the spelling of the whole. \u2014 Ed.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":

Only two leaves of these now remain. \u2014 Ed.\n</p>\n<p>\n f Bradford always deprecated the removal of its citizens from the town of Plymouth,\n even for the purpose of establishing other towns within the colony. He felt that it\n tended to weaken the original place of settlement, and thereby to draw away support\n from the mother church ; without, perhaps, securing the maintenance of religious in-\n struction elsewhere. In 1644, after noticing the resolution taken by some to make a\n settlement at Nawset, afterwards called Eastham, he concludes in a similar strain to\n the above: \u201cAnd thus was this poor church left, like an ancient mother, grown old,\n and forsaken of her children, (thongh not in their affections) yet in regard of their\n bodily presence and personal helpfulness. Her ancient members being most of them\n worn away by death ; and those of later time being like children translated into other\n families, and she like a widow left only to trust in God. Thus she that had made\n many rich became herself poor.\u201d (History of Plymouth Plantation, p. 427.)\u2014 Ed.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":
