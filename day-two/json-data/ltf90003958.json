The\n memoirs were given to me in the following marvelous manner : I\n was investigating materialization and precipitation of paintings and\n letters, as usual I being the only sitter, or audience. I had a long\n talk with James Freeman Clarke, Michael Faraday, and many of the\n miost notable men who have lived in past ages; all materialized.\n During that evening they told me to get a new Yost typewriting\n machine, and place in it the cabinet with some folio paper. The\n proposition was entirely new to me. I secured the machine and\n paper, and placed them upon the table in the cabinet , which was\n in the corner of a parlor, I sitting about twelve feet from the cabinet\n and the medium perhaps five feet. The parlor was darkened, mak\u00ac\n ing the cabinet perfectly dark. In perhaps one minute after the\n conditions were made the typewriting machine began to work, as\n rapidly as it was possible for a machine to run. The spirit of\n George W. Stevens, an army officer, was given as the operator, and\n Mr. G. W. N. Yost, the inventor of the typewriting machine used,\n who died over a year ago, superintended the operation, while Ma\u00ac\n dame Blavatsky dictated her own memoirs. Other matter was\n dictated and will appear at the end of the book. This matter was\n dictated by the individuals whose names are signed to it. During\n the materializing seances Madame Blavatsky would often sit inside\n the cabinet, with her head outside, having forced the entranced\n medium from her chair, and at such times she would ask me to draw\n my chair up near to her, so that our heads would be only about\n twelve inches apart, when she would talk about what pertained to\n her life history and that which was near and dear to her, the Theo-\n sophical Society. It appears that those about her either could not or\n would not understand her, while most of them were bent on making\n money out of her personality, and seeking fame instead of seeking\n to understand the principle involved and disseminate it. Of these\n things she complained bitterly. In our first conversation she swore\n when alluding to Judge (he was then living, but she told me that he\n would die soon), but said, \u201c Excuse me, Wade; I did swear in life,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0008/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 149, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0008/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 298, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 548}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0008/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 597, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1097}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0008/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1194, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2194}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0008/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2389, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4388}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0008/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/po/st/hu/mo/us/me/mo/ir/00/wa/de/posthumousmemoir00wade/posthumousmemoir00wade_0008.jp2", "height": 4388, "width": 2389, "levels": 6, "size": 502463}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"8\">\n<p>\n 2\n</p>\n<p>\n INTRODUCTORY EXPLANATION.\n</p>\n<p>\n and smoked most of the time.\u201d She also stated on several occa\u00ac\n sions that she regretted that she had not known me while in earth\n life. On one occasion, while I was not thinking of anything in par\u00ac\n ticular, she almost ran out of the cabinet for about fifteen feet, then\n back again. She had told me that in life she had elephantiosis,\n which all but crippled her in a deformed body, and she no doubt\n ran out of the cabinet that I might see her condition in her later\n years. The sheets of typewritten manuscript were thrown out of\n the cabinet, one at a time, at the rate of eight or nine per hour,\n as written. At the end of the hour the machine would cease\n and all would be as silent as the tomb. We sat two and three\n times per week, about an hour each time, until the work was fin\u00ac\n ished. During the time of sitting for this work I received several\n remarkable \u201cdrop\u201d or \u201cprecipitated letters,\u201d but all of a personal\n nature, being either instructions or explanations; therefore I do not\n reproduce them at this time. It is doubtful if any man ever delved\n deeper into the phenomena of spiritism than I have done, in my\n search for a spiritual condition. I have a room full of oil portraits,\n many of them 24 by 30 inches in size, and yet often given instan\u00ac\n taneously, by Vandyke, Angelo and other artists, without paint or\n brush. I have one of the \u201cVirgin\u201d Mary when enciente\\ another\n of Joseph, Mary and child, with mule, in Egypt; another of Mary\n at the tomb, and still another of Christ in his prime.\n</p>\n<p>\n I went out in the Astral, and wrote through others on deep occult\n subjects, years before I knew what it meant. I have had \u201cdrop\n letters\u201d for years, and can show them all. On one evening I was\n given two paintings, 17 x 23, in two or three minutes\u2019 time, and have\n been given large quantities of water color sketches; all fine art work.\n I mention these things simply to convey to strangers the fact that I\n am no novice, but have delved deeply into the occult world, at great\n expense in time and money, shunning all society as a hermit would,\n or I would not be made the recipient of such deep manifestation.\n To those weak enough to cry \u201c egotism,\u201d I would say that whatever\n is original is personal, and were it not told it would remain a mys\u00ac\n tery to the world at large. In this work Madame Blavatsky hints at\n my taking the leadership in true theosophy; i.e., founded in The\n Truth. I cannot see this possible. Although I am engaged in the\n publication of a trade paper and am a very active man, still I am a\n hermit, as it were, in a busy life, in a busy city. I do not want\n money, and fame is but a bubble; therefore I cannot see it possible\n to mix in any form of organized society.\n</p>\n<p>\n I want the reader to note carefully the quotations made from\n other works.

On my\n mother\u2019s side I am the daughter of Princess Dolgorouky, with whose\n death the elder line of the family became extinct in Russia.

In the army and among the soldiers, in the barracks\n as I often was with my relatives, I became hardened in tempera\u00ac\n ment, and a very cossack at heart; it is to be wondered at that I\n did not go further in my bursts of passion than I did, for within my\n own nature I certainly knew my own feelings best and what I re\u00ac\n quired as a child as well as in later years, and fully thought of the\n grave mistake of guardians who, knowing but little of the interior\n necessities of the young, or mistaking their outer lack of develop\u00ac\n ment as an indication of inner incipiency, think that their own often\n foolish ideas are better for one than their own.\n</p>\n<p>\n I wish to say here, for the benefit of the young, that the interior\n nature of children contains as much knowledge, and often of a far\n superior kind, than the years of experience give their parents or\n guardians.

This element of my\n nature also gave me great trouble in all the years of my life, for I was\n brought into the troubles of my life mainly through the incoherency,\n incipiency and lacking clairvoyance of my associates; for had I been\n gifted with the power to have my ways accepted by those whom I\n trusted, I would have averted all my injuries, all my sorrows, or so\n it seems to me now, and I know that one should be careful about\n the karma of their colleagues, the destiny which shrouds places and\n enfolds inanimate things.

Where the questions\n required an answer, which, if given, the karma or that of their friends\n would be interfered with, there would be a diversified answer, equivo\u00ac\n cal and disingenuous; for it was not intended to give out anything\n that would impair the value of human reason or understanding, nor\n to anticipate the events of daily life about personal matters, but to\n evoke thought and prepare the ground for new ideas, becoming\n receptive to which the mind would open to the rays of divine truth\n and gradually the inner sight would receive the philosophy which\n could not have been understood if the phenomena had not given\n the aboriginal conception to the well-worn grooves of human thought.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus it will be noticed, and not heretofore fully explained, why,\n if these powers can make replies, apodictic and omniscient, they\n use subterfuges and evasions or fail to reply at all when solicited\n and are profuse when unexpected or unsolicited. The answer is\n simple : They have not the purpose to enlighten anyone beyond\n the requirement of the hour or moment; they are designed merely\n to awaken thought, not supplement it, and, having given one proof\n of its infallibility, its duty is done, and the neophyte is left to\n imbibe, by analogy, inference, the balance.\n</p>\n<p>\n My father was the most skeptical person within the family circle,\n but after the incident of the immovable chess table and releasing\n it at will as I had done for them, he became enthused and debated\n less heatedly about the glory of Voltaire and Letharge, whose dis\u00ac\n ciple he was.\n</p>\n<p>\n The principle of the Astral body was thus no trick of dioptrics,\n the Astral bell and the other sounds no device of diaphanous mes\u00ac\n merism.

Another authority can find no warrant for this estimate\n in this geological resume; it denies the existence of any proof that\n palaeolithic man disappeared so long ago as 80,000 years, and that\n heolithic man has reigned throughout the long subsequent period.\n It assumes that palaeolithic or post-glacial man did not appear until\n 20,000 to 30,000 years ago, and that his disappearance should not be\n put back further than 10,000 or 12,000 years from these times.

Thus it is the latent or expressed\n desire of the individual who is upon the path of knowledge to\n attach the fullest importance to the things which pertain to the state\n of existence which is always about to occur \u2014 in the soul life to pre\u00ac\n pare for the next re-birth, and in the mortal life to prepare for the\n certain death; and as any part of a wheel follows its other parts\n with unerring accuracy, so the details of life and existence follow\n each other in never-ending revolution until the end of the series of\n that Manvantara, or the ego, having attained to the state of Nirvana,\n relinquishes its returns and becomes the full guardian of its spirit\u00ac\n ual prerogatives and enters the further boundaries of surcease, or\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0075/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 148, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0075/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 558}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0075/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1117}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0075/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1186, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2234}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0075/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2373, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4468}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0075/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/po/st/hu/mo/us/me/mo/ir/00/wa/de/posthumousmemoir00wade/posthumousmemoir00wade_0075.jp2", "height": 4468, "width": 2373, "levels": 6, "size": 476347}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"75\">\n<p>\n HELENA PETROVNA BLAVATSKY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 69\n</p>\n<p>\n remains upon the horizon of spirit to point the way to those who\n are coming up in the scale of successive re-births.

At the time of which I write, there was in Spiritism a\n teeming, resistless mass of investigators, each differing with the other\n as to the cause of phenomena and the ability to secure psychic\n power for themselves, and there were numerous theories as to the\n best manner of obtaining mediumistic power. Some thought it was\n necessary to sit in the dark and others contended that the power\n was an hereditary one or engrafted at birth ; to offset this, several\n mediums came forward who had the advanced power of etherializa-\n tion, voice speaking, levitation, production of flowers and other\n articles in the dark and the light, that had come to them by pro\u00ac\n longed sittings and following the advice of Spirits who had entranced\n them and given the requisite advice; others, however, had followed\n the advice of the same Spirits with no result whatever. Clearly\n there was some rule of endeavor in psychic inquiry, the following of\n which would produce some result in the acquisition of the latent\n power felt to be the result of the soul force. Moreover, some who\n were destitute of latent psychic power, owing to their inhibited\n embodiment for other purposes, desired a cult or combined associa\u00ac\n tion which gave a precedence to the truth of Spiritism, without fol\u00ac\n lowing the ritual of any sect at all, and this seemed to require some\n form of worship besides the routine of a seance for phenomena only.\n Others desired to look upon the power as an odic force which,\n scientifically followed, would bring mankind to recognize fresh dis\u00ac\n coveries in the domain of psychics, and, thus instructed, find other\n and different answers to the many problems of existence in compact\n groups.

Its superior\n use was plainly set forth and its self-illuminating possibilities; it\n advanced tendencies as freeing the ego from one set of laws and\n impulses, while making it the subject to the work which was given\n it to do.

This was Colonel\n Olcott, and not knowing it I had the bad grace to say that I hoped\n that he would not write about me in the paper, as I did not want to\n attract any publicity, as would be the case if he should insert my\n personality in his articles in the paper for which he was writing.\n Assuring me that he would not do so if requested, I at once found\n that my acquaintance was the one who afterwards became the col\u00ac\n laborator and associate in my society and life work; one who ex\u00ac\n isted to the end as the real and substantial founder of the Theo-\n sophical Society, but whose real blunders, more than any other\n feature of a remarkably brilliant intellectual life, contained the\n nucleus for a permanent subsistence in the recrudescence of Occult\u00ac\n ism. At that time Olcott was a man of the world, well versed in its\n subtle hypocricies, extremely erudite upon ordinary subjects, and\n with a flowing discourse which enwrapped the hearer in a maze of\n belief and faith.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ignorant of the simplest Occult law, and taking up the investiga\u00ac\n tion of psychism from the physical point of attack, he stood every\n chance of falling amid a ruin which his own incredulity would build.\n Moreover, what a man for the work, I thought! So well able to\n write articles and attack the enemy, able to make addresses which\n would stand the test of all literati. Schooled in worldly wisdom to\n the etiolated extreme of a social scholar, I looked upon him with\n the eye of one who had found the limit of their search and merely\n for the use which he would be to me in the work to be done, and to\n himself if he was desirous of coming under the chelaship of the Ma\u00ac\n hatmas. At present he did not believe in the Spirit phenomena,\n the identity of the Spirits behind the movement, the possibility of\n generating Occult work upon lines of original simplicity and with\n the stupendous possibilities of Eastern magic as a result, rather than\n the worship of the religious inclined for a test of Spirit identity,\n which only interested those who were confined to ancestors in\n realms of Spirit.

At this time I fully be\u00ac\n lieved in the necessity of frequent phenomena for the attracting of\n investigators to the new field of inquiry which would attempt to free\n men\u2019s minds from bondage, but at the same time I knew that the\n revulsion from too much phenomena must inevitably take place\n among the intellectual ones, and unless they were held upon an in\u00ac\n tellectual plane and also one of metaphysical worth, they would\n drift into materialism again and the good work of the Spirit revela\u00ac\n tion would be undone and its effect lost forever. There was much\n schism among Spiritists, and varied sects and groups of believers.\n No two thought alike, and especially about the subject of materiali\u00ac\n zation there were two distinct factions. The success of each class of\n phenomena resulted in its antithesis \u2014 a grand exposure ! What\n was taught and demonstrated one day was undone upon the next;\n the enemies, attacking phenomena alone, could effectually disprove\n its facts; yet the tenets of a philosophy that rested upon intellect\n alone, or the prevision and clear-sighted view of the clairvoyance,\n could not be undone. So the doctrine of reincarnation, which ap\u00ac\n pealed to the inner mind and the instinct, when accepted, was not\n affected by the exposure of any class of phenomena. It was a\n truth if all materialization was false; it could be depended upon to\n satisfy the mind about the past existence and also the future, if ac\u00ac\n cepted, without reference to phenomena at all. So also with the\n idea of Karma, or man\u2019s responsibility for his own conduct and\n acts, which was in direct contrast with the church idea of vicarious\n atonement, that had made of men for centuries wrong doers, with\n the perfect thought of escaping consequences by reason of the sac\u00ac\n rifice of a saviour for their redemption. To establish some form of\n work based upon an intellectual conception of the great laws and\n draw upon the ancient and Eastern forms of religious and legendary\n lore, to attain to a supremacy in the world of psychic endeavor and\n then let the mind unfold in its own method as led by its own in\u00ac\n stincts, seemed to be the solution of the varied difficulties. I will\n attempt to elucidate in what manner our collaboration grew until it\n finally established the well-known work of modern Theosophy, with\n the colonel and myself as its initial founders and with the ample\n assistance of my dear Brother William Q. Judge, who as much by\n his errors of judgment as by his unequalled Occult tendencies gave\n to the movement its primal efficiency. I will also mention my\n friend Elliot Coues, than whom there are none more able in the\n realm of intellectual endeavor who could bring that powder to a field\n of psychic work, and also his dear wife, my best friend, who came\n to me in many a trial and assisted me wdth counsel and advice.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0117/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 148, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0117/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 558}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0117/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1117}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0117/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1186, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2234}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0117/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2373, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4468}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0117/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/po/st/hu/mo/us/me/mo/ir/00/wa/de/posthumousmemoir00wade/posthumousmemoir00wade_0117.jp2", "height": 4468, "width": 2373, "levels": 6, "size": 432530}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"117\">\n<p>\n HELENA PETROVNA BLAVATSIvY.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ill\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER VIII.\n</p>\n<p>\n FORMATION OF THE THEOSOPHICAL SOCIETY.\n</p>\n<p>\n Union Between Spiritists and Theosophists in Esotericism.\u2014Thauma-\n t ui ' gy in Esse.\u2014Llamasary in New York City, and the Mahatmas.\u2014\n Isis Unveiled.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cNirmanakaya \u2014 a complete Buddha, Consciousness merged into\n the Universal, or soul devoid of every attribute of physical concern.\n Once a Dharmanakaya, an Adept or Buddha leaves behind every possible\n relation with]\u2019or thought for this earth and its affairs.

It was not of much moment\n at that time whether the force was believed to be this or that power\n so long as some power in Nature was partially unveiled and the\n mind led to look upon psychic forces in some direction instead of\n attributing all progress to a blind faith and the leadership of an\n annointed one.\n</p>\n<p>\n It would indeed be strange if I were to attempt to show that re\u00ac\n incarnation was a fact to one upon the very threshold of Divine\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0119/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 148, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0119/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 558}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0119/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1117}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0119/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1186, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2234}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0119/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2373, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4468}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0119/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/po/st/hu/mo/us/me/mo/ir/00/wa/de/posthumousmemoir00wade/posthumousmemoir00wade_0119.jp2", "height": 4468, "width": 2373, "levels": 6, "size": 492627}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"119\">\n<p>\n HELENA PETKOVNA BLAVATSKY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 113\n</p>\n<p>\n wisdom, after ages of spiritual authority and crass ignorance of the\n suburbs of spirit knowledge.\n</p>\n<p>\n I was obliged often to veil even the simplest fact, that the pupil\n might not be lost in the reverberations of a continual argumentative\n oratory, and even with William Q.

Because somebody who knows all dictates to me \u2014\n my Master or higher Guro, and occasionally others whom I knew in\n my travels years ago. I tell you candidly that whenever I write\n upon a subject I know little or nothing of, I address myself to them\n and one of the Brothers inspires me. They allow me at times to\n simply copy what I write from manuscripts and some printed mat\u00ac\n ter that passes before my eyes in the air, during which process I am\n not unconscious a single instant. I am filled with the sacredness\n of the mission and all that the work implies to mankind, and this\n lifts me up and gives me an impetus that nothing mortal can tran\u00ac\n scend. It is that knowledge of his protection and faith in his\n power that has enabled me to become spiritually so strong; and\n even the Master is not always required, for during his absence on\n some other occupation he awakens in me his substitute in knowl\u00ac\n edge. At such times it is not I who writes, but my higher self or\n inner ego. I am solely occupied with writing Isis and also with\n Isis herself. I live in a sort of permanent enchantment \u2014 a life of\n visions and sights with open eyes and no trance state at all. I sit\n and watch the fair goddess constantly; and as she displays before\n me the inner meaning of her long-lost secrets and the veil, becom\u00ac\n ing with every hour thinner and more transparent, gradually falls off\n before my eyes, I hold my breath and can hardly trust longer to my\n senses. For several years, in order not to forget what I have\n learned elsewhere, I have been made to have permanently before\n my eyes all that I need to see. Thus night and day the silent\n images of the past are ever marshalled before my inner eye. Slowly\n and gliding silently like images in an enchanted panorama, centuries\n after centuries appear before me. I am made to connect these\n epochs with certain historical events, and I know that there can be\n no mistake. Races and nations, countries and cities emerge dur\u00ac\n ing some former century, then fade out and disappear during some\n other one, the precise date of which I am then told by Morio or\n some other of the Brotherhood.

Olcott had been an enthusiastic ad\u00ac\n mirer from America, and in his desire to come in contact with\n Eastern mysticism he mistook any old man with a beard and origi\u00ac\n nal views for a Mahatma. Although I repeatedly warned him that\n this man was a humbug, still he had such reverence for the man\u2019s\n undoubted learning, his powers of Yoghi, and his perfect Oriental\n knowledge of the doctrines of Buddhi, that he fell under his influence\n and it took many interviews for Olcott to perceive that the aoms\n of our society and those of the Arya Samaj were not only identical\n but there was nothing cohesive about them. This brought about a\n disruption which added fuel to the storm of controversy which our\n departure from the Americas had started, and which grew as we\n came forth in our quest. We were roughly handled by Dayananda\n Sarasvati and in his own country, where all that saved us was the\n gentle natures of the Asiatics and the fact that the antagonist was a\n radical teacher and had at that time no following nor influence ex\u00ac\n cept among those who were widely separated and could not reach\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0127/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 148, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0127/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 558}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0127/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1117}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0127/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1186, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2234}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0127/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2373, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4468}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0127/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/po/st/hu/mo/us/me/mo/ir/00/wa/de/posthumousmemoir00wade/posthumousmemoir00wade_0127.jp2", "height": 4468, "width": 2373, "levels": 6, "size": 499561}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"127\">\n<p>\n HELENA PETROVNA BLAVATSKY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 121\n</p>\n<p>\n us with their envenomed sarcasm.

This could not be done at once, and I gave the\n greatest attention to repeating most of the phenomena that he had\n seen with Spirit mediums, and then, advancing from it to a higher\n plane, brought him into contact with the correspondence with the\n Brotherhood, which became the foundations of the Theosophical\n movement. Mr. Sinnett was undoubtedly the clearest and best\n writer to be found who could bring the world into contact with the\n initial impulse of Theosophy and its Mahatmic backers. He had\n been trained in investigation of phenomena and could give his in\u00ac\n fluence and power to produce any writings necessary to illustrate the\n theories and ideas of the secret Brotherhood. Olcott\u2019s testimony\n had lost most of its value; he was regarded at that time as a dupe\n of mine and so closely held under my influence as to believe anything\n which I could or would tell him. At this critical point, Sinnett, who\n had the post of an intelligent observer and of much influence among\n the countless thousands of Spiritists and free thinkers in Europe,\n and who had the possibility of publicity, a very necessary feature,\n was approached by the Masters, and through his organism and mine,\n assisted by the colonel, gave to the world the initial philosophy and\n ideas of modern Theosophy. This was the requirement of my visit.\n What did it matter if from the social standpoint I was in deliberate\n rebellion against the customs of refined society or was coarse of\n speech? I had not come as a guest to seek marriage or to show\n myself off as a trained diplomatic \u2014 a hypocrite in ethics of social\n intercourse. My power lay in honest conduct, and while I have\n often been accused of cheating by the ignorant pupil, yet where I\n could benefit myself by assuming a soft and polite manner, I pre\u00ac\n ferred to act as I felt and give the hyprocrite the knowledge that\n I read the heart and was not to be deceived by their sugar-coated\n airs.

Taking advantage of an offer of a lady\n who was formerly a resident of a suburb of Madras, I was able to\n obtain a palace at Adyar for our united family. After the Suez\n Canal was built and in operation, the suburb of Madras, which was\n the residential situation of the wealthy occupants of Madras in the\n hot season, known as Adyar, lost its prestige. It was seven miles\n from Madras, and this city, losing its harbor vitality, ran down in\n trade and riches so that most of the people in active business moved\n to Calcutta and elsewhere. This so depreciated the suburban\n property at Adyar that large and handsome places had no occupants\n nor purchasers; we were able to obtain by our united efforts these\n headquarters for a very small sum, and to obviate the necessity for\n housekeeping separately we all joined in a communal residence and\n lived upon a common fund. Olcott and some of them desired to\n attempt to practice a vegetable existence \u2014 an effort which was\n always preached in theory by me, but which I could never accustom\n myself to. My cuisine made such a difference to them that I had a\n separate table and could get meals and such as I wished at any time\n and not at the time that the group of F. T. S. ate together. More\u00ac\n over, it was designed to attempt to separate me from some of the\n household who, although of us, were inimical to our efforts and de\u00ac\n sired to ruin us at the first chance. To overcome this influence\n and have two domestic functions, it became necessary to have some\u00ac\n one to oversee the housekeeping and cooking departments of the\n community. Candidates were constantly arriving now from all\n parts of the world. Adyar was seven miles from all hotels and res\u00ac\n taurants.

I am obliged to copy exact\n passages from several letters which I have just received from Adyar.\n There extracts will be lengthy. I will not dwell upon what is then\n said respecting Madame Couloumb and Mr. Brown, who (you) in\n his case as you did in that of Hartmann, \u2018 tries her best to under\u00ac\n mine the power of the united Theosophists, by talking scandal and\n untruths to them as to its merits and intentions as a society.\u2019 All\n of that may or may not be serious and important. Neither is what\n Mr. Lane-Fox says in his letters; but only see what is added : * She\n (Madame Couloumb) opposes everything that is intended for the\n benefit of the society. But these are perhaps trifling things which\n I might easily counteract. More serious is the fact that she says\n that she lent you money in Egypt! (That I have never hidden ; I\n have told it to everybody, and at the time of the Wimbridge-Bates\n tragedy I announced publicly that I was under obligations to you,\n since when no one would aid me \u2014 me a stranger in Cairo and with\n no home and friends. You alone, and M. Couloumb, helped me \u2014\n gave me shelter, loans of money, etc. I have always said more even\n than you really did. Well, I continue my copying) : \u2018 She says that\n the money was never repaid ; that M. Couloumb has been construct\u00ac\n ing secret trap-doors for the producing of phenomena, to support our\n society and make disciples: that she could tell the Lord knows what\n if she wanted to; and, lastly, her foolish assertion that the Theo-\n sophical Society was founded to overthrow British rule in India.\n Madame Couloumb, ever since I have had the sorrow of knowing\n her, expressed it to be her greatest wish to get sufficient money to\n go to some other place, and in furtherance of this primal object she\n begged ^2000 rupees from Hurrusingjee. She has told me many\n times that if she had 2000 rupees she would go like a shot. Mr.\n Lane-Fox has offered to give her the 2000 rupees, or provide for\n her in any other way that she wishes ; but now she suddenly changes\n her attitude and insists upon staying, saying that she has a paper\n from Colonel Olcott in which he offers her a home in Adyar for life,\n and that she has positive orders from you (orders !) not only to re\u00ac\n main here during your absence, but also to help herself from the\n funds of the society whenever she should want money to buy dresses\n or other things for herself or husband.\u2019 Is it, then, because I have\n really said and repeated to you, before Olcott and others, that you\n both, being Theosophists and friends, had the right to spend the\n money of the society for your dress and necessary expenses, that\n you are saying to them that M.

If Judge was working all those years to gather in for him\u00ac\n self the pomp of power and the position of self-preferment, then I\n say that, having this intention, he has not done anything for The\u00ac\n osophy, but was instigated by love of self and a desire to make for\n himself a position in which he could manipulate his superior skill\n and love of intrigue, as did the ancient priests and hierophants of old,\n thus bringing their philosophies into contempt and fearing each day\n that the truth had found them out. Of course, I never judged his\n work; at the most I only saw him a few days each year, and Besant\n knew that we were often at full loggerheads upon questions of policy,\n differing to the point of a full breach. How could she and the house\u00ac\n hold permit him to acquire this great hold upon them, even after\n being warned by one who came to them at my suggestion, and with\n full proofs as to his authentic claims? Poor Annie; fallen in the\n opinion of her friends, accused by her enemies of insanities, and\n being under the dominion of Buddhist black magicians, she now can\n understand a small tithe of the dreadful injury which skillful calumny\n will work. From the plane of a respected leader of thought she has\n fallen to that of a victim of William Q. Judge, and not only has her\n own injury to account for, but that of those who followed her, as the\n blind are led by others equally blind.\n</p>\n<p>\n I can see no reason to hope for her regaining an even temporary\n ascendancy, nor that the breach between her and Mr. Herbert Bur\u00ac\n roughs can ever become healed again.

Her \u201c Blossom\n and Fruit \u201d and rules for those seeking the higher life are especially\n worthy of praise. At the time when these were written, Mrs. Cook\n (Mabel Collins) was under the influence of the Brothers, and one\n of them especially controlled her organism to give to the world\n \u201c Light upon the Path,\u201d a treatise which was of the greatest benefit\n to those seeking to come under the esoteric influence. After our\n separation, I do not see but that she fell into desuetude, as did all\n those who attacked me and withdrew their personality from the\n cloistered household in Theosophy. It was its need to a benighted\n world which gave them the prominence they enjoyed, and with a\n prudent regard for me and the purposes of the work, a continuous\n and faithful performance of their duties as Theosophists, with\n supreme devotion to the cause, we might all have brought the\n strength of our ideas to a harmonious union, and in this produced\n the reform which would have startled the world. One single edi\u00ac\n torial of mine expatriated my lodge from favor and gave me a \u201c black\n eye \u201d for a time with some of the weaker members. I thought it\n was to be another failure, and in consequence of my physical disa\u00ac\n bilities, which required rest and permanent residence, I was alarmed\n for a time with the shrinking timidity of my chelas. I think the\n address to the archbishop in the early \u201c Lucifer,\u201d the best of my\n essays at that time, was antagonistic to the established Church of\n England, and this displeased the English members, who, although\n radical in demanding reforms among the clergy and in the dispen\u00ac\n sation of princely incomes, were afraid of the intense indignation\n which the article in question excited. I called upon the archbishops\n to account for the large sum of their holdings in realty and the in\u00ac\n comes derived from tithes and taxes, donations and revenues, and\n to consider if it was not incumbent upon them to feed the poor, re\u00ac\n lieve all distress, instead of devoting all but the small residuum to\n new church windows and the ritual of reiteration and extravagance.\n I see now that this article, which called forth the signal abuse of the\n Theosophists at that time and gave Sinnett a new chance to abuse\n me and attempt to elevate himself, was at the foundation of the\n world of thought which has since united to demand the dis-estab\u00ac\n lishment of the Church in England.

The\n whole edifice of organized religion is tottering, and every thought of\n mine, every word which I wrote against it, will help the fall. God\n speed it! Liberty of thought is what we want in the world, personal\n individual freedom, possibility for all men to come into relations and\n knowledge of their soul without the intervention of paid and lying\n servile priests, who keep the people ignorant in order to reap a har\u00ac\n vest of avarice. The best way to secure this is to break down dogma\n institutions and all manner of device upon the part of organized\n religion, to maintain a suzerainty over the minds and intellect of\n man. When the Church of England goes down and every other form\n of organized thought as to man\u2019s relation with his soul, then the\n Master will indeed come and institute the thousand years of peace\n upon the planet Earth.\n</p>\n<p>\n If in this grand apotheosis of liberty any word of mine has been\n useful in enlightening the world, then I have not lived in vain and\n the work of Theosophy has never failed. It was this idea that I\n had always in mind : To make the work of Theosophy a beacon\n light to the world at large, that it might feel the leaven of liberty\n working to free the mortals in bondage, give their souls a fresh im\u00ac\n petus, struggling to express the power of spirit, and tear down not\n only the incubus of superstition in theology, but the false respect\n and prestige enjoyed by an antiquated philosophy of life and death.\n</p>\n<p>\n I feel that this has been done, and if every feature of Theosophy\n is a failure, if Judge has tarnished the vehicle of Truth and Olcott\n and the others fallen into disuse and desuetude, still the world feels\n the impulse which my life gave and the accumulated force which I\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0158/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 147, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0158/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 294, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 549}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0158/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 589, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1099}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0158/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1178, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2198}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0158/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2357, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4396}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0158/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/po/st/hu/mo/us/me/mo/ir/00/wa/de/posthumousmemoir00wade/posthumousmemoir00wade_0158.jp2", "height": 4396, "width": 2357, "levels": 6, "size": 451011}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"158\">\n<p>\n 152\n</p>\n<p>\n POSTHUMOUS MEMOIRS.\n</p>\n<p>\n brought it in the personalities of these Theosophists, who as martyrs\n first held to the radical tenets of Truth, than which there is no reli\u00ac\n gion higher.\n</p>\n<p>\n So apart from all personalities, which I merely review to show\n that I am conversant with the features of each collaborator and the\n true light in which I held their efforts for advancement in the intri\u00ac\n cacies of the Path, I find that our little body of pilgrims have had\n an effect upon the evolutionary waves of thought in its primordial\n attempt to release the world from the antics of anthropomorphic\n domination.\n</p>\n<p>\n This must be held to have my work, the part of my life for which\n I was incarnate, and the success of which must be gauged by the\n broad scope of the general knowledge held by the entire body of the\n people as to the doctrines inculcated, and not by the advancement\n or proficiency of any one pupil or their honesty, or the reverse, for\n in all life the impulse is wasted or conserved as the intention of the\n participant is known.

This would prevent the confu\u00ac\n sion of ideas which always arises when the state of the argument is\n unknown or little understood. It is quite common for many to\n confuse the principle of man which is meant in a metaphysical dis\u00ac\n cussion, and thus the subject is not well treated because the per\u00ac\n sons are talking about\u2014 one, the man material, and the other, man\n spiritual. About ten o\u2019clock I usually withdrew and sought my\n rest, and until the last days I maintained this as the rule of my life.\n I was much concerned about the last order of \u201c Master \u201d to dissolve\n the Theosophical Society and reluctantly talked it over with the\n household, who considered it as being an emanation of our enemies\n inserted upon the Koot Hoomi letter. But I sent out the order\n and it made the final trouble of my life, for I saw that they\n were not disposed to accept. Judge and Mrs. Besant with the\n colonel desired to maintain its exoteric head, but I, who well knew\n the Occult side of the order, was disposed to carry out \u201c Master\u2019s \u201d\n wishes. I understood that our work was to be merely preparatory\n to the coming of the \u201cMaster\u201d himself, and that good was best\n accomplished that would serve to introduce him to the world. So\n long as the organization conserved this useful purpose, it was a de\u00ac\n signed good; but as the tree is relieved from the covering which\n assists its early growth, so the work of Theosophy was designed to\n grow among the public as it had incipiently taken root with the\n society. My demise was considered a good time to begin this dis\u00ac\n integration, and especially as I was only a forerunner or precursor\n of the \u201c Master,\u201d whose agent I was, and it was designed to dissolve\n any and all organization which would interfere with his final treat\u00ac\n ment of the work.\n</p>\n<p>\n Those who do not understand this esoteric part of Theosophy\n will thus side with Judge and Besant, for it did seem inconsistent to\n make an imposing display of our accretions and work consistently\n for that end and then to dissolve the order. But Theosophy, unlike\n any other form of work, had its reason, and that was paramount to\n personal ambitions and a desire to rule officially in the ranks of a\n powerful organization.\n</p>\n<p>\n The schism with Judge came at this time, and he openly defied\n me. In a letter which he wrote me at that time he affirmed that\n he was in communication with another set of African Adepts, who\n desired that the society be kept intact, and that it was desired by\n them that he, Judge, should attain to leadership in the order and\n rule the members into a set form of Theosophical tenet. I hastily\n wrote to Olcott about it and changed my will so that in Besant as\n my executor I would find an ally to carry out \u201cMaster\u2019s\u201d plans and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0165/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 148, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0165/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 558}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0165/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1117}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0165/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1186, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2234}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0165/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2373, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4468}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0165/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/po/st/hu/mo/us/me/mo/ir/00/wa/de/posthumousmemoir00wade/posthumousmemoir00wade_0165.jp2", "height": 4468, "width": 2373, "levels": 6, "size": 504348}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"165\">\n<p>\n HELENA PETROVNA BLAVATSKY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 159\n</p>\n<p>\n defeat Judge\u2019s policy of personal preferment and use my work as a\n shield to his own ambition.

Many never saw it at all;\n those who read it were under the rule of Judge, and, deceived by my\n former adulations of him, which were merely colloquial and not\n sincere and literal, gave their strength to oppose the wishes of the\n Brothers \u2014 with the result that has been witnessed since my incine\u00ac\n ration, an almost total disintegration of Theosophy, and the result\n which was foreseen by the Brothers and provided for and ordered.\n The struggle for leadership after my demise, which gave me the\n greatest concern, and in which my influence was fully enlisted, has\n now almost terminated, and the need of the age, a coming leader\n of the people, will soon be a fact accomplished ; for not only is such\n a leader necessary but the age will require such, as well for the\n reason of its crass ignorance as for the unique troubles which will\n beset it in these the last days of the Manvantara.

In preparing the minds for this great event,\n the Theosophical Society has had its use and purpose, and, having\n done it, its best interests will be conserved by dissolving, so that the\n next movement can assume the platform of the Truth, than which\n there is no religion higher. I finally, on the eighth day of May in\n the year 1891, relinquished the hold upon my mortal essences and\n material body and superintended the last obsequies of my remains\n in company with the Spirit of Le-Palm, for whom I had stood spon\u00ac\n sor at his obsequies.

From lofty heights the conventions\n have been followed one after the other, and I was present at the trial\n of Judge which his perfidy resulted in. After this he made the\n schism of the age in the rupture between the different countries of\n Theosophical activity, and insinuated himself as the American leader\n at the price of the work losing its international character. From\n the post of secretary, Judge tried to advance and take the place of\n the master, and in this he was foiled by immediate removal and\n premeditated decease, for in this cult there is a grand apotheosis\n which cannot be impeached nor overcome, and in this I will as\u00ac\n suredly have a hand and voice. For this purpose I have been\n assured of my return to the Earth in another body, healthy and\n vigorous and with added powers, and the weaker evil adversaries to\n combat.

For the\n most irate of the skeptics cannot deny, and will fail to dispute, the\n fact that the Theosophical Society exists, that it is far and away the\n most influential of all the associations which have endeavored to\n popularize Occultism; and that its influence is, at the present time,\n felt far and wide in many lands and in many churches, not by its\n adoption as a true philosophy, but in the shrinking of the congrega\u00ac\n tions to adopt other doctrines. The number of pledged Theoso-\n phists may be few, although it is probably greater than most people\n imagine; but the Theosophical ideas are subtly penetrating the\n minds of multitudes who know literally nothing about Theosophy,\n and are profoundly ignorant of all the controversies that have raged\n about Madame Blavatsky, the initial founder.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c This is eminently the case with the doctrine of reincarnation,\n and with the altered estimate which the average man is beginning\n to form of the mystic teachers and seers of India. Reincarnation\n may or may not be true. Whether true or false, it has, until the last\n decade, been almost an unthinkable sequence by the average west\u00ac\n erner. This is no longer the case. Multitudes who still reject it as\n unproved have learned to recognize its value as a hypothesis ex\u00ac\n plaining many\u2019of the mysteries of life which are otherwise inexpli\u00ac\n cable. Many admit that there is nothing in the reincarnation an\u00ac\n tagonistic to the teachings of Christ. That it is possible to hold\n firmly all the great verities of the Christian revelation, without re\u00ac\n jecting the; belief that the life of individual, upon which judgment\n will be passed at the Great Assize, is not necessarily confined to the\n acts done between the cradle and the grave, but may be such an\n existence of which such a period is but one chapter in the book of\n life. Altogether, apart from the question of the actual truth of the\n doctrine, it is indisputable that the sympathetic recognition of the\n possibility of reincarnation has widened the range of popular thought\n and infused into religious speculation some much-needed charity.\n And this, which is unquestionably a great achievement, will ever be\n associated with the name and personality of Madame Blavatsky.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Still more remarkable has been the success with which this re\u00ac\n markable woman has succeeded in driving into the somewhat wooden\n head of the Anglo-Saxon the conviction \u2014 long ago arrived at by a\n select circle of students and Orientalist, of whom Professor Max\n Muller may be said to be the most distinguished living representative\n _that the East is, in matters of religious and metaphysical specula\u00ac\n tion, at least entitled to claim as much respect as the West.

There are some\n who declare that Science was never so prosperous as now, but in the\n face of the failure of the Koch limph, the new anesthetic and per\u00ac\n oxides, the alarming increase of suicides, which Science has no idea\n of a remedy for, and the vexed questions of mind which the subject\n never even touches, but dismisses with a declaration of insanities,\n the revelations of the inter-etheric forces outside the domain of\n Science, and the last new feature of the unknown, the discovery of\n the X rays of light and its neutral affinities for its components, show\n that if not actually bankrupt Science has become inert, lethargic\n and no more is in the front ranks of the inquiring entity. M. Bru-\n netiere\u2019s phrase does not, however, touch the domain of physics; it\n merely refers to the materialistic philosophy which treats as trivial\n or baneful all speculation that is beyond the range of physical proof.\n To quote from his matter, which has been so much discussed, will\n suffice to show exactly what he means : \u201c From a Darwinism barely\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0171/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 148, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0171/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 558}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0171/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1117}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0171/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1186, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2234}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0171/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2373, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4468}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0171/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/po/st/hu/mo/us/me/mo/ir/00/wa/de/posthumousmemoir00wade/posthumousmemoir00wade_0171.jp2", "height": 4468, "width": 2373, "levels": 6, "size": 511868}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"171\">\n<p>\n HELENA PETIIOYNA BLAVATSKY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 165\n</p>\n<p>\n assured of the truth of its principles, or from a physiology that is\n still rudimentary, we may appeal to a more extended Darwinism, or\n to a more learned physiology; but in the meanwhile we must live a\n life not merely animal, and no science of today can show us how to\n do this.\u201d Science, then, according to him, is bankrupt in the sense\n that it has failed to satisfy what is in the nature of man, or to lift\n the veil of the mystery which surrounds him and his varied princi\u00ac\n ples.

The polished mockery and\n refined but bitter cynicism in regard to Spirit beliefs and powers of\n the soul, with other supernal speculations, wherein Edmund About\n and so many writers of his day and generation excelled, and which\n were so much relished by an epicurean bourgeoisie, have quite gone\n out of fashion.\n</p>\n<p>\n That insagacious temper of mind seems to have quite worn itself\n out. No doubt it may come again, but the fact to be noted as a\n mental phenomenon, to be philosophically pondered, is that this\n most skeptical of centuries is ending in France \u2014 the fatherland of\n free-thought \u2014 in a disposition of mind which, if not Christian, is\n more colored by transcendental idealism than materialism. The\n very keen interest, well maintained in the face of an overwhelming\n opposition, that so many of the French people of the highest intel\u00ac\n lectual class have of late years taken in Buddhism, Occultism, both\n Neo-platonic, Egyptian and Aryan, Spiritism, Theosophy, and that\n of the Russian lady, Madame H. P. Blavatsky, especially and fore\u00ac\n most, with the dip into magic and the hermetic philosophies,\n although by no means approved by the Catholic clergy, is neverthe\u00ac\n less a symptom of the reaction from the extreme Voltaireian mood\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0172/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 147, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0172/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 294, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 549}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0172/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 589, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1099}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0172/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1178, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2198}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0172/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2357, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4396}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0172/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/po/st/hu/mo/us/me/mo/ir/00/wa/de/posthumousmemoir00wade/posthumousmemoir00wade_0172.jp2", "height": 4396, "width": 2357, "levels": 6, "size": 503301}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"172\">\n<p>\n 166\n</p>\n<p>\n POSTHUMOUS MEMOIRS.\n</p>\n<p>\n which lasted so long and which became so very much in earnest,\n so different from Voltaire\u2019s humor that, had he lived long enough,\n he might have repudiated his own disciples.

The same cannot be said now. The youths of the schools\n have not grown pious, but Auguste Compte, Renan and Darwin\n have lost their hold which they had on the students, and their in\u00ac\n creasing mysticism is noted by the skeptics with pain and disgust,\n especially by those who were born earlier in the century and whose\n philosophical opinions were fashioned by a very different wave of\n inter-etheric thought. But contemporary literature is perhaps the\n best mirror in which to see reflected that new movement of the\n French mind which has led M. Brunetiere to speak of the \u201c Bank\u00ac\n ruptcy of Science.\u201d Several writers of note could be named who,\n from being the thorough-going materialists that they w r ere some ten\n or fifteen years ago, before the present fashionable movement of\n psychism and the cult of Mrs. Blavatsky and the Duchess de Pomar,\n with the ever indefatigable Mrs. Annie Besant as the chosen plat\u00ac\n form mouthpiece, the theurgy of a recrudescent thaumaturgy, with\n an inner ceremonial of esoteric prostration and a revival of Hindoo-\n ism, Buddhism and the magic of the Essenes as a basis for a further\n reaching knowledge of the world of invisible Essenes and the soul\n immortal, have with steadily increasing boldness and a vigor of im\u00ac\n peccable transcendentalness been reaching and aspiring towards an\n impassioned idealism that is almost if not quite religious in the nude\n sense of the word.\n</p>\n<p>\n A writer in the \u201c Figaro \u201d has gone so far as to point to the new\n direction taken by M. Zola\u2019s mind (evinced by his choice of Lourdes\n and Rome for his latest subjects) as confirmatory of the opinions as\n expressed by M. Brunetiere in his remarkable article. Zola, in spite\n of himself, by the choice of his last subjects, Lourdes and Rome,\n deals a blow at the purely documentary theories which inspired his\n other romances. Vainly does he have recourse to the awkward pre\u00ac\n tence of referring everything, even dreams of visionaries and the\n miracles of Madame Blavatsky, to the immutable action of physical\n forces. In vain does his style remain carnal, even when he essays to\n describe angels and souls. Who does not perceive that his mind\n has taken a new direction, that his rare descriptive faculty is no\n longer urged on by curiosity in regard to bestial passion?

Wade.\n</p>\n<p>\n The first half century of my life, beginning with early manhood,\n was given to seeking for something. I did not know what it was\n that I was seeking, and did not know why I was seeking; but I was\n impelled onward by some unseen power from within myself, and\n never ceased seeking, night or day, in work or play. Sunday was\n my best day, for I then could get into the fields and woodlands, and\n on that day there is a stillness in nature and harmony unbroken by\n business. I shunned society always, and especially the company of\n men, for something told me that they did not possess what I was to\n find, hence could not give to me what I was seeking. In union\n there is animal strength, while in solitude the spirit is all powerful.\n Something seemed to tell me that I could find what I was seeking\n in animal and vegetable life, uncontaminated by the selfish, mam-\n mon-worshipping influence of man; hence I sought it intensely in\n every hobby pertaining to nature. I now know that external nature,\n in its ever-varying forms, was but the outer visible shell of what I\n sought, the husk to what I was seeking all those years. The \u201c pearl\n of great price \u201d was there, but not visible to my material sight or\n tangible to the senses; for I was seeking the spiritual, not the\n sensual, and I continued to- search with an energy perhaps never\n equalled by any man. I studied nature in all its many forms, such\n as botany, floriculture, horticulture and agriculture, including stock-\n breeding, birds, fowls, pigeons and fishes, and I read lots of so-called\n \u201c theosophical \u201d ( ?) literature; but there was little or nothing in it\n for me. It was not of the spirit. I finally was guided to a copy of\n \u201c White and Black Magic.\u201d Something seemed to tell me that the\n \u201cpearl\u201d was hidden in the matter of that book, but I could not\n even then uncover it as I seemed to know that I should sometime.\n I finally found the author, Dr. Franz Hartmann, in Berlin, Austria,\n who kindly pointed to the \u201c pearl \u201d within myself, but I could not\n see it,\u2014could not even think there was anything within myself that\n I did not already know of, and I did not succeed for some time\n after he had pointed the way to it. He was as earnest in teaching\n me how to find it as I was in my \u201c seeking \u201d for it. I did not know\n it then that the teacher could not turn his back on the one who\n \u201c seeks \u201d as long as he continues seeking. I did not even then find\n the \u201cpearl,\u201d but I kept seeking, night and day, in business and out\n of business, without ceasing, for the visible world, with its sensual\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0179/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 148, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 279}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0179/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 296, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 558}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0179/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 593, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1117}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0179/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1186, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2234}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0179/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2373, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4468}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0179/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/po/st/hu/mo/us/me/mo/ir/00/wa/de/posthumousmemoir00wade/posthumousmemoir00wade_0179.jp2", "height": 4468, "width": 2373, "levels": 6, "size": 499023}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"179\">\n<p>\n pleasures, had nothing that I wanted; I seemed to know that there\n was something deeper and grander, something more divine, that I\n had not found.\n</p>\n<p>\n Finally I wrote a letter to my old ornithological friend, Dr. Elliot\n Coues, at Washington, detailing some experience that I had gone\n through, and the letter I received from him in reply was indeed a\n surprise to me. It might be termed \u201c the soul\u2019s awakening.\u201d I\n then began to examine my possessions, as it were, and found that I\n had the \u201c pearl \u201d and had had it for some time, perhaps from birth;\n but it was so covered with intellectual rubbish; i.e., pleasures, de\u00ac\n sires and worldly ambition, that I did not know what it was or that\n I had it even. I worked with redoubled energy to clear away this\n external rubbish, as I would had it been a diamond in the rough,\n and at last the beauties of the \u201c pearl \u201d were revealed in me. When\n I recognized the \u201c pearl,\u201d I knew that I had always possessed it.\n It was a jewel that my father had always worn and exhibited to the\n world, but no one recognized it. As I realized its value, I was daz\u00ac\n zled with its splendor and the power it conferred, for with its light\n we can read a newspaper and the editor by its head-lines alone;\n we can read a book by its title alone, and if any man will but talk a\n little, or write a paragraph, or do something, we can read his whole\n life or detect that which is real or spiritual from that which is intel\u00ac\n lectual or illusionary. With a knowledge of the possession of this\n \u201c pearl of great price,\u201d an intense desire to give it away seized me,\n and this unselfish desire to give is the \u201c pearl \u201d itself. I have\n worked harder to give it away than I did to secure it, and have spent\n a great deal of time, energy and money to give it away, working\n night and day, without ceasing, to find some one who would take this\n priceless jewel, worth more than millions of dollars. But, after years\n of searching, I have found but a very few people who will even\n examine it, and fewer still who will ask questions about the \u201c pearl.\u201d\n The people do not seem to realize that it is a \u201c pearl of great price,\u201d\n for they are so taken up with the getting of money, on the specula\u00ac\n tive plane, with which to buy artificial pearls (pleasure) that they\n cannot see its dazzling beauty. Then again, not one is willing to\n go to the labor of securing it and cleaning its outer surface, but all\n are elated to get the rubbish (pleasures) which I cleaned from its\n outer surface; for that is visible to the animal sight and senses, and\n is much sought after. With this \u201cpearl\u201d goes a deed of the whole\n world, as it were, and the power to rule the human race forever.\n Most people would prefer a ticket to the circus; i.e., the pleasures\n of the day, than the \u201cpearl of great price.\u201d And yet he who\n possesses the \u201cpearl\u201d rules all people and all things forever, silently\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0180/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 147, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 274}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0180/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 294, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 549}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0180/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 589, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1099}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0180/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1178, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2198}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0180/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2357, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4396}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:po:st:hu:mo:us:me:mo:ir:00:wa:de:posthumousmemoir00wade:posthumousmemoir00wade_0180/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/po/st/hu/mo/us/me/mo/ir/00/wa/de/posthumousmemoir00wade/posthumousmemoir00wade_0180.jp2", "height": 4396, "width": 2357, "levels": 6, "size": 388317}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"180\">\n<p>\n but surely.

He who lives a true life of good works while on earth\n is ignored by society, but he is Jirst in Heaven , while that \u201c so\u00ac\n ciety \u201d is lost to itself; for \u201c the stone which the builders rejected\n becomes the head of the corner,\u201d and he who is first on earth, i.e.,\n material life, is last in Heaven.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is to the much-maligned Madame Helena Petrovna Blavatsky\n that we are indebted for opening up the divine wisdom of the\n Orient; for the Western nations knew but little of Karma and the\n concealed wisdom of the East until the advent of this most remark\u00ac\n able woman.\n</p>\n<p>\n Jos.
