He was a tall, portly\n man, with an ample face, and a keen eye,\n over which hung a brow that plainly told\n his scholars, if they were remiss in their\n duties, his able right arm would wield the\n cane or the rod, with which his desk was\n ever graced to their sorrow.

On visiting Lee Cottage one day,\n my old friend met me with his usual smile,\n though there was an air of thoughtfulness\n about him which I had never seen before. I\n wondered at the change, for my old friend\u2019s\n face was invariably free from care, but I did not\n have to wonder long.

His\n desire is to try his fortune in India : it is a\n wider field for him, he says, than is England.\n He seems, indeed, resolute in the matter, and\n unless you, my friend, who possess some influ-\n ence over his mind, can prevail upon him to\n forego his intentions, I fear that I shall be de-\n prived of my son as well as of my wealth.

He did\n not go to school with me, but during our vaca-\n tions 1 had an opportunity of ascertaining how\n he fared where he went, and it was by no means\n creditable to himself. Old Mr. Norden was desir-\n ous of bringing his son up to the church, and he\n fancied that his son had both the piety and the\n abilities requisite for the priestly office. And in\n this estimate of the character of his son perhaps\n he was not mistaken. Matt Norden was one\n of the most pious among my companions, and I\n do not recollect his ever having uttered a word\n in my hearing, or committed any action, which\n detracted from his character as a Christian.\n His abilities, also, were, unquestionably good ;\n he only lacked one thing requisite to make him\n a shining character, and that was industry.\n His father was well aware of this sad feature in\n Matt\u2019s character, but still he thought he would\n improve in this respect, and therefore he resolv-\n ed to spare no expense in order to promote his in-\n terests. One of the best schools of the day was\n selected for Matt\u2019s education, and his fond fa-\n ther flattered himself that his son would surely\n benefit by the instruction of his learned precep-\n tor. His pleasing dreams, however, proved vis-\n ionary.
