attribute of the soul\n wh \" h, living, like the soul, forever, is created into an immortal love of man for man. Thus does the love\n for Lincoln live in the memory of his fellows- Thus will it live for many times these hundred years, nor\n dit u ' *il the memory of man dies and the memory of that Republic which he saved has passed away.\n</p>\n<p>\n There never was more profound and genuine respect paid to the memory of an American the coun-\n tr over than that to Abraham Lincoln on the one hundredth anniversary of his birth. From the At-\n lantic to the Pacific, in the North, in the East and in the West, and down in the heart of the South his\n name was honored.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of the most notable celebrations was that at the laying of the cornerstone of a memorial to be\n reared about the cabin in which Lincoln was born. Here, in the little town of Hodgenville, Ky., Pres-\n ident Theodore Roosevelt, the governor of the state and others in the forefront of American life joined in\n the enshrining of a flower mantled, but dingy structure of logs within a noble structure of marble. Another\n | celebration to which many made a pilgrimage was that held at Springfield, 111., Lincoln ' s home, where\n also the building in which he had his law office and the court house in which he practiced law stand, with\n 2 little church, in which he worshipped, and his grave. M. Jusserand. the French Ambassador, and\n James Bryce, the Ambassador from Great Britain, added their voices to those of the American speakers in\n praise of Mr. Lincoln at this memorial.\n</p>\n<p>\n In New York the official celebration was held in Cooper Union. Addresses were delivered by\n Mayor McClellan, Joseph H. Choate and the Rev. Dr. Lyman Abbott. They spoke in the same hall and\n .om the same platform from which Lincoln spoke on February 27, 1860, when he came East three months\n before his nomination as President by the new-born Republican party. The same reading desk and chair\n which Lincoln used on that occasion were used at this meeting. Other interesting meetings were\n eld throughout the city, the one at Carnegie Hall being one of the largest. Dr. Booker T. Washington\n .de a stirring address at the Waldorf-Astoria in the evening of February 12, with the grandson of his\n .ormer master in the audience. Some of the best addresses of the day were given at the public schools\n of the city, all of which held commemorative exercises.\n</p>\n<p>\n This Library contains many of the addresses delivered in Greater New York. The book is pub-\n lished to preserve in some permanent form the notable utterances and patriotic sentiments spoken on\n the hundredth anniversary of our emancipator\u2019s birth.\n</p>\n<p>\n The memory of our beloved Lincoln will not die because- this celebration is passed. It will live on\n md grow even more sweet. A hundred years from now the school children will sing the same patriotic\n praises, the Gettysburg speech will be read again in every quarter, every orator will be called upon to pay\n his tribute, and pilgrimages will again be made to the little farm in Kentucky. And why not?\u2014 for to him\n we owe the preservation of the Union, the fraternity of the states, the humanity of the Constitution, and\n the freedom of the race.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0008/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 319, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 486}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0008/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 639, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 973}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0008/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1279, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1946}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0008/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2559, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3892}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0008/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/li/nc/ol/nc/en/te/na/ry/00/un/se/lincolncentenary00unse/lincolncentenary00unse_0008.jp2", "height": 3892, "width": 2559, "levels": 6, "size": 677704}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"8\">\n<p>\n Abraham Lincoln\n</p>\n<p>\n By ST.

It was difficult to state\n them, or realize them in separate but\n simultaneous detail, when they were un-\n dertaken.

Lincoln\u2019s capacity was, of course,\n great, but the knowledge or even the\n suspicion of his great capacity was not\n entertained by bis countrymen when he\n was nominated. A very few of his home\n intimates knew his great abilities. A\n large number were aware of his rare\n powers of familiar statement, and had\n hopes of his adequacy to the duties for\n which he was proposed. But neither\n millions nor even tens of thousands, out-\n side the Central West, appreciated him\n as much more than a politician who had\n won a nomination over statesmen whose\n services and abilities were rated far above\n bis own. He owed his nomination to the\n skill of the managers who obtained it.\n They obtained it by the inability of other\n aspirants in the convention to unite on\n any other man and by the gravitation of\n events and rivalries in the convention\n around Lincoln as a compromise choice.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c1 am aware that the biographies of\n Liucoln since he passed away have made\n his greatness a household word among\n Ins countrymen. 1 ant aware, and glad,\n that most of the mysteries and misap-\n prehensions and nearly all of the myths\n that at first gathered about him have\n been dissolved. 1 rejoice that knowledge\n of him is uow so prevalent and so accu-\n rate thai ignorance of him, like ignor-\n ance of the penal law, which is morally\n b ' ot turned on the Ten Commandments, ex-\n cusetb no man. But on this occasion I\n am recalling a time when none of this\n was so. dames K. Polk had been a gov-\n ernor, a speaker of the House, and a\n statesman of the second rank, when nom-\n inated over Van Buren and elected over\n Clay. Franklin Pierce had been in the\n War with Mexico, as distinguished a\n soldier as Hayes. Garfield. Benjamin Har-\n rison and McKinley In the war between\n tile states. He had also been United\n States senator. Zachary Taylor had\n been the star hero of a war when lie was\n elected. The distinction of the least of\n these Presidents when nominated ex-\n ceeded in public estimate that of Abra-\n ham Lincoln, when be was nominated.\n The distinction of the greatest of these\n Presidents does not equal, and the eulo-\n gists of the greatest of them would con-\n cede the fact, that of Abraham Lincoln\n when he was snatched from us. He has\n had no par or peer in his party or in\n any other party in the time between his\n birth and bis centennial, which befalls\n to-night. I say this still remembering\n that, he was born in the term of defter\n son, was a voter in the first term of\n Jackson, and that he has been succeeded\n by Grant and Cleveland. Roosevelt, and\n Taft.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" One should not be too curious or too\n dogmatic or too speculative in discuss-\n ing whether Lincoln ' s greatness was\n more due to events than the greatness of\n the events with which tie is associated is\n due to him. The comparison could be in-\n stituted. but it could never be settled.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is more attractive to academic de-\n baters than capable of being solved by\n anybody. In a way. the comparative\n treatment, of this cuestion can be ap-\n proached. but only approached. The\n policy of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s administration\n was determined. not, by the North which\n elected him, but by the South, which by\n</p>\n<p>\n division prevented the election of any\n of his opponents, and which sought to\n retire from the Union when he was\n elected. A large body of Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\n supporters, represented by leaders of his\n party, were favorable to avoiding civil\n war by compromise. They did not take\n Mr. Lincoln into their councils of com-\n promise. It can be surmised, but It can\n never be determined, what view he would\n have taken, had his participation in pro-\n posed compromises been solicited and,\n if solicited, secured. He was not In-\n vited to any compromise conferences. It\n was well lie kept or was kept out of\n them.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThat he knew of them cannot be\n doubted. The reports of them were\n broadcast. They were common property.\n They were universal knowledge. They\n were debated in every household and in\n every home. Mr. Lincoln\u2019s complete\n separation from them was historically\n fortunate for bis freedom of action when\n he took office.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThere were others, also, not repre-\n sented in those conferences, the dominant\n leaders of many Southern States and of\n much Southern sentiment. There were\n still others: the radical leaders of the\n party that had nominated Mr. Lincoln.\n The Southern extremists and the North-\n ern extremists thus both kept away from\n the peace conferences. Seven of the\n eleven Southern States had formally se-\n ceded before the conferences formulated\n any plan to speak of. The men who con-\n ferred were thus prescribing for a case\n they had not been asked to consider. At\n this distance the comedy of it is apparent.\n At the time, the moral tragedy of it was\n evident. The circumstances that kept Mr.\n Lincoln out of the conferences were be-\n nign for his country and for himself. The\n Confederacy had set up the form of a\n government before Mr. Lincoln had as-\n sumed the executive office In Washington.\n The only compromise he first offered made\n the return of the seceding states to the\n Union its sole ' condition. The only other\n compromise he afterward , offered added\n the freedom of the slave to that condition\n of return to the Union. Those two condi-\n tions were acceded to, long after his\n death. The further conditions enforced\n were not of his making. He might or\n might not have agreed with them, had he\n been spared. Debate can be as endless\n as fruitless on that head. It can be omit-\n ted here.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe ever since vexed question of negro\n suffrage never came before Abraham Lin-\n coln in full form. He thought that suf-\n frage within states belonged to states,\n and that the Southern States were in the\n Union, because they had failed to get out\n of it. He suggested, in a letter as to\n Louisiana, in which reconstruction or re-\n occupation had first been effected, that\n the experiment might be made of intrust-\n ing with suffrage negroes of good charac-\n ter and fair knowledge, as well as those\n who had honorably served in the army or\n navy of the Union. The suggestion wa3\n lost in the subsequent action of Congress\n toward such suffrage. The further treat-\n ment. of the subject within the states\n acutely affected by it does not concern\n a discussion of Abraham Lincoln, who\n | passed to his account before the subject\n | became acute and dividing. In Illinois,\n long before the war. Mr. Lincoln was\n charged by Stephen* A. Douglas with fa-\n voring the admission of the negroes in\n that state and in the territory of Kansas\n to the bailor, on the same conditions as\n those accorded to or required of whites.\n Mr. Lincoln squarely denied thp charge,\n and Mr. Douglas retracted it. The Fif-\n teenth Amendment to the Constitution\n was not proposed during Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\n presidency, and was not declared to be\n adopted until several years after his\n death.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cPerhaps what has been said has dealt\n sufficiently with Mr. Lincoln\u2019s relation to\n contested public questions. That sub-\n ject could be infinitely extended. The\n undisputed public benefits which Air.\n Lincoln secured, for all the people, for\n</p>\n<p>\n all the future, were not few. Among\n them was the legislation which resulted\n in the transcontinental railways. The\n incalculable stimulation that gave to set-\n tlement and civilization is manifest.\n Among them also was the Homsetead\n law, which brought farms within the\n reach of every settler. Among them\n likewise was the legislation which gave\n to states the proceeds of public lands\n sales for the establishment of agricul-\n tural schools and colleges. The railroads\n riveted the Union with bonds of Iron\n from East to West. They marked the\n course of empire. They brought the two\n oceans within a journey of days, where\n months were before required. The value\n of- the Homestead law and that of the act\n for agricultural grants to education\n needs no statement and is incapable of\n exaggeration. Investigation would re-\n veal other results for peace and progress\n which Abraham Lincoln\u2019s administration\n secured, in the midst of civil war, but\n these must suffice for mere suggestion.\n The fact that Mr. Lincoln forwarded\n these results not only demonstrates the\n fertility of his mind and his appreciation\n of the needs and destiny of his country,\n but also his solid faith in the perma-\n nency of the Union. The commercial\n value of the transcontinental railway\n system is incomputable. The strategic\n value of It for defensive purposes is im-\n measurable. The initiation of all the\n laws named is an impressive proof of\n the importance Lincoln felt of makiDg\n government, commerce, migration, set-\n tlement and education mean more and\n confer greater benefits and more easily\n overcome obstacles than the case was\n when, single handed, he wrought his\n way from the bottom of privation to the\n summits of opportunity and honor in the\n world. Of course, illustrious coadjutors\n co-operated with him in the works of\n war, liberty and peace, but as the credit\n of sustaining them belongs to him, so\n does the credit of colaboring with him\n belong to them. With him these things\n were done. That under him in the\n greatest civil war that ever was these\n peace things were done, as and when\n they were done, and in such a way, in\n such a time, as to be useful forever,\n writes his name among the wisest of the\n wise, among the most foreseeing of the\n prophets of statesmanship and of des-\n tiDy.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe fifty-six years of Lincoln\u2019s life\n cast on the centennial of his birth not a\n few admonitions and inspirations for his\n countrymen. Lincoln has rightly been\n canonized. He exists in Homeric calm\n and godlike completeness. He Is without\n comparison, because without competition.\n The effect of the United States on Abra-\n ham Lincoln has been less regarded, so\n stupendous is his personality, than the\n effect of Abraham Lincoln on the United\n States. The United States made Abraham\n Lincoln, who afterward morally remade\n | them His extraction was obscure. His\n circumstances were those of extreme des-\n titution. There was a Providence, how-\n ever, in the humble birth and hopeless\n environment of Abraham Lincoln. It\n made him tender toward the poor. It\n made him considerate of the humble. It\n brought him into confidential terms with\n nature and with human nature. The\n United States accomplished their work in\n the education of Lincoln for the trusts\n for which he was reserved. The Mexican\n war was an ethical arousal to him. The\n Indian troubles of the earlier Hawkeve\n war were a revelation of his courage\n and of his capacity for leadership. The\n anti-slavery agitation from 1854 onward\n aroused him from a sluggish whigism into\n an affirmative for freedom. All readers\n know all the rest, from 1836 to 1865 \u2014 the\n rapidity of his rise, the adequacy of\n his powers, the versatility of his genius,\n his ability to gild defeat with anecdote,\n despair with philosophy, victory with\n clemency, power with magnanimity, man-\n hood with truth, patriotism with martyr-\n dom, and the grave with glory of self-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0010/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 319, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 486}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0010/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 639, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 973}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0010/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1279, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1946}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0010/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2559, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3892}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0010/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/li/nc/ol/nc/en/te/na/ry/00/un/se/lincolncentenary00unse/lincolncentenary00unse_0010.jp2", "height": 3892, "width": 2559, "levels": 6, "size": 492492}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"10\">\n<p>\n &\n</p>\n<p>\n )\n</p>\n<p>\n LINCOLN CENTENARY,\n</p>\n<p>\n sacrifice.

The Virginian and the Kentuckian,\n the one the flowering perfection of a so-\n cial aristocracy, the other the obscure\n product/of poverty, ignorance and con-\n tempt, not only both filled the highest of-\n fice in the gift of the people and attained\n the highest measure of ambition and of\n power, but both filled that office so well\n that their records in it became the su-\n perlative expression of moral achieve-\n ment toward which others might strug-\n gle, but up to which none of them, in\n</p>\n<p>\n public estimate, has ever reached. They\n are the entirely heroic quantities in our\n national life. Perhaps we idealize them\n both, but a nation without Ideals is a\n nation tumbling down the steppes of\n death, just as a man without ideals, but\n with consuming ambitions, is not only a\n danger to a party and a peril to hie\n country, but a false light on the shores of\n history to its ingenuous youkh. On this\n day, so foil and suggestive of history, on\n this Lincoln centennial, looking back-\n ward on the past with gratitude and for-\n ward on the future with faith, we should\n rebaptize ourselves in his snirit and. as\n he did at Gettysburg, newly dedicate our-\n selves as citizens of the United States to\n the vow to which he was so true and to\n the duty for which he gave his life, that\n government of the people, for the peo-\n ple and by the people shall not. with its\n entail of blessings and of obligations, by\n any default of ourselves or of our pos-\n terity, perish from the earth. \"\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00bb : r. :\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2022 .\u2022 i i !\n</p>\n<p>\n Lincoln\u2019s Gettysburg Address\n</p>\n<p>\n a! - :.*. \u2022 \u25a0 \u2022 i - \u25a0\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2022 1 ,i i \u25a0 . . \u2022 ,\n</p>\n<p>\n i\n</p>\n<p>\n Fourscore and seven years ago our\n fathers brought forth on this continent a\n new nation, conceived in liberty, and dedi-\n cated to the proposition that all men are\n created equal.

The great conflict\n was so far advanced as to fill the very\n air of the capital with plots and rumors\n of plots. Not a few of these concerned\n the very person of the newly elected\n President. There was a feeling of delib-\n erate apprehension that he might never\n arrive safely at the White House.\n</p>\n<p>\n In those days the necessities for hedg-\n ing about and protecting high officers of\n the government had not arisen, and there\n was no Secret Service protection for the\n person of the President. Special pro-\n visions were made. There were hints of\n distinct unfriendliness at Baltimore, a\n city decidedly Southern and Democratic\n in its sympathies; other hints that con-\n spirators would not hesitate at burning\n the railroad bridges along the route\n The railroad companies had their own in-\n terests in the preservation of their prop-\n erty. Mr. Lincoln\u2019s friends were much\n alarmed at these constant rumors. Be-\n tween them a young man, one Allan Pin-\n kerton, who has since become intimately\n connected with the life of Brooklyn, was\n secured to guard Mr. Lincoln on his ap-\n proach to the capital. Mr. Pinkerton was\n asserted to have a distinct talent as a\n detective and this must have been true\n for bv strategy and real generalship he\n brought Mr. Lincoln to the old Baltimore\n and Ohio station in Washington in abso-\n</p>\n<p>\n ute safety.\n</p>\n<p>\n This same man was among those who\n itood in front of the Capitol on that\n \u25a0ventful 4th of March that saw Buchanan\n ind the old order of things step out and\n Lincoln and the new order step in. That\n vas the most momentous inauguration in\n he history of the nation. Surely histo.-y\n .vas in the making that dav under hie\n .infinished dome of the great building\n ivherein was centered the visible hub of\n ;he distressed nation.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI have attended some great murder\n rials as counsel \u2019\u2019 inv informant told me,\n \u2018and some of the most tense moments\n af mv Iif ^ have been when we were\n awaiting the jury and the verdict that\n was to mean so much to one man at\n least. None of those moments have\n brought the dramatic closer to me than\n that scene at the first inauguration of\n Lincoln. Somehow r had the feeling of\n life and of death brought closer to me\n than it had ever before been brought.\n</p>\n<p>\n I could glance off toward the Southland\n and almost fancy that I could catch the\n dim sound of the rebel songs, faint\n glimpses of the Stars and Bars. I could\n almost fancy their guns leveling the\n great structure of the Capitol and leaving\n it in ruins as the British had done once\n before. That was the sickish feeling of\n death that first came to me.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThen I would catch sight of Lincoln\n up on the platform above us and I felt\n close to life once again and reasonably\n secure once more, 1 don\u2019t remember what\n he said so much; it was the way be said\n it. We had an old illustrated Bible out\n home and there was a picture in it of\n Moses that had made a great impression\n on my boyish mind. It showed Moses\n straight and strong and tall, standing on\n a high place and preparing to lead the\n Children of Israel out of danger.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln, standing up there straight\n and strong and tali made me think of\n that old picture; made me think him a\n second Moses. And I think that he was\n that. If he did not lead his people out\n of danger just as surely as old Moses did,\n then all the historians who have written\n of him have lied most grievously.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThere was a lot of chatter about me.\n ' It starts with a sky rocket flourish,\u2019 one\n man said who Stood near me. \u2018Watch it\n sink to the earth in a few months.\u2019 There\n were plenty of such sentiments among\n the crowd. Rumors of deserting officers\n of the army and of the navy, traitors in\n Washington, traitors who stood within\n arm-touch of Lincoln as he took his oath\n of office went everywhere among the\n thirty thousand of us who watched him.\n Every one of us was suspicious of his\n neighbor. It was a ticklish time. Some-\n times the sickish feelings of the rebel\n guns mounted over on the Virginia hills\n and trained down upon the capital would\n come back to me. and all I would have\n to do to gain my courage once again was\n to look at the tall, homely man who had\n come out from Illinois to save the Union,\n and then I would think of Moses and his\n people, and how God had never deserted\n them.\u2019\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n With the new President in office the\n rumors of treachery and traitors did not\n cease. They gained volume, and the very\n men who sat in the hails of congress\n were many times held under suspicion.\n They gained further rumor and did not\n halt at the threshold of the White House.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018It is said,\u2019\u2019 went the whispers about\n Washington, \u201cthat Mrs. Lincoln is in\n communication with her Southern rela-\n tives. It is said that she is giving them\n secret information.\u2019\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n Poor Mrs. Lincoln! It was her role ln\\\n life to be misunderstood.

It was just coming to\n business when the doorkeeper came to\n it, an expression, half of fright, half of\n embarrassment upon his face. On his heels\n came the tall figure of the President, his\n hat in hand, recognizing no one. He took\n a position at the foot of the committee\n table and addressed the embarrassed\n Senators:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI, Abraham Lincoln, President of the\n United States, \u2019* he said, \u201cappear of my\n own volition before this committee of the\n Senate to say that I, out of my own\n knowledge know that it is untrue that\n any of my family hold treasonable com-\n munication with the enemy.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then, without a word of recognition for\n anyone, he turned on his heel and left\n the committee-room The Committee im-\n mediately adjourned. The matter of Mrs.\n Lincoln\u2019s loyalty was not discussed in\n Washington after that.\n</p>\n<p>\n * * \u2666\n</p>\n<p>\n There were other matters more vital\n for discussion. The workmen finishing\n the great iron dome of the Capitol could\n look across the Potomac on clear days\n and see the blood-red flags of the new-\n born Confederacy waving back there on\n the Virginia hills. The news of Sumter\n came flashing to Washington and the-sit-\n</p>\n<p>\n onel Elmer E. Ellsworth, a young man of\n great promise and of surpassing popular-\n ity. Colonel Ellsworth espied a Confed-\n | erate flag floating above a hotel and. as-\n cending to the roof remove the ob-\n noxious emblem, was shot and instantly\n killed by the proprietor. This might be\n called the first personal tragedy of the\n war and its effect upon the President was\n remarkable. His grief was that of a\n father who had lost his only son. Under\n his direction Colonel Ellsworth ' s body\n was brought to the White House, and\n the funeral held from that East Room,\n which has played so memorable a part\n in the history of the nation.

The federal\n treasury was empty, the national credit\n failing and broken, the aid of foreign\n nations in money matters beyond all pos-\n sibilities. The army was torn apart and\n on the verge of destruction; the navy\n similarly weakened. His own party was\n a newcomer, without experience or\n without prestige. It was filled with dis-\n cordant elements. He himself was with-\n out prestige. He had not- even received\n</p>\n<p>\n It was a big situation for a green\n lawyer from a backwoods country, and\n</p>\n<p>\n ; he faced it as an Alexander, a Caesar or\n a Napoleon might have faced a great\n situation. He picked his Cabinet of ad-\n visers with great care. Lincoln was a\n big enough man to forget personal feel-\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2022 ings with the nation at the point of dis-\n ruption. So he placed the very men who\n had contended with him for the presiden-\n tial nomination in his Cabinet and when\n some of his advisers threw up their\n hands in horror Lincoln only said, \u201cThis\n is no time for prejudices.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Certainly it was no time for prejudices.\n There had come to the White House a\n man who seemed to be as far ' removed\n from prejudices as ever mortal hian\n might be.

The President\n had intervened, had telegraphed to th &\n</p>\n<p>\n ! army over in Virginia that he had given\n a pardon in the case.

He\n called for his carriage and drove ten\n miles through storm and cold to make\n sure that the sentence of death was\n stayed.\n</p>\n<p>\n That, was ibe Lincoln idea of justice.\n Frequently it had the War Department\n up in bitter protest. How could disci-\n pline be maintained? It would inquire of j\n the President.

The very fact that they\n had left their everything behind to fight\n tor their country must ever be a great\n mitigating clause That was the Lin-\n \u2022 coin foundation of a common law. It\n deserves to rank with the precepts of a\n Socrates or a Justinian.\n</p>\n<p>\n When peace was close at hand, Mr. Lin- j\n coin began to look forward to a new\u2019 !\n season in the White House\u2014 a season\n when each day, each hour almost, would\n I not bring to him a fresh roll of those\n j who would never come North again \u2014 a\n ! season when all the faculties of his mind\n would be set toward the knitting of the\n I wounds of a distressed nation. That was\n</p>\n<p>\n more to his liking. He preferred to be\n known as an agent of construction, not\n of destruction. The healing of the na-\n tion\u2019s wound w\u2019as a thing he confided to\n those who .came close to him at the\n White House, that would appeal to him\n more than any opportunity that had ever\n before presented Itself to him.

It was given to the\n great President to see the attack agains:\n the integrity of the Union hopelessly\n broken. Then, before he might even greet\n his boys who had fought so loyally\n throughout the four long years \u2014 the cur-\n tain was dropped in front of his eyes.\n His task was ordained finished.\n</p>\n<p>\n * * *\n</p>\n<p>\n Not yet have we the full perspective of\n this rail-splitter of Illinois, who came\n from the back country to guide a nation\n safely through the greatest conflict that\n ever threatened to rend a state asunder.\n We may pour torrents of words upon the\n printed page, our orators may thunder\n out their praises, but time and time alone\n will render the verdict.

In such a project an oppor-\n tunity would lie afforded for everyone\n in the land \u2014 from the wealthiest mul-\n ti-millionaire to the poorest day la-\n borer \u2014 to contribute either in money\n or labor. Such a road, it lias been\n suggested, should be a boulevard \u2014 the\n finest in America. It should be main-\n tained by the nation and would be,\n therefore, a perpetual testimonial in\n honor of the man whose name it\n should bear. The Lincoln road should\n stretch from the capital to that fa-\n mous battlefield. Ir should be, not\n only a national tribute to Lincoln,\n but an individual tribute. It should\n represent the love and respect of every\n man, woman and child in the United\n States. It should represent the penny\n contributions from the children, a\n day\u2019s work by the laborers, and gen-\n .erous donations from the well-to-do.\n Thus would it represent that true\n touch of human life that has made\n Lincoln ' s life dear to all Americans.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of the most enduring incidents\n in the last days of Robert Louis Stev-\n enson was the building of a road by\n the crude natives of Samoa in Ins\n honor. They built it in that rough\n country as an evidence of their love\n for the man who had come among\n them and who had shown such kind-\n ness and tenderness to them as to\n touch their simple hearts, and, that it\n might more truly represent the love\n of all tlie people all labored upon it.\n Every stone that was upturned, every\n rut that was smoothed out represented\n the labor of some honest hand. And\n when this road was done, in which\n everyone had had an individual share,\n they called it the Road of the Loving\n Heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n Would not this Lincoln road he such\n a one?\n</p>\n<p>\n Iso one can read the secret of the\n</p>\n<p>\n hoy or man that makes him beloved\n by others. Kim was the little friend\n of all 1 lie world, albeit his world was\n the half wild tribes of India, the\n men of the roving caravans, the horse\n traders, the mule drivers, the tenders\n of camels, the Hindoo fakirs and\n tlie British soldiers A kindly word,\n a look, a bit of sympathy which\n makes all the world akin, cements a\n friendship that never dies.\n</p>\n<p>\n Such a friendship with the world\n was Lincoln ' s. His love for the peo-\n ple was tlie strong bond that made\n him dear to the people. He had that\n touch of human nature in him, that\n sympathy for all mankind that took\n possession of all who met him. As the\n pool - hired boy working for 2b cents\n a day, not permitted to even retain\n Ids scanty wages, lie made friends\n with those for whom he labored, with\n the other laborers, with the dumb\n brutes for which lie cared. He was\n a cheerful laborer, in turn a carpen-\n ter, a hostler, a woodeliopper, a plow-\n man. Frequently lie helped the\n women with the chores. Ho made\n tlie fire, carried water to the kitchen\n or tended the baby. None worked\n harder with tlie ax. or plow, or hoe\n than he, and when ihe day\u2019s work\n was done none entered with more\n zest into the fun of the evening. Lin-\n coln loved people. He liked to mingle\n with them; hear their views and give\n his views in return. Nothing he\n liked better than going to mill, which\n in I hose days meant a long wait \u2014\n sometimes a whole day \u2014 until one ' s\n grain was ground. On these occa-\n sions Lincoln talked with the others\n ill waiting, and there was developed\n that love for story-telling which in\n after years made him famous, and,\n perhaps, had much to do with win-\n ning his way into the hearts of the\n people.\n</p>\n<p>\n When a very small hoy he always\n preferred those recreations which\n brought him into intimate touch witn\n men and women. The spelling school,\n the husking bee, the \u201craising\u201d were his\n especial favorites, as they gave an op-\n portunity to him to exercise that wit\n which had developed in him even as a\n child. Despite ail his roughness, Lin-\n</p>\n<p>\n coln had a crude sense of politeness\n which was cultivated to some ex l on l in\n Indiana in those early days. But back\n of It all, perhaps, was his own idea of\n politeness \u2014 the politeness of kindness\n to others \u2014 which is the greatest of *\n them all. This politeness of tlie back-\n woods ever remained with Lincoln as\n a boy and as a man. lie carried it\n with him into the White House. la\n spite of his natural crudeness, in spite\n of his untrained manners and his man-\n nerisms, Ids ever present consideration\n of other people made him always the\n true gentleman. Because of his fine\n regard for the feelings of the members\n of his Cabinet\u2014 few of whom were in\n sympathy with him \u2014 the impression\n prevailed that lie was easily led. but\n when the time came for a decisive\n stand Lincoln showed that he was the\n master.\n</p>\n<p>\n During those first days in Indiana\n Lincoln earned a reputation not only\n as a story teller, but as an orator. H*\n had committed to memory many poems\n and speeches which had come into his\n hands at odd times, and imitated to\n perfection the traveling preachers who\n happened into Gentryville. In this way.\n although lie had seen nothing of the\n world, lie was able to deliver such stir\n ring political speeches that lie held his\n small audience in the store bound as if\n under a spell. It was, undoubtedly, a\n species of vanity that urged the young\n boy on in this direction, hut it was a\n commendable vanity which brought its\n good results, for it took him nearer to\n human nature and helped him to ana-\n lyze human life more completely than\n any lesson which lie could have conned\n from the text-books.\n</p>\n<p>\n Later on, when he neared man ' s es-\n tate, and his work called him on to\n the Ohio and the Mississippi rivers,\n he met other people for the first time\n outside of the little country cross-road\n village. Here were the great routes > < '\n the western world, where odd crafts of\n all kind went up and down. Here Lin-\n coln saw the first real life he had ever\n seen. lie met men. lie studied men.\n From each man he met lie learned some\n lesson\u2014 a lesson he never forgot, which\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0016/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 319, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 486}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0016/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 639, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 973}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0016/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1279, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1946}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0016/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2559, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3892}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0016/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/li/nc/ol/nc/en/te/na/ry/00/un/se/lincolncentenary00unse/lincolncentenary00unse_0016.jp2", "height": 3892, "width": 2559, "levels": 6, "size": 724868}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"16\">\n<p>\n 12\n</p>\n<p>\n LINCOLN CENTENARY.\n</p>\n<p>\n i\n</p>\n<p>\n helped to make up the sum and sub |\n stance of that knowledge of humanity\n which was one of the great secrets of j\n his memories living to-day ; of the man\n himself living in the hearts of the peo-\n ple to-duy as if he were a man of flesh\n and blood and passed daily among\n them.

There, in the most cosmopolitan j\n city in the United States at ihat time, ;\n he mingled with travelers from all |\n parts of the world, and within him were\n awakened new ideas of life, new ambi-\n tions of which he never dreamed in\n Indiana. And, while all these ideas and\n these ambitions and these new iessotts |\n were impressing themselves upon him, :\n the tender solicitude of two good worn- !\n en, successively, was sweetening and j\n broadening bis necessarily narrow life.\n These women were his mother and his !\n stepmother. Botli were uneducated j\n women, as women are known to-day. 1\n hut both were Imbued with that spirit j\n of gentleness, Christianity and prac- ;\n tieal knowledge that so entered into the\n heart of the boy entrusted to their care\n that they created in him those attrib\n utes of manhood which were the foun-\n dation of his usefulness and greatness\n in after life.\n</p>\n<p>\n Not many years ago if one had\n gone back into the old Iudiana home\n of Abraham Lincoln and talked with\n those who knew him, he would have\n secured an unfailing fund of informa-\n tion as to the young man\u2019s kindnesses\n and little attentions. There were few\n men or women of those days in that\n settlement, who could not tell of some\n little act of gentleness or some cheer-\n ing word that made life the easier\n for them. A worthless drunkard of\n the village called him friend, for one\n night Lincoln found the man by the\n roadside freezing and carried him to\n shelter. ' Wherever Lincoln lived there\n was not a child for miles around\n who did not love him. And this love\n of all the world and this desire ;o\n help all the world never deserted him\n in his more prosperous days. After i\n he had obtained a standing in Spring- |\n field, Illinois, be was one day hurry- J\n</p>\n<p>\n ing through the street when he saw a\n little girl at a gate crying.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" What is the trouble?\u201d asked Lin-\n coln.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201d1 am going away cm the cars,\u201d said\n the litlle girl: \u201cthe expressman has\n not come for my trunk, and 1 shall\n miss the train. \"\n</p>\n<p>\n \" How big a trunk is it?\u201d asked Lin-\n coln, and led by the child he went\n upstairs. He took the trunk, a small\n affair, upon his shoulders and say-\n ing: \" Come on. \" trotted down the\n street at a rapid pace and saw the\n little girl safely V/u board the train.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lincoln was otie of the busiestf men\n iu any age. yet lie always had time\n to do a favor for another. He was a\n part of the street life of Springfield.\n He knew everybody in the town, and\n everybody iu the town knew him.\n Also, lie knew everything that was\n going on iu the town. He knew the\n history of every old building and lie\n made himself acquainted with the his-\n tory of every new building. He took\n an active part in politics, and bis quick\n wit aua ready speech made him al-\n ways a welcome companion in social\n and political circles. His democrat-\n ic ideas made him popular with nil\n kinds and conditions of men and\n women. Back in the old rail-split-\n ting days they railed him a good fel-\n low, and as he grew in power and\n greatness lie did not outgrow his love\n for all people, even tlip lowly in life.\n While in the White House a poor\n man once called on him to ask a favor.\n The man was greatly impressed with\n the idea that he was in rhe preseuce\n of the President of the United States,\n who seemed to him like some won-\n derful being, ami, his business over,\n he was hurrying away, when Lincoln\n noticed that lie was of unusual\n height. Lincoln himself was six feet\n four and proud of it. So he called out\n to the man:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHold on. How tall are you?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The man hung back.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Come here, \" said Lincoln. \u201cLet ' s\n measure. \"\n</p>\n<p>\n The man was the taller. Lincoln\n laughed, and the Tuan hurried away,\n abashed at the idea that he was taller\n than the President of the United\n States\n</p>\n<p>\n Lincoln ' s faculty of getting close\n to all with whom he came in coutaet\n was due undoubtedly to the fact, that\n be understood people. He believed vo\n a considerable extent in carrying, out\n the old adage, \u201cWhen you are hi\n Rome do as the Romans do. \" He\n was always in sympathy with men\n who excelled in physical strength. He\n himself was possessed of great\n strength and always liked to com-\n pare himself with strong and tali\n men. It is related of him that on one\n occasion, after lie had delivered a\n speech at a state agricultural fair in\n Milwaukee, he was escorted into a side\n show, where a strong man\u2014 a short\n lit 1 le chap \u2014 performed wonderful feats\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n I\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n of strength. Lincoln expressed his\n surprise in emphatic \u201cby Georges! \"\n and finally when introduced to the\n athlete, looked him over, and aston-\n ished at his shortness of stature,\n ejaculated: \u201cSay, l could lick salt off\n the top of your hat!\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It was not altogether by his quaint\n speeches and his stories that. Lincoln\n secured his hold on the people. Nor\n were his homely nets of courtesy the\n only acts that made friends for bini.\n Sometimes his very boldness of strenu-\n ous action won applause for him, and\n sometimes the man who felt the effect\n of bis strong right arm realized the\n justness of it. and was afterward his\n friend. Lincoln preferred argument to\n force, but if force had to he. he never\n avoided a fight. When he was clerking\n in a store iu New Salem a bully en-\n tered the place and became profane in\n the preseuce of women. Lincoln told\n him to be quiet, but be persisted in\n continuing bis profanity, and when the\n women had departed he abused Lin-\n coln, until the latter, unable to endure\n the bully longer, invited him outside.\n Liucoln quickly threw his antagonist\n to the ground and rubbed smart weed\n into his eyes until be cried that be had\n had enough.\n</p>\n<p>\n The persona! bravery of Lincoln was\n never questioned. When a young man\n he saved the lives of three of his com-\n rades. . Two of them had sought refuge\n on a half-sunken log in the swiftly\n moviug current of the Sangamon River\n after their boat bad swamped, and a\n third, while trying to rescue them, was\n also obliged to seek safety on the log.\n It was then that Lincoln put out into\n midstream on a log held by a rope by\n men on shore and succeeded iu bring-\n ing all to land.\n</p>\n<p>\n His readiness to do a favor for an-\n other is shown by his disregard of a\n fee when practicing law if the client\n were unable to pay. Frequently when\n a client was poor Lincoln refused to\n accept compensation. There are in-\n stances of liis having proffered his\n services without charge, as in the Arm-\n strong murder case. This was at a\n time. top. when Lincoln, next to Ste-\n phen A. Douglas, was Hie most con-\n spicuous man iu Illinois. Lincoln\u2019s own\n idea of fees was expressed in the notes\n for a law lecture, which were found\n among his papers after his death:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe matter of fees is important far\n beyond tbe mere question of bread and\n butler involved. Properly attended - to,\n fuller justice is done to both lawyer\n and client. An exorbitant fee should\n never be claimed. As a general rule,\n never take your whole fee iu advance,\n nor any more than a small retainer.\n Wheu fully paid beforehand you are\n more than a common mortal if you can\n feel rhe same interest in the case.*as\n if something was still in prospect for\n you, as well as for your client.

The surroundings of his early life\n were not only obscure but depressing aud\n disheartening. It was not simply that he\n was the child of poverty. That may be\n a blessing. The real deprivation was not\n in the rudeness of the home or in the\n lowliness of the estate, but in the. lack\n of those incentives to endeavor and stim-\n ulate to ambition which are the heritage\n most of our American boys.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Abraham Lincoln Mas an acute man.\n But we erect no monuments to shrewd-\n ness. We set aside no days for the com-\n memoration of mere American smartness.\n Skill in manipulation, acuteness in deal-\n ing for selfish purposes, may win their\n temporary victories. But the people re-\n serve their memorials for the ability that\n finds its highest display in unselfish de-\n votion to the public good.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln was an expert logician. He\n brought to bear upon his opponents the\n batteries of remorseless logic: But he\n thought honestly and scorned the tricks\n of sophistry. He had a profound con-\n fidence in the reasoning judgment of the\n American people. He disdained all ef-\n forts to capture the populace by other\n means or to employ talents in other than\n fair disputation. He treated opposing ar-\n guments with an extraordinary power of\n analysis. He eviscerated the subject of\n discussion and laid it bare. He presented,\n not abuse, not appeal to the emotions of\n the multitude, but cogent reasoning, and\n thus appeared before the American peo-\n ple representing their idea! of straight-\n forward. hon est representation of the\n truth, applicable to their crisis. Loyalty\n was commanded because reason exerted\n it* sway. Whenever you are tempted to\n think in a discouraging manner of the\n</p>\n<p>\n future of the American Republic, you\n should read the annals of those times\n when the Union itself was in the balance,\n and you should realize how inevitable is\n the final response of the American peo-\n ple to the demands of reason.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln was a humble man, unpreten-\n tious and genuinely democratic. Honors\n did not change him and pride could not\n ! corrupt him. He was a stranger to affecta-\n | tion. He was a humane man, a man of\n ! emotion well controlled, a man of senti-\n ment apd deep feeling. No one who has\n j lived among us has been so much a\n brother to every man, however lowly born\n or unfortunately circumstanced. He was\n a lowly man who never asserted himself\n as superior to his fellows. Yet he could\n rise in the dignity of his manhood to a\n majesty that has not been surpassed by\n any ruler of any people under aDy form\n of government.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0018/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 319, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 486}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0018/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 639, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 973}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0018/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1279, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1946}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0018/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2559, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3892}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0018/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/li/nc/ol/nc/en/te/na/ry/00/un/se/lincolncentenary00unse/lincolncentenary00unse_0018.jp2", "height": 3892, "width": 2559, "levels": 6, "size": 694728}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"18\">\n<p>\n Lincoln s Boyh ood\n</p>\n<p>\n By KATHERINE GLOVER.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 .N tile heart of the untrorl brown |\n winter ' .von. is of southern Indiana, j\n on L:Ulo Pigeon Creek. ;t lean-to\n camp of logs stands as Uio sole j\n outpost of civilization.

A stocky, strong, but Inzy-look- 1\n It ' S mail, with good nature beaming in\n b;s face, sits on one of llio three-legged\n stools beforn tho blaze, hugging his\n knees, while be spins a yarn to two\n small listeners; one. a gild of about 0,\n who sits at his feet, and another a\n funny, spindly boy. a little younger in\n years, perhaps, but stretching to a good\n wiry length ns ho lies on his stomach\n before tlie Bre anil lifts up to his father\n a strange, homely, eager, little face,\n with dark eyes that gleam and dream\n as tie drinks In the story of adventures\n with the Indians back in the wilds of\n Kc uUieky.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thu only one of tho group on whom\n the shadow of hardship seems to rest\n is the woman, who is in the background\n cleaning the one or two cooking vessels\n that, have been used for the evening meal.\n The lliokering light of the logs shows\n lior a slender, colorless woman; hol-\n low-chested, ' villi dark brown hair that\n lias little contrast, to offer to the yellow-\n ish brown tones of the skin. Her fore-\n head is very prominent, and tn tier eyes\n there is a deep shadow of melancholy,\n as with the provision of some tragedy\n to cornu. Those eyes constantly watch\n the group before the fire with a certain\n wistful, half scornful tenderness as they\n rest on the man so absorbed in bis tale,\n lost to any thought of shame at those\n unpromising surroundings of tils family,\n and with a warm flash of love as they\n wander to the two children, lingering\n longest on the face of the boy.\n</p>\n<p>\n When Nancy Hanks married Tom l.ln-\n coln some ten years ago in the settle-\n ment in Kentucky people thought she\n married a little beneath her. \" Tlfe\n Hankses are some smarter\u2019n the Lin-\n colns. \" was the general opinion of the\n settlement, but as to social standing\n there was no difference except that\n there was hint of a strain of good Vir-\n ginia blood in the Hanks family. The\n Hankses were considered \" the finest,\n singers and shooters in the country,\u201d\n and at camp meeting they were among\n</p>\n<p>\n tho leaders. Tcim Lincoln never was\n much of a leader in anything except in\n spinning a yarn, but lazy, good-natured\n Tom was pretty sure to be willing to\n help a neighbor in a difficulty II it didn ' t\n call for too much physical exertion, aDd\n he would share his last crust with him\n ungrudgingly. And lie surely had a way\n with the girls, so that Nancy was a\n very beaming bride when she mid Tom\n made their vows before the parsou.\n</p>\n<p>\n lint things hadn ' t gone so well with\n them in Kentucky. Farming was hard\n work and Tom liked to fish and hunt\n and tell stories better than to wrestle\n witii l be grudging soil, and so after a\n while, hearing talcs of the glories of\n Indiana, the Lincolns with their two\n children, Abe and \" Sairy.\u201d set out for\n the Western wilderness, and took up\n th-ir abode in the rough camp that\n Tom with the help of Aba threw to-\n gether.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the boy this first winter has been\n great sport. It mattered little to him\n that his bed up under the roof was pad-\n ded with leaves and boughs and that the\n covering was scant and the cold came\n in sharply throiigh the cracks. There\n has been the spur of newness, with the\n spirit of adventure and discovery always\n present. He has been much in the woods\n with his father, trapping rabbits and\n muskrats and shooting fowl for food to\n eat. The thirst for hooks, already\n aroused in him by his few weeks of\n schooling in Kentucky and feebly en-\n couraged by the busy mother, has been\n for the little while forgot. - though the\n dreams and the Imaginings have been\n whetted by the fresh life and the soli-\n tude.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is pretty lonely on Little Pigeon\n Creek with no neighbors to halloo to\n across the fields and no familiar face\n to see occasionally, but within a year\n the Sparrows. Tom and Betsy, relatives\n of Nancy, with Dennis Hanks, a boy of\n IS, nnd Tom\u2019s mol her and other relatives,\n emigrate and take up life at the side\n of Tom and Nancy ' s family, who vacate\n their first hut for the use of the Spar-\n row* and move into one a trifle better\n and bigger.\n</p>\n<p>\n With the beginning of this little settle-\n ment. life opens up to the Lincolns. The\n town of Oentryville Is only a mile and\n a half away, and soon strangers begin to\n pass their way. and a thread of connec-\n tion is established with civilization.\n Homely, droamy-eyed Abe is growing\n hungry for people and happenings, after\n his season of exile and contact only with\n tlie woods and the wilds. The sight of a\n stranger brings him to the front of the\n cabin tenSe with interest. The whole\n group Js likely to gather to hear what\n tales the travelers bring of the outside\n world Tom has hardly time to drawl out\n his hospitable. \u201cLight, stranger.\u201d before\n the boy. forgetting his shyness and every-\n thing else but. Lite possibilities of news\n and information the stranger holds out.\n has thrust some eager question. That\n answered, he fires another, and is ready\n with another when Tom cuffs him on the\n head with a curt, \" Shut up; ain\u2019t you got\n no better manners than to pester a\n stranger to death with questions. Git\n away. \"\n</p>\n<p>\n Aha slinks off to find Dennis, who is his\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n confidant and companion, In spite of Ihe\n difference In years. \" Denny. \" he com-\n plains, \" Pap thinks it ain\u2019t polite to ask\n folks so many questions.

The\n only doctor is thirty-live miles away.\n Drugs are hardly known. There is no\n money to pay a doctor if one should bo\n necessary. The little group of relatives\n live in dread of the sickness, and close\n on the heels or tho dread comes the real-\n ity. Both Tom and Betsy Sparrow are\n stricken with it. aud both died of it. The\n little community grows smaller. Then\n Tom\u2019s mother is seized and in a few\n weeks she. too. is dead, and then tho\n sleuder, melancholy Nancy succumbs The\n shadow grows black over the little Lin-\n coln cabin. In a week after Naucv is\n seized she ealls her two children to her\n and bids them good-by. It is a Wretched\n trio she leaves huddled in tho cabin at\n her death. There has been little demon-\n stration and show of affection in tlie\n pioneer family. There were too many\n hardships to he faced and overcome, but\n the ties were strong aud the snapping\n leaves the hearts of thoso that are left\n sore and smarting. Perhaps Nancy was\n not sorry to go except for leaving her\n two helpless bairns, for hers had been\n no gentle path, but Abo and Sairy aud\n lom find It very lonely in her absence.\n There had been no doctor to attend her\n in her sickness; there is no undertaker\n to bury her. Silently Tom and Dennis\n Hanks, with Abe helping, set to work to\n make the coffin to hury her in. Even the\n pegs that hold it together must be whit-\n tled. for there are no nails to bo had\n</p>\n<p>\n It is a dreary winter that drags by\n after Nancy ' s going. Little Sairy does\n the best she can to cook and clean for\n the three men\u2014 Dennis lives with them\n now\u2014 but it. is half-hearted work. She is\n so lonely that she curls down by the fire\n and cries her heart out at times. Dennis\n and Abe go forth in the woods to find\n something to give her pleasure. With\n delight they bring back to her one day\n a turtle and another day a baby coon, and\n these pets make her cry out with joy\n but even a cunning baby coon anil a funny\n little turtle don\u2019t quite take the place of\n a mother. They seour the woods in every\n direction for a fawn. Surely that would\n go far towards helping her loneliness, but\n no fawn can be found to reward their\n search.\n</p>\n<p>\n Abe is very busy with his chores and\n his father tries to teach him his trade\n of carpentry, but the boy is hopeless.\n He hates it. and his father finally gives\n it. up as a bad job. \" He\u2019s too lazy; ain\u2019t\n good for uothin\u2019 but readin\u2019 an\u2019 cipher-\n in ' .\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n * * *\n</p>\n<p>\n Tom has been away for several weeks\n and Abe and Sairy and Dennis have man-\n aged In the cabin bv themselves as best\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0019/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 489}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0019/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 978}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0019/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1957}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0019/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3914}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0019/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/li/nc/ol/nc/en/te/na/ry/00/un/se/lincolncentenary00unse/lincolncentenary00unse_0019.jp2", "height": 3914, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 697920}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"19\">\n<p>\n LINCOLN CENTENARY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15\n</p>\n<p>\n they can. Tom set out for Kentucky, for\n what purpose the trio knows/ not, but\n they are beginning to scan the road im-\n patiently for his return. One day the\n creak of wheels is heard, and a wagon\n is seen coming toward the cabin. The\n three are strained with the eagerness of\n watching by the time it draws up, and\n when Abe and Salry and Dennis see with-\n in the wagon not only Tom, but a woman\n and two little girls and a boy, their eyes\n are nearly popping out of their three\n separate heads. Tom surely had not\n gone to Kentucky for nothing. When a\n new mother and the new sisters and\n brother are introduced to the young Lin-\n colns and they catch a glimpse of the good\n stock of furniture their new mother has\n brought along with her, there is not only\n astonishment but joy in their lonesome\n little hearts.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now begins a new era in the Pigeon j\n Creek cabin. The new mother immedi-\n ately on alighting from the wagon lines\n up all the children before her and. hav-\n ing the trough outside filled with water,\n gives them a needed scrubbing. In a\n hurry things are put to rights in the\n cabin, the new furniture is installed,\n pewter dishes and knives and forks are\n introduced, Abe has a mattress to sleep\n on and warm bedding. Tom is set to work\n filling up the chinks in the cabin, plas-\n tering it and supplying door and win-\n dows. Within a week the bustling, kind-\n ly woman has made a home of a hut and\n is mothering the motherless children in\n a way they have never known before.\n Abe\u2019s fondness for books is found out, and\n she has him packed off to school and for-\n bids any interruption when he huddles\n down of an evening with a book, munch-\n ing his supper of corn dodgers while he\n reads.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2022 \u2022 \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n Going to mill is one of the experiences\n in the life of Abe, who as he grows into\n his teens is stretching out to marvelous\n length, growing homelier with the years,\n more wiry and sinewy but with a strange\n far-off light coming into his eyes. Going\n to mill is more exciting than fishing in\n the creek, setting traps for rabbits, going\n coon huuting with Tom and Dennis, drop-\n ping corn or ploughing, more exciting\n even than following up bees to find the\n bee tree. The mill is seven miles away\n and Abe is allowed to go on the old gray,\n flea-bitten mule. Going to mill means\n carrying one\u2019s own sack of corn, it means\n awaiting one ' s turn for grinding, it means\n sometimes one or two trips before enough ;\n meal is ground, but it also means meet-\n ing the other boys from the neighbor-\n hood, it means talking\u2014 and Abe likes\n talking\u2014 it means, perhaps, gaining some\n new fact or some fresh hint of the world\n beyond Gentryville.\n</p>\n<p>\n One day when Abe goes to the mill on\n the old gray mule he has to wait until\n sundown for his turn to have the corn\n ground. Each person has ' to furnish his\n own power, so Abe. mounting the arm of\n the wheel hitches the mule to it. The\n</p>\n<p>\n old gray mule is slow and not easy of\n persuasion. A be keeps urging her on\n with \u201cGet up, you old hussy.\u201d But the\n old hussy has a different way of looking\n at it. Finally, with patience exhausted,\n she swiftly lifts both of her hind legs\n and hits the impatient Abe in the head.\n The boy falls off the arm unconscious\n and bleeding. In much alarm his father\n is sent for and carried him home. Dur-\n ing most of that night, Abe lies uncon-\n scious. Toward morning he stirs, and the\n j first words he says are, \u201cYou old hussy. \"\n</p>\n<p>\n The incident lingers in the boy\u2019s mem-\n ory. He turns it over in his mind and\n se\u00abks a scientific explanation of it in\n this way: that when the old gray mule\u2019s\n heels came in contact with his head he\n had just got out the words, \u201cGet up\u201d: the\n sentence stopped half-cocked and the rest i\n was only fired off when consciousness re-\n turned.\n</p>\n<p>\n At 13 Abe has quite a library; three\n whole books and each dearly come by.\n These are \u201cAesop\u2019s Fables,\u201d \u201cArabian\n Nights\u201d and \u201cWeems\u2019 Life of Washing-\n ton.\u201d With one of the three he crouches\n before the fire every evening and hun-\n grily devours It. It is too good to be\n kept to himself alone. The Arabian\n Nights\u2019 tales or Aesop he reads aloud\n in bits to his stepmother, who sits by\n with her patchwork, and to Dennis, who\n is lazily whittling. When Abe throws |\n back his head and laughs the other two i\n laugh with him. though not always very I\n certain at what they are laughing. Some-\n times Dennis, growing reflective, puts ill I\n the comment, \u201cAbe, them yarns is all j\n lies.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Abe, without putting down his book, j\n says, \u201cMighty darn good lies, Denny,\u201d\n and ' proceeds with his reading.\n</p>\n<p>\n Abe begins to do odd jobs for the\n neighbors around Gentryville, and some-\n times in exchange for his work he has the\n privilege of reading a new book and add-\n ing to his store of accumulating knowl-\n edge. At the village store in Gentry-\n ville there is an occasional newspaper\n over which he pores, and storing up its :\n information in his mind, spouts it gen- I\n erously to whomever will listen. He\n writes all over the walls of his home\n until \u201cAbraham Lincoln, Abraham Lin-\n coln.\u201d with splendid flourishes, adorns\n every available space. After writing it.,\n he stands off admiringly and says to\n Dennis, \u201cLook at that, will you \u2014 \u2018Abra-\n ham Lincoln\u2019 \u2014 that spells me. Denny.\n Dan\u2019t look a blamed bit like me, does\n it?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Tom is not much for learning, and he\n finally indignantly protests against the\n disfiguring of the walls, so Abraham\n takes to the woods and carves his namo\n on the trees his father is going to cut\n down, and then writes it with his toe in\n the sand.\n</p>\n<p>\n * \u2022 \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n He is now at 13, stretched almost to\n his full height of six feet four, and his\n stepmother despairs of ever keeping his I\n breeches in any sort of :o:ineetloa w ' .iii\n</p>\n<p>\n his boot-tops. But Abe is growing more\n particular with his rude toilet. He wants\n some white shirts, ami his stepmother\n urges him to get some cloth so she can\n make them for him. He secures a job\n of cutting wood for a man in the neigh-\n borhood. and cutting nine cords of\n wood manages finally to procure nine\n yards of unbleached cotton. This Mrs.\n Lincoln bleaches and out of it makes\n Abe his first two white shirts, one of\n which he very proudly dons every Sun-\n day.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the meantime Abe\u2019s desultory school-\n ing lias fjeen going on. The sehoolhouse\n is a long way from his home, and the\n schoolmasters are not able to imna r \u2019\n much more than Abe knows himself, but\n he is a very faithful scholar when the\n crops doesn ' t interfere. It is a great\n event at Crawford\u2019s School where Abe\n is enrolled when he io 14, when Mr. Craw-\n ford inaugurates a class in manners\n The scholars are required to enter the\n rough, uncouth little sehoolhouse as if\n it were a drawing-room or parlor; they\n j are trained in introducing one another\n and in exchanging greetings To the\n | backwoods scholars who lino no other\n social festivities than log-rollings or oc-\n casional wedding feasts, this is a mat-\n ter for much merriment, and when long,\n awkward Abe tries his hand at the gentle\n art, the girls\u2019 giggles and the boys\u2019\n whoops are unrestrained.\n</p>\n<p>\n But if Abe is the least apt pupil\n in \u201cmanners.\u201d in the things that are to\n be learned out of books he is always the\n best and especially in spelling, so that\n from all spelling matches he is final! '\n debarred. There is one girl in the class\n Kate Roby, whom it distresses the\n gawky Abe beyond measure to see de-\n feated in a match, because Kate is pret-\n ty and rosy-cheeked and hath a roguish\n eye.

This\n rail splitter, this boy who passed his un-\n gainly youth in the dire poverty of the\n poorest of the frontier folk, whose rise\n was by weary and painful labor, lived to\n lead his people through the burning\n flames of a struggle from which the na-\n tion emerged, purified as by fire, born\n anew to a loftier life. After long years\n of iron effort, and of failure that came\n more often than victory, ho at last rose\n to the leadership of the Republic, at the\n momenl when that leadership had be-\n come the stupendous world-task of the\n time. He grew to know greatness, but\n never ease. Success came to him. but\n never happiness, save that which spriugs\n from doing well a painful and a vital\n task.\n</p>\n<p>\n Power Was His, but Not Pleasure.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cPower was his. but not pleasure. The\n furrows deepened on his brow, but his\n eyes were undlmmed by either hate or\n fear. Uis gaunt shoulders were bowed,\n but his steel thews never faltered as he\n bore for a burden the destinies of his\n people. His great and tender heart\n shrank from giving pain; and the task\n allotted him was to pour out like water\n the life-blood of the young men. and to\n feel in jiis every fiber the sorrow of the\n women. Disaster saddened but never dis-\n mayed him. As the red years of war\n went by they found him ever doing his\n duty in the present, ever facing the\n future ' tiith fearless front, high of heart\n and dauntless of soui. Unbroken by\n hatred, unshaken by scorn, he worked and\n suffered for the people. Triumph was his\n at the last; and barely had he tasted it\n before murder found him. and the kindly,\n patient, fearless eyes were closed forever\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAs a people we are indeed beyond\n measure fortunate in the characters of\n the two greatest of our public men.\n Washington and Lincoln Widely though\n they differed in externals, the Virginia\n landed gentleman and the Kentucky back-\n woodsman, they were alike in essentials,\n</p>\n<p>\n they were alike in the great qualities\n which rendered each able to render serv-\n ice to his nation and to all mankind such\n as no other man of his generation could\n or did render. Each had lofty ideals, but\n each in striving to attain these lofty\n ideals was guided by the soundest com-\n mon sense. Each possessed inflexible\n courage in adversity, and a soul wholly\n unspoiled by prosperity. Each possessed\n all the gentler virtues commonly exhib-\n ited by good men who lack rugged\n strength of character Each possessed\n also the strong qualities commonly ex-\n hibited by those towering masters of\n mankind who have too often shown them-\n selves devoid of so much as the under-\n standing of the words by which we signify\n the qualities of duty, of mercy, of de-\n votion to the right, of lofty disinterested-\n ness in battling for the good of others\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThere have been other men as great\n and other men as good, but in all the\n history of mankind there are no other,\n two great men as good as these, no other\n two good men as great. Widely though\n the problems of to-day differ from the\n problems set for solution to Washington\n when he founded this nation, to Lincoln\n when he saved it and freed the slave, yet\n the qualities they showed in meeting\n these problems are exactly the same as\n those we should show in doing our work\n to-day.\n</p>\n<p>\n He Saw Into the Future.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln saw into the future with the\n prophetic imagination usually vouchsafed\n only to the poet and the seer. He had\n in him all the lift toward greatness of\n the visionary, without any of the vision-\n ary\u2019s fanaticism or egotism, without any\n of the visionary\u2019s narrow jealousy of the\n practical man and inability to strive in\n practical fashion for the -realization of an\n ideal. He had the practical man\u2019s hard\n o- imon sense and willingness to adapt\n mians to ends, but there was in him\n none of that morbid growth of mind aud\n soul which blinds so many practical men\n to the higher things of life. No more\n practical man ever lived than this homely\n backwoods Idealist: but he had nothing\n in common with those practical men\n whose consciences are warped until they\n fall to distinguish between good and evil,\n fail to understand that strength, ability,\n shrewdness, whether in the world of busi-\n ness or of politics only serve to make\n their possessor a more noxious, a more\n evil member of the community If they are\n not guided and controlled by a fine and\n high moral sense\n</p>\n<p>\n \" We \u00bbf this day must try to solve\n many social and industrial problems, re-\n quiring to an especial degree the combi-\n nation or indomitable resolution with\n</p>\n<p>\n cool-headed sanity. We can profit by\n tl.j way in which Lincoln used both\n these traits as he strove for reform.\n We can learn much of value from the\n very attacks which, following that course,\n brought upon his head attacks alike by\n the extremists of revolution and by the\n extremists of reaction. He never wa-\n vered in devotion to his principles, in\n his love for the Union, and in his ab-\n horrence of slavery. Timid and luke-\n warm people were always denouncing\n him because he was too extreme; but as\n a matter of fact he never went to ex-\n tremes, he worked step by step; and be-\n cause of this the extremists hated and\n denounced him with a fervor which now\n seems to us fantastic in its deification\n of the unreal and the impossible. At\n the very time when one side was holding\n him up as the apostle of social revola-\n tion because he was against slavery, the\n leading abolitionist denounced him as\n the \u2018slave hound of Illinois.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n Attacked for Radicalism and Non-\n Radicalism.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWhen he was the second time candi-\n date for President, the majority of his\n opponents attacked him because of what\n they termed his extreme radicalism,\n while a minority threatened to bolt his\n nomination because he was not radical\n enough. He had continually to check\n those who wished to go forward too fast,\n at the very time that he overrode the\n opposition of those who wished not to\n go forward at all. The goal was never\n dim before his vision: but he picked his\n way cautiously, without either halt or\n hurry, as he strode toward it, through\n such a morass of difficulty that no man\n of less courage would have attempted it,\n while it would surely have overwhelmed\n any man of judgment less serene.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cVet perhaps the most wonderful thing\n of all. and, from the standpoint, of the\n America of to-day and of the future, the\n most vitally important, was the ex-\n traordinary way in which Lincoln could\n fight valiantly against what he deemed\n wrong and yet preserve undiminished his\n love and respect for the brother from\n whom he differed. In the hour of a\n triumph that would have turned any\n weaker man\u2019s head, in the heat of a\n struggle which spurred many a good man\n to dreadful vindictiveness, he said truth-\n fully that so long as he had been in his\n office he had never willingly planted a\n thorn in any man\u2019s bosom, and besought\n his supporters to study the incidents of\n the trial through which they were pass-\n ing as philosophy from which to learn\n wisdom and not as wrongs to be avenged;\n ending with the solenm exhortation that,\n as the strife was over, all should reunite\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0023/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 489}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0023/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 978}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0023/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1957}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0023/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3914}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0023/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/li/nc/ol/nc/en/te/na/ry/00/un/se/lincolncentenary00unse/lincolncentenary00unse_0023.jp2", "height": 3914, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 425332}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"23\">\n<p>\n LINCOLN CENTENARY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 19\n</p>\n<p>\n In a common effort to save their common\n country.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lived in Days That Were Great and\n Terrible.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHe lived in days that were great and\n terrible, when brother fought against\n brother for what each sincerely deemed\n to be the right.

BRYAN AND HON. JAMES BRYCE, BRITISH AMBASSADOR, AT\n THE FORMER HOME AND CRAVE OF LINCOLN, FEBRUARY 12, 1909,\n</p>\n<p>\n Mi*. Bryan ' s Address.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Lincoln\u2019s fame as a statesman and as\n the nation\u2019s chief executive in its most\n crucial period has so overshadowed his\n fame as an orator that his merits as a\n public speaker have not been sufficiently\n emphasized. When it is remembered that\n his nomination was directly due to the\n prominence which he won upon the\n stump; that in the most remarkable se^\n ries of debates known to history he held\n his own against one of the most brilliant\n orators America has produced, and that to\n his speeches, more than to the arguments\n of any other one man, or, in fact, of all\n other public men combined, was due the\n success of his party \u2014 when all these facts\n are borne in mind it will appear plain,\n even to the casual observer, that too lit-\n tle attention has been given to the ex-\n traordinary power which he exercised as\n a speaker. The debates with Douglas\n have never had a parallel in this ' , or. so\n far as history shows, in aDy other coun-\n try.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cOn one side an institution supported\n by history and tradition a.nd on the other\n a growing sentiment against the holding\n of a human being in bondage \u2014 these pre-\n sented a supreme issue. Douglas won\n the senatorial seat for which the two at\n that time had contested, but Lincoln won\n a larger victory \u2014 he helped to mold the\n sentiment that was dividing parties and\n rearranging the political map of the\n country.\n</p>\n<p>\n ' Wo other American .President has ever\n so clearly owed his elevation to his ora-\n tory Washington. Jefferson and Jackson,\n the Presidents usually mentioned in con-\n nection with him, were all poor scholars.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" In anlyzing Lincoln\u2019s characteristics\n as a speaker one is impressed with the\n completeness of his equipment. He pos-\n sessed the two things that are absolutely\n essential to effective speaking \u2014 namely,\n information and earnestness. If one can\n be called eloquent who knows what he\n is talking about and means what be\n says \u2014 and I know of no better definition\u2014\n Uncoln\u2019s speeches were eloquent. He\n was thoroughly informed upon the sub-\n ject; be was prepared to meet his oppo-\n nent upon the general proposition dis-\n cussed, or upon any deductions which\n could be drawn from it.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWhile the printed pagp cannot fully\n reproduce the impressions made by a\n voice trembling with emotion or tender\n with, pathos, one cannot read the reports\n of the debates without feeling that Lin-\n \u00aboin regarded the subject as far tran-\n</p>\n<p>\n scending the ambitions or the personal\n Interests of the debaters. It was of lit-\n tle moment, he said, whether they voted\n him or Judge Douglas up or down, but.\n it was tremendously important that the\n question should be decided rightly. His\n reputation may have suffered in the opin-\n ion of some, because he made them think\n so deeply upon what he said that they,\n for the moment, forgot him altogether,\n and yet, is this not the very perfection\n of speech? It is the purpose of the ora-\n tor to persuade, and to do this he pre-\n sents not himself but his subject. Some\n one in describing the difference between\n Demosthenes and Cicero said that \u2018when\n Cicero spoke people said, how well Cicero\n speaks, but when Demosthenes spoke,\n they said, let us go against Philip.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n -\u201cXo one has more clearly stated the\n fundamental objections to slavery than\n Lincoln stated them, and he had a great\n advantage over his opponent in being\n able to state those objections frankly,\n for Judge Douglas neither denounced nor\n defended slavery as an institution \u2014 his\n plan embodied a compromise and he could\n not discuss slavery upon its merits with-\n out alienating either the slave owner or\n the abolitionist.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Brevity is the soul of wit, and a part\n of Lincoln\u2019s reputation for wit lies in his\n ability to condense a great deal into a\n few words. He was epigrammatic.\n</p>\n<p>\n ' \" His Gettysburg speech is not sur-\n passed. if equaled, in beauty, simplicity,\n force and appropriateness by any speech\n of the same length in any language. It\n is the w ' orld\u2019s model in eloquence, ele-\n gance and condensation. He might safely\n rest his reputation as an orator on that\n speech ' alone.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" He understood the power of the inter-\n rogatory, for some of his most powerful\n arguments were condensed into questions.\n Of all those who discussed the evils of\n separation and the advantages to be de-\n rived from the ' preservation of the Union,\n no one ever put the matter more forcibly\n than Lincoln did when, referring to the\n possibility of war and the certainty of\n peace some time, even if the Union was\n divided, he called attention to the fact\n that the same question would have to be\n dealt with, and then asked. ' Can enemies\n make treaties easier than friends can\n make laws?\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHe made frequent use of Bible lan-\n guage and of illustrations drawn from\n Holy Writ. It is said that when he was\n preparing his Springfield speech in 1858\n he spent hours trying to find language\n that would express the idea that domi-\n nated his entire career, namely, that a\n republic could not permanently endure\n half free and half slave, and that finally\n a Bible passage flashed through his mind,\n and he exclaimed. M have found it \u2014 \u201cA\n house divided against itself cannot\n stand.\u201d \u2019 and probably no other Bible\n passage ever exerted as much influence\n</p>\n<p>\n as this one in the settlement of a great\n controversy.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" With no military career to dazzle the\n eye or excite the imagination, with no\n public service to make his name familiar\n to the reading public, his elevation to the\n Presidency would have been impossible\n without his oratory. The eloquence of\n Demosthenes and Cicero was no more nec-\n essary to their work and Lincoln de-\n serves to have his name written on the\n scroll with theirs.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Bryce ' s Address.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cYou are met to commemorate a great\n man, one of your greatest; great in what\n he did, even greater in what he was,\u201d\n said Mr. Bryce. \" One hundred years have\n passed since, in a lowly hut in the bor-\n der State of Kentucky, this child of ob-\n scure and unlettered parents was born\n into a country then still wild and thinly\n peopled. Three other famous men were\n born in that same year in England \u2014 Al-\n fred Tennyson, the most gifted poet who\n has used our language since Wordsworth\n died; William Gladstone, the most power-\n ful. versatile and hieh-mindcd statesman\n of the last two generations in Britain,\n and Charles Darwin, the greatest natural-\n ist since Linnaeus and chief among the\n famous scientific discoverers of the nine-\n teenth century. It was a wonderful year.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" I Was an undergraduate student in the\n University of Oxford when the Civil War\n broke out. I recollect how it slowly\n dawned upon Europeans in 1S62 and 1863\n that the President could be no ordinary\n man, because he never seemed cast down\n by the reverses which befell his arms, be-\n cause hefnever let himself be hurried into\n premature action nor feared to take so\n bold a step as the Emancipation Proc-\n lamation was when he saw- that the time\n had arrived. And above all, I remember\n the shock of awe and grief which thrilled\n all Britain when the news came that he\n had perished by the bullet of an assassin.\n There have been not a few murders of the\n heads of states in our time, but none\n smote us with such fiorror and such pity\n as the death of this great, strong and mer-\n ciful man in the moment when his. long\n and patient efforts had been crowned with\n victory and peace had just begun to shed\n her rays over a land laid waste by the\n march of armies.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" A man may be great by intellect or\n by character, or by both. The highest\n men are great by both, and of these was\n Abraham Lincoln.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Rarely, indeed, has it happened in his-\n tory, hardly at all could it have happened\n in the last century outside of America,\n that one born in poverty, with no help\n throughout his youth from intercourse\n with educated people, with no friend to\n back him except those whom the imprev\n sion of his own personality brought\n round him, should so rise. \"\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0025/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 489}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0025/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 978}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0025/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1957}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0025/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3914}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0025/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/li/nc/ol/nc/en/te/na/ry/00/un/se/lincolncentenary00unse/lincolncentenary00unse_0025.jp2", "height": 3914, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 679162}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"25\">\n<p>\n Address of Booker T .

'\n If this is true of the ordinary man, how\n much more true is it of the hero of the\n hour and the century \u2014 Abraham Lincoln!\n One hundred years of the life and influ-\n ence of Lincoln is the story of the strug-\n gles. the trials, ambitions and triumphs\n of the people of our complex American\n civilisation. Knit into the life of Abra-\n ham Lincoln is the story and success of\n the nation in the blending of all tongues,\n religions, colors, races, into one com-\n posite nation, leaving each group and\n race free to live its own separate social\n life, and yet all a part of the great whole.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe signing of the Emancipation Proc-\n lamation was a great event, and yet it\n was but the symbol of another, still\n greater and more momentous. We who\n celebrate this anniversary should not for-\n get. that the same pen that gave freedom\n to 4,000.000 of African slaves at the same\n time struck the shackles from the souls\n of 27,000.000 of Americans of another\n color.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cin abolishing slavery Lincoln pro-\n claimed the principle that, even in the\n case of the humblest and weakest of\n mankind, the welfare of each is still the\n good of all. In re-establishing in this\n country the principle that, at bottom, the\n interests of humanity and of the indi-\n vidual arc one. he freed men ' s souls from\n spiritual bondage.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHenceforth no man of any race, either\n in the North or in the South, need feel\n constrained to fear or hate his brother.\n By the same token that Lincoln made\n America free, he pushed back the boun-\n daries of freedom everywhere, gave the\n spirit of liberty a wider influence\n throughout the world, aud re-established\n the dignity of man as man.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBy the same act that freed ray race\n he said to the civilized and uncivilized\n world that man everywhere must be free,\n and that man everywhere must be en-\n lightened, and the Lincoln spirit of free-\n dom and fair play will never cease to\n spread and grow in power until through-\n out the world all men shall know the\n truth, and the truth shall make them\n tree.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cPeople so often forget that by every\n Inch that the lowest man crawls up he\n makes it easier for every other man to\n get up. To-day, throughout the world,\n because Lincoln lived, struggled, and tri-\n umphed, every boy who is ignorant, in\n poverty, despised, or discouraged, holds\n his head a little higher. His heart beats\n a little faster, his ambition to do some-\n thing and be something is a little strong-\n er, because Lincoln blazed the way.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLike Lincoln, the negro race, should\n seek to be simple, without bigotry and\n without ostentation. There is great\n power in simplicity. We, as a race,\n should, like Lincoln, have moral courage\n to be wliat we are, and not pretend to\n be what we are not.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe should keep in mind that no one\n can degrade us except ourselves; that if\n ! we are worthy no influence can defeat as.\n | Like other races, the negro will often\n meet obstacles, often be sorely tried and\n tempted, but we must keep in mind that\n freedom, in the broadest, and highest\n sense, has never been a bequest; it has\n been a conquest. In the final test the\n success of our race will be in proportion\n to the service that it renders to the\n world. In the long run the badge of\n service is the badge of sovereignty.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIn paying my tribute of respect to the\n great emancipator of my race, I desire\n to say a word here and now in behalf of\n an element of brave and true white men\n of the South who, though they saw in\n Lincoln\u2019s policy the ruin of all they be-\n lieved in and hoped for. have loyally ac-\n cepted the results of the Civil War and\n | are to-day working with a courage few\n 1 people in the North can understand to\n uplift the negro in the. South and com-\n [plete the emancipation that Lincoln be-\n gan.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI am tempted to say. that it certainly\n required as high a degree of courage for.\n men of the type of Robert. E. Lee and\n : John B. Gordon to accept the results of\n the war in the manner and spirit whieh\n they did as that which Grant and SJjer-\n : man displayed in fighting the physical\n battles that saved the Union.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Lincoln lives to-day because he had\n I the courage which made him refuse to\n hate the man at the South or the man at\n I the North when they did not agree wdth\n j him. He had the courage as well as the\n patience and foresight to suffer in si-\n ) lence, to refuse to revile when reviled,\n j For lie knew that if he was right the\n | ridicule of to-day would be the applause\n ! of to-morrow. He knew, too, that at\n some time in the distant future our na-\n tion would repent of the folly of cursing\n our public servants while they live and\n blessing them only when they die.\n</p>\n<p>\n I \u201cIn this connection I cannot refrain\n j from suggesting the question to the mil-\n I lions of voices raised to-day in his\n I praise, \u2018Why did you not say it yester-\n ^day?\u2019 \u2014 yesterday, when one word of ap-\n</p>\n<p>\n proval and gratitude would have meant\n so much to him in strengthening his\n hand and heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAs we gather here, brothers all, in\n the common joy and thanksgiving for the\n life of Lincoln, may I not ask that you.\n the worthy representatives of 70,000.1)00\n of white Americans, join heart and hand\n with the 10,000,000 of black Americans \u2014\n these 10,000.000 who speak your tongue,\n profess your religion\u2014 -who have never\n lifted their voices or hands except in de-\n fense of their country\u2019s honor and their\n country\u2019s flag and swear eternal fealty to\n the memory and the traditions of the\n sainted Lincoln?\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI repeat, may we not join with your\n race and let all of us here highly re-\n solve rh3t justice, good-will and peace\n shall be the motto of our lives? If tbiB\n be true, Lincoln shall not have lived and\n j died in vain.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAnd. finally, gathering inspiration and\n j encouragement from this hour and Lin-\n | coin\u2019s life, I pledge to you and to the\n | Nation that my race, in ' so far as I can\n ' speak for it, which, in the past, whether\n jin ignorance or intelligence, whether in\n j slavery or in freedom, has always been\n j true to the Stars aud Stripes and to\n the highest and best interests of this\n country, will strive to so deport itself\n that it shall reflect nothing but the high-\n est credit upon the whole people In the\n North and in the South.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n During the address of Mr. Washington\n he turned impressively to Mr. A. H. Bur-\n { roughs, a grandson of his former master,\n ! and. though not a part of the prepared\n | speech, he spoke very feelingly of the old\n i acquaintance as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThere sits a man who is the grand-\n son of Joseph Burroughs, who was my\n owner down in Franklin County, Ya.,\n when I was a slave.

He grew to\n manhood amid the fierce contests of\n the Federalists. Republicans and Dem-\n ocrats, and in early manhood witnessed\n the strife over the Missouri Compromise\n measures, the Mexican War and later\n the Kansas border wars, himself taking\n high ground against the extension of\n slavery into the territories. He drank\n in liberty and the love of his fellow men\n from his earliest moments, and it grew\n with his growth and strengthened with\n his strength until he was called hence\n as his country\u2019s martyr.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" He was largely a man of one pur-\n pose, not to say one idea. He was\n something of a Cromwell, without his\n hatreds. His frontier life was lonely,\n and necessarily promotive of independ-\n ence. self-reliance and liberty. It was\n equally conducive to democracy -iv-\n ernment and close touch with the people.\n His growth into manhood had no class\n prejudices, and, being close to nature,\n the very air he breathed was promotive\n of the belief that all men were created\n equal. There was nothing but equality\n of all men at Pigeon Creek. Ind., and\n New Salem. 111. That one man could en-\n slave another was abhorrent to every\n sense of justice of those frontier people.\n The color of a man\u2019s skin was \" Ot a\n criterion of superiority among the hardy\n pioneers of the western civilization of\n this Republic from 1830 to 1850.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHe grew up amid surroundings and\n</p>\n<p>\n influences to strengthen and confirm the\n principles he later exemplified.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe great men in life have been the\n men of a single purpose. Abraham Lin-\n coln was ambitious. He never denied it.\n He always asserted it. His purpose in\n life was political. He wished to serve\n the state. How he came by that desire\n is past finding out. It was undoubtedly\n intuitive. There is not a suggestion in\n history that anyone ever counseled him\n in this direction or urged him upon a\n political career. At 23 years of agf,\n without, so far as wc know, a single\n thing ever having been done or sug-\n gested by him before, lie launched into\n political life in an address to the people\n of Sangamon County on March 9. 1832.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Governor Fort read part of it, and then\n said :\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThis is the first known public writing\n of Lincoln. It is almost as sudden in\n its bursting upon the world as the an-\n nouncement on the banks of the Jordan\n of the Messiah by John the Baptist.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cFrom the day he sent forth this ad-\n dress until the day he fell, a martyr to\n the cause of the freedom of man, he\n never flagged in his ambition to repre-\n sent and be esteemed by the peo-\n ple. His expressed wish that he\n might be \u2018esteemed by his fellow men\u2019\n he realized in life: and in death, his\n memory is revered by countless millions,\n not only of his fellow men. but of all\n seekers after liberty throughout the civ-\n ilized world.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln was, in every respect, consid-\n ering his time and the then methods, an\n ideal politician \u2014 for he was a politician\n in the truest and best sense of that. word.\n He was an intense partisan; yet his\n country was always first and his party\n second.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHe was not a time server. He never\n issued addresses nor constructed mean-\n ingless platforms to deceive the people.\n What he said he uttered in sincerity and\n never swayed from his promises. He\n stood for conditions as they were until\n they could be overthrown by constitu-\n tional methods. He believed in the re-\n public with an intensity born of glorious\n prosperity under it.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHis belief in the people was sanctified\n by their devotion to him. His purposes\n were all noble and elevating. His heart\n bled for the oppressed of the human\n race, and his sense of justice prompted\n him to aid in the overthrow of their op-\n pressors; and in all his public acts and\n utterances there was an underlying reli-\n ance in the justice of his cause, ooupled\n with a firm belief in the ultimate triumph\n of righteousness.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lincoln\u2019s Predominating Characteris-\n tic.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cCourage, the quality of statesmanship\n so needed in our times, was the predomi-\n nating characteristic of Lincoln. As a\n national political leader, his first great\n advance was made in 183S. when he -de-\n</p>\n<p>\n clared in the Springfield convention,\n which nominated him for senator: \u2019A\n house divided against itself cannot stand.\n</p>\n<p>\n I believe this government cannot endure\n permanently half slave and half free. I\n do not expect the Union to be dissolved.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 do not expect the house to fall. It will\n become all one thing or all the other. '\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cConsidering the conditions that existed\n at that time, that was, probably, the most\n courageous statement ever uttered by any\n political leader. It was staking all upon\n a single throw. Lincoln knew it. His\n friends knew it. They counseled that he\n omit It from the speech. But he said,\n \u2018No.\u2019 And while it probably cost him the\n senatorship, it made him the President.\n What a campaign that was between Doug-\n las and Lincoln!\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cDid it ever occur to you that the\n modern suggestion that United States\n senators should be elected by the people\n by nominating conventions or primar.es,\n was not novel in the states? Both Doug-\n las and Lincoln were so nominated by\n their party in 1858. It is the right way.\n The people have a right to know for\n whom their representative is to vote for\n this great office. They have an equal\n right to know what views the prospective\n senator holds on all important public\n questions.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIs it not remarkable that, in all Lin-\n coln\u2019s political career, there is not a sen-\n tence of any letter or public address that\n we would wish he had never written or\n spoken? He was the ideal political lead-\n er. Would we had more like him. Men\n who put principles above party; honor\n above office, brains above money, integ-\n rity above political policy, and country\n above self.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThere L a splendid civic spirit abroad\n in cur day. It is growing. The people are\n quickening in interest in public affairs.\n They are demanding higher principles in\n public service; that public officials shall\n he governed bv a single motive, namely,\n that public office is a public trust, and\n that every official act shall be per-\n formed with the sole object of voicing\n the popular will. In short, that we shall\n have to represent us In all public office*\n men with the principles of Lincoln Repub-\n licans.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWhat a magnificent pilot he was!\n Calm, serene, steady; \u2018with malice toward\n none, with charity for all.\u2019 He piloted\n the ship of state safely. ' We. a reunited\n nation to-night, are all honoring the man\n and his memory. He left us a great re-\n public. Citizenship in it is a high honor.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIn the days of Caesar, the Eagles of\n Rcme dominated the then known world\n and protected a Roman everywhere.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWhen the great apostle to the Gentiles\n stood falsely accused before Festus and\n about to be condemned to death, he\n stayed the hand of the executioner by\n declaring to that magistrate. \u2018I am free\n born and a Roman, and I appeal unto\n Caesar, ' and unto Caesar he did go.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThis republic which Lincoln saved Is\n now recognized as potential in all the na-\n tions known to civili .d man.

Out of that war\n grew this united country. Our people\n sometimes say that the war with Spain\n was expensive and that little has re-\n sulted. 1 think we have been paid many\n times over in the saving which has re-\n sulted in the control of yellow fever.\n Formerly the cost of maintaining a quar-\n antine from the mouth of the Potomac to\n the mouth of the Rio Grande and the\n stopping of commerce and transportation\n in result far exceeded the cost of the\n war. Another result has been the up-\n building of a government in the Philip-\n pines among a people to whom any form\n of self-government has hitherto been un-\n known. I think that wars honestly un-\n dertaken by honest people usually result\n in great good. We sometimes criticise\n the loss of time spent in the army, espe-\n cially in foreign armies, but I think men\n are much better fitted to take up the\n battle of life after, say. two years of\n military training, and I think that it Is a\n good thing to devote a certain portion o*\n our lives to the defense of our country.\n The great work of the army here is to\n keep in touch with the National Guard\n and to improve the system of instruction.\n We do not come as . critics, but as\n brothers in arms, perhaps following the\n trade a little more steadily, and we want\n to get in close and sympathetic touch\n with you and do all we can to help\n you on.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018Pilgrim\u2019s Progress\u2019 he must have been\n acquainted with Faithful and Faintheart\n and the splendid record of Christian\n Reading Crusoe he mu3t have learned to\n meet a position of need, to build up from\n little the things he needed, to be patient\n in the long struggle. In reading the life\n of Washington he mus\u2019 have found much\n similar to his own; tne young fellow\n alone on the prairie, the captain in the\n Indian war. In the life of Clay there\n were many parallels; the boy life, alone\n at 15, the clerk in the grocery store, mak-\n ing his own progress through the law.\n The greatest thing that has come into\n our national education was that uttered\n by William James, when he said to the\n teachers some fourteen or fifteen years\n ago, that there is no reception without\n reaction, there is no impression with-\n out corelating expression, by which he\n meant that one man having the impres-\n sion of another man in nailing nine nails\n into a board has learned loss than the\n man who saw him nail one nail and then\n nailed nine A very learned man In this\n country said. \u201cWhenever I wish to know\n anything about a subject I lecture on it. \"\n When any of us ' care to know anything\n about a subject we mav read, but we do\n not know until we have spoken of it.\n Lincoln read and reread, and then he had\n the reaction and the expression. Words\n meant something to him, and no man\n who ever wrote English wrote words so\n simple and yet so eloauent. Speaking for\n education, he said: \u2018I believe in anything\n that will make for mora\u2019ity, sobriety, en-\n terprise and industry.\u2019 Wendell Holmes\n said: \u2018There are words that have loved\n each other since the bit th of the lan-\n guage. and when they meet that is\n poetry.\u2019 Llnco\u2019n had this poetrv of the\n highest tvpe. No man was ever h ' s equal\n as a master of happy apposites. Lincoln\n was a commander-in-chief because he was\n that simple man, because he want, bark\n to first principles. He defeated Dougins\n because h. took higher moral ground. He\n was a commander-in-chief because he\n could argue only such cases as he felt\n were just; because he had honor; because\n he knew the value of the scriptural\n phrase: ' To him that overcometh snail\n be given.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe cannot .n\u2019l be President, but we\n can all of us deserve to be. We can all\n hare the control of ourselves that Lincoln\n had. We can all of us be cotlimanders-\n in-chief in the degree that he was; to\n recognize behind the physical surround-\n ings the God that was in him, and be\n true to that on all occasions.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Senator Depew\u2019s Address.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cOne of the speakers has said\n that Abraham Lincoln was the first\n</p>\n<p>\n Speech of Augustus Thomas.\n</p>\n<p>\n Augustus Thomas, who was introduced\n by President Latson, as perhaps the\n greatest playwright in America, spoke in\n part as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln was many things to many men.\n The books tell us that in his youth and\n up to manhood, he had in his possession\n only the Bible, \u2018Aesop\u2019s Fables,\u2019 \u2018Pil-\n grims Progress. - \u2018Robinson Crusoe\u2019 and\n ihe lives of Washington and Clay.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln, struggling along on the Bible\n and Aesop and those other books, must\n have read and reread them, and we have\n in our knowledge a glimpse of the forces\n that made the character of this great\n man. A3 a reader of the Bible he must\n have been familiar with utterances of\n David and Jeremiah and Paul, and the old\n fashioned and eternal wisdom of the\n Proverbs; he must have known the pa-\n tience and charity and gentleness of the\n Man of Nazareth. In Aesop\u2019s Fables he\n learned ihat men of all time were like\n himself, and what was true of them was\n eternally true. And he learned to think\n with Emerson that to believe your own\n thoughts, to believe that what is true for\n you in your own heart is true for all\n mankind. That, is genius, and that was\n Lincoln\u2019s genius. As a reader af the\n</p>\n<p>\n product of direct nomination. They\n</p>\n<p>\n must have had a different, system\n</p>\n<p>\n then from now, because, as 1 un-\n derstand it, now the finest product of\n</p>\n<p>\n direct nomination is Isaac Stephenson of\n Wisconsin, at $2 per. I am not here to-\n night to discuss primary nominations, but\n I hope that Brother Kracke, when he gets\n his bill perfected up to date, will make it\n so that things which are done In other\n s-tates will be avoided in our own when\n the system is adopted.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln the man impresses me. from\n my personal recollection of him. more\n than Lincoln the statesmen. As the lat-\n ter he has been my study for forty years,\n but Lincoln the man has been the most\n tender appreciation of my recollection.\n He was the most human creature I ever\n met. I saw him before he was inaugu-\n rated and frequeutly afterward. The\n wonder was in the deronrrptic way In\n which he received everybody that he\n was not assassinated long before the\n tragedy. He took no precautions what-\n ever. The wear and tear of the inces-\n sant demands upon him at the time of\n the war would have killed him except for\n two reasons. One, the extraordinary vi-\n tality which he had gained from (he\n hardy life of his youth, and the other his\n</p>\n<p>\n vast love of fun and bis immense store of\n anecdote. Once I called on him to pay\n my respects, and, after he had got rid\n of a crowd of people, he threw himself\n on the lounge and drew up those long\n * legs of his (the longest I ever sawl, put\n his hands around his knees and, rocking\n back and forth, for upward of an hour\n told me clever stories. Now the reason\n he did that was to relieve his mind. Bui\n he often used a story to get rid of\n troublesome callers. There was a dis-\n tinguished politician from Maryland who\n was constantly calling on President Lin-\n coln, accompanied by a crowd of con-\n stituents, and demanding offices. One day\n he came as usual with his friends and\n Lincoln was weary and ill. Still the man\n forced his way in, and Lincoln said ' ' 1\n am glad to see you, because 1 can give\n every one of you something now.\u2019 They\n ail began to say. ' Thank you. Mr. Presi-\n dent, thank you, Mr. President, ' and the\n politician began Mr. President, I wain\n to say on behalf of the people of Mary-\n land ' \u2018Hold on, hold on. ' broke in the\n</p>\n<p>\n President, \u2018i have got the smallpox. The\n doctor sa\u2019 s mine is a very bad case.\u2019\n And the room was cleared in two rniii-\n utes.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cNow. where did Lincoln get his style?\n M.- impression is (hat writing his com-\n position without anybody lo correct ii\n u-.jon a wooden :hovol he compared It\n with his Shakspeare and his Old Testa-\n ment and the \u2018P.lgrim\u2019s Progress ' He\n had the great courage, which few presi-\n l detjts have had, of calling the greatest\n men of his party to his cabinet, men who\n were his rivals, notably Seward and\n Chase. I want to tell you something of\n his appearance. He was six feet four,\n had enormous hands and feet and was\n very awkward in movement. At first you\n thought he had never had any oppor-\n tunity for culture. When you talked\n with him there was something in his\n t_Ik, something in his face, something\n of dignity and the great mind behind,\n that you left with the impression that\n you had spoken with one of the great\n men of the age. 1 had that impression\n many times. I Faw Lincoln when he\n stepped off his car for a few m nutes\n at Peeksklll while on his way lo Wash-\n ington for his inauguration He was\n cheerful and light hearted though he\n traveled through crowds, many of whom\n were enemies, part of the time in secret\n and all the time in danger of assassina-\n tion. I met him frequently three years\n afterward when care, anxiety and over-\n work had made him look prematurely\n aged. I was one of the committee 1 ft\n charge of the funeral train which was\n bearing his body to his home while on\n its way through the State of New York\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe aye celebrating within a few\n months of each other the tercentenary of\n Milton and the centenaries of Poe and\n Darwin.

We have every rea-\n son to trust the people which moved him\n to place his trust in them and one be-\n sides, Lincoln himself \u2014 the common\n people incarnate in this type-man.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln has conferred a new dignity\n upon labor, but the new dignity of labor\n must include larger dignity and fuller\n life for the toiler. If it be true, as Lin-\n coln has said, that to secure to each\n laborer the whole product of his labor, or\n as nearly as possible, is a worthy object\n cf any good government, then children\n should cease to toil, then Northern capi-\n</p>\n<p>\n tal shall cease to enslave the children of\n the South. Then women must not be\n overworked and underpaid, and must not\n be driven into shame from shop and store\n and factory by a starvation wage, then\n man must have a larger and larger share\n of the fruits of his labor, aJJd the state\n is to cease to be so unwise as to suffer\n the evils of widespread and protracted\n unemployment.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe Lincoln centenary will be of little\n value unless, in the spirit of the Gettys-\n burg address, we make it tell by dedi-\n cating ourselves anew to the things for\n which he lived and died. The important\n thing to-day is not what we say of Lin-\n coln, but what Lincoln would say of us,\n if he were here ir. this hour and could\n note the drift and tendency in American\n life and American politics. Are we true\n to him. are we loyal to his memory? Lin-\n coln is become for us the test of human\n worth, and we honor men in the measure\n in which they approach the absolute\n standard of Abraham Lincoln. Other men\n may resemble aud approach him; he re-\n mains the standard whereby all other\n men are measured and appraised. There\n could be no poorer way of honoring the\n memory of Lincoln than to assume, as\n \u25a0\u201ee sometime* do, that the race of Lin-\n colns has perished from the earth, that\n we shall not look* upon his like again.\n When the Lincoln-like man stands before\n us, let us recognize and honor him fitly.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n At the Lincoln Club, Brooklyn\n</p>\n<p>\n ADDRESS IN PART OF JUSTICE LUKE D. STAPLETON.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" He was the embodiment of common\n sense,\u201d he said, \u201cand had a perfect sense\n of proportion. He had some of the frail-\n ties of mankind, he was endowed with all\n the rugged virtues. He thought fairly\n and concluded accurately. Justice was\n his ideal. To its achievement his match-\n less talents, his untiring energies and\n uncompromising loyalty were devoted. He\n knew the people; he perceived their ha-\n bitual indifference; he felt the thrill of\n their occasional enthusiasm; he knew '\n the rectitude of their aroused purpose; he\n had an abiding faith in the wisdom of\n their final judgment.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHe did not believe that they needed\n civic guardians. He understood that no\n class or type had a monoply of con-\n science, experience or wisdom. He be-\n lieved that all the people were more dis-\n</p>\n<p>\n interestedly patriotic than a few. He had |\n the shrewdness to seek the motive be- J\n hind the professions of voluntary ad- \\\n visers. He was afflicted by no delusion\n concerning politics or human nature.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHe was ever mindful of the eternal\n struggle between the practical and the\n ideal. In the appointment of his Cabinet\n he demonstrated the sagacity of repress-\n ing the hostility of his competitors by\n affirmatively inviting their co-operation,\n and knew that the best way to quiet an-\n noying ambition was to partially gratify\n it. Mis opportunities for culture w r ere,\n meager; his achievements in culture\n were superb. What he knew, he knew '\n thoroughly. He is history\u2019s great ex-\n emplar of simplicity. He knew the value\n of advice, but realized the responsibility\n of decision. He had an instinct for\n</p>\n<p>\n mercy. He made industry a habit. He\n is the one character conspicuous in his-\n ; tory absolutely free from vanity. He\n was infinitely more concerned in the\n triumph of right and justice than in the\n agency by whom it w ' as achieved. He\n craved for the accomplishment of his\n great purpose that he might withdraw\n from the glare and enjoy the true happi-\n ness of private life following public\n service faithfully performed.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln was the demonstration of th '\n wisdom of our form of government. He\n was illustrious without ancestry, noble\n without environment, cultured without\n compromising -elf-respect, great without\n design, famous without ambition, and the\n glory of his career will endure while\n there is a soul to admire virtue and a\n heart to love the greatest of plain men.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0029/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 489}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0029/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 978}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0029/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1957}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0029/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3914}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0029/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/li/nc/ol/nc/en/te/na/ry/00/un/se/lincolncentenary00unse/lincolncentenary00unse_0029.jp2", "height": 3914, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 738088}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"29\">\n<p>\n Centenary of Emancipator Fittingly Observed in\n Schools of Brooklyn \u2014 Extracts of Addresses\n</p>\n<p>\n each of the forty-six school\n districts of the city, exercises\n were held ou February 12. un-\n der the auspices of the Board\n of Education.

Gaynor, at the\n Manual Training High School.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" WhUe the boy Abraham Lincoln was\n being reared on the frontiers in poverty\n and toil, and without schooling, except a\n lew weeks now and then\u2014 not to exceed\n a year in all\u2014 millions of boys all over\n the country, especially of the cities, were\n being thoroughly educated in the schools\n and colleges to be equipped for the af-\n fairs of life. And yet this obscure, hard-\n worked and unschooled boy was to sur-\n pass them all. He had in him the stuff\n and the mettle, and especially the deep-\n rooted aud anxious soul, which constitute\n primacy among men. His destiny was\n rooted in a character which no amount\n of education can bestow. His life illus-\n trates the saying that the power of in-\n struction is seldom of much use. except\n in those happy dispositions in which it\n is almost superfluous. Every one cannot\n have the opportunity and the destiny of\n Abraham Lincoln; but look about you at\n the leaders in every department of life,\n and see what you are capable of. if like\n Lincoln you are firm of faith, self-reliant\n and persevering, little by little, and from\n little things to greater. Patience is the\n possession of great souls, and how God-\n like was the patience of Lincoln.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLook at our great heads or captains\n of industry as they are called. Whence\n came they ' but by the royal road of hard\n toil from the lowest beginnings, and gen-\n erally from youths of hardship and pov-\n erty\u2019 And how many are railing at and\n abusing them! Their hard-earned success\n seems to excite the ill-will of a consid-\n erable number of people. Their courage-\n ous enterprise, and combinations of cap-\n</p>\n<p>\n ' ital are the subjects of unthinking\n clamor. Rather should they excite our\n I admiration ana good will. The natural\n | combination of capital, unfostered and\n unaided by law or government, is a thing\n no one need dread. It will work good\n and notv HI to mankind. But if it be\n built up by government favoritism, which j\n enables a few to destroy their rivals, '\n then It is wicked and fraught with ills.\n Do not attack the honest enterprise of j\n your fellowmen.. but attack these evils\n wherever they exist. Blame your gov- 1\n eminent for them. That many should be |\n made poor that a few may be made rich\n suiteth not a commonwealth, as Crom-\n well said, and Lincoln often said the like.\n Fair play to all and favoritism to noue i\n will still continue to produce your Abra-\n ham Lincolns and your leading men \u2014 [\n statesmen, politicians, business men \u2014 i\n from your own ranks.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln was born and reared among |\n the best kind of people. His character J\n was an inheritance. The people with j\n whom he was born and bred were a\n sterling stock. To mingle with them,\n and be of them, was an education in it-\n self. They came from the schools and\n town meetings of the Easiern States, and\n from the similar institutions of Virginia\n and Kentucky. In character and intelli-\n geree they were not excelled in .the |\n world. They were very far from being\n ignorant. They were laV-abiding, respect-\n ful to authority, but would suffer no un- i\n lawful encroachment, and knew how to!\n keep government at arm\u2019s length, which\n is characteristic of free men It was\n in their blood. \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cit is true that Abraham Lineoln be-\n longed to no Christian church or de-\n nomination; but, oh, how full his great |\n soul was of belief in Almighty God and\n his rulership over this world. His be-\n lief in Almighty God was tender and ab-\n solute. His sublime expression of it in\n some of his utterances moves to tears.\n He was attending the theater on Good\n Friday night when assassinated, almost\n at that hour when the Christian world\n were facing with sorrowful hearts toward\n the hill called Golgotha, where the Son\n of Man hung from the Cross. A good\n many Christian hearts were sore over\n ! this, but they nevertheless felt that\n another great heart had ceased to beat,\n and their sorrow was increased.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 \u201cThe greatness of the epoch in which\n 1 he lived, and of the great men of that\n epoch, the aggregate soul of his day\n and generation, are apotheosized in him\n and make him great forever. Every,\n great epoch is apotheosized in some one\n man; noc always the greatest man, but\n the one about which it centered and j\n I finally evolved. There were other 1\n Lincolns that were never heard of. Not\n every great soul is given opportunity\n to unfold to the world; many go to\n the grave unknown, and sleep in the\n churchyards. ' Some mute, inglorious\n Milton here may rest; some Cromwell,\n guiltless of his country\u2019s blood.\u2019 But\n with all his defects, and slowness of mind\n i and mistakes, the depth of his philoso- i\n phy and human nature makes him stand\n forth forever as one of the world ' s .\n fpw mlers whose figure, like unto that ;\n of Jesus, will grow more and more\n colossal as , he generations recede far- !\n ther and farther from it.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Newell Dwiglit Hillis, at the\n Girls High School.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln had a magic touch; he\n touched a log cabin and transformed It\n into a palace; he touched a few simple\n books and turned them into a university,\n in which he learned the rudiments that\n afterward made him a leader of men.\n George Washington climbed hand over\n hand the golden rungs of the ladder of\n luxury, Abraham Lincoln climbed hand\n over hand up the ladder of success, the\n rungs of which were rails split by his\n own hands. The four golden rules that\n lead to success in this great country\n of ours are liberty, equality, intelligence\n and opportunity. Lincoln, Henry Clay\n and William McKinley are brilliant ex-\n amples of what can be attained by the\n use of opportunity, and they all knew\n what real hardship was in their boy-\n hood and young manhood.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln lay on the floor of his rude\n log cabin before the blazing logs, and\n absorbed the contents of three books \u2014\n the Bible, Aesop\u2019s Fables and Bunyau ' s\n \u201cPilgrim ' s Progress.\u201d His splendid\n brain took in the contents of these\n books as our bodies take in the meat\n and bread that sustain our physical life.\n Later ou. when his opportunity came,\n be was equal to it; God took him\n into the Temple of Fame, and we point\n to him with pride, and say, \u2018There is\n the sort of men we produce in this re-\n public.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWhat are the secrets of the character\n and career of Lincoln? His character\n he inherited from his father and mother.\n Nothing is more common than for editors\n and authors to belittle the parents of\n Lincoln. Nancy Hanks was a bundle\n of apple blossoms that never came tc\n fruit: Thomas Lincoln was a bundle of\n roots that never came to full growth.\n God didn\u2019t perform any miracle when\n Ht created Abraham Lincoln; He gave\n him a good father and mother, and\n gave the child au inheritance beyond\n price. Abraham Lincoln was like Pike ' s\n Peak. You really begin the ascent of\n Pike\u2019s Peak at Omaha, and you climb\n by degrees until you reach the summit\n among the clouds. Study Abraham Lin-\n coln\u2019s ancestry, and you will find that\n he stood on a foundation so strong that\n hi-: forehead strikes against the stars.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln\u2019s written words have never\n been excelled for simplicity and style.\n Simple, racy, beautiful words, learned\n from his study of \u2018The Pilgrim\u2019s Prog-\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln\u2019s belief in God was one of h\u2018 s\n mo 3 t distinguishing characteristics. If\n you take God out of Lincoln\u2019s life it would\n be like taking Jul > and August out of the\n summer time.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThere were many things in which ho\n was not well versed, but he was thor-\n oughly equipped for the work he had in\n hand, which was the preservation of the\n Union. This was never shown to greater\n advantage than in the letter he wrote to\n Beecher. Greeley and Phillips, that caused\n those three men to see that Lincoln un-\n derstood the real cause of the conflict be-\n tween the North and South, and that,\n made them understand It as he did.

If you could have cut into his heart,\n you would have found graven on it\n ' Truth. ' He had a wonderful sympathy.\n My definition of sympathy is a golden\n chariot, in which the human soul rides\n out to bring messages that cheer the\n downtrodden and oppressed. Lincoln\u2019s\n soul was always in this golden chariot,\n and it never failed to bring a message to\n those that needed it most sorely.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Edward Lauterbach, at Public School\n No. 5.\n</p>\n<p>\n The speaker traced the history of\n slavery on this continent from the be-\n ginning in the early plantation days\n when Dutch and English traders made\n much wealth by capturing slaves and\n unloading them on the new country. And\n even later, when England had abolished\n slavery in her own islands, she forced\n the iniquity on her colonies. Why?\n Merely that her princes of trade and\n even her royal family might profit. Eng-\n land took no account of the evil she was\n forcing on her dependencies for all time\n to come.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then came the Revolution, and the\n yoke of England was for all time shaken\n from our neck, but slavery remained. It\n wa3 an evil that could not be shaken off,\n for again by the invention of cotton gin\n it had become profitable to the owners\n of the South. They could not do with-\n out the black man\u2019s labor, and they had\n to have their corn, sugar and cotton grow\n in the fields. In the North slavery was\n abolished, because it was against the\n ideas of freedom, in which New England\n and the rest of the North has always\n been in the lead. There was no provision\n in the Constitution of the United States\n against slavery, but Washington clearly\n did not approve of the Institution, as\n shown by his manumission of his own\n slaves.\n</p>\n<p>\n But there was a provision in the Con-\n stitution that slavery should not go\n above tie Mason and Dixon line. This was\n satisfactory until the great West was ac-\n quired, and state after state was carved\n out of that territory. Then came the\n question: Should slavery be allowed in\n these new states or not? Here is where\n the South broke faith. They had agreed\n that no slavery should be allowed north\n of a certain line, but now it was politi-\n cally expedient to say. \u201cNever mind about\n the agreement. Let the people in these\n new states say \u25a0whether they want slavery\n or not.\u201d Then came the momentous\n Dred Scott decision, by which a slave\n was declared not to be a person with any\n inherent right to freedom, but a chattel,\n and thus could be^ recovered by th#\n owner anywhere.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n At this time Douglas, the Little Giant,\n was the great man of the country. He\n played politics, placated the South and\n placated the North, but when he stood\n for re-election in his state, Illinois, he\n encountered Abraham Lincoln, a man\n without 4 any learning in books, but with\n much o*f the learning that comes from\n the open and rough life of the frontiers-\n man. A man educated in the great\n school of woods and hills, he brought the\n issue at stake clearly before the coun-\n try, and although defeated for the sena-\n torship, he became the leader of the new\n party in the North.\n</p>\n<p>\n He was a man of courage, of gentleness,\n and of wisdom. When he was elected the\n South threatened to declare war the mo-\n ment he took the oath of office. But he\n did not hesitate.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the flag was shot upon he issued\n a call to arms, and the country rever-\n berated with the cry, \u201cYes. Father\n Abraham, we are coming, three hundred\n thousand strong.\u201d The story of the\n battles, the defeats, the dark days,\n the opposition, the criticisms, is familiar\n to all. The North cried to have tha\n slaves emancipated immediately, but Lin-\n coln was not the man to do a thing un-\n lawfully. He called to the South to come\n back to the Union, slavery or no slav-\n</p>\n<p>\n ery. The great editor, Horace Greeley,\n wrote to him and told him he was wrong,\n but Lincoln answered him with such\n gentleness and forbearance that Greeley\n was silenced.\n</p>\n<p>\n The members of Lincoln\u2019s cabinet had\n been his opponents, yet he picked the men\n not to suit himself, but to get the ablest\n men for the country. They thought at\n first that they could run the country\n without consulting the obscure country\n lawyer from Illinois, but they found they\n were mistaken. He was the master.\n</p>\n<p>\n When victory came, and Lincoln\u2019s face\n was furrowed with sorrow and care, a\n fanatic shot him down. Fortunately, no\n Southern leader was implicated in the\n plot, and now that he is dead, it is idle\n to speculate as to what would have been\n the course of the country had he lived.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Charles Levermore, at Public\n School No. 147.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI shall speak of Abraham Lincoln,\n not as a party leader, not as a statesman,\n but as a man. I shall try to show him\n as he is revealed in the published memo-\n ries of his friends. Rightly precious is\n every scrap of reminiscence of that won-\n derful personality, a true saint of the\n modern tim^. He was the first American\n to rise to the first rank in the love of\n mankind. Washington wears a similar\n crown of universal admiration, but he\n was born an English country gentleman\n and lived as such until he was a middle-\n aged man. Ben Franklin was a repre-\n sentative Yankee who became a world-\n hero, but he also was a provincial Eng-\n lishman until he was on the verge of old\n age. Andrew Jackson was as typical an\n American as Lincoln, but he never\n reached Lincoln\u2019s height of abiliiy or\n fame. Abraham Lincoln alone \u2019s, as\n Lowell hailed him, the \u2018first American.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln was in lineage as in char inter\n the sum of all the generations of the\n American democracy. As he said, \u2018The\n Lord must love the common people, for\n He makes so many of them.\u2019 The Lin-\n colns were plainly among those vlnm\n the Lord loved. They settled first in\n Massachusetts early in the seventeenth\n century, and then wandered southward\n first to S T ew Jersey, then to Pennsylvania,\n afterward to Virginia and finally wirh\n Daniel Boone to Kentucky. They were\n farmers, millers and blacksmiths. They\n absorbed some Quaker blood. They were so\n illiterate that their name was sometimes\n battered out of shape into \u2018Linkharn.\u2019 In\n Virginia and Kentucky they were pour\n whites, owning no slaves and little land.\n Mr. Lincoln says that one of the reasons\n for his father\u2019s removal from Kentucky\n to Indiana iu 1816, and afterward to\n Illinois was to escape from the neign-\n borhood of slavery and to live among free\n laborers. This history of a leisurely fain \u2022\n ily migration illustrates the slow orina-\n tion of a new American type, \u2018new\n birth of our new soil.\u2019 It was a Yatik \u25a0?\n stock, with an admixture of Quaker sym-\n pathy of Scotch-Irish intensity and d Hie\n freedom and audacity of the frontiersmen\n of the Alleghany Mountains and of the\n broad Western plains.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The speaker then discussed the various\n elements of Lincoln\u2019s personality, illus-\n trating in turn his honesty and truthful-\n ness, his sense of justice, his courage,\n his freedom from affectation, his gradual\n education and the mistakes which pro-\n ceeded from his lack of knowledge of the\n world, his gentleness and patience \u2014\n sometimes carried too far for the welfare\n of his party and the nation; his undsrly-\n ing strength of will and character, his\n deep sympathies, his strongly religious\n nature, his skill in speech and in p > wtr\n of persuasion, his large fund of common\n sense, and his extraordinary gift > f hu-\n mor. The concluding paragraph of the\n address is as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln was killed by a dissolute fa-\n natical egotist. From that time until now\n the world has been rearing monuments\n</p>\n<p>\n to Lincoln. It will continue to ouild\n them. He towers above all his contem-\n poraries as the hero of our struggle\n against slavery. He is the man, above\n all others, who preserved the unity of\n this nation and made it really free. He\n was the only Republican party leader\n who understood the issues and the out-\n come of the Civil War. He was the only\n Northern statesman capable of being the\n balance wheel for his section in the per-\n ilous moment of victory. He was the best\n friend that the prostrate South has. His\n death brought upon the nation the hor-\n rors of the Reconstruction policies of\n Wade, Stevens and Sumner, mism-ies\n worse than those of the war. Many\n men win fame by eminence in a single\n quality. This man was rich in all the\n qualities that exalt one to leaders ' n-p.\n Power of every kind and tender-neartol\n sympathy, boundless patience and gentle-\n ness and illimitable hope and courage,\n skill in persuasion and a rugged honesty,\n an indomitable will and an invincible\n modesty, audacious humor and shrewd\n practical common sense, an easy toler-\n ance of censure and an abiding faiih in\n the justice and love of God. all these\n couplets of virtues \u2014 any one of which\n would have sufficed to elevate him above\n his fellows \u2014 Abraham Lincoln showed\n forth in his daily life. He was as mat y\n sided as our race itself: he was an epi-\n tome of the race. Everyone knows Lin-\n coln\u2019s features and yet no one picture\n of Lincoln looks exactly like another.\n Each picture conveys its own revelation\n His strongly molded features were so\n eloquent of the changing moods of his\n mighty nature.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n James McKeen, at Erasmus Hall,\n Brooklyn.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAt this distance of time. 100 years\n after the birth of Lincoln. 45 years after\n his tragic and untimely death, Lincoln\n towers above his great contemporaries.\n By common consent of former friends\n and former foes, he is hailed as the dis-\n tinctive American of the nineteenth cen-\n tury. At the outset, proper humility im-\n pels a paraphrase of what he said of\n the heroic dead at Gettysburg. It mat-\n ters little to him what we may say here.\n It is we who may gain courage and in-\n spiration from the contemplation of his\n career. t\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt is almost impossible for those\n whose personal recollection does not ex-\n tend back into the decade which preceded\n the Civil War to realize how the slavery\n question completely dominated our na-\n tional politics. It is difficult to realize\n the peril of the political situation.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWith all his detestation of slavery,\n Lincoln had inherited from Webster and\n Clay and the old Whig school an enthu-\n siasm for the Union. He felt with them\n that the preservation uf the Union was\n indispensable to the salvation of free\n government m America: that no political\n evil would be so great as the dissolution\n of the Union.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cDuring the summer of 1862, the New\n York Tribune and the Independent, the\n latter then edited by Mr. Beecher, were\n drastic in condemning the President for\n not emancipating the slaves. Late in that\n summer, Mr. Beecher. < hen residing on\n Columbia heights, near Orange street, re-\n ceived a message, inquiring if he would\n surely be at home that evening; that, if\n so a man from Washington would call\n to see him on a matter of some import-\n ance. It proved to be a very rainy and\n cheerless night. Mr. Beecher ' s bell rang\n and he went to the door himself, where\n a tall man stood alone, wrapped in a\n cloak. It proved to be President Lincoln.\n Mr. Beecher ushered him into his study.\n The President said that he keenly felt the\n criticism of the Tribune and of the Inde-\n pendent. considering their editors to be\n two of the men most potent in guiding\n public opinion; that he had himself some\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0031/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 489}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0031/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 978}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0031/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1957}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0031/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3914}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0031/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/li/nc/ol/nc/en/te/na/ry/00/un/se/lincolncentenary00unse/lincolncentenary00unse_0031.jp2", "height": 3914, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 815018}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"31\">\n<p>\n LINCOLN CENTHNARY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 27\n</p>\n<p>\n me since come to the conclusion that\n he continuance of the rebellion justified\n mancipation as a war measure, but that\n \u25a0 would be Inexpedient to resort to it\n intll the Union Army should achieve\n some marked success; otherwise it would\n be construed as a cry of despair Ho then\n drew from his pocket a manuscript which\n he submitted to Mr. Beecher, asking sug-\n gestions. and Mr. Beecher made several.\n After some further discussion.

His paramount\n object was to save the Union.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln\u2019s rank as a popular orator is\n the highest In the annals of American\n eloquence. His second inaugural address\n and his oration on the battlefield of Get-\n tysburg reach the sublimest elevation of\n human speech. He had moral earnestness\n as well, and the spirit of a hero and mar-\n tyr.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln was a son of the oommod\n people. His origin was humble, his for-\n tune was long in coming, his poverty was\n sharp and his schooling was limited to\n twelve months. No family was ennobled\n by his achievements; no university was\n honored by his record of glory; no church,\n with narrower walls and narrower creed,\n claims him in the fellowship of her blind\n</p>\n<p>\n flrtces in life, could easily have recog-\n nized.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThis myth-making habit could not\n fail to make free with the life and char-\n acter of Abraham Lincoln, and from the\n day of his i.asassinatlon until twenty\n y- .rs or so c .,o, it had been construct-\n ing a Lincoln in many ways different\n from the actual man. But, more re-\n cently, another process has been going\n on: The patient investigation of critical\n historical scholarship. To no great\n cl..\u2019.r < -cter has research been more re-\n morselessly applied than of late it has\n been to Lincoln; and it Is certain that\n to-day our knowledge of that wonderful\n man is probably on the whole more ac-\n curate, more detailed, more true to the\n life In every particular, than is our\n knowledge of any other important, indi-\n vidual in our national history. The pic-\n ture and the story of Lincoln that will\n from this time on descend to posterity\n will be not myth, but truth.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cOf the many aspects of Lincolns\n greatness, that one which, from this\n time forward, will probably receive, in-\n creasing attention, and will seem ' to. the\n American people to be most significant,\n we discover, I think, in the ' - peculiar\n qualit.-. reach and power of his demo-\n cratic convictions. The man of demo-\n cratic professions, whose platform and\n activities are readily explained by the\n character of his own political oppor-\n tunities, we all are well acquainted with.\n The theoretical or philosophical demo-\n crat, also, has played In our history a\n large and beneficent part. Such a man\n was Thomas Jefferson, who, more clearly\n than any other of our political leaders\n set forth in his writings and speeches\n the principles, limitations and alluring\n , romises of a democratic form of politi-\n cal socLty. Abraham Lincoln was demo-\n cratic, not as a political opportunist,\n nor merely r, \u25a0 . keen!. Intelligent and\n I broad-mint\u2019 td -MUi^l rhi ' ?\u201d?b\u201cr; nl\n</p>\n<p>\n though he \u2014 both political philosopher\n and political opportunist in the best\n sense of the words. At bottom, his\n derm acy was aa understanding of the\n common people, of what they are. of how\n they feci, of what they know, of what\n th;y arc able to do, of their common\n sense and their sense of right, which\n has never l :..i equaled or perhaps ap-\n proached by any other public man in\n f ' modern or the ancient world.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIn n memorable speech which Mr.\n Lincoln made at Independence Hall in\n Philadelphia just before the storm of the\n Rebellion burst, he said: \u2018I have never\n had a feeling politically that did not\n spring fro j tl. sentiments embodied in\n the eclaration of Independence. ' It\n has been fashionable in recent years to\n speak slightingly of the Declaration as\n impractical and academic: to say that\n the people, after all. arc not by nature\n free and equal, and that they make bad\n work of trying to govern themselves in\n a democratic way. Abraham Lincoln\n never for one moment ceased to believe\n in the competence of the people, or in\n their continuing political success. From\n what did this confidence spring\u201d The\n answer which wc have to make to-day.\n after fifty years of questioning and rc\n search, clearly is this: The first and for-\n mative hai of Lincoln\u2019s life was passed\n among people of the very humblest ori-\n gin, the most pinching poverty, the most\n deprived of all the resorces and advan-\n tages of cl-ilization. Yet those people,\n ns Lincoln knew, because he understood\n and loved them as only those who have\n fought the struggle for existence to\n gether can love and understand, were\n fully able to care for themselves, to\n shape their institutions, to make their\n laws, and to decide the gravest ques-\n tions that can confront a nation, on\n grounds of good sense, sobriety and\n right. And if those humble folk could\n Jo these things, then any men. any-\n where. and at an; time, can do them.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Hugo Hit sit, at Public School No.\n</p>\n<p>\n 150.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cNo one ever knew Lincoln but was\n the better for knowing him; no one came\n to him for advice but left him comforted\n and stronger; no client gver came to him\n for counsel but knew that the fee alone\n never tempted him in a cause, hut that\n justice and his love for it and its\n due administration were the controlling\n features in his acceptance of a retainer.\n And when our country needed counsel\n and advice, when it was in the very\n throes of secession and division, when it\n needed a leader who was strong, honest\n and unselfish, who could withstand the\n flatteries of the sympathizer and did not\n fear the curses of his opponents, and\n when the question of the continued slav-\n ery or the freedom of four million people\n became, as it was bound to become, the\n main issue of a strife which cost un-\n numbered lives\u2014 then, then Lincoln gave\n himself.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cNeither the partisanship nor the\n trickery of politics could or did affect\n him. Once he knew he was right he\n trod the path. Sometimes he trod it\n alone. But whether he was alone or with\n others there was no deviation from the\n path as hewed out or marked out by\n him. His friends advised with him and\n warned him: his enemies openly threat-\n ened him and the press cartooned him\n But he went ahead doing his duty as he\n saw It.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHe possessed the power of convincing\n men.

E. W. McCarty, at Public School\n No. 118.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cPifty years ago these United States\n were not so closely knit as they are\n to-day. State sovereignty was stoutly\n asserted and not denied. The right of\n a state to withdraw ' from the Union\n had not been passed upon. Now the\n amalgamation of the various nationali-\n ties; mutual commercial interests; the\n hammering together of the elements that\n tjme has done; the welding together of\n the states in the Vulcan forge of war\n has produced a oneness that did not ex-\n ist then. A special line of demarcation\n was rather sharply drawn between the\n North and the South.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThere were two political parties \u2014\n the Democrats and the Whigs. The issue\n between them was the right to extend\n slavery into new r states and territories.\n The states were half slave and half free.\n It was a struggle between the written\n law, which rather favored it. and the\n law pf humanity, which forbade it. The\n whole country was in a volcanic condi-\n tion. The Congress was bitterly divided.\n No man could foresee the outcome.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt has always seemed to me that\n America is God\u2019s favorite among the na-\n tions. He did not fail us in this hour\n of deadly peril. He raised up a mighty\n man, splendidly eqrrrpped to guide us\n \u2022afely through the awful crisis.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cConditions called for a man who was\n big enough to be an American without\n being sectional; a man brainy enough to\n charm and lead the leaders of the land;\n a man with a heart big enough to sym-\n pathize with and to love every man.\n Woman and child, white and black.\n North and South; a man with principles\n of law, justice, honesty aud morality\n that were fixed and inflexible; a man\n who would hold fast to these principles\n With the gentleness of a child, but with\n the courage of a hero; a man of infinite\n patience and of masterly prudence; a\n man who could be self-contained in the\n midst of warring passions and events;\n a man of sterling and unselfish patriot-\n ism, who knew and loved the Constitu-\n tion and who would gladly give his life\n rather than permit the least of the stars\n</p>\n<p>\n to be torn from our flag. Such a man\n was Abraham Lincoln.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" America\u2019s friend, the God of nations,\n prepared him for the task. The school-\n ing was long and hard, but effective.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cUnlike other great men,\u201d said Mgr.\n McCarty, in conclusion. \u201cLincoln was a\n peculiar mixture of the lofty and the\n commonplace. Lion-like in courage,\n lamb-like in gentleness. An uncouth\n frontiersman in manner and speech to-\n day, to-morrow at expert statesman hand-\n ling quite easily complex problems of na-\n tional importance. Sometimes with ready\n wit and flippant manner, seeming to for-\n get the dignity and responsibility of his\n office; again rising majestically to some\n occasion in words exact and clean cut as\n a cameo; iu sentences short, crisp and\n pulsating with feeling he gave forth\n creations of his gifted, mind that were\n models in language, gems of patriotism,\n masterpieces of political sagacity that\n will last as long as the Republic en-\n dures. Unhandsome in appearance, un-\n gainly in action, unconventional in dress,\n unpolished in manners, he was nobleness\n itself in character, glorious in his sim-\n plicity. His great big heart was filled\n with golden goodness and his kingly head\n with natural genius.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cDown on the bank of the Potomac\n there rises a shaft of marble, tall and\n plain and white. It indicates the lofty,\n simple and spotless character of the\n father of our country. Let us build an-\n other one on the other side of the river\n just as tall, just as plain, just as white,\n in honor of Lincoln, the preserver of our\n country. Though unlike in birth and\n training, each loved his country better\n than he loved himself; both were ideal\n Americans, both were noblemen of\n nature.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Rev. Caleb S. S. Dutton, at Pub-\n lic School No. 145.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHis life was one of great difficulties\n greatly ' overcome, yet the fact which re-\n mains most impressive of all perhaps, is\n tbe unobtrusiveness, the docility, of a\n personality so complex and powerful.\n The mainspring of bis power, and the\n truest evidence of his greatness lay in\n his \u2018wise passiveness\u2019 coupled w ' ith the\n nobility of his alms, the fervor of his\n convictions, the stainless rectitude which\n guided his action and won for him the\n confidence of the people. Without these\n things neither the vigor of his intellect\n nor the firmness of his will would have j\n availed. Thus he stands before us all\u2014\n ever devoted to justice!\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWith a wit and irony which can\n hardly be matched, be possessed a heart\n capable of unutterable sadness. Daunt-\n less as a lion, he bad the tenderness of\n a Saviour. An unconquerable foe to\n wrong, he was patient like a god. What\n meaning is in that grave, lofty face,\n seamed by care, shadowed by fate, with\n deep fathomless eyes as if containing an\n unrevealed meaning! Gaunt and angular\n as a mountain, yet with a delicacy of\n sentiment end the ability to discern mo-\n tives and all the subtle operations of tbe\n human spirit. Ungainly, but with the\n rare power of attracting all men toward\n him. A partisan, but always able to see\n the other side of things\u2014 and could state\n his adversary\u2019s position better than\n could he himself. Uneducated in the\n schools, but knowing well that for\n which the schools exist, namely, to refine\n the intellect and purify the heart, so\n that they may read and understand the\n great ethical laws and obey them as a\n revelation of the Most High. Like a fire\n bell in the night, he roused his country-\n men from their sleep by his speech\n against the repeal of the Missouri Com-\n promise. He knew that he was speak-\n ing, not on behalf of the party, but in\n the name of all the peoples in the world\n who hope for liberty.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cA Republican, he had no leanings to-\n</p>\n<p>\n ward empire. Without a touch of courtly\n fashion, his simple, free, unadorned man-\n ner made the pomp of emperors seem\n ridiculous. Devoid of the artificial\n graces of speech, yet by his own natural\n methods he went straight to the heart\n of things, and thus reached heights of\n eloquence which cannot be surpassed.\n At Gettysburg his few sentences made\n the ornate address of the orator who\n preceded him seem pale and unreal by\n comparison, and they have become a\n part of the classics of our English\n speech. Strong, fearless, patient he kept\n his hand on the helm of the Republic;\n and, when, like a bruised and battered\n ship it emerged from the awful storm in\n which for four years it had struggled,\n and when the port was almost reached,\n he was suddenly summoned elsewhere.\n Abraham Lincoln! While memory lasts\n can we forget him? Nay! can a hundred\n ages dim the luster of his fa,me ?\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe courtesydue to such men as Wash-\n ington and Lincoln is obedience to the\n principles enthroned in their lives. On\n their birthdays we should study deeply\n that which constitutes the true glory of\n this nation. The clamors of national\n and class interests should be silenced by\n the deep, solemn music of human wel-\n fare. They should be sacramental days\n for this country. On them we should\n vow new allegiance to the principles on\n which this nation was founded \u2014 and which\n alone gave it a reason for being insti-\n tuted among the .nations of the earth.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe do well to recall these men in the\n nation\u2019s history who cared more for the\n country\u2019s honor than for its wealth, and\n exalted human liberty and fraternity\n above power and conquest. Their almost\n spotless honor, their self-denial, their\n devotion to the righfs of mankind, and\n their trust in humanity and in God, make\n them a standing example of the kind of\n citizenship needed in a republic. We\n need many more like them. A few will\n not do. There should be many whose\n minds are not dazzled by wealth or office.\n Men who will resolve as Washington re-\n solved, to make this nation an example\n to mankind of a people always guided\n by an exalted justice and benevolence:\n men who will feel with Lincoln that this\n democracy is the last, best hope of man;\n men whose patriotism is one with re-\n ligion.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMay the great God send many such\n patriots who will guide this great coun-\n try in safety through all the perils\n which beset it; who will make its future\n worthy of its past! And what a past It\n is! And in that background the grand-\n est figure of all is Abraham Lincoln, \u2018the\n kindly-earnest, brave, foreseeing man\u2019\n w\u2019ith \u2018a heart too great to harbor a wrong.\u2019\n his life dominated by one supreme am-\n bition \u2014 \u2018die when I may.

He made a complex nature\n one by devotion to justice: aud that de-\n votion led him on from conquest to con-\n quest, till all the power of the Infinite\n Justice became his strength and stay.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Rev.

But God inspired\n that nomination, as God had been train-\n ing for the critical hour the man who\n would meet the situation. And the man\n measured up to the situation, as God ' s;\n men always do. Lincoln had that subtle\n sympathy with men and things which we\n call genius. His unostentatious personal\n use of power, his reasoning and reason-\n able moderation of speech, his forbear-\n ance, patience and charity of Judgment,\n his avoidance of passion and excitement,\n his dislike , of radical or extreme meas-\n ures, when they were not necessary, his\n keen penetration, his broad vision, his\n firm grip on essential principles and his\n great common sense equipped him well j\n for hia mighty work.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLincoln was unselfishly devoted to In-\n terests not his own. He had no private\n ends to aohieve. There was no trace of\n sordidness in his character or conduct.\n He was at all times a poor man. His\n life objects were not personal. They\n were large and national.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" In him was no littleness at all. Re-\n buked and reviled as few men have been,\n let. It he said, and it may be said of no\n other man in human history, that this\n pensive, patient, bumble, honest, fair and\n dispassionate man never spoke in bitter-\n ness of any foe, never cherished a single\n</p>\n<p>\n grudge, never maintained a moment\u2019s\n malice and never indulged himself in the\n slightest passion.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIn the firmament of his unfaltering\n faith were two lights which guided his\n course through public life \u2014 the presence\n of God and the prescience of the people.\n He had faith in God. Through his great\n soul broad and deep currents of re - 1\n ligious sentiment swept with strong aud\n resistless force. The one primal reality\n in his thought was God. He had a deep\n sense of dependence upon God as the su-\n preme ruler of life both individual and\n national. He ever confessed this depend-\n ence and always sought to be on God\u2019s\n side.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHe had confidence in the people. He\n lived in fellowship with the Eternal and\n at the same time he lived close to the\n great pulse-beat and heart-throb of the\n common people with whose every voice\n his heart was attuned and with wondrous\n prescience of majestic seasons his own\n great, melancholy spirit moved in perfect\n accord.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBeing a man of the people he was all\n people\u2019s man. If there was nothing of\n the aristocrat shout him. so there was\n nothing of the demagogue. He valued a\n man as a man and the incidental or acci-\n dental conditions of wealth or poverty,\n position or obscurity, learning or its lack\n did not influence him. He was the incar-\n nation of the finest Ideals of Americanism\n</p>\n<p>\n and became their expression in a regency\n and completeness as no other man has\n shown.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cSympathy was the basic element in\n the fiber of his being. In the great pur-\n pose of his life he was a man of grim\n determination, firm-fibered as oak. In\n the presence of duty he was stern and\n austere; but was gentle and tender as 4\n mother with her child in the presence ot\n want or sorrow or suffering. Xo matter\n bow worn with the cares of his great\n office, the President was always . ready\n to give patient hearing to the poor\n mother who was pleading for her son ' *\n life. It there was any weakness in hi*\n administration it developed on the side\n of sympathy, for among tho mysterious\n splendors of this man were the ener-\n gies of a giant and the tenderness of a\n woman. A large-hearted gentleness ex-\n haled from him like an aroma as life\n carried him from cabin to capitol, from\n capitol to camp and from camp to coro-\n nation.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI have not attempted any explanation\n of Abraham Lincoln. He defies explana-\n tion. His ancestry did not create him.\n His environment did not make him. The\n church did not fashion him. The schools\n did not equip him.

DR. NEWELL DWIGHT HILLIS.\n</p>\n<p>\n We are here to celebrate the centennial\n of the martyred President, who helped us\n nobly save the last, best hope of earth,\n by giving liberty to tho slaves, that he\n might assure freedom to the free. Take\n hint all in all, Abraham Lincoln is the\n greatest thing this republic has pro-\n duced. Indeed, history tells of no child\n who passed from a cradle so humble to\n a grave so illustrious. The institutions\n of the Republic were founded for the\n manufacture of a good quality cf soul.\n In the presence of the great men of the\n world we can point with pride to Lin-\n coln. saying. \" This is the kind of man ' ' he\n institutions of the Republic can produce. \"\n For Lincoln\u2019s most striking character-\n istic was t his Americanism. At best.\n Washington was a patrician, the product\n of aristocratic institutions, so that Eng-\n land claimed him Washington was the\n richest man of his era, his home an old\n manor house, his estate wide ancestral\n acres, his relative an English baronet,\n his brother the child of Oxford Univer-\n sity. The root was planted iti English\n soil, though it rruited under American\n skies. But Americanism is the very es-\n sence of Lincoln\u2019s thoughts Lincoln\u2019s\n enthusiasm. Lincoln\u2019s speeches. Lincoln\u2019s\n character. One or the golden words of\n the Republic is the word \" opportunity.\u201d\n All the highways that lead to office,\n land and honor must be open uitto all\n young feet. A banker\u2019s son may climb\n to the governor\u2019s mansion, or the White\n House, but so may tile washerwoman\u2019s.\n The widow\u2019s son practices eloquence in\n the cornfields of Virginia, but he has\n ability, and patriotism, and we bring\n Henry Clay to the Senate chamber. A\n child out in Ohio goes barefooted over\n the October grass, driving an old red\n cow to the barn lot. and we bring Mc-\n Kinley to the While House.\n</p>\n<p>\n Yonder stands the Temple of Fame,\n with a door that is open by day and by\n night, and a tall. thin, sallow boy turns\n l\u2019-is back upon a log cabin in Illinois and\n knocks for entrance at the Temple of\n Fame, and !o. the angel at the threshold\n asks hard questions, \u201cCan you oat crusts?\n Can you wear rags? Can you sleep in a\n garret? Can you endure sleepless nights\n and days of toil? Can you bear up\n against every wind that assails your\n bark? Can you live for liberty and Clod ' s\n truth, and can you die for them? ' ' And\n that boy bowed his assent Washington\n climbed hand over hand up tho goiden\n rounds of tho ladder of success. Lincoln\n built the ladder up which ho climbed out\n of rails which his own hands had split.\n Like his Divine Master, he touched two\n or three crusts and itirnecl them into\n bread for the hungry multitudes. His\n little log cabin shames our palaces. His\n three books eclipse our libraries, his six\n months tn a tog schoul house tv or ' 1 more\n than, equal to our ' eight years in lecture\n hall and library. His fidelity to tho great\n convictions shames our shifting poli-\n ticians. Foi tif ' -y ye.rs lie walked for-\n</p>\n<p>\n ward under clouded skies. Like Dante,\n he held heartbreak at bay. During one\n brief epoch only did his sun clear itself\n of clouds He died without recognition\n or reward. In retrospect he stands forth\n the saddest and sweetest, the strongest\n and gentlest, the most picturesque and\n the most pathetic figure in our history.\n The Saviour of the world was born in a\n stable and cradled in a manger, and went\n by the Via Dolorosa toward the world ' s\n throne. Not otherwise Abraham Lincoln\n was born in a cabin, more suited for\n herds and flocks than for a young mother\n and a little child; and by the way of\n poverty and adversity the great eman-\n cipator traveled toward his thfrone of in-\n fluence and world supremacy.\n</p>\n<p>\n An Era of Great Men.\n</p>\n<p>\n History holds a few deeds so great that\n they can be done but once. There are\n some laws, some reforms and some lib-\n erties that once achieved are always\n achieved. Thus, an Italian discovered\n this new continent, but his achievement\n reduced all the other ex-plorers to the\n level of imitators. Thus Isaac Newton\n discovered gravity, and in a moment\n every other astronomer became a pupil\n and a disciple. There never can be hut\n one James Watt, for. though a thousand\n Inventors improve his engine, their\n names are little tapers, shining over\n against the sun. The last century of-\n fered men of genius two signal opportu-\n nities, and there were a thousand eager\n aspirants for the honor. Charles Dar-\n wjn discovered the golden key that un-\n locked the kingdom of nature and life,\n and carried off all the honors of science.\n Abraham Lincoln, in an hour when some\n would meanly lose it, planned to nobly\n save the Union, and emancipated three\n million slaves, and carried off the honors\n in tho realm of reform and liberty. How\n great was the work he did, and how\n supreme was the man himself, we can\n bust understand by comparison and con-\n trast. Among small men It is easy to be\n great\u2014 in Patagonia, where everybody\n eats blubber.\n</p>\n<p>\n Anybody can be a giant in heroism and\n reform among Hottentots and South Sea\n savages But the era of ' he Civil War\n was an era of giants Great men walked\n in regiments up and down the land. Tt\n was the age of Daniel Webster whose\n genius is so wonderful that he achieved\n the four supreme things of four realms,\n the greatest legal argument we have,\n the Dartmouth College case; the greatest\n \u25a0ea before a judge and Jury the White\n murder case: our finest outburst of In-\n spirational eloquence, the oration at\n Bunker Hi:!: the greatest argument in\n defense of the Constitution, his reply to\n Hayne. For two hours Lyman Beecher\n sat reading Webster\u2019s reply to the elo-\n quent Southerner -What do you think\n of it. Dr Beecher? \" \" What do i think\n of it?\u201d exclaimed Lyman Beecher, spring-\n ing to his feet, lifting the paper in his\n hand, \u201cT think it is a rod hot cannon bail,\n going through a bucketful of eggshells \u201d\n it was the age of John C. Calhoun, a lo-\n</p>\n<p>\n gician, who could prove to the faculty\n of Yale College that shad grew on apple\n trees.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was the era of Seward, the all-\n round scholar, of Chase tne greatest sec-\n retary of treasury since Alexander Ham-\n ilton. who struck the rock with the rod\n of hie genius, and made the waters of\n finance flow forth from the desert. It\n was the age of our greatest orators, for\n Wendell Phillipsand Beecher were at their\n best. It was the era of Emerson, the\n philosopher; of Theodore Parker, the re-\n former; of Garrison, the abolitionist; of\n Lovejoy the martyr; of Lowell and\n Whittier the poet3 of freedom; of\n Greeley, the editor, it was also the age of\n our greatest soldiers, Grant and Sherman,\n and Sheridan and Lee. The great man is\n a form of fruit ripened in an atmosphere\n made warm and genial, and the climate\n that nurtured Lincoln\u2019s genius unfolded\n the talents lhat represented other forms\n of mental fruit. Among these men Lin-\n coln lived and wrote and spoke, and\n suffered and died, aud he stands forth a\n master among men. one of the five su-\n preme statesmen of all history.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Cause of the Great Conflict.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now if we are to understand the\n unique place of Abraham Lincoln in our\n history we must think for a moment of\n the men who set the battle lines in array.\n Unfortunately, most of our histories tell\n our ehildreu and youth that the Civil\n War raged about the slave. As a\n matter of fact, slavery was the occasion\n of the war, but not the cause. Slavery\n was the sulphur match that exploded the\n powder magazine, though the powder\n magazine could have been set off by a\n spark from the flint, and steel, or a hun-\n dred other methods. The Civil War was\n really fought over the question whether\n a nation conceived in liberty and dedi-\n cated to the proposition that all men\n are equal could permanently endure. The\n whole period from 1789 to 1865 was a\n critical period, during which the Consti-\n tution was being tested and tried out.\n</p>\n<p>\n During this testing many forms of se-\n cession were planned, and several rebel-\n lions actually took place. In 1787 there\n was a rebellion under Shay, over the\n question of taxation. In 1830 to 1835 there\n was a secession movement on in South\n Carolina, and President Jackson put down\n that rebellion over the tariff. Then Dan-\n iel Webster marked out the final lines\n of battle. Webster fired the first shot\n of the war, whose last shot was fired at\n Appomattox Webster carried the flag\n that Grant followed at Vicksburg, and\n shook out the folds of the banner that\n was crimsoned with blood at Gettysburg.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was Webster\u2019s banner that Major\n Anderson pulled down at Fort Sumter,\n under the stress of fire, and It was Web-\n ster\u2019s banner that, four years later to an\n hour, the same General Anderson pulled\n up on the same flagstaff, the same flag at\n the same Fort Sumter. During the thir-\n ties and the forties, the conflict was *\n conflict of words and editorial argument*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0035/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 489}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0035/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 978}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0035/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1957}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0035/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3914}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0035/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/li/nc/ol/nc/en/te/na/ry/00/un/se/lincolncentenary00unse/lincolncentenary00unse_0035.jp2", "height": 3914, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 831456}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"35\">\n<p>\n LINCOLN CENTENARY\n</p>\n<p>\n 31\n</p>\n<p>\n between men like Calhoun, and Garrison\n and Phillips.

The\n whole land rocked with excitement. Lib-\n erty and Slavery, like two giants, grap-\n pled for the death struggle. Soon God\n anointed men with the ointment of war,\n black and sulphurous. In such an era\n God raised up Abraham Lincoln, to lead\n the people out of the wilderness, and into\n the Promised Land of Union and of Peace.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lincoln ' s Early Surroundings.\n</p>\n<p>\n Never was a candidate for universal\n fame born under so unfriendly a sky.\n His annals are \u201cthe short and simple an-\n nals of the poor.\u201d His home was a log\n cabin that had but three sides, the fourth\n one being a buffalo robe, swaying to and\n fro in the wind. When the biting wind\n of poverty became unbearable in Ken-\n tucky. the scant possessions were loaded\n upon a horse, carried across the Ohio,\n and the child walked barefooted through\n the forests of Indiana, where a new shack\n was built in the wilderness. There the\n Lincoln\u2019s angel mother sickened and died\n \u2014 that mother to whom Lincoln said he\n owed all that he was or hoped to be.\n Then when the winter of poverty and\n discontent settled down blacker than\n ever, the father removed to another\n state, where the mud was deeper, and\n the winters colder, where nature was\n less propitious. Lying on his face, be-\n fore blazing logs, the boy committed to\n memory the four Gospels. \" Aesop\u2019s\n Fables.\u201d and Bunyan\u2019s \" Pilgrim\u2019s Pro-\n gress.\u201d At nineteen he went to New Or-\n leans, and standing in the slave market\n saw a young girl sold at public auction,\n and told his brother, Dennis Hanks, that\n if he ever had a chance he would hit\n slavery the hardest blow he could.\n</p>\n<p>\n At twenty he split 1.200 rails for a\n farmer, whose wife wove for him three\n yards of cloth, dyed in walnut juice, with\n which he had a new suit of olothes. He\n started a little store, failed in business,\n became a surveyor, bought a copy of the\n Constitution of the United States and the\n Declaration of Independence; was made\n postmaster; several years later leturned '\n to the government agent the exact silver\n quarters and copper cents that he had\n kent tied Op in a bag, because the iden-\n tical coins must be returned to the gov-\n ernment; entered upon his debate with\n Stephen Douglas; delivered the \u201chouse\n divided against itself cannot stand\u201d\n speech; made the issue between liberty\n and slavery so clear that a wayfaring\n man, though a fool, could not misunder-\n stand; declared that if slavery was not\n wrong, there was nothing that was wrong;\n came to be looked upon as fhe one man\n who each year would coin the happy\n phrase and the rhythmical watchword\n that would be taken upon the lips of 30.-\n 000,000 of people; was made the leader of\n the new \u201cparty of freedom\u2019\u2019: with infln.h\n skill and patience, entered upon the tat.:\n of proving that he was the strongest man\n in his Cabinet, the strongest man in the\n North, the strongest man in the country,\n</p>\n<p>\n and the only man who had the last fact\n in the case, and therefore had the right\n to rule. Seward began by delicately\n hinting to Lincoln that if he felt himself\n unequal to the Presidency, he could re-\n sign, and that he, Seward, would not\n evade the responsibility.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lincoln answered by reading Seward ' s\n statement of a possible measure, and\n then placing beside it a statement of his\n own that reduced Seward to fhe level of\n a schoolboy standing up beside a giant.\n Then Stanton entered the lists as com-\n petitor, and quietly Lincoln asserted him-\n self until Stanton\u2019s attitude became one\n of almost reverent worship, as he said\n of Lincoln, \u201cHenceforth be belongs with\n the immortals.\u2019\u2019 Then Greeley put in his\n claim for supremacy, and after Lincoln\n had published his answer, to Horace\n Greeley, in lines as clear as crystal, and\n in words as gentle as sunbeams, not a\n man in the land but saw that Lincoln was\n intellectually head and shoulders above\n Horace Greeley. One by one and step\n by step he ascended the hills of diffi-\n culty. Round by round he climbed the\n ladder of fame. And now comes this\n day and week of celebration, when all\n the wheels are still, and all the stores\n and factories are silent, when eighty mil-\n lions of people are gathered into one vast\n audience chamber, when one name Is\n upon all lips \u2014 the name of Abraham Lin-\n coln, the emancipator of the slaves, the\n acknowledged master of men, who gave\n liberty to the slaves that he might assure\n freedom to the free.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lincoln ' s Ancestral Making.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thoughtless writers have talked Lin-\n coln\u2019s ancestory down. and careless\n biographers have defamed him. Super-\n ficial students speak of him as a miracle,\n and say that his genius is surrounded\n with silence and mystery. But all that\n Abraham Lincoln was he had at the\n hands of his fathers and his mothers.\n Although their greatness was latent,\n his parents had as much ability in their\n way as their distinguished son had in\n his way. How do I know? Because\n when God wants to call a strong man He\n begins by calling his father and mother.\n There never was a great man who did not\n have a great ancestry, even though the\n greatness may have been latent and un-\n conscious, Every strong man stands up\n on the shoulders of his ancestors. When\n you start for the top of Pike ' 6 Peak you\n start at Omaha. When you reach Denver\n you are six thousand feet in the air. and\n Pike\u2019s Peak is shouldered up on the\n foothills. Socrates is a great teacher,\n but look at Spboroniscus, the sculptor,\n his tather. Paganini is a great musi-\n cian. but Paganini was born of musicians\n whose wrists had muscles that stood out\n like whipcords.\n</p>\n<p>\n Bach is a great musician, but there\n were forty people of the name of Bach\n mentioned in musical dictionaries.\n Charles Darwin is the great scientist, but\n there were four generations of scientists\n who had made ready for Darwin, just as\n there were seven generations of scholars\n that culminated in Emerson. And stand-\n ing in the shadow behind Abraham Lin-\n coln are half a dozen generations of men\n and women who handed forward to him\n a perfect logic engine, a sound mind, in\n a sound body; a mental instrument that\n worked without fever and without fric-\n tion and without flaw-. At the hands of\n Stradivarius one piece of apple wood is\n fashioned into a violin. If Stradivarius\n passes by the other board because he\n has not time, let no man say the board\n that was undeveloped was not full of\n latent music. The Divine Artist and\n Architect shaped Abraham Lincoln\u2019s na-\n ture into a world instrument, buj the\n same quality and the stuff were in his\n father and mother, who lived and died\n a handful of blossoms that never fruited,\n and a bundle of roots that were never\n planted.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Lincoln\u2019s father and mother were like\n</p>\n<p>\n the crystal caves in their own Kentucky.\n Lecturing there recently I saw a cave of\n diamonds, newly discovered. One day a\n farmer plowing, thought the ground\n sounded hollow. Going to the barn, he\n brought a spade and opened up the aper-\n ture. Flinging down a rope, his friends\n let the explorer down, and when the\n torches were lighted, lo, a cave of ame-\n thysts and sapphires, and diamonds! For\n generations the cave had been undiscov-\n ered and the jewels unknown. Wild beasts\n had fed just above these flashing gems,\n and stijl more savage men had lived and\n fought and died there. And yet just be-\n neath was this cave of flashing jewels.\n Oh, pathetic illustration of men who are\n big with talent, of women full of latent\n gifts, of fathers and mothers like Thomas\n Lincoln and his young wife, who strug-\n gle on without opportunity, who are de-\n nied their chance, who are imprisoned by\n poverty, and fettered by circumstance,\n who are like birds beating bloody wings\n against the bars of an iron cage, who die\n unfulfilled prophecies, and dying, trans-\n fer their ambitions to their gifted chil-\n dren, believing that their son shall be-\n hold what the father and mother must die\n without seeing. God worked no miracle\n in Abraham Lincoln.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is a photograph of the signature\n of the grandfather upon a title deed in\n Culpepper County in Virginia. Now.\n place that signature side by side with\n the signature of Abraham Lincoln on the\n emancipation proclamation, and the\n strong sinewy sweep in the signature of\n the grandfather comes down and repeats\n itself in the strong sinewy sweep of the\n grandson. And perhaps the strong sinewy\n sentence comes down and repeats itself\n also, for all fine thinking stands with one\n foot on fine brain fiber. The time has\n come for men with a sharp knife and a\n hot iron to expunge from two or three\n of the otherwise best biographies of\n Abraham Lincoln these false, superficial\n and ignorant statements about his an-\n cestry. Science, observation, experience,\n history and the facts all unite to tell\n us that whatever was great in its unfold-\n ing in the talent of Abraham Lincoln was\n great in the seed form in his father and\n mother.\n</p>\n<p>\n His Unique Supremacy.\n</p>\n<p>\n Where were the hidings of his power?\n Why is Lincoln revered above his fel-\n lows. the orators, tho soldiers, and the\n statesmen and editors and secretaries of\n his time? A single contrast with the\n other great men who were his competi-\n tors for fame will make Lincoln\u2019s su-\n premacy to stand forth as clear in out-\n line as the mountains, and as bright as\n the stars. For example. Wendell Phillips\n was the agitator and orator of the aboli-\n tionists. Phillips said, \" Emancipation is\n the essential thing. The Union second-\n ary. If the Southern States will not\n emancipate the slaves, force them out of\n the Union.\u201d Horace Greeley was the edi-\n tor of the war epoch. Greeley said,\n \" Emancipation is first, the Union sec-\n ondary.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLet the erring sisters go.\u201d Beeche*\n was the all-round man of genius. Hi*\n great speech in England began, with a*\n exordium at Manchester; he stated th*\n arguments at Edinburgh, Glasgow and\n Liverpool; he pronounced the peroration\n at Exeter Hall, in London, and no such\n peroration and eloquence has been heard\n since Demosthenes\u2019 philippic against th*\n tyrant of Macedon. But Beecher\u2019s criti-\n cisms of Lincoln in the New York Inde-\n pendent during April and May of 1862 led\n Lincoln to explain after reading ono of\n them, \u201cIs Thy servant a dog that he\n should do this thing?\u201d If these men did\n not appreciate the national crisis, Lin-\n coln understood it perfectly. Now, over\n against the editorials of Beecher and\n Horace Greeley and the lectures of\n Phillips, stands Lincoln, and to these\n three men he sent words addressed only\n to Horace Greeley, explaining to th*s\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0036/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 319, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 486}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0036/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 639, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 973}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0036/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1279, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1946}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0036/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2559, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3892}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0036/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/li/nc/ol/nc/en/te/na/ry/00/un/se/lincolncentenary00unse/lincolncentenary00unse_0036.jp2", "height": 3892, "width": 2559, "levels": 6, "size": 452231}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"36\">\n<p>\n 32\n</p>\n<p>\n LINCOLN CENTENARY,\n</p>\n<p>\n why the time had not come for the\n Emancipation Proclamation.\n</p>\n<p>\n X would save the Union.\n</p>\n<p>\n If there be those who would not save the\n Union unless they could at the same time\n same slavery.

Lincoln\n saw clearly where others had an indis-\n tinct vision. As to gravity, Isaac, New-\n ton\u2019s vote outweighs all the other mill-\n ions of men. and from the hour that\n Lincoln published this letter to Horace\n Greeley the people saw that Abraham\n Lincoln had the last fact in the case,\n saw the whole truth, saw it through and\n through. By sheer power, clarity of\n thought, strength of statement and fair-\n ness, Abraham Lincoln finally won over\n not only a lukewarm North, but a bitter\n South, until to-day he belongs to the\n eighty millions. If every Northerner\n should die, the brave and patriotic men\n of the South living now ' would defend\n everything for which Abraham Lincoln\n lived and died.

He made a study of\n what the teaohers Darned Suffering and\n Sorrow had accomplished in the way of\n making Lincoln sympathetio toward the\n slave, and Illustrated that sympathy\n from various speeches of Lincoln. He\n also analyzed Lincoln\u2019s supreme literary\n achievements, and made a study of Lin-\n coln\u2019s style In his second Inaugural and\n the speech at Gettysburg. He analyzed\n Lincoln\u2019s wit and humor in relation to\n Cervantes, whose laughter scalds like\n tears.

He was\n then within a few hours of his fifty-\n second birthday. As he stood on the\n ear platform at Springfield, 111., a tall,\n gaunt and homely figure, the eye of the\n most discerning man in the throng at-\n tsnding his departure could scarcely\n have detected his actual greatness or\n the destiny that awaited him. He was\n the President-elect of a divided and\n i ancorous country. He was about to\n succeed a gentleman who, in that office,\n had allowed overbearing ministers of\n state to weaken and plunder the gov-\n ernment. The Carolinas were active in\n secession. A general apathy had fol-\n lowed the excitement of the election of\n 1860. Many friends of the Union depre-\n cated a vigorous and aggressive policy\n in its defense. A country decreed by\n Nature and by Providence a unity; a\n unity evidenced by rir^s and moun-\n tains that laced and ribbed the land-\n scapes from No \" th to South, was divided\n and degraded by artificial barriers, by\n pride and ignorance, by caste and envy,\n and by the dehumanizing evils of slavery.\n What mind, however keen, could have\n read the fate of Lincoln on the chilly\n morning when winter ' s glcom covered\n the landscape and encircled his tower-\n ing form? Moreover, he had but four\n years and a few weeks of life left for\n use. The problem was gigantic; the\n sands in the glass were running low;\n death\u2019s bony fingers were already en-\n twined on the curtain that was to fall\n and dismiss him from the stage of\n earthiy action. Those years were, in-\n deed, few, but they were fateful. No\n human career has met more, or met it\n more nobly, than has this one. They\n were crowded with the havoc of war\u2014\n a war whose shock was increased by\n all the fierceness of fratricidal strife.\n Men thronged the battlefront a thou-\n sand miles in length, a million and a.\n half iu number. Nearly half a million\n fell in death, duo to wounds, disease\n and starvation. One hundred and fifty\n thousand households were left to mourn\n in the darkness arising from a father\u2019s,\n a brother\u2019s and a lover\u2019s grave. Great\n cities were ravaged, fruitful valleys\n were stripped to desolation, huge rivers\n ran with blood. The border states be-\n came an involuntary temple for this\n sacrifice. Never before or since, at\n least, in modern times, has any nation\n been so torn, disrupted and convulsed.\n Pain and rage and righteous grief filled\n the clamant skies.\n</p>\n<p>\n And emergent through this black, I\n I black night of war and suffering, the '\n j patient stooping pioneer form of Lin-\n coln looms into view. Its darkness ean-\n i not hide him, for he is radiant. He trod\n | the way of death with assurance of faith\n \\ and consolation of love. Upon his\n I shoulders, more than any man\u2019s, rested\n i a government which he believed to be\n God\u2019s last best pledge of human welfare\n to the world. At that government men\n struck, heavily, struck sincerely, and\n | struck to kill. It was in peril at home\n land abroad. Polite society in Europe\n j scorned it because of its detested de-\n | mocracy. Commercial interests threat-\n j ened it because they worshipped profits.\n</p>\n<p>\n ! Kings and diplomatists, whose nod\n meant war, awaited the halt; the\n stumbling of this man. Beset behind\n and before, with the real causes of the\n struggle concealed by both North and\n South for varying reasons, he plodded\n along his thorny path, putting caution\n against hope, that hope may not be\n j premature, and hope against caution,\n that caution may not become despair.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then came, in successive strokes of\n ; dramatic intensity, the victories in the\n West, where once more the Mississippi\n I flowed unvexed to the sea; the slow re-\n J treat of the gallant Lee from the stub-\n j born Meade at Gettysburg; the act that\n I emancipated four ffiillion slaves; the\n crowning mercy of Appomattox; his last\n words of pacification; and the sovereign\n benison of just and mighty Death, which\n laid him on the purple altar of the state,\n its victor-victim and its high renowmed\n prince \u2014 surely Homeric legends are here\n outdone.\n</p>\n<p>\n Yet one must not be tempted to use\n undeserved superlatives, and I am warned\n concerning those fond devices, due to\n friendship\u2019s bias, that hurt our esti-\n mates. Still the unvarnished fact remains\n that all around this world to-day are in-\n creasing multitudes that no man can\n number, who will say with us that their\n knowledge of Abraham Lincoln is part of\n life\u2019s unalterable good. We celebrate this\n centennial with solemn joy; we are\n measurably reconciled to bis awful taking\n off; we comfort ourselves, if comfort be\n needed, by the reflection that his memory\n is our proud and imperishable heritage.\n The sublime admixture of his character\n and gifts in the service of such a crisis\n of humanity will endure beyond any hori-\n zon which can be realized by America\u2019s\n imagination.\n</p>\n<p>\n But behind our ranks of weeping and\n rejoicing citizenship, and heart to heart\n with us on this centennial anniversary,\n</p>\n<p>\n . are men of many nations, and the wise\n</p>\n<p>\n of all mankind. For our \u201chappy warrior\u2019\u2019\n who detested war has forever escaped the\n mists of prejudice and passion that con-\n cealed his meritorious person. His stately\n outlines have assumed their statuesque\n repose, and we see him now, and so does\n Engiand, and so do English-speaking\n men and men of other tongues, as Stan-\n ton saw him when he covered the face of\n the holy dead, and murmured in his grief,\n \u201cNow he belongs to the ages.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The enemy has uncapped to him in the\n gate. His devotees come from near and\n far. The voice of homage, heartfelt and\n spontaneous, is upraised beyond the wid-\n est seas. In that harvest of increase\n where the chosen few are permitted to\n reap, he has his bounty, and Time for\n this, her favored son, reverses the law of\n oblivion and declares that he being dead\n shall live, and that his name shall be\n glorious. With those elect and blessed\n ones who are called to stand in the Mount\n of Light, he ascends to undeniable, de-\n served and permanent renown.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some will wonder why this verdict was\n left to later times, and that so few of\n Lincoln ' s contemporaries could rightly\n read his riddle. Was not the purest Man\n that ever lived crucified? How long did\n Copernicus or Cromwell wait for their\n due meed? I beseech you, beware of con-\n temporary judgments. They lack perspec-\n tive; they were too close to Lincoln to\n perceive his real proportions. Chase\n patronized him; Seward believed that he\n must superintend his Presidency; Greeley\n rolled huge obstructions born of egotism\n in his path. The unparalleled beauty and\n power of his state papers and notable\n speeches were characterized as drivel and\n childishness. The Gettysburg address,\n first of all uttersfnees of the nineteenth\n century, was scarcely reported. Some\n prominent journals referred to it as \u201ca\n few remarks\u201d by the President. Here and\n there, and mainly among plain and simple\n men, he was valued at his approximate\n worth. But had he depended upon those\n who were the self-elected or accepted\n guides of opinion, he would have fared\n ill at intervals. These doubted, and so\n did his friends that Lincoln could be re-\n elected.

If\n it curses, it blesses. It qnloeks the\n springs Of life, disciplines men\u2019s native\n powers, and in its stern school an im-\n press is received that shapes for use\n and service. Nor was he so at all re-\n moved from Washington in blood, A\n shiftless fnther was but an eddy in the\n stream. His mother was an honorable\n woman, and her gift to us enshrines her\n in our spirit\u2019s deeps. The race to which\n he owed linpage had fruited off De\n Montfort, Cromwell, Pym and Pitt. It\n has always been prolific in parliamentary\n gifts, in constitutional liberty and the\n transforming capacities of political and\n social reform Men of Lincoln ' s type\n and of Washington ' s type are at one in\n essentials; their differences are acci-\n dental. Pioneer risks had made a con-\n trast between tho log cabin on Rock\n Creek and Mount Vernon\u2019s comfortable\n residence, but it was a surface inkling \u2014\n nothing more.\n</p>\n<p>\n They served two distinct epochs in one\n national evolution. They brought to\n that service a common ancestry, a com-\n mon language and a common law. Their\n instincts were alike \u2014 the conservative,\n reverent, obedient, and, in turn, com-\n manding traits that stand forth in both\n were products of a physical and moral\n bond, pecans roll in vain to destroy, and\n the flight of ages strengthens into forti-\n licd habits of the mind. I have no doubt\n that apart from his constitutional melan-\n choly, which needed the death of his\n mother to release it. Lincoln spent a\n happy boyhood in the grand amphitheater\n of natural aud free environment around\n his humble home.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 disturb oratorical relations of these\n rural simplicities with diffidence. But\n let us see him as he was: of good blood,\n of pure and normal- begetting; no fortui-\n tous man, no providential flat, but a mag-\n nificent and scientif ic product of racial\n supremacy \u2014 a supremacy that has trans-\n ferred the scepter of the race from the\n Tiber to the Thames, and from the Nile\n to the Potomac. Nor was Lincoln an\n uneducated man. His philosophy was\n pregnant, if peculiar to himself. His in-\n tuitions were keen to interpret the mys-\n teries of life and action. His style was\n equal to that of the contemporary poets\n and essayists, and superior to that of all\n his political associates. He did not\n read New England\u2019s literary leaders, but\n be devoured the Bible of the 1611 ver-\n sion, and he spent days and nights with\n Shakspeare. Wherein was he at loss?\n His wisdom was profound, and at times\n its prescience awes us His magnanimi-\n ties were simply vast. No man had a\n more catholic heart. The patience, the\n silence, the speech, the merciless think-\n ing, the lucid exposition, the moral lofti-\n ness. the tender felicity of Lincoln\u2019s many-\n sided nature, should be held steadily be-\n yond rail-splitting stories and allusions\n to hjs necktie. One greater than he\n drove the plane and fastened the nails at\n Nazareth. We are thankful for Truth\u2019s\n entrance at these lowly doors, but It is\n Truth we magnify, and not the door.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ten years before he was elected Presi-\n dent he was defeated and retired, a mem-\n ber of a falling party, whose day was\n over. But these were the silent years\n when he turned within himself, and when,\n freed from the intoxications and besol-\n ments of popular applause, he prepared\n his way toward the investment of\n Douglas.\n</p>\n<p>\n For three sorts of thinking he\n had great facilities. He could think\n</p>\n<p>\n in analysts, ancf all the tricking out of\n the dish did not delude his jnclsive\n dealing with it. He could think in\n comprehension. and pot only the\n</p>\n<p>\n North. but the true South, the\n</p>\n<p>\n South unseduced and virgin. had\n</p>\n<p>\n no greater interpreter than he. He could\n think in construction, though his attenu-\n</p>\n<p>\n ated body fairly creaked as he labored to\n rebuild the house upon a sure foundation.\n Thinking analytically, thinking comprehen-\n sively, thinking sympathetically, thinking\n steeped Inhumanity, and shot through and\n through with charity\u2019s sovereign power-\n such thinking made the superiority of\n Lincoln In the debate that shook the con-\n tinent. defeated the dearest hopes of the\n great leader of the Democratic party and\n finally gave Lincoln the prize that cost\n him his life. The Cooper Union speech\n was the masterly summarizing of twenty-\n ftvo years of unclouded mentality. It was\n more; it was the interpretation of the '\n conscience of the nation, when the fiend\n of gain was expolled.\n</p>\n<p>\n But. in the interim before that painful\n casting out of the diabolical tenant, the\n very Union was put to hazard. And, much\n as Lincoln detested slavery, he loved the\n nation more. Against both frenzied Abo-\n litionist and blinded Secessionist he held\n the ground that he must first save the\n ship and then adjust her cargoes. Here\n is the key that opens the doors in every\n winding of hfs policy. And in the first\n inaugural he never mentions slavery; he\n strikes the note that will vibrate to the\n -doom\u2014 the note of the Union. In his sec-\n ond inaugural, after four long, weary,\n purgatorial years of cleansing fire and\n blood, he pronounces on the entire issue\n in words I dare not comment upon, and\n can but quote:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe Almighty has His own purposes,\u2019\u2019\n he said. \" Woe unto the world because of\n offenses! for It must needs be that of-\n fenses come; but woe to that man by\n whom the offense cometh.\u201d If we shall\n suppose that American slavery is one of\n those offenses which, in the providence of\n God, must needs come, but which, having\n continued through his appointed time, he\n now wills to remove, and that he gives\n to both North and South this terrible\n war, as the woe due to those by whom\n the offense came, shall we discern therein\n any departure from .those divine attri-\n butes which the belie ' vers in a living God\n always ascribe to Him? Fondly do we hope,\n fervently do we pray, that this mighty\n sourge of war may speedily pass away.\n Yet, if God wills that it continue until\n all the wealth piled by the bondman\u2019s 250\n years of unreauited toil shall be sunk,\n and until every drop of blood drown with\n the lash shall be paid by another drawn\n with the sword, as was said 3,000 year3\n ago, so still it must be said, \u201cThe judg-\n ments of the Lord are true and righteous\n altogether.\u201d \u00ab\n</p>\n<p>\n \" With malice toward none; with char-\n ity for all; with firmness in the right, as\n God gives us to see the right, let us\n strive on to finish the work we are in, to\n bind up the nation\u2019s wounds; to care for\n him who shall have borne the battle, and\n for his widow, and his orphan \u2014 to do all\n which may achieve and cherish a just and\n lasting peace among ourselves and with\n all nations.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This address was placed by the lead-\n ers of England in the front of all politi-\n cal utterance. Yet in its presence, where\n tho noblest magistrates have bowed in\n reverence, a flippant criticism offends us\n by querulously asserting that Lincoln\n was no genius. Whence came this power\n and gift of utterance? utterance that\n makes him an entirely public man. What\n weight and penetration are here, what\n unerring interlocking logic. His defini-\n tions have become our current speech,\n and sentences culled from his deliver-\n ances will outlast the words of any other\n American.\n</p>\n<p>\n It matters little how genius obtains\n its gifts. We care not who taught Homer,\n or with whom Shakspeare took counsel.\n They dominate us but they resent our\n curiosities. The tides of eternity find\n some estuaries where they can flow mag-\n nificently, And Lincoln had ample room\n for their silent and massive floods The\n oulse of 20,000,000 throbbed in his breast,\n thoir thoughts find expression from his\n anointed tongue. For such a current\n he had sufficient outlet, and held be-\n tween the people and their God, he had\n</p>\n<p>\n a commerce with heaven and earth that\n made him rich toward both.\n</p>\n<p>\n I am convinced that this heroic man\n has not yet received his last laurel.\n Men wonder that he should be so richly\n crowned, But wonder will cease and\n the coronation will proceed apace. He\n was possessed of heights and depths no\n man of his times could claim and some of\n these as yet are but dimly suspect.\n</p>\n<p>\n These strange and unusual gifts, which\n are beyond the wont of nature did not\n become riotous through sheer strength,\n or play false to things of lesser fortune.\n In Napoleon, they wrought the destruc-\n tion of humanity, and one trembles to\n think of the penalties that would have\n visited this land had Lincoln been noth-\n ing save a genlU3. a supremely gifted\n man. But he also carried more familiar\n excellences and virtues, and these he\n maintained at an unusual pitch of perfec-\n tion. He did not parade his shining\n qualities. He sought no meretricious\n applause or maudlin sympathy. After he\n was President he was loth to speak un-\n less from sheer necessity. And he made\n no reference to tho rugged lot of his\n early days. He did not cause censure by\n superiority; he invited confidence, ho dis.\n armed suspicion, he oonflrmed good will.\n This broad humor was at times extrava-\n gant, but it was narrow when compared\n with his width of being, and its relief\n saved his staggering brain and heart.\n By Its means he kept the fool In his\n place, concealed his profound plans and\n policies, and gently offset the stilted ar-\n tlflcialisms of men who lacked his lis-\n some naturalness. So from the phenome-\n nal association in Lincoln of supreme\n and normal talents there issued the sal-\n vation of the people. For practical pur-\n poses religion and morality are of one:\n split for our mental convenience and\n for learned discussion, and by some mis-\n takenly conceived as too widely apart,\n since they deem the creatures of their\n minds absolute realities.\n</p>\n<p>\n Is It not superfluous naughtiness to ask\n if Lincoln was Mllgious? Do the stars\n shine? Does the sun give forth light and\n heat? Men tithe mint, anise and cumin,\n and glance at him to see how he tallies\n with their pettiness. I tell you that;\n busy in earthly politics a6 he was, he had\n moral might and majesty upon the like\n of which God\u2019s judgment throne is reared.\n He belonged to the glad hearts, without\n reproach or blot, who do God\u2019s will and\n know it not. He was excellent by rea-\n son of an instinctive conscience, the\n vicar of the skies within him, and not\n because he had to constantly struggle to\n keep from leasing lies and vanity. He\n had his days of doubt, induced In part\n by an ever-searching mind and in part by\n credal barriers that wrongly tested the\n qualifications for sainthood.\n</p>\n<p>\n But when the storms of personal and\n public woe burst upon his tender and\n firm nature, he bowed his knees to his\n Father, and wooed that passionless bride,\n divine tranquillity. She came to his heart\n through great tribulation. But in the last\n days, as he was being prepared for his\n ending, sorrow had no dominion that\n could usurp his peace. His griefs dug\n deep channels in him. and then love came\n and filled them with its healing waters.\n In Passion Week he died, when the flow-\n ers were bursting forth from the earth,\n and the last gun had been fired. lie had\n read a passage from \u201cMacbeth\u201d a few\n days before when sailing down the James\n River He repeated it aloud twice end\n thrice:\n</p>\n<p>\n Duncan is in his grave;\n</p>\n<p>\n After life\u2019s fitful fever, lie sleeps wei):\n Treason has done ilia worst: nor steel nor\n poison,\n</p>\n<p>\n Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing\n Can touch him further.\n</p>\n<p>\n A marked change had transformed him\n before the murderous shot was sent by. a\n debauched fanatic, who. as usual, bragged\n his code of honor.

Mrs. Julia\n Ward Howe has given to the world a\n poem W ' orthy of Lincoln and of herself.\n Lyman Abbott, Joseph H. Choate, Horace\n Porter and other men of New York, as\n well as citizens of New Egland and the\n Middle West, have said splendid things.\n Next to these the men influenced by the\n tradition of Lincoln are a notable num-\n ber. And not among the least of them\n are the Southerners and the children of\n the Southerners who have passed under\n the Lincoln influence.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe thus find the men who knew and\n heard Lincoln and the men upon whom\n the influence of Lincoln has fallen unit-\n ing in as memorable a tribute as the\n nation or the world ever paid to a human\n being. The service was transcendent and j\n the keynote of it was freedom to the\n race. We should not quarrel with the\n estimates of those who would have made j\n that keynote different. It is better for i\n every man to be sincere than for all of\n them to be right. My own humble opinion\n is that emancipation wrought at least as\n much good to the whites as to the ne-\n groes, and that the preservation of the\n Constitution waa the greatest work to\n which Lincoln set his hands. Emancipa-\n tion without the Constitution might have\n Icit the United States a wrangling series\n of jealous and discordant republics.\n Emancipation with the Constitution and\n within the Constitution preserved the)\n jewel of liberty and the citadel of fed-\n erated government as Its ca6lcet. The\n prayer of Webster: \u2018Liberty and union,\n now and forever, one and inseparable,\u2019\n was answered through the service and\n genius of Lincoln, and he must be skep-\n tical. indeed, who can believe that the\n answer was not prescribed by a Power !\n that is Divine.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI notice that Goldwin Smith, in an\n elaborate article, rates Lincoln very\n l::ghly, except in those proceedings as to\n which he differed from Mr. Lincoln him-\n self. The unconscious egotism and the\n imperturable complacency of Goldwin\n Smith are amusing \u2014 but not amazing. He\n is good enough to perceive that Lincoln\n was eventually right, because he finally\n reached the plane which he should have j\n reached at an earlier period. Mr. Smith, j\n however, forgives the dilatoriness of our {\n great President, and on the whole com- j\n mends him to the admiration of mankind. !\n Mr. Gladstone was under the same neces- |\n sity to differ from Mr. Lincoln, and to j\n carry the difference to the extent of buy- i\n ing Confederate bonds, and of favoring j\n the recognition of the independence of\n the Confederate States. Prince Albert,\n Queen Victoria, Disraeli and other Eng-\n lish persons, unpardonably differing from\n Mr. Gladstone, stayed his hand in Parlia-\n ment and in the foreign office, and such\n Americans as Archbishop Hughes, Thur-\n low Weed and Charles Francis Adams, as\n well as Henry Ward Beecher, confirmed i\n and consolidated, on English soil and to\n English minds, the conviction of John\n Bright, earliest, longest and stoutest\n friend of ours in Great Britain, that lib-\n erty and union were and forever would\n be one and inseparable here. Thus. Mr.\n Lincoln\u2019s unconditional American friends\n \u2022 nd unconditional British friends and be-\n</p>\n<p>\n lievers gradually brought Mr. Lincoln\u2019s\n British critics to their way of thinking\n \u00bb\u00bb > 4 sturdily held the British government\n to lines of neutrality which have since\n broadened into ties of brotherhood be-\n tween the two English-speaking nations\n of the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lessons of the Lincoln Centennial.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018\u2018These are among the lessons which\n the Lincoln centennial renews to Amer-\n icans, and the lessons are invaluable.\n Those who knew, met and heard Lincoln\n were captivated by him. Those who for\n many reasons, some ambitious, some en-\n vious, and all unjust, at the start belittled\n or distrusted Lincoln, grew to a larger\n moral stature as they perceived his moral\n and mental magnitude. Those who dis-\n cerned that there was no place for a\n state outside of the union, and those who\n realized that the Constitution must be\n made the integument of liberty to give\n to liberty either protection or perpetuity,\n were patient with Lincoln from the first ' ,\n or grew to be patient with him before\n long. The men who knew themselves to\n be wiser than Lincoln, because they\n were less patient, more heady and more\n precipitant, were unable to get posterity\n to accept their own valuation of them-\n selves, and some of them are still incon-\n solable on that account.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAmong the very best qualities of Lin-\n coln was the one that could make allow-\n ances. He could make allowances for\n those who differed from him by reason\n of lesser knowledge or lesser patience.\n He knew that the larger knowledge\n would come and the larger patience\n with it. Among those who were not\n wholly just to Lincoln, though ever de-\n sirous to be, was Charles Sumner. The\n morning Mr. Lincoln gave notice that he\n would proclaim emancipation, if in a few\n months ' time the South should not lay-\n down its arms, Mr. Lincoln, as George\n William Curtis told me, sent a copy of\n his notice to the Senator from Massachu-\n setts with the simple statement, in his\n own writing: - J am only three weeks be-\n hind you, Mr. Sumner.\u2019 And that stately\n Senator found his opposition dissolved by\n a blow so magnanimous and so gentle\n that he hastened to Mr. Lincoln with as-\n surances of attachment that were not\n afterward displaced. And when Mr. Lin-\n coln went to the Second Inauguration\n Ball he took Mr. Sumner with him in\n the carriage and committed to Mr. Sum-\n ner the escort of Mrs. Lincoln on that\n occasion of spectacle. The healing and\n confirming gospel of fellowship and of\n faith which this attested was lost to his-\n tory, but it was long preserved in the\n traditions of the Federal Capital.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe disarming Lincoln, the concilia-\n tory Lincoln, the magnanimous Lincoln,\n the optimistic Lincoln the forgiving\n Lincoln is the one I much like to remem-\n ber on an anniversary such as this and\n under associations such as these. The\n critics, the gentlemen whom Beacons-\n field said have failed in literature and\n in art, carry no Lincoln in their minds\n and suggest no Lincoln by their thoughts\n and letters whom the w-orld will little\n note or long remember. Lincoln, the\n great Magistrate, Lincoln the orator of\n persuasion and conversion, Lincoln the\n lawyer of subtlety, learning and of mas-\n terful influence with juries, will lose no\n</p>\n<p>\n ] place and will lose no rating. But Lin-\n coln, the man of heart, the man of sen-\n ! sibility, the man who respected women.\n</p>\n<p>\n ! loved children, pardoned those sentenced\n to die when they did not deserve death\n and who wrote himself a place on the\n tablets of the hearts of women and ol '\n men, is the Lincoln that will make his-\n tory tender, chronicle human, faith inde-\n structible, love eternal and tradition irn-\n i mortal.\n</p>\n<p>\n | \u201cLincoln was so many sided and so\n great that his enemies have derived more\n tame from the man they opposed than\n from their opposition. So loving and so\n luminous in this Lincoln that he lighted\n even his foes to posterity and transfused\n even some of them with a splendor not\n I their own. As was said somewhere yes-\n terday, I think by Lyman Abbott, perhaps\n it was Choate, or perhaps Horace Por-\n ter, Abraham Lincoln knew the South\n I itself better than Jefferson Davis, whom\n | the South made its leader, regarded as its\n i interpreter and who was long proDe to\n * be considered to be its martyr. Mr. Lin-\n l coin knew the universal South. Mr.\n [Davis knew the patrician South. The uni-\n ] versal South has responded to the heart\n j of Lincoln, and there are no eulogists of\n ! Lincoln to-day so sincere and so cordial\n | as the Southern people as a whole. The\n ! letters and the a ' ddresses of Lincoln, from\n ! the moment he was baptized by suffrage\n and by prayer into the Presidency, every-\n where breathe a tenderness, a trustful-\n ; ness, and what Dr. Storrs was wont to\n i call ' a longanimity,\u2019 that are trauscend-\n : ent; His humor was uuaint, rare and\n constant, but it was the by-product of\n I qualities much more serious and lasting,\n j It was the relief from despair. It was\n j the antidote to depression. it was a\n 1 full against rude, rash and intrusive\n I fools. It was an aid to the despondency\n of others and an amelioration of their\n apprehension or a dissolvent of their\n doubts. It was an ornamentation, not a\n substantiality. It will fall away and\n perish, just as the parts of a statue\n which are not the statue itself ar c\n brushed off before it is placed upon its\n pedestal for the observation of all aci\n I tor the appreciation of the best.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI am glad that the city, the state, all\n the states and the world have passed\n under the spell of this anniversary. T\n hope we can realize, without vanity, the\n larger America of to-day than the\n America of Lincoln ' s labors and of Lin-\n coln\u2019s love.

DR. THEODORE L. CUYLER.\n</p>\n<p>\n (From the February Homiletic Review.)\n</p>\n<p>\n The first time I ever saw Abraham\n Lincoln was in November, 1860, a few\n days after his election to the presidency.\n I met him at the Tremont House in\n Chicago. He had just come from\n Springfield to Chicago and he was ac-\n companied by his minister, the pastor\n of the Presbyterian Church in Spring-\n field, whose name now escapes me.\n His pastor told me that Lincoln had\n once been a very faithful teacher in the\n Sabbath school of his church, and this\n is a very important fact in its bearing\n on the much discussed question of Mr.\n Lincoln ' s religious character. I sent\n in my card to Mr. Lincoln, and when\n we met, he greeted me with a charac-\n teristic grasp of the hand, and his first\n seaterce touched my soft spot, when he\n said:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" I have kept up with you nearly overy\n week in the New York Independent.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The next time X saw Mr. Lincoln was\n when he was riding down Broadway,\n which was thronged with a gazing mul-\n titude, on his way to assume the presi-\n dency. He stood up in a barouche,\n holding on to the seat of the driver with\n one hand. On his bare head rose a\n thick mass of black hair, the crown\n which nature gave to her king. His\n mel-j ' choly eyes had a far-away look, as\n though he was conscious of the toils and\n troubles that awaited him. The great\n patriot President, moving on toward the\n conflict, the glory and the martyrdom\n was the most majestic figure that my\n eyes have ever beheld. He never passed\n through New ' York again until he was\n borne through tears and broken hearts\n cn his journey to his Western tomb.\n</p>\n<p>\n During the Civil War I visited Wash-\n ington as one of the preachers for the\n Christian Commission. On one of my\n visits to Washington, when I was the\n guest of Professor Henry, of the Smith-\n sonian Institution, I expressed a desire\n lo call upon Mr. Lincoln. That evening\n lie was to hold a levee at the White\n House. I went over very early, and.\n when the doors of the East Room opened,\n I was he first person who came in to\n salute him as he stood in the center of\n Hie parlor. HU first words were:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cDr. Cuyler, I am glad to see you. I\n haven\u2019t seen you since that evening at\n rhe Tremont House in Chicago.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n During that time he had encountered\n hundreds of thousands of persons, but\n his memory of that little incident was\n perfect. fT. : s ;e- \" o!lectloa was rernark-\n</p>\n<p>\n ' able an:! his great tact in recognizing\n people was one of the greatest contribu-\n tors to h s persona! influence. it. was\n , truly wonderful how he remembered\n | everybody he had ever seen.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the day following the levee 1\n called on him again, accompanied by my\n j venerable mother, who said that, she\n ! could not die happy unless she had seen\n Mr. Lincoln.\n</p>\n<p>\n My mother and I found him standing\n alone in the room, opposite the table\n on which he had written, the Emancipa-\n tion Proclamation. His hair was un-\n</p>\n<p>\n kempt. his eyes had a weary look. He\n said to us that he had not seen his\n wife, he had been so busy\u2014 and it, was\n then afler 4 o\u2019clock in the afternoon\u2014\n since 7 o ' clock that morning. And this\n day was but ,one of almost countless\n others 1\u2019ke 1:. When we came cut, my\n mother said, \u201c\u2019Did you ever see such a\n sad countenance in your life\u2019\u2019 isn\u2019t it\n cruel to keep that man here in such\n suffering?\u201d We speak of h ' m as the\n martyr President, but the truth is ' that,\n his martyrdom lasted through four\n years of overwhelming anxiefes and per-\n sonal suffering under the burden of hi3\n ; responsibilities, in his unceasing efforts\n j in behalf of the people who had ' :ub-\n i mitfed to his care the welfare of the\n 1 nation.\n</p>\n<p>\n ! There has been no little discussion in\n j regard to the religious character of\n Abraham Lincoln. That he was a man\n [ of the most strict and exemplary morai-\n I ity no one has ever dieouted. For ex-\n ample, in his early life he made a speech\n for total abstiuence which had a wide\n circulation. When the notification com-\n mittee called upon him to inform him of\n his election to the presidency, instead of\n bringing put a decanter of wine, as might\n have been expected, be brought only a\n pitcher of cold water and told the com-\n mittee that he would entertain them with\n i the oldest beverage that had ever passed\n j the lips of man. He was, with all of his\n i jesting and fondness for mirthful stories,\n very clean-mouthed, and most reveren-\n tial in his utterances.\n</p>\n<p>\n That Abraham Lincoln believed in\n prayer no one has ever disputed. When\n ibis intimate friend. Bishop Simpson, for\n whom he had a warm attachment, oalled\n - upon him, it was his custom to request\n S:mpsou to offer prayer with him. and I\n think it was to Simpson that he made\n ! tha t memorable utterance: \u201cI have often\n been driveu to my knees when, under the\n I pressure of overwhelming difficulty, I felt\n</p>\n<p>\n \u25a0that my own wisdom and that of others\n around me had utterly failed, and I had\n nowhere else to go.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n General Kusliug of New Jersey has\n published an account of an interview\n ' with Mr. Lincoln in which the President\n : told him of a prayer which he had of-\n fered beftfre the battle of Gettysburg, in\n ; which he promised that if God should\n j give to the Union arms the victory, he\n would be true to his promise of universal\n emancipation. Now then, if Mr. Lincoln\n was a man so pure and exemplary in his\n private life, if lie believed, as he did\n not hesitate to avow ' , so emphatically in\n I the \u2022 efficacy of prayer, the question\n arises: -Why is it that he nevbr made any\n j public profession of his faith in Christ\n and never entered into membership of\n ^ aiiy church?\n</p>\n<p>\n I have already said that in SprfogBeld\n he was ' a Sabbath school teacher, but\n fba: did not require that he should be\n a member of the church which he a:-\n teuded. .During his presidential days in\n Washington he was a regular attendant\n and pew-holder in the New York Avenue\n Presbyterian Church. The pastor of that\n church was a man possessed of a very\n I Irgh order of intellect and Of spiritual-\n ity. Bat with all of bis personal excel-\n lences as a. most godly minister of Jesus\n Christ, lie aid not gain a strong personal\n hold upon Mr. Lincoln. I have always\n believed that if the President had; been\n under the ministry of his beloved ijriend.\n Bishop Simpson, or the eloquent Dij. Ed-\n ward N. Kirk of Boston, both of whom\n used to visit him and inspire hint with\n fresh ardor iu his great work and to ex-\n press to him their warmest sympathy with\n his aim at emancipation, either of ' them\n might have gained an influence \u2019 that\n would have led him to an open declara-\n tion of his faith in the Lord Jesus Christ.\n It has even been said that Lincoln gave\n as a reason for not uniting with the\n Church that he was not prepared to\n subscribe to any entire denomina-\n tional creed: that If they only asked him\n to subscribe to the two great tommand-\n ments \u2014 to love God with all bis heart\n and mind and strength and big fellow\n men as himself\u2014 he would be willing to\n unite with the Church on syeh condi-\n tions.\n</p>\n<p>\n Whether that were true or not., I still\n feel that had he been, during those four\n years, under the constant loving over-\n sight and association with a pastor who\n had won his way into bis heart, he\n might have been brought iyto tbs Church\n of the Lord J;\u2019us Christ.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0042/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 319, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 486}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0042/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 639, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 973}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0042/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1279, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1946}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0042/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2559, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3892}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:li:nc:ol:nc:en:te:na:ry:00:un:se:lincolncentenary00unse:lincolncentenary00unse_0042/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/li/nc/ol/nc/en/te/na/ry/00/un/se/lincolncentenary00unse/lincolncentenary00unse_0042.jp2", "height": 3892, "width": 2559, "levels": 6, "size": 433015}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"42\">\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n TKe Pkilosopliy of tlie Election\n</p>\n<p>\n (An^ -address delivered by Mr. Lincoln to a group of serenaders on November\n 10, 1864, the second night after his re-election.)\n</p>\n<p>\n It has long been \u00ab grave question\n whether any governm\u00b0nt not too strong\n tor the liberties of its people can be\n strong enough to maintain its own ex-\n istence in great emergencies. On this\n point the present rebellion brought our\n republic to a severe test, and a presiden-\n tial election occurring in regular course\n during the rebellion added not a little to\n the strain. It the loyal people united\n were put to the utmost of their strength\n by the rebellion, must they not fail when\n divided and partially paralyzed by a po-\n litical war among themselves? But the\n election was a necessity. We cannot\n have free government without elections;\n and if the rebellion could force us to\n forego or postpone a national election, it\n might fairly claim to have already con-\n quered and ruined us. The strife of the\n election is but human nature practically\n applied to the facts of the case. What\n has occurred in this case must ever re-\n cur in similar cases. Human nature will\n not change. In any future great -na-\n tional trial, compared with the men of\n this, we shall have as weak and as\n strong, as silly and as wise, as bad and\n as good. Let us, therefore, study the in-\n cidents of this, as philosophy to learn\n wisdom from, and none of them as wrongs\n to be revenged. But the election, along\n with its incidental and undesirable strife,\n has done good, too. It has demonstrated\n that a people\u2019s government can sustain\n a national election in the midst of\n</p>\n<p>\n great civil war. L ' ntil now It has not\n been known to the world that this was\n a possibility. It shows, also, how sound\n and how strong we still are. It shows\n that, even among candidates of the same\n party, he who is most devoted to the\n Union and most opposed to treason can\n receive most of the people\u2019s votes. It\n shows also, to the extent yet known, that\n we have more pien now than we had\n when the war began. Gold is good\n in its place, but living, brave, pa-\n triotic*. men are better than gold.\n But the rebillion continues; and now\n that the election is over, may not all\n having a common interest reunite in e\n common effort to saVn our common coun-\n try? For my own part, I have striven\n and shall strive to avoid placing any ob-\n stacle in the way. So long as I have\n been here, I have not willingly planted\n a thdrn in any man\u2019s bosom. While J\n am deeply sensible to the high compli-\n ment of a re-election, and duly grateful,\n as I trust, to Almighty God for having\n directed my countrymen to a right con-\n clusion. as I think, for their own good,\n it adds nothing to my satisfaction that\n any other man may be disappointed or\n pained by the result.\n</p>\n<p>\n May I ask those who have not differed\n with me to join with me in this same\n spirit toward those who have?
