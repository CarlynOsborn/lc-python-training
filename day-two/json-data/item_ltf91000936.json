Chance decides who shall have the first shoot ; the object is to\n drive the marble into the first hole ; if this be done, the player shoots again,\n at the distance of a span, towards the second. If, however, he miss the\n lole, the other player begins, and each shoots, alternately, as the other\n misses. After having shot the marble into a hole, the player is allowed,\n if his adversary\u2019s marble be near, to drive it with his own as far as he can,\n and if he strike it, to shoot again. The game is won by the player who\n gets first into the last hole, in the following order : \u2014 first hole, second, third,\n \u2014second, first, \u2014 second, third. The loser places his knuckles at the first\n hole, the winner shoots as near to it as he can from the line, and fires three\n 1 imes, from the place where his marble rests, at the loser\u2019s knuckles.\n</p>\n<p>\n KNOCK-OUT.\n</p>\n<p>\n Two or more may play at this game. He who begins, throws a marble\n gently against a wall, so that it rebounds to a distance not exceeding a yard ;\n a second player throws another marble against the wall, endeavouring\n to make it rebound, so as to strike or come within a span of the first; if he\n can do neither, the first player takes up his own marble, and, in turn, strives\n to snop or span that of the second. The marble that is thus snopped or\n spanned, is won, and the winner begins again. Where only two play, it\n is best to knock out two or three marbles each, alternately, before they\n begin to use those on the ground.

If he fail to do so. Ilia\n own taw is thrown at in turn, and thus each player has, alternately, a\n cast at the taw of the other. A strong marble will frequently break, or\n conquer, fifty or a hundred others ; where this game is much played, a\n taw that has become a conqueror of a considerable number, is very much\n prized, and the owner will not play it against any but those which have\n conquered a respectable quantity. \u201c When Greek meets Greek,\u201d or when\n two conquerors are engaged, the number of marbles previously broken by\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0023/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0023/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0023/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0023/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0023/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0023.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 446773}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"23\">\n<p>\n MINOR SPORTS\n</p>\n<p>\n 11\n</p>\n<p>\n the vanquished if added to those of the victor; thus, if my taw having\n already tplit twenty marbles, conquers another that has split twenty, my\n taw then becomes a conqueror of forty-one, \u2014 that is, twenty, its previous\n score ; twenty, the vanquished taw\u2019s score, and one for the broken taw\n itself. In the west of England, the game of \u201c The Conqueror\u201d is also play-\n ed, with small, hard, variegated shells, which are found in old banks, and\n from which the snails, their former inhabitants, have disappeared.

We have seen\n the boards, in this game, marked above some of the arches with nihils, in\n this order : \u2014 5, 0, 1, 2, 0,.3, 0, 4, 0. In some places, where there are no\n nihils on the board, and the numbers go beyond five, the bowler not only\n loses his marble, if it strike against the sides of the arches, but also gives\n the board-keeper a marble each time he bowls.\n</p>\n<p>\n RING-TAW.\n</p>\n<p>\n The rules of Ring-taw vary in different places ; the following are the\n most general : \u2014 A circle is drawn, into which each party places as many\n marbles as may be agreed on. A line, called the offing, is then drawn at\n some distance, from which each in turn shoots at the ring. Shooting a\n marble out of the ring, entitles the shooter to go on again, and thus the\n ring may be sometimes cleared by a good player, before his companion or\n companions have a chance.

About London, peg-tops are, in general, only used for the purpose\n of being spun, and taken up to \u201c sleep,\u201d as it is called, in wooden spoons,\n which are sold at the toy-shops for that purpose ; but elsewhere, regular\n games at peg-top are played, in which the victors carry off capital steel\n pegs as trophies of their prowess at the sport. A circle, whose diameter is\n about a yard, is first drawn on a smooth piece of ground, (pavement is\n objectional for this game,) and several players surround it. One volunteers\n to commence; he throws his top inside the circle, and the others are at\n liberty to cast theirs at it, so long as it remains within the ring ; the moment\n it rolls out, he may take it up, and peg at those which still remain inside.\n The object of each player being to split the tops of his companions, if he\n succeed in any case, he keeps the peg of the split top as the spoil of his\n victory. If either of the players do not cast his top within the ring, or if\n he attempt to take it mt, or if he fail to set it spinning when he throws,\n</p>\n<p>\n or if it do not spin out, or after it ceases spinning, roll out of the circle,\n it is called \u201c a dead top,\u201d and must be placed in the centre of the ring for\n the others to peg at. When it is knocked out again without being split,\n the player to whom it belongs, takes it up, and plays away as before.\n Sometimes half-a-dozen dead tops are driven out of the ring by one cast,\n without any of them being damaged, and indeed, if they be made of good\n box, it is but rarely that they split. A top witli a long peg i , best at this\n</p>\n<p>\n game, as it is more calculated to swerve out of the ring after it is spun ; a\n</p>\n<p>\n top that sleeps after it is east, runs the greatest danger, and those that sleep\n most, are heavy bodied tops with short blunt pegs. It is advisable to wind\n tlie cord round nearly three parts of the peg, as well as the top, and to use\n a button at the end instead of a loop. The Spanish\n</p>\n<p>\n pcg-t n, of which we give a cut in the margin, is\n</p>\n<p>\n made of fine mahogany, and tapered off less abruptly\n toward the peg than the English tops. The peg is\n very short, of an uniform thickness, and rounded,\n not pointed, at the end. These tops spin nearly up-\n right, and for thrice the usual time ; it is unnecessary\n to throw them with any degree of force ; in fact, they\n spin best when set up under-handed ; so that, for playing on flooring or\n pavement, they are much superior to those made in the English fashion,\n although, for the same reason, totally unfit for \u201c Peg in the ring.\u201d The\n forms of English peg-tops, as well as those of humming-tops, and the\n conmjon whip-tops, are so well known, that it would be useless for us to\n offer engravings of them.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0027/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0027/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0027/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0027/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0027/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0027.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 312358}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"27\">\n<p>\n MINOR SPORTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n HUMMING-TOP.\n</p>\n<p>\n Hum ming-tops, of various sizes, are to be bought at the toy-shops ; vert\n little art is necessary to use them.

The player to whom the\n hole, into which the ball is bowled, belongs, picks it up as quickly as he\n can, and endeavours to strike one of the others with it; (the latter all run\n off as soon as they perceive that the ball is not for themselves ;) if the\n thrower miss his aim, he loses a point, and is called \u201c a fifer,\u201d and it is his\n turn to bowl : if, however, he strike another, he loses nothing; but the\n party so struck, in case he fail to hit another with the ball, becomes \u201c a fifer/\u2019\n and it is his turn to bowl. Five or six may be struck in succession, anil\n the ball may be kept up, no matter how long, until a miss be made, when\n the party so missing loses a point, and bowls. It is also allowed, for one\n player to accept the ball from another, and run the risk of striking a third :\n thus, if A stand close behind B, and C have the ball in front of B, A may\n signify by motions that he will take the ball, which is then thrown toward\n him by C; he catches it, and endeavours to strike B before he can run\n away ; if he miss, he loses a point, and bowls. The second bowling is con-\n ducted precisely as the first; but he who bowls three times without passing\n the ball into a hole, loses a point, and if he have lost one before, becomes\n \u201c a tenner;\u201d he must still go on, until he succeed in putting the kail inti\n a hole; it is his own fault if he bowl into that which belongs to himself,\n A party who misses his aim a second time becomes \u201c a tenner;\u201d he win.\n loses a third point, ** a fifteener ;\u201d and when four points are lost, the party\n stands out. The game goes on until all the players are out but one ; the\n latter wins the game. One of the others then takes the ball in his left\n hand, places his face toward the wall, and throws the ball over the riglu\n shoulder as far as he can. The player who has won stands at the spot\n wnere the ball first touches the ground, or, if it be not immediate!

The ball is a little one, but exceedingly hard,\n being made with leather, and stuffed with feathers. There are, generally,\n two players, who have each of them his bat and ball. The game consists in\n driving the ball into certain holes made in the ground; he who achieves\n which the soonest, or in the fewest number of strokes, obtains the victory.\n The G off-lengths, or the spaces between the first and last holes, are some-\n times extended to the distance of two or three miles; the number of inter-\n vening holes is optional, but the balls must be struck into the holes and not\n beyond them. When four persons play, two of them are sometimes part-\n ners, and have but one ball, which they strike alternately, but every one\n has his own bandy.

Innings are tossed up for,\n and the player who wins, places the\n ball in the spoon of the trap, touches\n the trigger with the bat, and, as the\n ball hops from the trap, strikes it as\n far as he can. One of the other play-\n ers (who may be from two to half-a-\n dozen) endeavours to catch it. If he\n do so before it reaches the ground,\n or hops more than once, or if the\n striker miss the ball when he aims at\n it, or hits the trigger more than twice\n without striking die ball, he loses his\n finings, and the next in order, which must previously be agreed on, takes\n his place. Should the ball be fairly struck, and not caught, as we have\n stated, the out-player, into whose hands it comes, howls it from the place\n where lie picks it up, at the trap ; which, if he hit, the striker is out. If he\n miss it, the striker counts one toward the game, which may be any number\n decided on. There is also a practice in some places, when the bowler has\n sent in the ball, of the striker\u2019s guessing the number of bat\u2019s lengdis it is\n from the trap; if he guess within the real number, he reckons dial number\n toward his game; but if lie guess more than there really are, he jo < qs his\n innings It is not necessary to make the game in one inning.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0034/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0034/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0034/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0034/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0034/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0034.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 515753}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"34\">\n<p>\n 20\n</p>\n<p>\n MINOR SPORTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n NORTHERN-SPELL.\n</p>\n<p>\n Northern-spell is played with a trap, and the ball is stricken with a bat,\n or stout stick, at the pleasure of the players, but the latter is most con.\n monly used.

Four stones\n or posts are placed from twelve to twenty yards asun-\n b d der, as a, b, c, d, in the margin; another is put at e ; one\n</p>\n<p>\n of the party which is out, who is called the pecker or\n e feeder, places himself at e. He tosses the ball gently\n</p>\n<p>\n toward a, on the right of which one of the in-party\n places himself, and strikes the ball, if possible, with his\n bat. If he miss three times, or if the ball, when struck, fall behind a, or be\n caught by any of the players, who are all scattered about the field except\n one who stands behind a, he is out, and another takes his place.

Supposin ' '\n he can only get to b, one of his partners takes the bat, and strikes at the ball\n in turn ; while the ball is passing from the feeder to a, if it be missed, or after\n it is struck, the first player gets to the next or a further goal, if possible, with-\n out being struck. If he can only get to c, or d, the second runs to b, only\n or c, as the case may be, and a third player begins; as they get home, that\n is, to a , they play at the ball in rotation, until they all get out; then, ot\n course, the out-players take their places.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0035/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0035/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0035/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0035/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0035/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0035.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 427257}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"35\">\n<p>\n SPORTS OF AGILITY AND SPEED.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many of the previous sports with balls and tops, are in part games of\n agility and speed, and so also are several of those which will be found\n among the Miscellaneous Minor Sports; but the following pastimes are\n exclusively games either of speed or agility, for which no implements are\n necessary.\n</p>\n<p>\n LEAP-FROG.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is a most excellent pastime.

The boy, who is to be leaped over, re-\n ceives the greater shock from the jumpers; anti he is in more danger of be-\n ing thrown down by, or having a blow on his head from, their knees.\n</p>\n<p>\n prisoners\u2019 base.\n</p>\n<p>\n Prisoners\u2019 Base is truly a capital game for cold weather. The best num-\n ber to play at it is six or eight on each side, but there is no objection to more\n or fewer players. The choice of partners is decided by chance ; a line, ten\n or twelve yards in length, is drawn about a dozen yards from a wall ; other\n lines are drawn at each end of the first, reaching thence to the wall, and the\n third from the middle of the first line to the wall ; one party takes possession\n of the bounds on one side of this middle, and the other set of players takes\n the bounds on the other side of it. Two prisons are also marked in a line\n with each other, at from one to two hundred yards (as convenience will per-\n mit) from the front of the bounds ; the prison belonging to one party must be\n opposite the bounds of the other. The game is now commenced by a player\n from one side running out mid-way between the bounds and prisons ; a\n player from the other side immediately follows, apd he may be pursued by\n one of his adversaries, who in like manner may be followed by a player\n from the side which began the game, and so on ; both parties being at liberty\n to send out as many as they think fit. The object of each player is to come\n up with, or intercept and touch any player of the opposite side, who has\n left the bounds before him ; he is not at liberty to touch any that \u2019have\n started after him, it being their privilege, on the contrary, if they can, to\n touch him before he can get back within his bounds again. A player is\n allowed to touch one of the opposite party only each time he quits bounds,\n and after having touched an adversary, he is exempt from being touched on\n his return to bounds. Every player who is touched, goes to the prison\n belonging to his party, where he must remain until one of his own side\n (who must start from bounds after the prisoner has been within the line of\n the prison) be able to reach him, without being touched in his run from\n bounds to prison, by any of the opposite party who may have left their\n bounds after him. When thus released, neither he nor the player who hits\n relieved him is to touch or be touched in their return to bounds again. The\n game is won by that side which has all the players of tlie other ir. prison at\n the same time.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0037/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0037/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0037/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0037/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0037/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0037.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 409186}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"37\">\n<p>\n MINOR SrORTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 23\n</p>\n<p>\n SADDLE MY NAG\n</p>\n<p>\n Two players toss up for choice of partners ; six or eight on each side is\n Jie best number : after choosing, the two leaders toss up for innings, he who\n oses (hen ranges himself and his associates in the following manner : \u2014 One\n player places himself almost upright, with his hands resting against a wah\n or tree, a second puts his head against the skirts of the first, the third\n against the skirt of the second, and so on until they are all ranged.

The player so overtaken becomes Touch, and then\n endeavours to get near enough to lay his hand upon one of the rest. This\n is an active and amusing game for boys in cold weather. It is sometimes\n called T ouch-iron or Touch wood ; in these cases, the players are safe\n only while they touch iron or wood, as may be previously agreed.

He mentions another kind of pastime upon the ice, which is even\n now practised by boys in several parts of England ; his words are to this\n effect \u2022 \u201c Others make a seat of ice, as large as a mill-stone, and having\n</p>\n<p>\n placed one of their companions upon it, they draw him along, when it some-\n times happens, that moving on slippery places, they all fall down headlong.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Sledges are, now-a-days, also used, which being extended from a centre\n by means of a strong rope, those who are seated in them are moved round\n with great velocity, and form an extensive circle. Sledges of this kind were\n set upon the Thames in the time of a hard frost at the commencement of the\n last century, as the following couplet, taken from a song written upon that,\n occasion, plainly proves.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c While the rabble in sledges run giddily round.\n</p>\n<p>\n And nought but a circle of folly is found.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n SKATING.\n</p>\n<p>\n Skating is by no means a modern pastime, and probably the invention\n proceeded rather from necessity than the desire of amusement. It is a\n boast of a northern chieftain, that he could traverse the snow upon skates of\n wood. Strutt states that he cannot by any means ascertain at what time\n skating made its first appearance in England, but that some traces of such an\n exercise are found in the thirteenth century ; at which period, according to\n Fitzstephen, it was customary in the winter, when the ice would bear them,\n for the young citizens of London to fasten the leg bones of animals under the\n soles of their feet, by tying them round their ankles, and then taking a pole\n shod with iron into their hands, they pushed themselves forward by striking\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0045/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0045/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0045/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0045/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0045/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0045.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 426374}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"45\">\n<p>\n MINOR SPORTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 31\n</p>\n<p>\n it against the ice, an I moved witli cclo* ily, equal, says the author, to :i liini\n Hying through the air, or an arrow from a cross-bow; but some allowance,\n ive presume, must lie made for the poetical figure : lie then adds, \u201c at times,\n two of them thus furnished agree to set opposite one to another at a great dis\n tance; tlvey meet, elevate their poles, attack and strike each other, when\n one or both of them fall, and not without some bodily hurt, and even after\n their fall are carried a great distance from each other by the rapidity of the\n motion, and whatever part of the head comes upon the icc. it is sure to be\n laid bare.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The wooden skates shod with iron or steel, which are bound about the\n feet and ankles like the talares of the Greeks and Romans, were, most pro-\n bably brought into England from the low countries, where they are said to\n have originated, and where, it is well known, they are almost universally\n used by persons of both sexes when the season permits. Some modern\n writers have asserted that \u201c the metropolis of Scotland has produced more\n instances of elegant skaters than perhaps any other county whatever; and\n the institution of a. skating club has contributed not a little to the improve-\n ment of this amusement.\u201d Strutt, in noticing this, observes tha when the\n Serpentine river in Hyde Park was frozen over, he saw four gentlemer\n there dance, if the expression may be allowed, a double minuet, in skates\n with as much ease and perhaps more elegance, than in a ball-room ; others\n again, by turning and winding with much adroitness, have readily in suc-\n cession described upon the ice the form of all the letters in the alphabet.\n</p>\n<p>\n SWINGING.\n</p>\n<p>\n The construction of the swing is simple : two ropes of equal lengths, are\n to be suspended from any branch or cross piece of timber, of adequate\n strength ; at the bottom of these ropes a seat is to be securely fastened, and\n the party who takes the seat must be propelled by another on the ground ; a\n rope for this purpose must be fastened to the back part of the seat\n</p>\n<p>\n FRENCH AND ENGLISH.\n</p>\n<p>\n This game is played by two parties, whose numbers are equal; they all\n take hold of a rope, and the object of each party is pull those belonging to\n tlie other across a chalk line on the ground, by means of the rope. When\n all the players on one side are thus pulled over or made prisoners, the other\n party wins the game. This is a very lively sport, any number may join in\n it, and it affords capital exercise and much amusement.\n</p>\n<p>\n TIP-CAT.\n</p>\n<p>\n Tip-cat, or, pernaps, more properly, the game of cat, is a rustic pastime\n well known in many parts of the kingdom.

The second method is to make four, six, or eight holes in\n the ground, in a circular direction, and as nearly as possible, at equal dis-\n tances from each other, and at every hole is placed a player with his cudgel ;\n one of the opposite party, who stand in the held, tosses the cat to the batsman\n who is nearest him, and every time the cat is struck, the players are obliged\n to change their situations, and run once from one hole to another in succes-\n sion ; if the cat be driven to any great distance, they continue to run in the\n same order, and claim a score toward their game, every time they quit one\n hole and run to another; but if the cat be stopped by their opponents, and\n thrown across between any two of the holes before the player who has quittec\n one of them can reach the other, he is out.\n</p>\n<p>\n HOP-SCOTCH.\n</p>\n<p>\n In some parts of England this game is called Pottle.

Each of the\n players being previously provided with a large pebble, or stone, double the\n si/.e of a cricket ball, or thereabout, one of them, by chance or choice, be-\n comes duck ; that is, he places the pebble or stone with which he is going to\n play, on the large stone, and stands a little on one side. The others then\n cast their pebbles or ducks at it, in turn, from the offing, each endeavouring*\n to knock it off its place. Each player, as soon as he has cast his duck,\n watches for an opportunity of carrying it back to the offing, so as to cast\n again. If the player who is duck, can touch him after he has taken up his\n pebble, and before he reaches the offing, provided his own pebble remain\n on the large stone, then the player so touched becomes duck. It sometimes\n happens that three or four of the out-players\u2019 ducks lie so close together, that\n the player who is duck can stand in a situation to be within reach of all oi\n them ; in this case, they cannot, without running the risk of being touched,\n pick up. mtil one of those who are at the offing is lucky enough to strike the\n duck ofi the large stone; then, before its owner can replace it, which he\n must do before he can touch a player, they all take up their ducks and run to\n the offing, where, of course, they are safe.\n</p>\n<p>\n HUNT THK SLIPPER.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is usually an in-door game, although there is no other objection to\n its being played on a dry piece of turf than that the slipper cannot be heard\n when struck by its momentary possessor, when passing round the joyoin\n ring.

It is to be observed, that there are two of\n these arches, that is, one at either end of the alley. The game of Mall was\n a fashionable amusement in the reign of Charles II., and the walk in St.\n James\u2019s Park, now called the Mall, received its name from having been ap-\n propriated to the purpose of playing at Mall, where Charles himself, and his\n courtiers, frequently exercised themselves in the practice of this pastime.\n The denomination of \u201c Mall,\u201d given to this game, is evidently derived from\n the mallet or wooden hammer used by the players to strike the ball.

When all are thus united, two others take the one who is\n at the extremity of the line by the two hands and pull until they separate him\n from the grasp of the one who is behind him.

Then do snow-balls, harmless if lightly com-\n pressed, but otherwise if strongly kneaded, fly about in abundance. Caves\n and even pigmy fortresses, are constructed; the rolling ball, which is first\n rounded by the little hands of a child, becomes, in a few hours, by driving it\n over the snow, too big for a man to move. When the joyous tenants of the\n play-ground have become fatigued with rolling the ball, or it has acquired a\n size and weight superior to their united powers, it is a common practice with\n them to cut a rude resemblance of a man out of the mass, adding to its height\n and diminishing its breadth. This is called the Snow Statue ; and Avhen\n complete, the young sculptors retire to a convenient distance, and, with the\n aid of snoAv-balls, each tries his utmost to demolish that which they have\n just taken such pains to construct.\n</p>\n<p>\n We are Avell aware that there are other Minor Sports and Pastimes piac-\n tised in play-grounds in different parts of the country, besides those we have\n</p>\n<p>\n __ described; it would be impossible for us \u201c to press the endless throng\u201d with-\n</p>\n<p>\n WM our limits.

The famous battle of Cressy was fought four years afterward, in\n which, it is stated, that we had about two thousand archers, opposed to about\n the same number of French. In the fifth year of the reign of Edward IV.\n an act was passed, that every Englishman, and Irishman dwelling with\n Englishmen, should have an English bow of his own height, which is directed\n to be made of yew, wycli, hazel, ash or awburne, or any other reasonable\n tree, according to their power. The next chapter also directed, that butts\n should be made in every township, which the inhabitants were obliged to\n shoot at, every feast day, under the penalty of one half-penny when they\n should omit this exercise. During the reign of Henry VIII. several statutes\n were made for the promotion of Archery. An act of parliament, in Eliza-\n beth\u2019s reign, regulated the price of bows. Charles I. is said to have been\n an Archer; and, in the eighth year of his reign, he issued a commission to\n prevent the fields near London being so enclosed as \u201c to interrupt the neces-\n sary and profitable exercise of shooting.\u201d So lately as the year 1753, tar-\n gets were erected in the Finsbury fields, during the Easter and Whitsuntide\n holydays, when the best shooter was styled \u201c Captain \u201d for the ensuing year,\n and the second, \u201c Lieutenant.\u201d Edward VI, in his journal, says, that one\n hundred Archers of his guard shot, before him, two arrows each, and after-\n ward, altogether ; and that they shot at an inch board, which some pierced\n quite through with the heads of their arrows, the board being well seasoned\n timber. The distance of the mark is not mentioned.

The round inside part is bent inward ; if the bow be pulled the reverse\n way, it will break ; therefore, however a bow may be bent when unstrung\n t is invariably to be strung with the round part inward\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0057/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0057/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0057/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0057/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0057/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0057.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 445473}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"57\">\n<p>\n ARCHERY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 45\n</p>\n<p>\n ARROWS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Arrows should be delicately proportioned in length and weight to the bow\n C or which they are intended. They are used blunt or sharp, and varying in\n their thickness according to the fancy of the Archer. Some are made so\n as to taper gradually from the feathers to the pile, and some viceversa ;\n others again are thickest in the centre. All arrows should have their nocks\n or notches cased with horn, and the nocks should be of such a size as to fit\n the string with exactness, and be neither too tight nor too loose. Three\n goose or turkey feathers are affixed to arrows; one of these, denominated\n Die cock feather, is of a different color from the other two, and this is al-\n ways to be placed uppermost.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE STRING.\n</p>\n<p>\n That part of the string which receives the nock of the arrow is whipped\n with sewing silk, to prevent the string being rubbed and weakened. If the\n silk should come oil ' the string, it ought to be re-whipped without delay;\n otherwise, it will be in danger of breaking ; and this is not the only mis-\n chief, for from the breaking of a string oftentimes ensues the snapping of the\n bow. It is also advisable to whip the noose and eye of the string, although\n many archers do not trouble themselves to do so. At one end of the bow-\n string an eye is made ; it is left for the archer himself, bows being of differ-\n ent lengths, to make the other : this, to a young archer, will be found rather\n difficult ; his best plan will be to inspect the mode of making the noose on an\n old string. The young archer will do well, if any of the threads of Ids\n string break, to throw it by and use another. He should never, if possible,\n permit the string to become twisted or ravelled; should such an occurrence\n lake place, before it is put on again it ought to be re-twisted and waxed.\n A bow, five feet long when braced, should never have the string more than\n Sve inches from its centre. This rule will be a guide to the young archer\n in stringing his bow ; whatever be its length he will of course adjust the\n distance in the same proportion, according to the admeasurement.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE TASSEL.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is very necessary to the archer for the purpose of cleaning the arrow\n from such dirt as generally adheres to it if it enter the ground.

The tassel is suspended on the left side of the archer, and\n is thus always at hand for use.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE GLOVE.\n</p>\n<p>\n The glove consists of places for three fingers, a back thong and a wrist\n strap to fasten it.

The facing is\n usually made of canvass which is sewn on the bass; tl\u00bbe bass is made of straw,\n worked as a bee-hive. The facing has a gold centre and four circles ;\n namely, the outer white edged with green, the black inner, white and red.\n Where it is not convenient to keep the targets fixed, it is better to use another\n kind, made of pastelward, these being more portable, although by no means\n so durable, as targets made of the other materials we have mentioned. If\n one target only be shot at, a great deal of time is wasted in going to fetch\n the arrows, and again returning to the spot for shooting from : two targets\n are, therefore, generally used, and the archers shoot from one to the other.\n In Archery matches, there are generally two prizes ; one for the greatest\n number of arrows shot into the target, \u2014 the other for the shot nearest the\n gold centre. Hits in the target are sometimes reckoned all alike ; but there\n is usually a distinction made. The gold centre is the mark, and the circle\n which approaches nearest to it, being less in size, and consequently ' , more\n difficult to hit, and nearer the main mark itself, an arrow shot in that circle\n is deemed of more value, in reckoning for the prize, than if it were to take\n place in any of those outside it, and so in proportion with the others. A\n celebrated society of Archery allows the following numbers for each cir-\n cle. For the gold, nine; for the red, seven ; for the inner white, five; for\n die black, three; and for the outer white, one. A writer on this subject,\n however, seems to think, that the outer circles are overrated, and if nine\n be allowed for the centre, only three should be scored for the red; two for\n the inner white; and less, in proportion for the two outer circles. When\n the sport terminates, the value of the number of hits, and not the hits them-\n selves, should be reckoned ; and he w hose score is the largest, is, of course,\n the victor.\n</p>\n<p>\n As mk is by no means a convenient thing to carry into the field, and marks\n made with the black-lead pencil are liable to be rubbed out, it is advisable\n to have a pin suspended from a card, properly divided for each archer\u2019s\n eeore, and to prick down the hits with it.\n</p>\n<p>\n STRINGING THE BOW.\n</p>\n<p>\n The bow is to be taken in the right hand, by the handle, with the flat\n part toward the person who is about to string it; his right arm should\n rest against his side; the lower end of the bow ' , which has always the shortest\n bone, should be placed against the inside of the right foot, which should be\n turned a little inward to prevent the bow from slipping ; the left foot should\n at the same time be brought forward ; the centre of the left hand wrist must\n be t) laced on the upper limb of the bow below the eve of the string, tiu\n E\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0060/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0060/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0060/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0060/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0060/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0060.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 486009}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"60\">\n<p>\n 4B\n</p>\n<p>\n ARCHERY\n</p>\n<p>\n forefinger knuckle upon one edge of the bow, and the top of the thumb cn\n the other.

No skill in\n aiming is requisite in flight-shooting ; it is, therefore, by no means improving\n to the young Archer, who wishes to excel as a marksman. The longest and\n lightest arrows that the bow will bear are used in flight-shooting; the game\n is generally seven.\n</p>\n<p>\n CLOUT-SHOOTING.\n</p>\n<p>\n Clout-shooting is mostly practised by those who cannot conveniently set up\n butts or targets near home. The clout, which is quite portable, is made of\n a round piece of pasteboard, thirty-six inches in circumference, fastened to a\n stick ; or it may be made of white cloth, so contrived as to roll up on a stick\n which is run through it. In clout-shooting, seven is the game, and all arrows\n tell that fall within three bows\u2019 length of the clout.\n</p>\n<p>\n ROVING\n</p>\n<p>\n This is a very pleasant pastime with the long bow ; and is, indeed, by\n some, preferred even to target-shooting. The parties are not restricted\n to any particular place, but rove about from field to field for miles around,\n if thev think fit. The mark is any clear and conspicuous object, such as a\n tree or a bush. The number of the game is, in general, as in flight and\n clout-shooting, seven; but it may be increased or decreased, according to\n the inclination of the parties. If there be more than six persons in a roving\n party, they should divide themselves into companies ; and when the first\n company have shot to, and walked some distance from, the first mark, the\n second should shoot at it : and so on with those that follow. Arrows that\n reach within five bows\u2019 length of the mark tell ; but those which reach\n nearest cut the others out. In measuring the distance, the Archer does\n so with his own bow, from a spot in the mark which is one foot from\n the ground ; and the first arrow is the one that is nearest, not to the mark,\n but to that point or spot of the mark. The Archer may measure to what\n part of his arrow he pleases. He who shoots nearest has the privilege of\n indicating the next mark. It is better to use blunt-headed arrows in\n Roving than sharp ones; as it not unfrequently happens that the latter are\n driven so firmly into the mark as to make it a matter of difficulty to ex-\n tract, them : should this occur, it is advisable to cut away the wood around\n the arrow, rather than endeavour to tug it out by violence.

When the grass\n is above the ankle, shoot only at a considerable elevation. After two or\n three arrows are shot, the Archer should cease awhile, otherwise his aim\n will get unsteady. If he shoot point-blank at a mark, the arrow, if it miss,\n will strike along, and so bury itself in the grass, as to defy the heenest eye,\n in many instances, for a very considerable time, to discover it. This in-\n convenience may be remedied by shooting at a proper elevation, for then\n the arrow will descend in such a manner as to leave the feathers visible;\n they will also be saved, from that injury which frequently occurs to them, by\n the moisture of the grass, or ground, when shot point-blank. Arrows\n should not be used of different lengths, nor should the young Archer shoot\n alone ; for in solitary shooting, he falls into habits of negligence and indif-\n ference ; if he practice with others, he will strive to emulate his companions;\n and, instead of a careless, unskilful marksman, soon become an adept in the\n pleasant pastime of Archery.\n</p>\n<p>\n \\\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0063/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0063/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0063/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0063/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0063/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0063.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 576379}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"63\">\n<p>\n The youthful Yeomanry are in the field, \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Their tents are pitched, and every heart beats high\n To join the friendly strife ; \u2014 their stoutest forts\n Are slender wickets ; \u2014 all their entrenchments,\n</p>\n<p>\n A popping and a bowling-crease ; their weapons,\n Eats ; \u2014 their ammunition, a brace of balls.\n</p>\n<p>\n This truly English pastime, although long a favorite with the people\n of this country, never reached to a greater degree of popularity than it\n possesses at this time.

The well-taught\n Gymnast would, in a case of necessity, take a leap which few could per-\n form, if any would venture. Leaps of great distances and heights he has\n often attempted with success. By him the length, the height, and the inter-\n rening obstacles could be measured in a moment. Rehearsals of such\n situations and circumstances have been his daily amusement. He cannot\n be dismayed at danger who has often played with it, and the principles of\n his art have supplied him with means to disarm it of half its power. To\n illustrate the foregoing remarks, we shall here relate what we consider an\n instance of the coolness, accuracy, and presence of mind to be acquired by\n daily practice. Walking out one day near the city of Edinburgh, our at-\n tention was attracted to a field where the Royal Company of Archers were\n practising. A man, hired for the purpose, and trained to the duty, was\n stationed at the target, with a small flag in his hand to mark the spot where\n the arrows ' fell, the distance being very considerable. It is incredible with\n what accurate perception this man followed the arrow in its rapid passage\n along the arch it made in the sky; and with what accuracy he seemed to\n conjecture how near the target, or on what side it would fall. He stood\n close to the target, almost touching it with his right arm; one arrow flew\n through the air ; he narrowly observed the feathered messenger advancing\n rapidly in its course \u2014 he stepped one step to the left, and the arrow stuck\n firmly in the ground a few inches to his right, betwixt him and the target.\n He waved his flag to the spot, and a second arrow was sent; from this he\n escaped by darting a little to the right. To save himself from the third, he\n had no occasion to move from his station, as he coolly saw it deposited in\n the lower part of the target. It is needless to detail the rest. The arrows\n stuck before, behind, and on each side of him. The exercise at last con-\n cluded; and it seemed no less surprising to us, the insensibility of danger\n which this man, for the sake of a little gain, exhibited, than the confidence\n which his employers doubtless had in the acuteness of his perception.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The same writer elsewhere observes that \u201c the ancients, particularly the\n free states of Greece, cultivated the study of Gymnastics as an important\n oranch of the education of youth. Having frequently to defend their lib-\n erties, either against the encroachments of kindred states, or the ambition\n of powerful foreign enemies, they considered it highly necessary to inure\n their youth to hardy and even violent exercise, that their minds might not\n be daunted in the hour of danger, nor their bodies sink under the necessary\n fiitiarues of warfare.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0071/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0071/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0071/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0071/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0071/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0071.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 399656}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"71\">\n<p>\n GYMNASTIC EXERCISES.\n</p>\n<p>\n The necessary fittings-up of a Gymnastic ground are as follows : \u2014 An\n horizontal bar, a vaulting-horse, a leaping-stand, parallel bars, a climbing-\n stand, and ladders of rope and wood.\n</p>\n<p>\n The best time for performing Gymnastics is early in the morning Boys\n should proceed gradually from the more easy to the more difficult exercises ;\n and it is most advisable to practise these sports under the eye of an expe-\n rienced person.

This is to be done without touching the chair with your\n hand.\n</p>\n<p>\n In doing this trick, the chair should not stand upon a slippery floor, as it\n may move from under you, and cause a fall ; a heavy chair should also be\n selected, and great care taken while performing it.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0080/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0080/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0080/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0080/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0080/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0080.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 465394}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"80\">\n<p>\n 68\n</p>\n<p>\n GYMNASTICS.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE TURN-OVER.\n</p>\n<p>\n In performing this feat, it is necessary to take a run of half-a-dozen\n paces The trick is to place the toe of the right foot against the wall,\n</p>\n<p>\n about the height of the knee from the\n ground, and to throw the left leg over\n it, making an entire revolution, so\n that when your left leg reaches the\n ground, your back will be to the wall.\n The toe of the right foot is the point\n upon which you must turn ; and it\n must not quit the wall during the\n performance of the exploit.

Even the example of other animals was sufficient to\n give the hint to man; by instinct many of them are led to apply cold water\n in this manner; and some, when deprived of its use, have been known to\n languish, and even to die.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c The cold bath recommends itself in a variety of cases, and is peculiarly\n beneficial to the inhabitants of populous cities, who indulge in idleness,\n and lead sedentary lives. It accelerates the motion of the blood, promotes\n the different secretions, and gives permanent vigor to the solids. But all\n these important purposes will be more essentially answered by the appli-\n cation of salt water. This ought not only to be preferred on account of\n its superior gravity, but likewise for its greater power of stimulating the\n skin, which promotes the perspiration, and prevents the patient from catch-\n ing cold.\n</p>\n<p>\n Cfc It is necessary, however, to observe, that cold bathing is more likely to\n prevent than to remove obstructions of the glandular or lymphatic system;\n indeed, when these have arrived at a certain height, they are not to be re-\n moved by any means. In this case, the cold bath will only aggravate the\n symptoms, and hurry the unhappy patient into an untimely grave ; it is,\n therefore, of the utmost importance, previously to the patient\u2019s entering upon\n the use of the cold bath, to determine whether or not he labors under any\n obstinate obstruction of the lungs or other viscera: and, where this is the\n case, cold bathing ought strictly to be prohibited.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0089/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0089/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0089/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0089/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0089/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0089.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 431080}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"89\">\n<p>\n SWIMMING.\n</p>\n<p>\n 77\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIn what is called a plethoric state, or too great fulness of the body, it\n is likewise dangerous to use the cold bath, without due preparation.

It must lie in the water so\n deep that you cannot reach to take it up but by diving for it. To encourage\n yourself, in order to do this, reflect that your progress will be from deep to\n shallow water, and that at any time you may, by bringing your legs under\n you, and standing on the bottom, raise your head far above the water; then\n plunge under it with your eyes open, which must be kept open before going\n under, as you cannot open the eyelids for the weight of water above you ;\n throwing yourself toward the egg, and endeavouring, by the action of your\n hands and feet against the water, to get forward, till within reach of it. In\n this attempt you will find that the water buoys you up against your inclina-\n tion ; that it is not so easy to sink as you imagine, and that you cannot, but\n by active force get down to the egg. Thus you feel the power of water to\n support you, and learn to confide in that power, while your endeavours to\n overcome it, and reach the egg, teach you the manner of acting bn the water\n with your feet and hands, which action is afterward used in swimming to\n support your head higher above the water, or to go forward through it.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c 1 would the more earnestly press you to the trial of this method, be-\n cause, though I think I shall satisfy you that your body is lighter than water,\n and that you might float in it a long time with your mouth free for breathing,\n if you would put yourself into a proper posture, and would be still, and for-\n bear struggling ;

for, as to\n the clothes, their additional weight when immersed is very inconsiderable,\n the water supporting it ; though, when lie comes out of the water, he would\n find them very heavy indeed.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c But, as I said before, I would not advise you, or any one, to depend on\n having this presence of mind on such an occasion, but learn fairly to swim,\n is I wish all men were taught to do in their youth ; they would, on many\n occasions, be the safer for having that skill ; and, on many more, the hap-\n pier, as free from painful apprehensions of danger, to say nothing of the en-\n joyment in so delightful and wholesome an exercise.

A copious draught of cold water,\n in similar circumstances, is frequently attended with the same effect, in\n North America.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c ' File exercise of swimming is one of the most healthy and agreeable in\n the world.

Per-\n haps the pores being cleansed, the insensible perspiration increases and\n occasions this coolness. It is certain that much swimming is the means of\n stopping a diarrhoea, and even of producing a constipation. With resjiect\n to those who do not know how to swim, or who are affected with a diarrlvea\n at a season which does not permit them to use that exercise, a warm bath, by\n cleansing and purifying the skin, is found very salutary, and often effects a\n radical cure. I speak from my own experience, frequently repeated, and\n that of others to whom I have recommended this.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c When I was a boy, I amused myself one day with flying a paper kite,\n and approaching the banks of a lake, which was near a mile broad, l tied\n die string to a stake, and the kite ascended to a very considerable height\n above the pond, while I was swimming. In a little time, being desirous of\n amusing myself with my kite, and enjoying at the same time the pleasure of\n swimming, I returned, and loosing from the stake the string with the little\n stick which was fastened to it, went again into the water, where I found that,\n lying on my back, and holding the stick in my hand, I was drawn along the\n surface of the water in a very agreeable manner. Having then engaged\n another boy to carry my clothes round the pond, to a place which I pointed\n out to him, on the other side, I began to cross the pond with my kite, which\n carried me quite over without the least fatigue, and with the greatest plea-\n sure imaginable. I was only obliged occasionally to halt a little in my\n course, and resist its progress, when it appeared that, by following too quick,\n l lowered the kite too much ; by doing which occasionally I made it rise\n again. I have never since that time practised this singular inode of swim-\n ming, though I think it not impossible to cross, in this manner, from Dover\n ' o Calais.

We have, it is true, known some\n trifling exceptions, but they have been rare indeed. Corks and bladders, we\n think, may be useful, but they should not be commenced with.

When bladders are used, they are blown full of\n air, tied at the necks, and fastened\n stead of corks.\n</p>\n<p>\n The manner of using corks or bladders is as follows : \u2014 the pupil places\n his breast across the rope between the corks or bladders as they float; he\n raises his legs from the ground, and rests his whole weight on the rope, so\n that the corks or bladders swim between his arms and his sides.

The fingers\n ( are to be closed, and the thumbs kept close to the hand, which should be\n straightened, or rather, a little hollowed in the palm; the hands are then\n to be brought together, the two thumbs touching, or palm to palm, it is\n little matter which, and raised just under the chin ; they are then to be struck\n vigorously forward, and when the arms are at their full stretch, parted, and\n carried slowly and regularly, a little below the surface of the water, at the\n full stretch of the arms, backward, as far as convenience will permit; they\n should then sink toward the hips ; by a slight pressure on the water, as they\n descend, the body will be raised, the head may be thrown back, and the\n breath drawn in for the next stroke. When the hands are at, or near, the\n hips, they should be raised, with the thumbs or edges, but by no means the\n backs, upward, to the first position; while doing this, the legs are to bo\n drawn up as near the body as possible, and the soles of the feet struck out\n against the water with reasonable force, at the same moment the hands are\n thrust forward again. Tliis is, in fact, the whole principle of swimming : \u2014\n the arms are first thrust forward, and the body propelled by the force of the\n soles of the feet, striking against the water; the air in the lungs is expired\n or breathed forth during this action; the hands are then stretched out and\n carried round so as to lift the body (which wants no support during the time\n it is propelled by the legs, and the lungs are nearly full of air,) while the\n legs are drawn up, and the lungs filled with air for a second effort. These\n very simple motions will seem difficult and complicated to the young swim-\n mer at first, but by degrees he will learn to perform them with facility.\n Above all tilings, let him endeavour to do them deliberately and without\n being Hurried.

We once knew a\n /cry promising youth who was nearly drowned, when in deep water, by the\n corks slipping from his breast to below his waist, so that his loins, and, at\n last, his legs, were above water, while his head was beneath; he was ex-\n tricated from this perilous situation by a youth of his own age, who had be-\n gun to learn the art of swimming, but without corks, on precisely tire same\n day as the lad who was thus in danger of being drowned. It would be well,\n if a string were tied by its middle to each end of the rope, close to the largest\n cork, and one end of it brought over the shoulder at the back, the other in\n front, and fastened securely together ; this would, at least, prevent the corks\n from getting out of their proper places.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE PLANK.\n</p>\n<p>\n The plank is useful in a bath, to perfect the young swimmer in the\n manner of properly throwing out his legs and feet. A piece of plank, about\n</p>\n<p>\n ten or twelve feet in\n length, two inches thick,\n and a foot and a half,\n or two feet broad, is\n the best size.

If he feel quite conscious of Ins\n own powers, lie may venture a few strokes out of his depth, across a stream,\n for instance, which is overhead only for a few feet in the centre, with shelv-\n ing banks on each side.

We earnestly cau-\n tion our pupil against giv-\n ing way to anything of this\n sort. Before he ventures\n out of his depth, let him calculate his own powers, and attempt such a dis-\n tance only as is in proportion with them. Is lie able to swim half-a-dozen\n yards without dropping his feet to the ground I If so, he may confidently\n cross a deep place which is only half that breadth. Let him not imagine\n that he is not quite as capable of swimming in deep as in shallow water;\n the contrary is the fact, for the deeper the water, the better he can swim.\n Above all things, let him not hurry himself, but strike slowly arid evenly,\n and keep good time with the motions of his arms, his legs, and his lungs.\n Boys frequently fall into an error, which is invariably attended with un-\n pleasant consequences, when first attempting to swim, as well as when they\n begin to vent ure out of depth, by losing their presence of mind, a id breath-\n ing at the wrong time. They draw breath at the moment when they are\n striking out with their legs, instead of at the time their body is elevated by\n the hands, when at the full stretch of the arm backward, or in descending\n toward the hips.

You may lay the arms across the breast ; keep them motionless\n at the sides; or, if you wish, strike out with them to help you on.\n</p>\n<p>\n To swim with your feet forward, while on your back, lift up your legs one\n after another, let them fall into the water, and draw them back with all the\n force you can, toward your hams; thus you will swim feet forward, and re-\n \\urn 10 the place whence you came.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0102/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0102/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0102/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0102/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0102/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0102.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 420006}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"102\">\n<p>\n 90\n</p>\n<p>\n SWIMMING.\n</p>\n<p>\n To turn from your breast to your hack, raise your legs forward, and throw\n your head backward, until your body is in a right position : to change from\n the back to the breast, drop your legs, and throw your body forward on\n vour breast.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO TURN WHEN SWIMMING.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n If you wish to turn while on your back, keep one leg still, and embrace\n the water beside you with the other ; thus, you will find yourself turn to\n that side on which your leg by its motion embraces the water, and you will\n turn either to the right or left, according to which leg you use in this manner.\n</p>\n<p>\n To turn while swimming in the ordinary way requires no further effort\n than to incline your head and body to the side you would turn to ; and, at\n the same time, move and turn your legs, in the same manner as you would\n do, to turn the same way on land.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO SHOW THE FEET.\n</p>\n<p>\n While on your back, bend the small of it downward; support yourself\n by moving your hands to and fro just above your breast, and stretch your\n feet above the water.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO BEAT THE WATER, & C.\n</p>\n<p>\n When swimming on your back, lift your legs out of the water one\n after another, and strike the water with them alternately.

The best time for swimming is in the months of May, June, July,\n and August. There are, however, some years, wherein it is not healthy to\n go into the water during these months; as when the weather, and conse-\n quently the water, is colder than ordinary for the season. One ought not to\n go into the water when it rains ; for the rain, if it last any time, chills the\n water, and endangers catching cold, by wetting one\u2019s clothes. The night\n is also improper for this exercise. Beware of weeds, as although you have\n company with you, yet, you may be lost beyond the possibility of help, if\n your feet got entangled among them. The bottom ought to be of gravel, or\n smooth stones, so that you may stand thereon as firmly as on the earth, and\n be neither in danger of sinking in the mud, nor wounding the feet : care\n ought also to be taken that it be even, and without holes; and, above all,\n that you know the depth, especially when you begin to learn; for as it is\n then easy to tire one\u2019s self when struggling and making the first efforts, you\n should, therefore, be sure that the bottom is not out of your depth, when you\n have occasion to rest, and take breath. It is impossible to be too cautious\n when you are alone, or have no one in company that knows the pond or\n stream. When you have found out a place fit to learn in, do not venture any-\n where else till you are considerably advanced in the art; and, till then,\n it will be the best way to exercise with some one who is already expert in\n swimming.\n</p>\n<p>\n CONCLUDING REMARKS.\n</p>\n<p>\n In entering the water, the head should be wetted first, either by plunging\n in head foremost, or pouring water on it. Before you adopt the first method,\n ascertain if the water be sufficiently deep to allow you to dive without\n touching the bottom,- otherwise you may injure yourself against it. Do not\n remain in the water too long, but come out as soon as you feel tired, chilly\n or numbed. It is a good plan to make a plunge, so as to wet the body all\n over, to return to shore immediately, and an instant afterward enter the\n water at your ease, and take your lesson or your swim. You do not feel so\n chilly if you do this, as if you dash in and swim off at once. Never be alarm-\n ed at having a few mouthfuls of water, when learning to swim ; be not dis-\n couraged at difficulties, but bear in mind, that millions have done what you\n are attempting to do. Beware of banks which have holes in them, and ven-\n ture out of your depth only by degrees.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":

But the dexterity of those people cannot for a moment be com-\n pared with the feats of mental arithmetic exhibited by George Bidder,\n the youth, whose portrait stands at the head of this article. This astonish-\n ing boy, at a very early age, and without education, was capable of solving\n very intricate questions in arithmetic, without the use of pen, pencil, or\n writing implements of any sort, but entirely in his own mind, as correctly\n and quickly as the most expert person could in the common way. We\n have, personally, witnessed his ability in this respect, and among many other\n complicated questions, which were put to him, we recollect the following : \u2014\n Supposing the sun to be 95 millions of miles from the earth, and that it were\n possible for an insect, whose pace should be inches per minute, to travel\n that pace how long would it take to reach the sun 1 This he mentally solved\n in a very short time.\n</p>\n<p>\n Several other mental arithmeticians have appeared within these few\n years; among the rest, Jedidiah Buxton, an illiterate peasant, who\n was never taught to read or write, appears to have been eminent. Several\n of the questions answered by this man have been recorded ; among others,\n we recollect the following : \u2014 How many times will a coach-wheel, whose\n circumference is 6 yards, turn in going 204 miles 1 In thirteen minutes,\n Buxton answered, \u2014 59,840 times. Then he was asked : \u2014 Anti, supposing\n sound travels at the rate of 1142 feet per second, how long will it be before\n the report of a cannon is heard 5 miles off 1 His answer was, \u2014 23 seconds,\n 7 thirds, and 46 remain. On being required to multiply 456 by 378, he gave\n the product in a very short time ; and, when requested to work the question\n audibly, so that his method might be known, he multiplied 456 first by 5,\n which produced 2280 ; this he again multiplied by 20, and found the product\n 45,600, which was the multiplicand multiplied by 100 ; this product he again\n multipled by 3, which produced 136,800, the product of the multiplicand\n by 300 ; it remained, therefore, to multiply this by 78, which he effected\n by multiplying 2280, (or the product of the multiplicand multiplied by 5,)\n by 15, as 5 times 15 are 75. This product, being 34,200, he. added to\n 136,800, which was the multiplicand multiplied by 300, and this produced\n 171,000 which was 375 times 456. To complete his operation, therefore, he\n multiplied 456 by 3, which produced 1368, and having added this number to\n 171,000, he found the product of 456 multiplied by 378, to be 172,368. By\n this it appears, that he was so little acquainted with the common rules, as to\n multiply 456 first by 5, and the product by 20, to find what sum it would\n produce, multiplied by 100 ; whereas, had he added two ciphers to th\u00ab\n figures, he would have obtained the product at once.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0111/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0111/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0111/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0111/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0111/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0111.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 473284}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"111\">\n<p>\n ARITHMETICAL AMUSEMENTS\n</p>\n<p>\n 97\n</p>\n<p>\n TO TELL ANY NUMBER THOUGHT * > *\n</p>\n<p>\n Desire any person to think of a number, say a cert* number ol\n shillings ; tell him to borrow that sum of some one in the company, and\n add die number borrowed to the amount thought of.

If this trick be per-\n formed several times successively, the number given in the third part of\n the ojieration must be always different; for if the result were several timed\n the same, the deception might be discovered. When the five first parts of\n the calculation for obtaining a result are finished, it will be best not to name\n it at first, but to continue the operation, to render it more complex, by say-\n ing, for example : \u2014 \u2018 Double the remainder, deduct two, add three, take the\n fourth part,\u2019 & c.; and the differ ent steps of die calculation may be kept hi\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0112/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0112/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0112/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0112/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0112/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0112.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 523494}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"112\">\n<p>\n ARITHMETICAL AMUSEMENTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n mind, in order to know how much the first result lias been increased 01\n diminished.

By following\n this method, he will infallibly attain to 89; and it will then be impossible\n for the second to prevent him from getting first to 100 ; for whatever number\n the second takes, he can attain only to 99 ; after which the first may say \u2014\n \u201c and 1 makes 100.\u201d If the second take 1 after 89, it would make 90, and\n his adversary would finish by saying \u2014 \u201c and 10 make 100.\u201d Between two\n persons who are equally acquainted with the game, he who begins must\n necessarily win.\n</p>\n<p>\n MAGICAL CENTURY.\n</p>\n<p>\n If the number 11 be multiplied by any one of the nine digits, the two\n figures of the product will always be alike, as appears in the following\n example : \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11 11\n</p>\n<p>\n 12 3 456789\n</p>\n<p>\n 11 22 33 44 55 66 77 88 99\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, if another person and yourself have fifty counters apiece, and\n agree never to stake more than ten at a time, you may tell him, that if he\n permit you to stake first, you will always complete the even century\n before him.\n</p>\n<p>\n In order to succeed, you must first stake 1, and remembering the order of\n the above series, constantly add to what he stakes as many as will make one\n nore than the numbers li, 22, 33, & c. of which it is composed, till you\n come to 89; after which your opponent cannot possibly reach the even\n century himself, or prevent you from reaching it.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0119/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0119/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0119/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0119/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0119/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0119.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 430299}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"119\">\n<p>\n ARITHMETICAL AMUSEMENTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 105\n</p>\n<p>\n If your opponent have no knowledge of numbers, you may stake any\n Other number first, under 10, provided you subsequently take care to secure\n one of the last terms, 56, 67, 78, & e. ; or you may even let him stake first, if\n you take care afterward to secure one of these numbers.\n</p>\n<p>\n This exercise may be performed with other numbers ; but, in order to\n succeed, you must divide the number to be attained, by a number which\n is a unit greater than what you can stake each time ; and the remainder\n will then be the number you must first stake.

The common\n figure will here serve.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is remarkable in this representation, that the motion of the smoke\n does not .at all change the figures; which appear so conspicuous that the\n spectator thinks he can grasp them with his hand. In the experiment,\n some of the rays passing through the smoke, the representation will be\n much less vivid than on the cloth ; and if care be not taken to reduce the\n light to its smallest focus, it will be still more imperfect.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE PHANTASMAGORIA.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the exhibition of the common magic lantern, the spectators see a\n round circle of light with the figures in the middle of it ; but, in the Phantas-\n magoria, they see the figures only, without any circle of light. The exhi-\n bition is produced by a mugic lantern, placed on that side of a half-trans-\n parent screen which is opposite to that on which the spectators are, instead\n of being on the same side, as in the ordinary exhibition of the magic\n lantern. To favor the deception, the sliders are made perfectly opaque,\n except in those places that contain the figures to be exhibited, and in these\n light parts the glass is covered with a more or less transparent tint, accord-\n ing to the effect required. The easiest way is to draw the figures with\n water colors on thin paper, and afterward varnish them. To Imitate the\n natural motions of the objects represented, several pieces of glass, placed\n behind each other, are occasionally employed. By removing the lantern\n to different distances, and, at the same time, altering, more or less, the\n position of the lens, the images are made to increase and diminish, and to\n become more or less distinct at the pleasure of the exhibitor; so that, to\n a person unacquainted with the effect of optical instruments, these figures\n appear actually to advance and recede.\n</p>\n<p>\n To make transparent screens for the Phantasmagoria. Transparent\n screens are prepared by spreading white wax, dissolved in spirits of wine\n or oil of turpentine, over thin muslin : a screen so prepared may be rolled\n up without injury. A clearer screen may be produced, by having the\n muslin always strained upon a rectangular frame, and preparing it with\n turpentine, instead of wax : but such a screen is not always convenient,\n and cannot be rolled without cracking, and becoming, in a short timo\n useless; therefore, nothing can lie better for the purpose than the former.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0135/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0135/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0135/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0135/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0135/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0135.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 416384}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"135\">\n<p>\n OPTICAL AMUSEMENTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 121\n</p>\n<p>\n SOLAR MICROSCOPE.\n</p>\n<p>\n # The solar microscope is constructed in the following manner.

When\n a person looks into one of these supposed mirrors, instead of seeing his own\n face he will perceive the object that is i the front of the other; so that, if\n two persons present themselves at the same time before these mirrors, instead\n of each one seeing himself they will reciprocally see each other.

We fill a flask half full of water, and boil it for a few\n minutes over a lamp, the steam which rises forces out the atmospheric air,\n and occupies its place ; we then remove the lamp, and secure the flask so\n as to prevent the readmission of atmospheric air. If cold water be now\n poured over that part of the flask occupied by the steam, the cold will con-\n dense the steam, which will trickle down the sides of the flask, and mix with\n the liquor below ; the steam being thus condensed, a vacuum is formed\n above the surface.

In\n the Encyclopedia Britannica, it is asserted that Edinboro\u2019 has produced\n more instances of elegant skaters than perhaps any other country\n whatever ; and the institution of a Skating Club there has contributed\n not a little to the improvement of this amusement. Strut, in noticing\n this, observes, that when the Serpentine river in Hyde park was frozen\n over, he saw four gentlemen there dance, if the expression may be al-\n lowed, a double minuet, in skates, with as much ease, and perhaps\n more elegance, than in a ball-room ; others again, by turning and win-\n ding with much adroitness, have readily in succession described upon\n the ice all the letters of the alphabet.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE SKATE.\n</p>\n<p>\n Skates are of various forms, and differ in their make, according to\n the several countries in which they are used. In England, where they\n are intended for amusement only, a much lighter description is made\n than in Holland or Russia, where, in the winter, they form one of the\n principal modes of travelling, even for great distances. The shape of\n the Iron gives the peculiar feature to the skate. In the northern coun-\n tries it is made to project six or eight inches beyond the wood, and\n curl upwards at the extremity, to nearly the height of the knee. In\n Lapland the iron projects nearly two feet. The reason for this is very\n clear, it enables trie skater to glide easily over the hillocks of ice or\n snow, which invariably collect on the rivers in those climates ; were\n the irons not made so, the inhabitants could not travel on the ice with\n safety to themselves, or to the various articles which they sometimes\n carry: it being a common occurrence for women to skate to market,\n carrying on their heads a basket full of eggs.\n</p>\n<p>\n Skates are made fluted or plain. For young beginners the former\n are preferable, as regards safety ; but with the Tatter only can velocity\n and elegance of movement be acquired.

We think\n that it would be by no means rash in us to pledge ourselves, that there is no\n superior treatise on Legerdemain to be obtained ; it is true, that there are a\n lew more bulky ones, but they contain so much useless matter, and accounts\n of tricks which it is impossible to perforin at all, or, at any rate, by\n the rude, ant iquated instructions which tney afford, that one half of them is\n useless. The following pages will, we trust, be found to contain everything\n that is valuable in this art, unencumbered with dross. We have brought a\n tolerable share of knowledge on this matter, to the preparation of \u201cFeats of\n Legerdemain j\u201d we have also gleaned the cream of several old and scarce\n works, and translated many choice recreations from foreign publications on\n this subject. Several friendly contributions have been afforded to us ; and\n what is of the greatest value, we have been favored with the assistance of\n some eminent and highly popular professors of the art; so that, we are en-\n abled to present to our young readers a collection of conjuring tricks, which is\n at once copious and select. Our object has been, not only to facilitate the\n acquisition of such a variety of amusing feats, as will render him, who is\n enabled to exhibit them, a parlor magician, but also to instruct our young\n readers in the mode of performing several master-pieces of Legerdemain,\n which require considerable agility, and expensive apparatus, so that they\n may understand the means of effecting the apparent wonders displayed by\n the public professors of the arc. In addition to the Feats of Legerdemain,\n we have devoted several of our pages to descriptions of various Automata\n and Androides, which have been exhibited to the public. The Marion-\n nettes, or figures, whose motions are governed by strings, are too simple for\n a lengthened notice : it is true, that, among the ancients, they were deemed\n of importance sufficient to be exhibited in their public shows, \u2014 but they are\n now mere toys, of which every lad knows the construction; for there are\n few who have not at one time or other possessed, played with, and dissected\n a pasteboard harlequin, or a bleeding nun. An improvement has lately\n been made on these juvenile Marionettes, which, while we are on this\n subject, is perhaps deserving of notice. The limbs, body, and head of a\n comic figure, are drawn and colored on a piece of paper, cut out, and\n gummed separately to a piece of card of similar dimensions ; they are then\n united by bits of thread, which, acting as hinges, suffer them to play loosely,\n and in various directions, when the body is moved. A piece of dark twine\n is fastened, by its middle, to the back of the body; the ends are tied, by a\n boy, just below his two knees; he sits, on a low stool, in a dark place, with\n a lig at on the ground, a little in front of him \u2014 the spectators standing at\n some distance from the light. By moving his knees quickly to and from\n each other, a variety of grotesque motions is given to the Marionnette, which\n dunces, apparently, without assistance. *\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0166/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0166/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0166/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0166/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0166/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0166.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 446414}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"166\">\n<p>\n 152\n</p>\n<p>\n LEGERDEMAIN.\n</p>\n<p>\n We doubt not but that this part of the work will be a favorite amuse\n merit with our readers, and that it will afford much innocent amusement\n during the long evenings of winter, around the comfortable parlor fire,\n to many a little social circle.

The blade of No. 1 (as you\n may perceive by inspecting the engrav-\n ing) goes over that of No. 2, and the\n blade of No. 2 passes across that of No*\n 3, which rests on that of No ' . 1. The\n knives being placed in this position, their blades will support each other.\n</p>\n<p>\n EATABLE CANDLE-ENDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Peel some large apples that are rather of a yellow tint ; cut several\n pieces out of them in the shape of a candle-end, round, of course, at the\n bottom, and square at the top ; in fact, as much as possible, like a candle\n that has burnt down within an inch or so. Then, cut some slips out of\n the insides of sweet almonds, fashion them as much in the shape of sperma-\n ceti wicks as you can, stick them into your mock candles, light them for ar\n instant, so as to make their tops black, blow them out again, and they are\n ready for use. When you. produce them, light them, (the almond will\n readily take fire, and flame for a few moments,) put them into your mouth,\n chew and swallow them one after another. This may well be called the\n iiifffiler\u2019s dessert.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0168/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0168/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0168/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0168/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0168/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0168.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 433922}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"168\">\n<p>\n LEGERDEMAIN.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE LITTLE FLOATING BEACON.\n</p>\n<p>\n Fasten a piece oflead to the end of a candle which has been half burnt |\n place it very gently in the water, so that it may find its proper equilibrium ;\n then light it, and it will burn to the end without sinking.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE RINGS AND RIBBONS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Take two pieces of ribbon, precisely alike in length, breadth, and color;\n double each of them, separately, so that their ends meet ; then tie them to-\n gether very neatly, with a bit of silk of their own color, by the middle, or\n crease made in doubling them.

This apparent piece of manual dex-\n terity is performed by passing that end of the string marked a, as quickly as\n possible round the top of the thumb, so as to come between the fore-finger\n ind thumb : it will thus get into the loop, and you will seem to have passed\n</p>\n<p>\n the end through it\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0169/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0169/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0169/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0169/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0169/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0169.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 393911}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"169\">\n<p>\n LEGERDEMAIN.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 55\n</p>\n<p>\n WINE U\u00bbON WATER.\n</p>\n<p>\n Half fil a glass with water, throw a bit of the crumb of a loaf into it,\n about the me of a nut, pour some wine lightly on the bread, and you will\n see the water at the bottom of the glass, and the wine floating at the top\n of it.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE CONJUROR\u2019S JOKE.\n</p>\n<p>\n Take a ball n each hand, and stretch your hands as far as you can, one\n from the other; then state that you will contrive to make both the balls\n come into either hand, without bringing the hands near each other.

It is most\n frequently performed by a female, but the effect of it is considerably increas-\n ed when it is displayed by a boy. A piece of calico, muslin, or linen, is\n taken in the left hand, a needle is threaded in the presence of the spectators,\n and the usual, or even a double or treble knot made at the extremity of one\n of the ends of it. The operator commences his work by drawing the needle\n and the thread in it quite through the linen, notwithstanding the knot, and\n continues to make several stitches in like manner successively.\n</p>\n<p>\n The mode of performing this seeming wonder, is as follows : a bit of\n thread, about a quarter of a yard long, is turned once round the top of the\n middle finger of the right hand, upon which a thimble is then placed to keep\n it secure. This must be done privately and the thread kept concealed,\n while a needle is threaded with a bit of thread of a similar length. The\n thread in the needle must have one of its ends drawn up nearly close, and be\n concealed between the fore-finder and thumb ; the other should hang down\n nearly as long as, and by the side of the thread, which is fastened under the\n thimble, so that these two may appear to be the two ends of the thread\n The end of* the piece that is fastened under the thimble is then knotted, and\n tlie performer begins to sew, by moving his hand quickly after he has ta-\n ken up the stitch. It will appear as though he actually passed the knotted\n ' bread through the cloth.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0174/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0174/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0174/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0174/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0174/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0174.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 440995}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"174\">\n<p>\n LEGERDEMAIN.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE BOTTLE IMPS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Get three little hollow figures of glass, an inch and a half high, representing\n</p>\n<p>\n imps, or Harlequin, Co-\n lumbine, and Pantaloon,\n which may be obtained at\n the glass-blowers, with a\n small hole in each of their\n legs.

After a mo-\n mentary pause, turn the knife again two or three times, and three wafers\n will appear on each side.\n</p>\n<p>\n The secret of this capital trick consists in using wafers of the same size\n and color, and turning the knife, so that the same side is constantly pre-\n sented to the view, and the wafers are taken off that side, one by one. The\n three wafers will thus remain untouched on the other side, so that when you\n have first made it appear that there are no wafers on either side, you may,\n apparently, show three on each, by the same means. The way to turn the\n knife is as follows ; when you lift it up, turn it in your hand, with your finger\n and thumb, completely round, until the side that was uppermost when vou\n lifted it, comes uppermost again. This is done in an instant, and is not\n perceptible, if adroitly managed.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE COUNTER CHANGED.\n</p>\n<p>\n Take two papers, three inches square each, divided into two folds, of\n three equal parts on each side, so as each folded paper remain one inch\n square ; then glue the back part of the two together, as they are folded, and\n not as they are opened, so that both papers seem to be but one, and which\n side soever you open, it may appear to be the same ; if you have a sixpence\n in one hand, and a counter in the other, show one, and you may, by turn-\n ing the paper, seem to change it.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE CUT LACE JOINED.\n</p>\n<p>\n Conceal a piece of lace in your hand; then produce another piece of tin.\n same pattern; double the latter, and put the fold between your fore-finger\n and thumb, with the piece which you have previously concealed, doubled in\n the same manner; pull out a little of the latter, so as to make a loop, and\n desire one of the company to cut it asunder. If you have conveyed the con-\n cealed piece of lace so dexterously as to be undetected, with the oilier be-\n tween your thumb and fore-finger, the S|)ectators will, naturally enough,\n think you have really cut the latter; which you may seem to make whole\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0178/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0178/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0178/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0178/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0178/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0178.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 424242}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"178\">\n<p>\n 164\n</p>\n<p>\n LEGERDEMAIN\n</p>\n<p>\n again, while repeating some conjuring words, and putting away the two\n ends of the piece that is actually cut.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE WIZARD\u2019S CHARIOT.\n</p>\n<p>\n This trick will call your mechanical abilities into play. First, get a pieco\n of board, planed quite smooth ; fasten a cross-piece under it, to support it in\n</p>\n<p>\n the position indicated by\n the cut. At the uppet\n edge of the slanted piece,\n fix two little pulleys, the\n use of which may, at a\n glance, be seen by the\n engraving. Next, con-\n struct two little coaches,\n carts, or classical trium-\n phal chariots ; let the\n wheels of one of them be\n considerably larger than\n those of the other ; they\n must, however, be pre-\n cisely the same weight,\n or, if not, you must load\n one with sho t to make it\n equal, in this respect, to\n the other. Do yoUr\n</p>\n<p>\n work so neatly, that the wheels of each may run equally well on their respec-\n tive axles. Next provide two lumps of lead, which must tally with each other\n to a scruple, and be sufficiently heavy to pull the chariots up the plane. Fix\n a piece of thread to the front of each of the chariots; pass these threads\n through the pulleys, and fasten one of your weights to each of them. The\n threads, be it remarked, should be long enough only to reach from the\n chariots, when placed at the foot of the inclined board, through the pulleys to\n the leads; and the board should be so inclined, that the distance from the\n pulleys to the ground be precisely the same as that of the chariots to the pul-\n leys. Your apparatus being thus ready, weigh the chariots together, and\n afterwards the leads in the presence of the spectators, that they may he\n satisfied they are equal, and let them inspect your apparatus, to see that all\n is fair : then start your chariots, and, notwithstanding the equality of their\n weights, and the equality of those of the leads, one of them will considerably\n outstrip the other; the chariot with the highest wheels will always be the\n winner of the race. This mechanical truth is unknown to many, and may\n if properly managed, produce much surprise.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0179/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0179/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0179/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0179/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0179/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0179.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 435964}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"179\">\n<p>\n LEGERDEMAIN.\n</p>\n<p>\n 165\n</p>\n<p>\n THE SIMPLE DECEPTION.\n</p>\n<p>\n Stick a little wax upon your thumb, take a by-stander by the fingers, show\n n. n a sixpence, and tell him you will put the same into his hand ; then wring\n iv down hard with your waxed thumb, and, using many words, look him in\n the face; suddenly take away your thumb, and the coin will adhere to it;\n then close nis hand if will seem to him that the sixpence remains; now tell\n him to open his hand, and, if you perform the feat cleverly, to his great\n astonishment, he will find nothing in it.\n</p>\n<p>\n PHILOSOPHY CHEATED.\n</p>\n<p>\n This feat is really an excellent one, and has astonished crowds of specta-\n tors in London, and different parts of the United Kingdom.

If you do this with velocity, although the tumbler, in\n the circles made by the hoop, is frequently quite bottom upward, it will\n neither fall from die hoop, nor will any of the water be spilt. To do this,\n however, requires even more practice than the trick which it prefaces ; as,\n although there is no difficulty in it while the hoop is in rapid motion,\n yet there is some danger until you are rendered expert by practice,\n of the tumbler\u2019s falling, when you begin to put the hoop in motion, and\n when you wish to slop it.

A cylindrical oven, constructed in the\n shape of a dome, had been heated, for four hours, by a very powerful fire.\n At ten minutes past eight, the Spaniard, having on large pantaloons of red\n flannel, a thick cloak, also of flannel, and a large felt, after the fashion of a\n straw hat, went into the oven, where he remained, seated on a foot-stool,\n during fourteen minutes, exposed to a heat of from forty-five to fifty degrees\n of a metallic thermometer, the gradation of which did not go higher than\n fifty. He sang a Spanish song while a fowl was roasted by his side. At\n his coming out of the oven, the physicians found that his pulse beat one hun-\n dred and thirty-four pulsations a minute, though it was but seventy-two at\n his going in.

A noxious and suffocating vapor of\n tallow filled the inside of the oven, and all the candles were extinguished\n and mehed. The Spaniard, whose pulse was two hundred at coming out\n of this gulf of heat, immediately threw himself into a cold bath, and, in two\n or ,hree minutes after, was on his feet, safe and sound.\n</p>\n<p>\n About the year 1809, one Lionetto, also a Spaniard, astonished not only\n the ignorant, but chemists and other men of science, in France, Germany,\n Italy, and England, by his insensibility to the power of fire. He handled,\n with impunity, red hot iron and molten lead, drank boiling oil, and per-\n formed other feats equally miraculous. While he was at Naples, he at-\n tracted the notice of Professor Sementeni, who narrowly watched all his\n operations, and endeavoured to discover his secret. He observed, in the\n first place, that when Lionetto applied a piece of red hot iron to his hair,\n dense fumes immediately rose from it; that when he touched his foot with\n the iron, similar vapors ascended, which affected both the organs of sight\n and smell. He also saw him place a rod of iron, nearly red hot, between\n his teeth, without burning himself ; drink the third of a table-spoonful of\n boiling oil ; and taking up molten lead with his fingers, place it on his\n tongue without apparent inconvenience.\n</p>\n<p>\n Anxious to discover the means used by Lionetto to render himself capable\n of thus enduring the application of heat, Sementeni performed several exper-\n iments upon himself, and made many important discoveries. He found, that\n by friction with sulphuric acid diluted with water, the skin might be made\n insensible to the action of the heat of red-hot iron : a solution of alum,\n evaporated until it became spongy, appeared to be more effectual in these\n frictions. After having rubbed the parts, which were thus rendered, in some\n degree, incombustible, with hard soap, he discovered, on the application of\n hot iron, that their insensibility was increased. He then determined on\n again rubbing the parts with soap, and after this, found that the hot iron\n not only occasioned no pain, but that it actually did not burn the hair.\n Being thus far satisfied, the Professor applied hard soap to his tongue, until\n it became insensible to the heat of the iron ; and after having placed an\n ointment, composed of soap mixed with a solution of alum, upon it, boiling\n oil did not burn it : while the oil remained on the tongue a slight hissing\n was heard, similar to that of hot iron when thrust into water; the oil soon\n cooled, and might then be swallowed without danger.\n</p>\n<p>\n These are stated to be the results of the experiments performed by Pro-\n fessor Sementeni, and they tend to explain the astonishing performances of\n Lionetto. It is evident that he prepared his tongue and his skin in a similar\n manner, previously to his exhibitions. With regard to his passing the hot\n plate of iron over his hair, it seems pretty evident that the latter was first\n saturated with a solution similar to that of the alum or sulphuric acid. 1 1 is\n swallowing the boiling oil ceases to become a phenomenon, when it is ob\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0190/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0190/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0190/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0190/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0190/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0190.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 544397}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"190\">\n<p>\n LEGERDEMAIN.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n served that, in order to show its high temperature, he threw pieces of lead\n into it, which, in the process of melting, absorbed a quantity of the caloric,\n or heat, of the oil ; and that the small quantity of the latter which he poured\n upon his tongue, already prepared to receive it in the manner we have\n stated, cooled before he swallowed it.

In 1642, an old woman presented the Prince of Cond#\n with some meat, bought by her the preceding day in the market of \" Mont-\n pelier, and which illuminated her room during the night. We have seen a\n sole emit most brilliant and beautiful flashes of light on a dark night.\n</p>\n<p>\n A great number of experiments have been performed by scientific men, to\n ascertain the cause of the luminous aspect of the sea ; it is attributed to those\n putrid substances, which are found in the waters. The following experi-\n ment, which has reference to this subject, is rather curious : \u2014 A little fresh\n whiting was placed in a vase containing water. It produced no light, even\n after having been agitated; that part of the fish only that was above the\n water, and not the water itself, grew luminous during the night. On lifting\n up the fish, by means of a stick, which was passed beneath it, and rested\n against the opposite side of the vase, the water appeared luminous behind\n it; on being much agitated, it became entirely luminous, and continued so\n for some time after it was left undisturbed. The strongest emission of light\n takes place after the fish has been about twenty hours in the water ; after\n three days, the water loses this property. About four drachms of the sub-\n stance of a fresh herring were put into a solution of two drachms of sulphate\n of magnesia, in two ounces of water. On the succeeding evening, the whole\n of the liquor, upon shaking the phial, became beautifully luminous, and it\n continued luminous till the fourth day.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is a fish mentioned by Pliny, the naturalist, which renders such ob-\n jects luminous as are touched by it. It differs from its fellow tenants of the\n waters, which become phosphorescent only when in a state of putrefaction ;\n whereas, the fresher the pholas is, the more luminous does it appear. Bran-\n dy extinguishes its light; when it becomes dry, a little pure or salt water\n will revivify its lustre.

The chest was placed upon four castors, which,\n together with the figure, might be moved to any part of the room.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the plain surface foi ' med by the top of the chest, in the centre, was\n raised an immovable chess-board, of handsome dimensions, upon which the\n figure had its eyes fixed, its right arm and hand being extended on the chest,\n and its left arm somewhat raised, as if in the attitude of holding a Turkish\n pipe, which was originally placed in its right hand.\n</p>\n<p>\n The exhibitor proceeded by wheeling the chest to the entrance of the\n apartment within which it stood, in front of the spectators.

This slight incongruity\n proceeded from inadvertence of the inventor, who did not discover his mis-\n take until the machinery was too far completed to remedy the defect. At\n the commencement of a game, the automaton made a motion of the head, as\n if taking a view of the board ; the same motion occurred at the close of the\n game. In making a move it slowly raised its left arm from the cushion\n placed under it, and directed it toward the square of the piece to be moved,\n file arm then returned to its position on the cushion. Its hand and fingers\n opened on touching the piece, which it took up and conveyed to any pro-\n posed square. The motions were, performed with perfect correctness, and\n the anxiety with which the arm acted, especially in the delicate operation\n of castling, seemed to be the result of spontaneous feeling; bending at the\n shoulder, elbow, and knuckles, and cautiously avoiding to touch any other\n piece than that which had been moved.\n</p>\n<p>\n On giving check to the king, it moved its head as a signal.

The air entered the body by three separate\n pipes, into which it was conveyed by nine pairs of bellows, which expanded\n and contracted in regular succession, by means of a steel axis turned by\n clock-work. These bellows performed their functions without any noise,\n which might have discovered the means of conveying the air into the ma-\n chine. The three tubes that received the air from the bellows passed into\n three small reservoirs in the trunk of the figure, where they united, and\n ascending towards the throat, formed the cavity of the mouth, which ter-\n minated in two small lips. Within this cavity was a small movable tongue,\n which, by its motion, at proper intervals, admitted the air or intercepted it\n in its passage to the flute. The fingers, lips, and tongue, derived their\n appropriate movements from a steel cylinder, also turned by clock-work.\n It was divided into fifteen equal parts, which, by means of pegs pressing\n upon the ends of fifteen different levers, caused the other extremities to\n ascend. Seven of these levers directed the fingers, having wires and chains\n fixed to their ascending extremities, which being attached to the fingers,\n caused them to ascend in proportion as the other extremity was pressed down\n \\y the motion of the cylinder, and vice versa ; thus the ascent or descent of\n one end of a lever produced a similar ascent or descent in the corresponding\n fingers, by which one of the holes of the flute was occasionally opened or\n stopped, as it might have been by a living performer. Tln*ee of the levers\n served to regulate the ingress of the air, being so contrived as to open and\n shut the three reservoirs above mentioned, by means of valves, so that more\n or less strength might be given, and a higher or lower note produced. The\n lips were directed by four levers, one of which opened them to give the air a\n freer passage ; the other contracted them ; the third drew them backward ;\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0205/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0205/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0205/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0205/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0205/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0205.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 511853}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"205\">\n<p>\n LEGERDEMAIN.\n</p>\n<p>\n 191\n</p>\n<p>\n an ! the fourth pushed them forward : the lips were projected upon that part\n of the flute which received the air, and by the different motions already\n menti > ned, properly modified the tune. The remaining lever was employed\n in the direction of the tongue, which it easily moved, so as to open or shut\n the mouth of the flute The just succession of the several motions performed\n by the various parts of the machine, was regulated by the following simple\n contrivance : \u2014 the extremity of the axis of the cylinder terminated, on the\n right side, by an endless screw, consisting of twelve threads, each placed at\n the distance of an eighth of an inch from the other. Above the screw was\n fixed a piece of copper, and in it a steel pivot, which foiling in between the\n threads of the screw, obliged the cylinder to follow those threads ; and thus,\n instead of turning directly round, it was continually pushed on one side.\n Hence, if a lever were moved by a peg placed on the cylinder, in any one\n revolution, it could not be moved by the same peg in the succeeding revolu-\n tion because the peg would be an eighth of an inch beyond it, by the lateral\n motion of the cylinder. Thus, by an artificial disposition of these pegs in\n different parts of the cylinder, the statue was made, by the successive\n elevation of the proper levers, to exhibit all the different motions of a\n flute-player.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE INVISIBLE GIRL.\n</p>\n<p>\n The operators have a communication, from the exhibition room to\n another where the confederate is concealed, by tin pipes, which end in a\n clear horn trumpet, inserted in an isolated glass chest or barrel, attached\n to the ceiling by colored ribbons, twined round a small gilt chain. In the\n inside of these pipes, at right angles, are placed small mirrors, which reflect\n and contract every object in the exhibition room, so that the confederate,\n who answers the questions put, can not only hear all that is said, but see\n even the objects that are held in the hands of the visiters, such as watches,\n money, miniatures, letters in a book, and every other tiling that is un-\n covered.

A locksmith of Nuremberg, in the\n sixteenth century, constructed figures that beat drums, while others played\n on lutes : and the emperor Charles the Fifth amused himself, in his retire\n ment, by making similar Automata, or rather, Androides, for so such figures\n are called by the learne I. The celebrated John Muller, it is reported, made\n a wooden eagle, in 14T0, which, on the emperor Maximilian\u2019s approach to\n Nuremberg, flew to meet him. Vauconson made an Automatic duck, and,\n as Labat tells us, General de Gennes, (who, in 1688, defended St. Christo-\n pher against the English,) an Automatic peacock ; both of these were of a\n size and plumage perfectly natural : they eat, drank, walked about, and ut-\n tered the same sounds as the birds themselves. The machinery, in both\n cases, was similar to that of a watch. However astonishing these more\n complicated pieces of machinery may have been to our forefathers, in mod-\n em times, enlightened persons regard Vauconson and his Flute-player, and\n De Kempelen and his Turk, with much less wonder than that with which\n the rustics of the present day gaze upon the Jack-pudding Jugglers, who\n amuse them on a Cart-stage\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0209/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0209/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0209/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0209/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0209/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0209.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 529470}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"209\">\n<p>\n TRICKS WITH CARDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n A mong the most amusing feats of Legerdemain are the tricks with cards,\n of which, in the ensuing pages, we present our reader with an excellent\n series.

First, ascertain what the card you intend to force is ; this must be doth\n</p>\n<p>\n privately, or while you are playing with the cards; then place it, to al\n appearance, carelessly in the pack, but still keep your eye, or the little\n linger of your left hand, in which you hold the pack, upon it. Now, request\n a person to take a card from the pack ; open them nimbly from your left to\n your right hand, spreading them backward and forward, so as to puzzle the\n person in making his choice : the moment you see him putting out his hand\n to take a card, spread on the cards till you come to the one you wish to\n force ; let its corner be most invitingly put forward in front of the other\n cards, and let it make its appearance only the moment his fingers reach the\n pack. This mode of operation seems so fair, that unless he knows the secret\n of forcing, you may put what card you please into his hand, while he thinks\n he is making a choice himself. Having thus forced your card, you may tell\n him to look at it, give him the pack to shuffle as much as he pleases, for, in\n fact, do what he will, you, of course, can always tell what it was. A method\n of doing this cleverly is the first thing to be acquired ; for without it, few ' of\n le master-feats can be performed.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO TELL A CARD THOUGHT OF BLINDFOLD.\n</p>\n<p>\n v Take tw ' enty-one cards, and lay them dow n in three rows, with their faces\n rpward ; (t. e.) when you have laid out three, begin again at the left hand,\n and lay one card upon the first, and so on to the right hand ; then begin on\n the left hand again, and so go on until you have laid out the tw ' enty-one\n cards in three heaps, at the same time requesting any one to think of a card.\n When you have laid them out, ask him which heap his card is in : then lay\n</p>\n<p>\n that heap in the middle between the other two. This done, lay them out\n again in three heaps as before, and again request him to notice where his\n noted card goes, and put that heap in the middle, as before.

This is a very curious trick, and, if\n well done, is really astonishing.

It\n consists of a flat piece of thin metal or bone, with ten holes in it ; in each\n hole a wire is loosely fixed, beaten out into a head at one end, to prevent its\n slipping through, and the other fastened to a ring, also loose. Each wire\n has been passed through the ring of the next wire, previously to its own ring\n being fastened on ; and through the whole of the rings, runs a wire loop or\n bow, which also contains, within its oblong space, all the wires to which the\n rings are fastened ; the whole presenting so complicated an appearance, as\n to make the releasing the rings from the bow appear an impossibility. The\n construction of it would be found rather troublesome to the amateur, but it\n may be pm chased at most of the toy-shops, very lightly and elegantly made.\n It also exists in various parts of the country, forged in iron, perhaps, by\n some, ingenious village mechanic, and aptly named \u201c The Tiring Irons.\u201d\n The following instructions will show the principle on which the puzzle is\n constructed, and will prove a key to its solution.\n</p>\n<p>\n Take the loop in your left hand, holding it at the end B, and consider the\n rings as being numbered 1st to 10th. The 1st will be the extreme ring to\n the right, and the 10th the nearest to your left hand.\n</p>\n<p>\n It will be seen that the difficulty arises from, each ring passing round\n jhe wire of its right-hand neighbour. The extreme ring at the right hand,\n of course, being unconnected with any other wire than its own, may, at\n any time, be drawn off the end of the bow at A, raised up, dropped\n through the bow, and finally released. After you have don-3 this, try to\n pass the 2d ring in the same way, and you will not succeed, as it is\n obstructed by the wire of the 1st ring; but if you bring the 1st ring ost\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0231/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0231/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0231/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0231/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0231/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0231.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 412534}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"231\">\n<p>\n PARADOXES AND PUZZLES.\n</p>\n<p>\n 217\n</p>\n<p>\n Again, by reversing the process by which you took it off, viz. by putting\n it up through the bow, and on to the end of it, you will then find, that by\n taking the 1st and 2d rings together, they will both draw off, lift up, and\n drop through the bow.

On a moment\u2019s con-\n sideration, it will appear plainly, th at\n there must be as much difficulty in getting\n the pipe in its present situation, as there can be in taking it away. The\n way to put the puzzle together, is as follows : \u2014 The slip, c c,e e, is cut out of\n a piece of card, in the shape delineated in Fig. 3. The card in the first\n figure, must then be gently bent at A, so as to allow of the slip at the bot-\n tom of it being also bent sufficiently to pass\n double through the pipe, as in Fig. 2. The\n detached slip with the square ends, (Fig. 3,)\n is then to be passed half way through the\n loop, f, at the bottom of the pipe; it is\n next to be doubled in the centre, at a, and\n pulled through the pipe, double, by means\n of the loop of the slip to the card. Upon\n unbending the card, the puzzle will be\n complete, and appear as represented # in\n Fig. 1. In order to take the pipe off, the\n card must be doubled, as (Fig. 2,) the slip\n passed through it, until there is sufficient\n of the loop below the pipe to allow of one\n of the square ends of the slip (Fig. 3) being passed through it. Fig. 3 is\n then to be taken away, and the pipe slipped off. The card for this puzzle\n must be cut very neatly, the puzzle handled gently, and great care taken,\n that in doubling the card, to put on the pi] > e, no creases are made in it, aa\n they would, in all probability, spoil your puzzle, by betraying, to an acute\n ipectator, the mode of operation.\n</p>\n<p>\n el\n</p>\n<p>\n IL\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0234/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0234/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0234/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0234/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0234/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0234.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 420310}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"234\">\n<p>\n 220\n</p>\n<p>\n PARADOXES and puzzles.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE SQUARE HOLE AND ROUND STOPPER.\n</p>\n<p>\n How can a mechanic file a square hole with a round file, and fill up an\n ova! hole with a round stopper 1\n</p>\n<p>\n Answer.

Although not fitted to support life, yet it may be respired\n for a short time, and the effects, produced by it upon the animal frame, are\n its most extraordinary properties. The manner of breathing it is this : the\n nitrous oxide gas, having been previously purified by standing over water,\n is put into a large bladder, or varnished silk bag, having a wide glass tube,\n or a stop-cock with a large bore, affixed to its neck. The bladder is then\n held by the tube in the right hand, the mouth of it being closed by applying\n the thumb, and the nostrils are closed with the left hand ; the air contained\n in the lungs is expelled by a long respiration ; and the tube of the bladder\n being instantly applied to the mouth, the gas is breathed from and into the\n bladder as long as possible, which, perhaps, will lie about two or three\n minutes. The effects differ greatly, according to the constitutions of the\n persons by whom it is respired. In general, however, they are highly\n agreeable. Exquisite sensations of pleasure, \u2014 an irresistible propensity to\n laughter, \u2014 a rapid flow of vivid ideas, \u2014 singular thrilling in the toes,\n fingers and ears, \u2014 a strong incitement to muscular motions, \u2014 are the ordi-\n nary feelings produced by it. We have read of one gentleman, who, after\n breathing the gas some time, threw the bag from him, and kept breathing\n on laboriously with an open mouth, holding his nose with his fingers, without\n the power to remove them, though perfectly aware of his ludicrous situation ;\n he had a violent inclination to jump over the chairs and tables, and seemed\n so light that he thought lie was going to fly. What is exceedingly remark-\n able, is, that the intoxication thus produced, instead of being succeeded by\n the debility subsequent to intoxication by fermented liquors, does, on the\n contrary, generally render the person who takes it cheerful and high-spirited\n for the remainder of the day.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE COMICAL CARDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n The juvenile artist may treat his friends with an hour\u2019s merriment by this\n humorous little device, which is effected by drawing, on a number of cards\n all of one size, a series of grotesque-looking faces, some male, others female,\n with droll head-dresses, night-caps, hats, wigs, and helmets, v hicli he may\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0244/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0244/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0244/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0244/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0244/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0244.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 337687}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"244\">\n<p>\n VARIETIES\n</p>\n<p>\n 230\n</p>\n<p>\n select from any of the prints or caricatures that fall in his way ; but the\n general compass of the face part should be within about the same space in all\n of them.

and there are few, either high\n or low, rich or poor, but know my name and qualifications. As I confess\n myself a stranger to beauty and innocence, in the fair sex I can never ap-\n pear. I avoid towns and cities, and commonly take my abode towards the\n extremity of a village. In respectable society I am never admitted, but in\n a gang of gypsies or beggars make a principal figure; and without me\n smuggling would be nothing. I cannot well show my face in day-time, but\n late in the evening, or middle of night I appear, and always in disguise,\n i am fond of gaming, thong! must own, whatever company I am in, never\n fail to end in cheating and plundering. It is the opinion of Burn and Black-\n stone, that I should always be put in jail : but, be that as it may, my fate is\n certainly not to be there at present. From the character I have given of\n myself, and the company I keep, you may suppose me some thief or pick-\n pocket ; but, as a proof that I am neither, I delight not in a crowd ; and, as\n a further hint, I no sooner appear before one, than it is instantly gone.\n</p>\n<p>\n 16.\n</p>\n<p>\n I am rough, smooth, hard, soft, long, short, round, flat, oval, square, or\n oblong Am now honored with the grasp of a monarch, and now in the\n nand of him who executes the meanest office. I possess the art of pleasing\n in a very eminent degree. Am now the delight of the idle beau, and now\n assist the skilful artist. My station is ever varying : I am now thrown care-\n lessly in a corner, now put into the mouth, now in the pocket, and now under\n the grate. 1 will only add, that every room is indebted to me for its chief\n ornament.\n</p>\n<p>\n 17.\n</p>\n<p>\n I am no monarch, but am superior to all of them, except the Pope ; I have\n no noble blood in my veins, yet the meanest of my family has precedence\n over the heads of others ; I wear Yio sword, but in my evening walks often\n meet and beat those that do ; indeed, I have fought more battles, and gained\n more victories, than all the conquerors and heroes recorded in history, from\n the beginning of the world. Sometimes my army has been defeated; yet,\n in that part of the action where I fought myself, the enemy has always sub-\n mitted, when I carry off my prisoners under an armed band, dressed in ' he\n French uniform, and sometimes adorned with gold and precious stones, Jo an\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0259/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0259/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0259/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0259/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0259/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0259.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 451721}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"259\">\n<p>\n SOLUTIONS\n</p>\n<p>\n 259\n</p>\n<p>\n 105 She\u2019s in Holland.\n</p>\n<p>\n 106 it is often baited.\n</p>\n<p>\n > 7 He\u2019s light-headed.\n</p>\n<p>\n 108 There\u2019s a goose\u2019s head in it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 109 He cut it too little, i. e. he did\n</p>\n<p>\n not cut enough of it.\n</p>\n<p>\n 110 It often tolled \u2014 (told.)\n</p>\n<p>\n 111 It is near the Temple.\n</p>\n<p>\n 112 A cat out of a hole.\n</p>\n<p>\n 113 He i3 a neck-romancer \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n (necromancer.)\n</p>\n<p>\n 114 In Noah\u2019s ark.\n</p>\n<p>\n 115 It is not fair.\n</p>\n<p>\n 116 R, U, E \u2014 (Are you he ?)\n</p>\n<p>\n 117 He\u2019s grim all day ( Grimaldi .)\n</p>\n<p>\n 118 Man : viz.

A great variety of rods may be had at the shops, of bamboo,\n vine, hazel, and hickory : for general fishing, those made of bamboo, having\n several tops of various strengths, are best ; but cane rods are much superior\n for fine fishing. The rod should be perfectly straight when put together,\n and gradually taper from the butt to the top. If you be desirous of making\n the rods yourself, the following directions must be observed : \u2014 The stocks\n should be cut in the winter ; hazel and yew switches are the best for tops,\n and crab-tree for stocks. Do not use them till fully seasoned, which will be\n in about sixteen months after they are cut ; but the longer they are kept the\n better. The rod should consist of five or six pieces, fitted so nicely, tuat the\n whole rod may appear as if it consisted of one piece only. The best rods are\n those that are brass ferruled ; but if they are bound together, it must be with\n thread, strongly waxed, the pieces being cut with a slope or slant, that they\n may join with the greater exactness. Six or eight inches must be taken\n from the top, and in its place a smooth round taper piece of whalebone sub-\n stituted, on which a strong loop of horse-hair must be previously whipt.\n Fly-rods are made more taper than others. Rods for trolling must be fur-\n nished with brass rings, whipt all the way up, about ten or twelve inches\n distance, for the trolling lines to go through ; the tops for trolls must be\n strong, and have rings whipt on, with pieces of quill, to prevent the lines\n being cut. The tops ot rods for Carp, Tench, Dace and Roach fishing,\n should be finer, and more elastic.\n</p>\n<p>\n The rod must neither be kept too dry, nor too moist; for the one will\n make it brittle, the other rotten. In very warm weather, always wet fhe\n joints, to make them adhere better ; if, however, by being too wet, they\n should stick, so that you cannot easily get them asunder, never use force, lest\n you should strain your rod, but rather wait till it be dry, or turn the ferrule\n of the joint which is fast, a few times over the flame of a candle, and it will\n separate.\n</p>\n<p>\n LINES.\n</p>\n<p>\n For the line, horse-hair is to be preferred; it should be round, twisted\n even, and of equal thickness. The best colors are white and gray fot\n clear waters, and sorrel for muddy rivers. The most easy method of mak\n ing lines, is by a little machine, which may be bought at most of the shoos\n where also, you purchase your lines, if you think fit.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0265/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0265/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0265/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0265/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0265/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0265.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 437724}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"265\">\n<p>\n THE ANGLER.\n</p>\n<p>\n HOOKS.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n 26\n</p>\n<p>\n Hooks are numbered, and made suitable in size to the fish they are inten\n ded to take.

In fishing with a Minnow,\n liook it by the lips, or beneath the back fin; use a small cork float, No. 6\n hook, and let your bait swim below mid-water in deep dark holes, which are\n free from eddies. Trout begin to feed in March, and continue in season till\n June. The first two or three months are best for bottom-fishing, they are\n then found in shallows ; in summer time, the large Trout lie in deep holes, or\n eddies.

During the hot months, Perch feed very little ; dark,\n windy weather, if not too cold, is best; they lie about bridges, mill-uools,\n near locks in rivers and canals, in deep, dark, still holes and eddies, ponds\n about flood gates, on the gravel or sandy parts, and near rushes. If there\n be any Perch about, and they are inclined to feed, they will soon take the\n bait, so that you need not delay long in one place.\n</p>\n<p>\n EELS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Eels are taken with th\u00a3 rod and line, night lines, dead lines, and by boh-\n Ding ' and sniggling. When fishing with a rod, use gut, or twisted hair lines,\n with a float, and No. 8 hook ; bait with a worm, fish at the bottom, and let the\n float remain a moment under water before you strike.

Immense numbers may be taken by this method.\n</p>\n<p>\n NATURAL FLY-FISHING.\n</p>\n<p>\n For Natural Fly-fishing, the rods should be long and s.ender, the lines\n fine, but not so long as those used for Artificial Fly-fishing ; the tackle run-\n ning; and the hooks short in their shanks, and well proportioned in size to\n the baits. By fishing with the wind at one\u2019s back, the line is wafted through\n the air just above the surface of the water. In streams, begin by fishing\n just under the banks or near the shore, and proceed by degrees, until at\n length you may throw your line the whole breadth of the water. In rivers,\n which, during the summer months, produce an abundance of weeds, you\n should fish between those places where the current is strongest, taking care\n so to manage your line as not to get it entangled. When fishing with natur.J\n flies, all the ether haunts of the different fish which we have elsewhere men-\n tioned should be frequented. Let the fly just reach the surface of the w a-\n ter, and go gently down the stream; the top of your rod should be a little\n raised, and the bait kept in motion upon the surface, by gently raising, low-\n ering, and drawing it to and fro. When a fish takes your bait, after a mo-\n ment strike smartly; and, if he be not so large as to break your tackle, lift\n him out immediately; for by playing with him you may, probably, scare\n away others. There is an immense variety of Natural Fly-fishing baits;\n we shall describe those only which are in most general use.\n</p>\n<p>\n NATURAL BAITS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Hornets, wasps, and humble-bees, are good baits for Roach, Dace, Eels,\n Flounders, Bream and Chub; some boil them, but it is best to dry them in\n an oven, or over a fire ; and, if not over done, they will keep a long time.\n The stone-fly is found at the sides of rivers, under hollow stones ; it is of a\n curious brown color, the body is pretty thick, and streaked with yellow on\n the back and belly.\n</p>\n<p>\n The green drake is taken from May to July; it is a long, slender fly, with\n wings like those of a butterfly ; its body is yellow, ribbed with green ; it turns\n its tail on its back. These are good baits for Roach, Dace, Perch, Bleak,\n and Flounders. The gray drake, in size and shape, resembles the green\n drake, but has black shining wings, and its body is a pale yellow, striped\n with black and green. The time for taking this fly immediately succeeds\n that of taking the green drake, and it is used for the same fish.\n</p>\n<p>\n Ant-flies are found in their hills from June till September; two or three\n of them fixed on a small hook are certain baits for Roach, Dace, and Chub,\n if you do not angle above six inches from the bottom. They may be kept\n \u2022n glass bottles, w ' ith some of the earth, from which they have been tak jn,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0269/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0269/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0269/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0269/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0269/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0269.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 454983}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"269\">\n<p>\n THE ANGLER.\n</p>\n<p>\n 269\n</p>\n<p>\n about thorn.

There are many fishes that will never rise at a fly ; while all the\n \u201c tenants of the stream\u201d may be taken, at some time or other, by a bottom\n bait ; and during the cold or wet weather, when the Fly-fisher cannot follow\n flis sport, the staunch Angler, who uses bottom-baits, may still resort to the\n ' * grassy margin of the stream,\u201d and indulge in his piscatory pastime ; for\n Jiere are few days in the year when fish will not take a proper bait.\n</p>\n<p>\n Artificial fly-fishing is, by far, the most difficult part of Angling ; much\n Z\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0270/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0270/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0270/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0270/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0270/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0270.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 494247}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"270\">\n<p>\n lime and practice are required to make the tyro an adept ir\n</p>\n<p>\n THE ANGLER.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n it can never be attained ; a few months\u2019 instruction, under an experienced\n person, will be more beneficial toward its acquirement than the perusal ofall\n the works extant on the subject.

Practice\n several throws at this length, and increase it occasionally, as you improve,\n until you are able to throw almost any moderate length, with ease, to within\n an inch of any spot you desire. Draw the fly lightly toward the shore, and\n look sharply at it, so as to be able to strike instantly if a fish should rise at\n it; if you do not, you will most probably lose him, for he quickly discovers\n the nature of your bait. In raising your line for the second and subsequent\n throws, wave your rod round your head, instead of bringing it directly back-\n ward. You should not return the line before it has gone its full length be-\n hind you, lest vo\u00bb > whip off your fly. In order to show your flies naturally to\n the fish, when you have thrown, raise your hand by degrees, with a slight\n quivering motion ; and, as you thus draw the bait toward you, let it go down\n (he stream, (for you must never bring your fly against it,) and before it comes\n too near you, prepare to cast again. If you see a fish rise at a natural fly,\n throw your line a little above him, so that the bait may come gently and\n naturally down toward him ; fish every yard of water likely to afford sport\n and never despair of success ; for, sometimes it so happens, that, after man\n fruitless hours spent without a fish ever rising at your fly, you will fill your\n bag or basket during the last hour. The lighter your fly descends on the\n water, the greater chance you have of a bite ; the way to throw with the\n requisite perfection in this respect, is only to be acquired by\n love for the art. Use only one hook at a time, till yoi\n to any given distance with certainty.

Use fine tackle, and\n you will the sooner become skilful : if you break your tackle, do not lose\n your temper, but sit down, and diligently repair it. If hail fall, or the day\n be cold, and the wind blow strong, the Angler must not expect much sport.\n</p>\n<p>\n . n soft rain, or foggy, close weather, most fish will bite. Never drink water\n out of rivers or ponds while in a perspiration ; keep your feet dry, by wear-\n ing strong boots and shoes. It is supposed that the best winds for Angling\n are the south, west, and south east. In hot weather, the cooler the wind\n blows the better; hut in the early part of the season, and also in autumn, a\n warm wind is more advantageous. When the wind comes from a cold\n quarter, such places as are most protected from its influence should be re-\n sorted to. A cloudy day, with light showers, after a bright night, in general\n proves most favorable to the Angler, who may also expect good sport even\n on those days when heavy rains descend during the intervals between the\n showers. When a calm bright morning is succeeded by a gloomy day with\n a brisk wir d, without any fall of rain, the fish, \u2014 at least, the larger sorts, \u2014\n are almost sure to feed.

These three rabbits,\n being of the true fancy strain, have occasionally thrown very excellent speci-\n mens, which he has selected and reared : the first he has disposed of again,\n and his hutches did not, at the time we saw them, which was about three\n months since, contain an animal that would not pass muster in the rabbitrv\n of a first-rate fancier.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE RABBITRY AND HUTCHES.\n</p>\n<p>\n The rabbit house should be dry and well ventilated ; too much humidity,\n whether externally or internally, will cause the rabbits to rot. Where con-\n siderable numbers are kept, fresh air is absolutely necessary to preserve\n them in a state of health ; still they should not be exposed to draughts,\n which, on many occasions, have brought on a disease called the snuffles \u2014 a\n dangerous, and frequently fatal malady. If economy be an object, or the\n young fancier be desirous of employing his mechanical abilities, he\n may construct hutches sufficiently good for common purposes himself.\n A tolerably good doe\u2019s hutch may be made out of an old egg-chest, and\n places for bucks and weaned rabbits, of tea-chests ; the former are to be\n bought at a cheesemonger\u2019s, the latter at a grocer\u2019s shop. If our reader\n should become his own carpenter in this case, we recommend him to follow,\n as much as his abilities will admit, the directions which are given for mak-\n ing hutches in the following page. Young persons should begin by keeping\n common rabbits, for which common hutches, such as they can construct\n themselves, if so inclined, will be quite good enough. When they have\n acquired experience in the management of the Rabbitry, and not before,\n they may, by degrees, introduce superior animals to their stock, and dispose\n of the common ones. They should then also obtain superior hutches ; for a\n fine lop-eared rabbit loses half the beauty of its appearance in a clumsy and\n ill-fashioned hutch.\n</p>\n<p>\n The hutch for does should have a partition with a hole in it, to let them\n pass from one part to the other, and a slide to close ibis hole when necessary .\n For weaned rabbits, a hutch without this partition is preferable, and it is\n unnecessary to make any partition in the bucks\u2019 hutches. The breeding\n hutches should be about three feet long, two feet and a half in depth, and\n eighteen inches high ; the breeding place may be from nine to :welve inches\n in breadth ; it should have a door to fit the whole front of it, fastened by a\n separate latch or buckle to that used for the door of the feeding place.

On his skill, as a feeder, mainly de-\n pends the young Fancier\u2019s chance of prosperity with his stock.

If you give rabbits more hay than\n they can eat in a few hours, except it be to a doe just about to litter, they\n will tread it under foot, and waste it ; if you give them but a moderate quan-\n tity at a time, they will eat and enjoy it. Generally speaking, rabbits prefer\n green or moist food to corn : but it is necessary to make them eat a suffi-\n cient proportion of solid food to keep them in health; occasionally, instead\n of corn, we give our rabbits a few split or whole gray peas. When a doe\n has a litter by her side, and also for rabbits recently weaned, we soak the\n peas for a few hours previously to putting them in the trough.

The rabbits are not to be left together above ten minutes.\n Some days before kindling, hay is to be given to the doe, with which, and\n the Hue which nature has instructed her to tear from her body, she will make\n her nest. Biting the hay into short pieces,, and carrying it about in her\n mouth, are almost certain signs of her being with young. The number\n produced varies from three to eleven. Destroy the weak and sickly ones,\n as soon as their defects can be perceived, until the litter is reduced to five\n or six. If you leave more to be suckled, some will, perhaps, die, others be\n sickly, and none of them fine. The old rabbits are not to be put together till\n the expiration of six weeks : the young may be separated from the doe and\n weaned a fortnight after. If more than five or six litters are obtained in a\n year, the doe will be soon worn out, and the young ones not worth much.\n The doe should not be disturbed by any other rabbit, while with young\n Should she be weak after kindling, give her a malt mash, scalded fine pol-\n lard, or barley-meal, in which may be mixed a small quantity of cordial\n horse-ball. In this case, and, in fact, whenever a doe is weak, bread \u2014\n soaked in milk, and squeezed rather dry again, if she will take it, will\n considerably strengthen her.\n</p>\n<p>\n If well fed, and kept warm, does will breed all the year ; but most fanciers\n are contented with five litters a year, and let them rest during the winter.\n Mowbray states, that the produce of rabbits is so multitudinous, that one\n might be well satisfied with this practice; for that even four litters in the\n year would be equal to two thousand young rabbits annually, from a stock of\n ' me hundred does. If does devour their young, or do not breed for any con-\n siderable time, rabbit fanciers dispose of them as useless incumbrances to\n their stock. It is advisable so to manage, that two or three does should kin-\n dle about the same time ; you may then take from the doe that has the great-\n est number, and put the excess under her that has the least ; taking care not\n to leave more than six young ones to each. It is advisable to obtain rabbits\n for breeding from a litter of two, three, or four only, as they are generally\n stronger and finer than those which come from a more numerous one. It is\n a disadvantage, rather than otherwise, to have above six produced in a litter,\n as the young rabbits, when that is the case, are almost invariably weak\n and puny ; and even if they be reduced to a moderate quantity, by removing\n some of them to another doe, or otherwise, they rarely become remarkable\n Ibr their size or beauty.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0280/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0280/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0280/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0280/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0280/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0280.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 430798}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"280\">\n<p>\n 280\n</p>\n<p>\n RABBITS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Diseases may, in a great measure, be prevented, by regularity in feed-\n ing, good food, and cleanliness.

Do not\n handle your rabbits, particularly the young ones, too much ; when you lift\n them, take them with one hand by the ears, and place the other under the\n lower part of their backs. Never slacken in attention ; a neglect of a day\n will do your stock much injury ; while by constant care you may breed to\n great perfection. Those who are fanciful in colors should not only look at\n those of the rabbits they buy for breeding, but also ascertain, if possible, the\n colors of the does they come from; for rabbits frequently throw litters, m\n which not a single young one of their own color can be found. If there hap-\n pen, for instance, to have been a single cross of gray in your stock for three\n or four generations back, it will frequently appear in stock, although every\n breeding rabbit in your hutches be of a different color. Gray is the most\n difficult of all colors to eradicate ; but even gray rabbits do not always have\n young ones of their own color.\n</p>\n<p>\n The more you vary the food, the fatter your rabbits will be ; but observe,\n that when they are once full fat, (to use a term of breeders,) they frequently\n fall off and pine away to bad condition. It is impossible to lay down rules\n fir the precise quantity of each sort of food to be allowed; a little ex\n perience alone can teach the youthful fancier this secret.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0281/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0281/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0281/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0281/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0281/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0281.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 418046}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"281\">\n<p>\n GUINEA PIGS.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c A rat without a tail.\u201d _\n</p>\n<p>\n Macbeth.\n</p>\n<p>\n These little animals were originally natives of Brazil, hut they have long\n been introduced to this and other European countries.

If the hen delay, the\n cock leaves the nest at the usual time, seeks her out, and drives her to her\n duty ; the hen does the same in case of negligence in this respect on the\n part of the cock.\n</p>\n<p>\n a a\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0284/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0284/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0284/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0284/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0284/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0284.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 451731}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"284\">\n<p>\n T\n</p>\n<p>\n T\n</p>\n<p>\n 28 4\n</p>\n<p>\n PIGEONS\n</p>\n<p>\n The young > nes are usually of different sexes. For the first three days\n after they are hatched, the female seldom leaves them ; after that time, the\n cock and hen attend to feed them indiscriminately. The way in which the\n old supply the young with food is singular : the parent birds collect a quan-\n tity of grain and water in their crops, which are very capacious, and after\n it has lain there until soft and macerated, they cast it up into the throats ol\n the young ones. As the young birds acquire strength, the old ones give the\n food less preparation, and at last drive them out to provide in part for them-\n selves; but they are often seen feeding their young ones even when the\n latter are able to fly, and they themselves are going to nest again. The\n young ones, while fed by the cock and hen, are called squabs, under six\n months old squeakers, and after that age they are denominated pigeons,\n being in a fit state to mate and breed.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE DOVE-COTE, OR PIGEON-HOUSE\n</p>\n<p>\n As many young people will take a pleasure in breeding a little flock of\n birds from a common box, fitted up against a wall or elsewhere, we shall give\n</p>\n<p>\n them a few words of advice\n on the subject. The form\n of the box is immaterial ;\n the triangular is, perhaps,\n the best, because it allows\n die wet to run off quickest ;\n it may be made with any\n number of holes, which\n should be sufficiently large\n for die pigeons to turn round\n in them with ease. Shelves\n and partitions of six or eight\n inches deep should run along\n</p>\n<p>\n the front, to keep the couples apart, and afford them good resting-places.\n It will be an advantage, if you can allow two holes between each partition\n for each couple of birds. The box may also be made square ; or in fact,\n according to the convenience or fancy of the individual fitting it up. It\n should be fixed where it will be secure from rats and cats, and ought always\n to face a warm quarter; cold winds being very pernicious to the birds.\n</p>\n<p>\n PIGEON LOFTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n We shall now proceed to give the young Fancier proper instructions for\n building pigeon lofts, which are used for breeding and keeping the more\n curious sort of birds, or what are commonly denominated Fancy pigeons.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0285/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0285/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0285/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0285/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0285/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0285.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 454699}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"285\">\n<p>\n PIGEONS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 285\n</p>\n<p>\n Many i k: r sons convert tlie spaces between the garrets and the roofs of\n their houses into lofts, by making an aperture in the tiling, which opens on\n a platform, fixed on the outside. It is necessary in this, as in all other cases\n to erect proper fences to keep out the cats. If possible, for the sake of\n warmth, your loft should face the south or southwest ; but as it rarely hap-\n pens that convenience will allow of a room being occupied entirely by\n pigeons, it is seldom that the birds are indulged with this advantage. Any\n place, in fact, that is dry, light, airy, and sufficiently commodious, may be\n converted into a good loft.\n</p>\n<p>\n The shelves for the breeding place should be fourteen inches, or a little\n more, in breadth ; and if you breed Pouters, there ought to be twenty inches\n between the upper and lower shelves, or otherwise the pigeons will acquire\n a trick of stooping, which will spoil their deportment. Partitions should be\n made in these shelves, about three feet apart, and a slip of board run along\n the front of the lower shelves about four inches high, to keep in the nests.\n This slip should run in a groove, or be otherwise managed so that it mav\n be easily removed, in order to clean out the nests when expedient. A simi-\n lar slip must also be fixed in the middle of each three feet division, which is\n thus adapted for a double nest, in one of which, the old hen may lay in\n quietness without being disturbed by her young ones in the other, as she\n often leaves them when about three weeks old to the care of the cock, and\n goes to nest again. Some Fanciers darken the nest by setting up a board a\n few inches within the edge of the shelves, having an entrance hole cut\n through it ; thus dividing the partition into an outer shelf or landing place,\n and an inner room or nest : in this case, of course, the slip is unnecessary.\n A good contrivance to keep the birds private when setting is, perhaps,\n worth attention, as they are sometimes shy, and set uneasy, or even\n fly off their eggs, in alarm, on any person\u2019s entering the loft. Some tame\n pigeons will not make their nests ; to such it will be right to afford a little\n liay. Straw buckets and pans of earthen- ware are used by many Fanciers\n for nests. When the latter are adopted, it is usual to place a brick between\n them (there being two pans in every partition) for the convenience of the\n birds, as well as more effectually to divide and support the nest. The pans\n should vary in size according to the pigeons for which they are intended.\n The straw baskets are in general preferred, as the egg is liable to be broken\n in the pan, unless it be strowed with hay, straw, or frail, of which the latter,\n for many reasons, is the best for the purpose.\n</p>\n<p>\n FEEDING, MATING, & C.\n</p>\n<p>\n Gravel should be strowed on the shelves and floor, the birds being fond\n of picking it ; besides, it gives the loft a much cleaner appearance. Clean-\n liness is indispensable ; if you suffer the loft to be filthy, the dirt will produce\n effects which will be equally annoying to yourself and your birds.

Of all gram, old tares prove to\n be the best suited to the nature of these birds ; new tares should be given\n very sparingly, especially to young pigeons, as they are very liable to do\n them much injury. Horse beans are esteemed the next best food to tares\n the smallest of these are preferred, especially small ticks. Wheat, barley,\n oats, and peas, ought only to be given now and then for a change of diet,\n as they sometimes hurt them. Rape, canary, and hemp-seed, pigeons\n are immoderately fond of ; but these must not by any means be made a\n constant diet.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mating or coupling of pigeons is often attended with much difficulty. Tn\n order to effect it, let two coops be built close together with a partition of\n lath between them, so that the birds may see each other, and they should\n feed out of the same vessels; by supplying diem well with hemp-seed, you\n may soon make them fit for mating, and when you perceive the hen to\n sweep her tail, you may remove her to the cock\u2019s pen, and diey will soon\n agree. When this convenience is wanting, and you are compelled to put\n them both into the coop at first, put the cock in three or four days before the\n hen, that he may get master of the coop, part icularly if the hen be a ter-\n magant, or else they will quariel so much, that their bickerings will end in\n an irreconcilable hatred. When the pigeons are matched, you can give\n them the run of the loft to choose a nest for themselves, or fix them to one, by\n inclosing them within it, by a ladi railing, giving them food and water in\n plenty for eight or nine days.\n</p>\n<p>\n DISEASES AND REMEDIES.\n</p>\n<p>\n For the wet roup, give them three or four pepper-corns once in three 01\n four days, and steep a handful of green rue in their water, which you may\n let all the pigeons drink of.

When the flesn round\n the eyes is torn or pecked, bathe it with salt water for several days; if this\n do not prove successful, wash the aggrieved part with two drachms of alum\n dissolved in an ounce and a half of water\n</p>\n<p>\n When pigeons are infested with insects, smoke their feathers w ' ell with\n tobacco.\n</p>\n<p>\n Pigeons are apt to gorge themselves when they have fasted rather longer\n than usual.

An easy dress should be worn, and it is usual, in academies, t\u00ab\n have a spot, or heart, on the left side of the breast of the waistcoat.\n</p>\n<p>\n HOW TO HOLD THE FOIL.\n</p>\n<p>\n The hilt must be flat in your hand ; so that the two edges are nearly hori-\n tontal when you throw yourself upon guard ; your thumb should be stretch-\n ed along the upper fiat part of the hilt, within half an inch of the shell, and\n \u2022lie pommel should rest under your wrist.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0290/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0290/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0290/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0290/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0290/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0290.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 496577}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"290\">\n<p>\n 290\n</p>\n<p>\n FENCING.\n</p>\n<p>\n COMMON GUARDS OF CARTE AND TIERCE.\n</p>\n<p>\n Stand in the first position, which is similar to the first position in dancing,\n that is, your right foot forward, with the heel advanced ; then throw your-\n self upon the common guard or carte, by advancing your right foot about\n half a yard from the left.

F rom 22 to 18 is supposed to be the best first move ; we will, therefore,\n imagine that white makes it. It is black\u2019s turn to move a piece; he, like\n his adversary, can only advance one of his front rank men; he may move\n the man on 9, to 13 or 14 ; that on 10, to 14 or 15 ; that on 11, to 15 or 16 ;\n and that on 12, to 16 only. The white having moved from 22 to 18, the\n hlack then may move, if he please, from 11 to 15. In the next move, the\n</p>\n<p>\n white man on 18, will take the\n man so placed by black on 15,\n by leaping over his head into 11.\n It is now black\u2019s turn to move,\n and he, in return, can take\n white\u2019s man which stands in 11,\n by either of tlie men standing on\n 7 or 8. In case he makes the\n capture with 7, he jumps over\n the head of the man to be taken,\n into 16 ; if he prefer taking him\n with 8, the move, for that pur-\n pose, is from 8 to 15. An op-\n portunity, here occurs, of giving\n a practical explanation of the\n huff. Supposing, when black\n had moved from 11 to 15, white\n had omitted to take him, in the manner we have just explained, and made\n some other move, white, in this case, would have \u201c stood the huff:\u201d that is,\n black might have taken away the white man that stood on 18, or compelled\n white to have taken him, which he pleased. This is \u201c standing the huff ;\u201d\n and, be it recollected, that so taking off the man from 18, is not to be con-\n sidered as a move, black having his move after having so done, before\n white can move again.\n</p>\n<p>\n In case the game were in a more advanced state, and that the black man,\n which, at the beginning, stood on 4, had been removed, the white man on\n 18, instead of taking only the black man on 15, would have taken the black\n man on 8, in addition, by leaping over 15 into 11, and over 8 into 4, which\n would be reckoned as one move. In this case, the man in 4, having reached\n one of the back squares of the enemy, (1, 2, 3, and 4,) he becomes a king,\n and black crowns him, by placing one of white\u2019s captured men on his head.\n The piece can now move, and take either backward or forward, and is of\n oreat importance. As many of the black men as, in their turn, reach either\n of the squares, 29, 30, 31, 32, immediately become kings, as in the case\n of the white men reaching 1, 2, 3, or 4, and, of course, have equal powers.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0314/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0314/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0314/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0314/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0314/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0314.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 469196}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"314\">\n<p>\n o2 4\n</p>\n<p>\n DRAUGHTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n We will now give a practical example or two of the \u201c kingly powers * \u2019 of\n these \u201c crowned heads.\u201d Supposing a black king stood on 29, a white king\n on 25, a white man on 18, another white king on 19, and a third white king,\n or a white man, on 27, \u2014 if it were black\u2019s move, and the board was clear,\n except only of the pieces that are mentioned, he would take them all thus :\n from 29 to 22, taking 25 ; from 22 to 15, taking 18 ; from 15 to 24, taking\n 19; and from 24 to 31, taking 27.

And here we feel it necessary to remark,\n that it will not be sufficient merely to go over the moves indicated in the\n following pages; by so doing, much time will be lost, and little learned : it\n is indispensable, if the learner be desirous of obtaining any benefit from\n these games, that he should carefully look to each series of moves, and, if\n possible, improve upon them as he goes on. The position of a single piece\n may totally defeat the best attacks, and it is not to be supposed that any\n two players will ever, except by some extraordinary accident, make all the\n identical moves, set down in the ensuing games. Still, however, much\n may be done by a few schemes of moves; especially, as toward the end,\n the positions of the men are very frequently similar, and we feel convinced,\n that by playing the following few games, (provided proper attention is given\n to them) an insight into the game may be acquired sooner than by the\n longest essay on the subject. We strongly recommend the young Draught-\n player, if he be desirous of speedily acquiring some proficiency in the game,\n to make himself a perfect master of the ends of, as well as any nice situations\n that occur in, the following games, so as to be able to play them, as it were,\n whenever an opportunity may occur. It is the advice of many experienced\n Draught-players, that learners should provide themselves with a common-\n place book for noting down any particular situations that may happen in\n their progress, or such masterly moves, by older hands, as they may have\n the good fortune to witness.

game of Draughts will, we\n have no doubt, derive much benefit from a perusal of the foregoing pages,\n and beco/ne enabled to defeat those by whom they have previously been\n beaten. A person who has never acquired any insight into the game may,\n we flatter ourselves, from the care which we have taken in preparing the\n treatise, acquire considerable proficiency, by a proper attention to our rules\n and instructions.\n</p>\n<p>\n The few remarks which we are about to make, as to one circumstance\n in Draughts, could not, we conceive, be so aptly introduced anywhere else\n as here ; we allude to the importance of having the move upon an antago-\n nist. The value of this will, no doubt, have frequently occurred to the\n reader, in the course of the preceding games; but there are situations, when\n it is not only useless, but detrimental. To have the move when your men\n are in a proper position, upon an open board, will often, in a short time,\n give you the power of forcing your adversary into such a situation as will\n render his defeat certain ; but, having the move, when your men are hud-\n dled in confusion together, and you are unprepared to point an attack from\n any quarter, that is to say, when you are strong in number, but powerless\n in position, will, not unfrequently, cause you to lose the game.\n</p>\n<p>\n In order to know whether any one of your men have the move over one\n of your adversary\u2019s, you must carefully notice their respective positions, and,\n if your opponent have a black square on your right angle under his man,\n you have the move upon him. This is a general rule, and will apply to\n any number of pieces. To illustrate it with an instance : if white have a\n man on 22, it being his turn to play, and black\u2019s man be on II, white has the\n move. A modern writer on this subject, gives another method of ascertain-\n ing whether a party, whose turn it is to play, has tlie move ; namely, by\n counting the squares and the men ; and if the squares be odd, and the men\n even, or the men odd, and the squares even, then the party whose turn it is\n to play has possession of the move : thus, if there be a black man on 19,\n on 26 a white king, on 28 a black king, and on 32 a white man, and white\n have to play, he has aie move, and may certainly win the game, if he act\n judiciously ; the opposite party\u2019s men being even, and the white squares, be-\n tween them and his own, odd ; there are three white squares from the black\n king on 28 to the white king on 26, (viz. 24, 27, and 31,) and between the\n black man on 19 and the white man on 32, two white squares, 23 and 27,\n making together, five. White begins by moving his man to 27, the black\n king goes to 32, the white man proceeds to 24, and is taken by the black\n man on 19 ; the white king now goes to 23 ; the black king must next step to\n 27, having no other move, (his man being on 28,) and is taken by the white\n k ing, who thus gets into 32, and wins the game, as black cannot move his mau.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0320/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0320/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0320/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0320/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0320/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0320.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 375686}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"320\">\n<p>\n *3- ' r\n</p>\n<p>\n DRAUGHTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Persons who know but little of this game are sometimes found talking\n lightly of it, as a trifle undeserving of attention ; to such speakers we quote\n the following passage from Dr. Johnson\u2019s dedication of Payne\u2019s Book on\n Draughts . \u2014 \u201c Triflers may think or make anything a trifle ; but since it\n is the great characteristic of a wise man to see events in their causes, to\n obviate consequences, and ascertain contingencies, your lordship will think\n nothing a trifle by which the mind is inured to caution, foresight, and cir-\n cumspection.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In conclusion, we beg to assure our young readers, that, simple as it may\n appear, they will never be able to attain any proficiency in this game,\n without some study, and much caution.\n</p>\n<p>\n ,li , | ! l i I\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0321/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0321/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0321/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0321/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0321/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0321.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 557499}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"321\">\n<p>\n /\n</p>\n<p>\n CHESS, ol ajl sedentary\n games, is undoubtedly the\n most eminent.

Thus, check is plainly derived from the Persian\n schach, or king ; and mat, in the same language, signifies dead ; hence\n check-mate, or, the king is dead.\n</p>\n<p>\n Although Chess can be traced back to the most remote antiquity, we\n have no satisfactory proofs of the place where, or the person by whom\n it was invented. . But, whoever he was, it is certain that he must have\n been a man of profound thought. It has been without a rival for cen-\n turies, and is as much admired in our day as it was a thousand years\n ago. \u2019 It may be called a representation of war in miniature ; two lit-\n tle armies, of different colors, are drawn up opposite each other in the\n order of battle, with their castles, their kings and queens, their knights,\n bishops, and common soldiers, prepared for mutual attack, and to take\n prisoner the king of the opposite party.\n</p>\n<p>\n Chess is highly beneficial to the improvement of the mind ; nothing\n in it is governed by chance \u2014 judgment is every thing.

He is then check-mated, and must surrender. He steps only\n from one square to the next at a time, but in any direction whatever,\n either forward, backward, sideways, or diagonally. He can also take\n any of the enemy\u2019s men in any square adjoining to him, so that he does\n not place himself in check ; that is, in such a situation as, if he were\n not a king, he could be taken by the enemy. The king however is ne-\n ver actually taken ; but, if he be checked by one piece, and can neither\n take the hostile man, interpose any of his own, nor move into any oth-\n er square without being in check from another, he loses the game.\n Whenever the king is in check, the adversary must say \u201c check,\u201d to\n him, which is a warning either to defend himself by his other pieces,\n to take the man who assaults him, or to move into a place of safety.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE QUEEN.\n</p>\n<p>\n The queen is, in point of power, the best piece on the board. She\n moves, like the king, in all directions, and as far as she pleases, but at\n one move, and provided the squares be unoccupied in her line of motion.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE ROOK, OR CASTLE.\n</p>\n<p>\n The rooks, or castles, are next in importance to the queen. Their\n motion is backward, forward, and sideways. And they may move as\n far as the field is open.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE BISHOP.\n</p>\n<p>\n The bishop moves diagonally, as far as the squares are open, in any\n direction. The bishop therefore always keeps the same colored squares\n as that on which he is placed at the beginning of the game.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE KNIGHT.\n</p>\n<p>\n The knight is particularly useful at the beginning of the game, and\n should be one of the first pieces brought into play. The knight moves\n in a peculiar way, leaping from the square on which he stands into ei-\n ther of the next that has a corner in contact with one of the farther cor-\n ners of the square over which he leaps. He alw ' ays moves therefore\n from white to black, or the contrary. As, for an example, from B I to\n A3, C 3, or D 2. The move of the knight is one of tne most difficult\n points of chess to explain in writing ; and we therefore recommend\n our young friends to take an opportunity of looking over a game of\n chess while playing, and fix the whole of the moves in their minds\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0324/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0324/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0324/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0324/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0324/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0324.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 460498}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"324\">\n<p>\n 334\n</p>\n<p>\n CHESS.\n</p>\n<p>\n A knight may be placed on any one square of the board, and conveyed\n hence into every one of the other squares in sixty-three moves. We\n subjoin an example ot this curious problem at the end of the article.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE PAWNS.\n</p>\n<p>\n The pawns are of great consequence in defending the king ; and are\n very useful in attacking and repelling the pieces, under the manage-\n ment of a good player. If a pawn can proceed across the field to the\n rear line of the enemy, that is from 2 to 8, or from 7 to 1, he is exchan-\n ged for a queen, or any other piece of his color that he chooses to de-\n mand. Thus, you may have a second queen, even though you should\n have lost none of your pieces. The pawn moves strait forward, and\n only a single square at a time ; except on its being first moved, when\n the player may advance it either one square or two, as from 2 to 3 or to\n 4, and from 7 to 6 or to 5 ; or when one takes a man from the enemy,\n which is always done diagonally, or across the corners of the squares.\n But a pawn cannot move two squares forward, when the square over\n which he leaps is so viewed by an enemy\u2019s pawn, that the latter could\n take him in that square.

The same mode is adopted by\n all the rest ; the pieces on the queen\u2019s side of the board being distin-\n guished as the queen\u2019s rook, knight, and bishop.\n</p>\n<p>\n PLACING THE MEN ON THE BOARD.\n</p>\n<p>\n The rooks occupy the four corners of the board ; the knights stand\n next to these ; the bishops next to the knights ; the queens on D 1 and\n D 8 ; and the kings on E 1 and E 8. Thus, the pieces or officers, stand\n opposite each other respectively, at different sides of the board : the\n queens being on the squares of their own color, and the kings the con-\n trary. The row immediately in front of the officers is occupied by the\n pawns. The value of the men has been estimated as in the following\n proportion to each other : \u2014 the queen, 95 ; a rook, 60 ; a bishop, 39 ;\n a knight, the same as a bishop ; the king (estimated as a fighting\n piece) 26 ; a pawn, 8, or rather more, from its chance of promotion, by\n being moved to a square that entitles its player to exchange it for a\n queen, or any other piece he chooses to demand.\n</p>\n<p>\n LAWS OF THE GAME.\n</p>\n<p>\n 1. Each player marches his men forward, gradually, against those\n of the enemy, or retreats when the game is open behind them, except\n only as regards the pawns, which can only move forward. Each party\n moves alternately, one man at a time.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. In each game, the players have the first move alternately, except\n where one gives the other the advantage of a piece or a pawn ; in\n which case, the party by whom such piece or pawn is given is entitled\n to the first move.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. If you misplace your men at the beginning, and play four moves,\n your adversary may permit you to begin the game afresh, or no* as\n he pleases.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4. If you touch a man, you must play it, except it would discover\n</p>\n<p>\n check on your king ; in which case you can only move the king, if it\n be practicable. When you have taken your hand from your man, he\n must remain where he is ; but as long as you keep hold of him, you\n are at liberty to place him where you please, though you may have se\u00bb\n him-down upon a square. \u2713\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0326/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0326/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0326/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0326/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0326/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0326.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 464810}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"326\">\n<p>\n 5.

The modes of extricating the\n king from check aie as follow : \u2014 If the man that checks him be in an\n adjacent square, the king may take such man if he be not guarded ;\n that is, if another man of his own color have it not in his power to\n move into the square in which the man is placed if he be removed from\n it ; since, in this case, the king would place himself in check again.\n For example, suppose the king in E 1 , and an enemy\u2019s pawn, advanced\n to D 2, give him check ; the king cannot take the pawn, if the enemy\n have another pawn, or a bishop in C 3 or E 3, or a rook or queen any-\n where in the open row D D, & c. The man that checks may also be\n taken by some other man, to whose attack he is open ; or a man\n may be placed between the king and the checking man (unless it be\n the knight) if there be a vacant square between them. Lastly, the\n king may he moved into another square which is not commanded by\n the adversary\u2019s pieces. The king is check-mated, and the game is lost,\n if he cannot extricate himself by either of these moves. A king can-\n not go into a square next the opposite king ; he cannot therefore give\n check ; because, in doing this, ne would go into check himself.\n</p>\n<p>\n Castling is allowed once in a game. It consists in moving the king\n two squares to the right or left, and bringing the rook on that side to\n the square adjoining the king on the other. Thus the king may be\n moved from El to G 1, and the rook brought from H 1 to F 1 ; or the\n king may be moved to C 1, and the rook from A 1 to D 1. For cast-\n ling, that side is preferable on which the king will be most secure from\n attack ; for this purpose the three pawns on F, G, H 2, are kept in re-\n serve, in order that he may retreat behind them ; it being generally\n stronger play to castle with the king\u2019s rook than thegueen\u2019s. Castling\n is not allowable when the king, or the rook, with which you would cas-\n tle, has been moved ; when the king is in check, or when the king\n must pass over a square in which he would be checked. Suppose the\n king would move from E 1 to G 1, he must pass over F 1. But, if\n there be a queen or rook of the enemy anywhere on the row F, as far\n as it is open ; or, in short, if F 1 be commanded by any one of the en-\n emy\u2019s men, the king cannot castle on that side, neither can he do so\n when there is a man between himself and the rook.\n</p>\n<p>\n GENERAL INSTRUCTIONS.\n</p>\n<p>\n If the king\u2019s pawn be advanced two squares, and the queen\u2019s one\n square, an opening is made both for the queen and the queen\u2019s bishop\n to the king\u2019s side of the board ; and the king\u2019s pawn cannot be taken,\n without the queen\u2019s pawn taking the adversary\u2019s man in turn, and sup-\n EE\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0328/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0328/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0328/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0328/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0328/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0328.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 484854}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"328\">\n<p>\n plying his place.

Af-\n ter the pawns are advanced a certain way, the knights may be brought\n forward, either to support them, or act upon the offensive.\n</p>\n<p>\n The plan of attack should be gradually formed from the commence-\n ment of the game, and each step taken should have a tendency to for-\n ward it, unless when it is necessary to thwart the plau of the adver-\n sary. The player must not suffer himself to be diverted from a well-\n concerted project by any collateral advantage ; for the taking of a\n pawn or piece may prove injurious when it leads to a deviation from\n the principal object. If your plan be discovered and frustrated, it is\n better to form a new one than to persevere in the old. Your plan should\n not only be concealed from your adversary, but you must also discover,\n if possible, what your adversary can do to counteract your moves. A\n plan may be most effectually concealed by excluding the queens and\n rooks, or by executing it through the agency of inferior pieces or pawns,\n or by masking the pieces intended to effect it behind men which are\n apparently indifferent. The skilful player, if his moves be calculated\n with precision, will sacrifice his most important pieces without hesita-\n tion, to mislead his antagonist, or, when necessary to the accomplish-\n ment of his plan ; nay, he will often do this intentionally, to lead his\n opponent into the hope of winning, and give his antagonist check-mate,\n when he fancies he has the game in his hands. It is far more com-\n mon for a player to conceal his purpose till it is out of his opponent\u2019s\n power to frustrate it, and then to pursue it openly. To give check\n without having it in your power to follow it up, is, in general, bad\n play. If your checking piece can immediately be repulsed, you lose a\n move ; never proceed to an attack therefore without good preparation ;\n and if your attack proceed well, do not suffer yourself to be drawn a-\n side after any bait that your antagonist may throw in your way.

Be not eager to take a pawn in front of your queen ; for, as\n your antagonist cannot take him, he is frequently a better protection\n than a man of your own. If you cannot save a piece, endeavor to take\n one of the enemy\u2019s ; or, by improving your situation, obtain a compen-\n sation for the loss.

The more valuable men should be guarded by those of inferior\n worth ; for, if your opponent guard his inferior piece by another infe-\n rior piece, you cannot employ your better piece to take your enemy\u2019s, as\n it would be lost. A far advanced pawn should be well guarcfed, for\n it is often indispensable to a check-mate, and may make a queen.\n</p>\n<p>\n Castling is not always advantageous, as from the confined situation\n in which it places the king, it sometimes (particularly when the ad-\n versary has his knights in play) prevents his escaping out of check. It\n is, however, possible to retain the power of doing so, and keep the re-\n quisite pawns in their places. For as long as you have it in your pow-\n er to castle, your opponent will be at a loss on which side to direct his\n attack ; when he has decided, and brought his main strength to bear\n on one side, you can frustrate his design by castling on the other. It is\n not always good play not to stir the three pawns in front of the king\n that has castled ; for liberty of moving may be necessary to get the\n king out of check. Crowd not your men too much together, as this\n restrains their movements. A man that cannot move is often worse\n than lost, by standing in the way. Endeavor to crowd your antago-\n nist ' s game, in which you may succeed, if he bring out his pieces too\n early, by driving them back with your pawns. Endeavor to open your\n game by exchanging men in those parts where you want room, if you\n get unintentionally crowded.\n</p>\n<p>\n Never make a move without examining whether you be endangered\n by the last move of your antagonist ; nor without calculating whether\n it will allow your enemy to harm you by his next. Beware of your en-\n emy\u2019s knights, as they command different squares at once in a peculiar\n way. If a knight command the square of a queen or rook, at tne same\n time that he gives check, the piece must be lost unless the knight can\n 1 e taken ; to avoid this, which is called forking, when a knight is near,\n a good piece should never be kept on a square of the same color as that\n c ecu pied by your king.

It was\n reserved however for the present century to lay this down on a general\n plan ; and the only English writer who has noticed this, is Mr. George\n Walker, in his \u201cTreatise on Chess.\u201d The plan is this: \u2014 Let the\n knight be placed on any square, and move him from square to square,\n on the principle of always playing him to that point, from which, in\n actual play, he would command the fewest other squares. Observing,\n that in reckoning the squares commanded by him you must omit such\n as he has already covered. If too there are two squares, on both of\n which his powers would be equal, you may move him to either. Try\n this on the board with some counters or wafers, placing one on every\n square ; and, when you clearly understand it, you may astonish your\n friends by inviting them to station the knight on any square they like,\n and engaging to play him, from that square, over the remaining sixty-\n three in sixty-three moves. When the Automaton Chess-player was\n last exhibited in England, this was made part of the wonders he ac-\n complished, though as the above plan was not then known here, he\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0337/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0337/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0337/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0337/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0337/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0337.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 404354}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"337\">\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n CHESS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 34 ?\n</p>\n<p>\n could not adopt it, but\n used something like\n the method laid down\n by Euler, and which\n we subjoin.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our young Chess-\n player\u2019s instructor in\n the game will show\n him that as this is a\n re-entering series of\n numbers, or intermin-\n able route, it does not\n matter on which of\n the squares theknight\n is placed at starting ,\n as, by acquiring the\n plan by heart, which\n is soon done, he can\n play him over all the\n squares from any giv-\n en point, his last\n square being at the\n distance of a knight\u2019s\n move from his first.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is obvious that this\n</p>\n<p>\n route may be varied many ways, and we have often amused ourselves\n by trying to work it on a slate.\n</p>\n<p>\n DOUBLE GAME OF CHESS.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Double game of Chess, said to have been invented by Mr. C.\n H.

Our duty\n rather than our incination now urges us to conclude. Fain would we\n have added a few rich and racy anecdotes of chess-playing, before we\n closed, but our limits will not allow it. Willingly would we have spo-\n ken of that famous kin^, who made his castle court a chess field, on\n which the pieces played were living squires, some attired in murrey\n and cloth of gold, others in costly vests of ethereal blue, powdered\n with silver stars. While knights, armed cap-a-pi > d, gorgeous as for\n a tournament, pranced over the checquers, at the bidding of the king\n and his rival in the game, who governed the moves of that splendid\n field from a canopied balcony above.\n</p>\n<p>\n We should not have forgotten that irascible scion of royalty, in the\n olden time, who, when beaten by his brother, took up the massive chess\n board, and, most unfraternally, broke his victor\u2019s head. Nor that man,\n who, by often playing with a hot and testy master, knew his tempera-\n ment so well, that the instant he made a check-mate move, he flew\n like an arrow from the room, to save his sconce from a similar fate to\n that of the royal player, to whom we have just alluded. Nor, to that\n great individual, who, being under sentence of death, received a pe-\n remptory summons to the fatal block, when playing a game of chess,\n and begged that the officer who came to leaa him to his doom would\n bear witness that he had the best of the game.\n</p>\n<p>\n Had we \u201c ample scope and verge enough,\u201d we would, with a surpas-\n sing pleasure \u2014 to ourselves at least, if not to our readers \u2014 relate the\n mode and manner of our own acquirement of the game. It was under\n the tall and stately elms of Gray\u2019s Inn Gardens where we first learnt\n to know what check and check-mate meant. Many a night and oft\n have we, then just emerging from our boyhood, glided forth through a\n private gateway into that quiet place, and spreading our board upon the\n grass, played by the light of a full summer moon, until the world, and\n all that moved upon it, except the kings, the queens, the knights,\n and those \u201c stout men at arms,\u201d on the pigmy field beneath us, were\n forgotten. Our tutor in the game was a fellow-student of that science\n which grave professors teach in all the inns of court.

The answer is, It is a matter of habit. Habit alone\n teaches us that the sensations of sight correspond to any thing\n external, and shows to what they correspond. Thus, place a\n wafer on a table before you ; direct your eyes to it, that is, bring\n its image on both retinae to those parts which habit has ascer-\n tained to be the most sensible and best situated for seeing dis-\n tinctly, and you will see only the single wafer. But, while\n looking at the wafer, squeeze the upper part of one eye down-\n wards by pressing on the eyelid with the finger, and thereby\n forcibly throw the image on another part of the retina of that\n eye, and double vision will be immediately produced ; that is,\n two wafers will be distinctly seen, which will appear to recede\n from each other as the pressure is stronger, and approach, and\n finally blend into one, as it is relieved. The same effect may\n be produced without pressure, by directing the eyes to a point\n nearer to or farther from them than the wafer ; the optic axes, in\n this case, being both directed away from the object seen.\n</p>\n<p>\n TWO OBJECTS SEEN AS ONE.\n</p>\n<p>\n On a sheet of black paper, or other dark ground, place two\n white wafers, having their centres three inches distant.

In this situation close the left eye, and\n look full with the right perpendicularly at the wafer below it,\n when this wafer only will be seen, the other being completely\n invisible.

When the\n eyes are close to the falling drops, each eye sees its appropriate\n rainbow ; and four rainbows are perceived at the same time, par-\n ticularly if the floor of the room is of a dark colour.

Draw a violin bow along any part of the edges, and as\n the sand upon the glass is made to vibrate, it will form various\n figures, which will be accurately imitated by the sand upon the\n paper ; or if a violin or flute be played within a few inches of\n the paper, they will cause the sand upon its surface to form\n regular lines and figures.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0400/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0400/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0400/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0400/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0400/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0400.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 423160}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"400\">\n<p>\n SIGHT AND SOUND.\n</p>\n<p>\n TRANSMITTED VIBRATION.\n</p>\n<p>\n Provide a long, flat glass ruler or rod, as in the engraving, and\n cement it with mastic to the edge of a drinking-glass fixed into a\n wooden stand ; support the other end of the rod very lightly on a\n</p>\n<p>\n piece of cork, and strew\n its upper surface with\n sand ; set the glass in vi-\n bration by a bow, at a\n point opposite where the rod meets it, and the motions will be\n communicated to the rod without any change in their direction.\n If the apparatus be inverted, and sand be strewed on the under\n side of the rod, the figures will be seen to correspond with those\n produced on the upper surface.\n</p>\n<p>\n DOUBLE VIBRATION.\n</p>\n<p>\n Provide two discs of metal or glass, precisely of the same di-\n mensions, and a glass or metal rod ; cement the two discs at their\n centres to the two ends of the rod, as in\n the engraving, and strew their upper sur-\n faces with sand.

Although the voice does not actually come from that\n region, in order to enable the ventriloquist to utter sounds from\n the larynx without moving the muscles of his face, he strengthens\n them by a powerful action of the abdominal muscles. Hence, he\n speaks by means of his stomach ; although the throat is the real\n source from whence the sound proceeds. It should, however, be\n added, that this speaking distinctly, without any movement of the\n lips at all, is the highest perfection of ventriloquism, and has but\n rarely been attained. Thus, MM. St. Gille and Louis Brabant,\n two celebrated French ventriloquists, appeared to be absolutely\n mute while exercising their art, and no change in their counte\n nances could be discovered.\n</p>\n<p>\n It has lately been shown, that some ventriloquists have acquired\n by practice the power of exercising the veil of the palate in such a\n manner, that, by raising or depressing it, they dilate or contract\n the inner nostrils.

This illusion will be greatly assisted by the voice being\n totally different in tone and character from that of the man from\n whom it really comes.

Thus, each of these artists has succeeded\n in carrying on a dialogue ; and each, in his own single person\n $nd with his own single voice, has represented a scene appa*\n rently with several actors.

The spoon\n being then let down through the mouth of a bottle, the circular\n piece of lead rests upon and stops the mouth.\n</p>\n<p>\n WHAT IS STEAMl\n</p>\n<p>\n Invert a glass goblet over a cup of hot water, when the vapour\n or steam will be seen to rise in it, to condense upon the cold glass,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0442/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0442/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0442/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0442/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0442/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0442.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 409559}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"442\">\n<p>\n 104 GAS AND STEAM.\n</p>\n<p>\n and then to run down its inside ; thus showing that steam is va-\n porized water, and will, when the heat is abstracted from it,\n become water again.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE STEAM-ENGINE SIMPLIFIED.\n</p>\n<p>\n The steam-engine is much more intelligible than its name at\n first suggests.

Provide a test tube, put into it a little water, hold the\n thumb over the mouth, and cause the water to boil by holding it\n over a spirit-lamp. There will soon be felt a pressure against\n the thumb ; when, if the tube be dipped into cold water, the\n thumb being still held at the end, a kind of suction will be felt\n against it. Now, the tube resembles the cylinder of the steam-\n engine, in which the piston moves up and down ; to imitate\n which, wrap a little tow about the end of a piece of stick, ' grease\n it with tallow, and fit it moderately tight into the tube; when\n the water is made to boil, the stick will be raised, and when the\n end is dipped into cold water, the stick will fall as the piston\n rises and falls in the cylinder.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO BOIL WATER BY STEAM.\n</p>\n<p>\n Nearly fill a retort with water, and boil it over a lamp ; then\n immerse the beak into a tumbler of cold water, and the disengaged\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0443/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0443/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0443/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0443/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0443/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0443.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 372591}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"443\">\n<p>\n G-AS AND STEAM.\n</p>\n<p>\n 105\n</p>\n<p>\n steam will raise the water to the boiling temperature, though it\n be at a distance from the source of heat.\n</p>\n<p>\n DISTILLATION IN MINIATURE.\n</p>\n<p>\n Fill a kettle with water, and set it on the fire ; fix a long metal\n tube to the spout, and as soon as the water boils, the steam will\n pass into the tube, and being condensed into water, will drip at\n the other end of the tube, which corresponds with the worm in\n the still ; it soon, however, becomes as hot as the water, and\n then the condensation will cease : but were the tube passed\n through cold water, as is the worm of the still in a tub, the\n whole water in the kettle might be boiled away, but reproduced\n in the tube, and collected from it without the loss of a drop.\n This simple process resembles distillation, and the kettle and\n tube the still.\n</p>\n<p>\n CANDLE OR FIRE CRACKERS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Provide a number of little glass bulbs, put into each a drop of\n water, and seal it up ; if it then be put into the flame of a candle,\n or the fire, the heat will soon convert the water into steam, and\n cause the bulb to burst with a loud report.\n</p>\n<p>\n STEAM FROM THE KETTLE.\n</p>\n<p>\n Observe attentively the steam that escapes from the spout of\n a tea-kettle at the moment the water begins to boil, and you will\n perceive the steam to be condensed in minute drops on the inte-\n rior edges of the spout.

Hence, if the discs were to be separated (their surfaces\n remaining parallel) with a velocity as great as that of the air\n blast, a column of air must meanwhile be interposed, sixty-four\n times greater than that which would escape from the tube during\n the interim ; consequently, if all the air necessary to preserve\n the balance be supplied from the tube, the discs must be separated\n with a velocity as much less than that of the blast, as the column\n required between them is greater than that yielded by the lube,,\n and yet the air cannot be supplied from any other source, unless\n</p>\n<p>\n 9\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0466/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0466/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0466/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0466/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0466/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0466.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 417163}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"466\">\n<p>\n 130\n</p>\n<p>\n FIRE, WATER, AND AIR.\n</p>\n<p>\n a deficit of pressure be created between the discs, unfavourable\n to their separation.\n</p>\n<p>\n It follows, then, that, under the circumstances in question, the\n discs cannot be made to move asunder with a velocity greater\n than one-sixty-fourth of that of the blast.

If the new moon happens\n in the morning, this day is taken into the account ; but if it hap-\n pens after noon, the following day is counted the first. The\n moon\u2019s age is to be multiplied by four and divided by five. The\n quotient must either be added to the hour which the shadow indi-\n cates on the sun-dial, and the sum will give the time sought; or\n subtract from the quotient the hour shown by the moon upon the\n dial, and the remainder will give the hour sought. The first is\n to be done when the shadow falls upon an hour of the afternoon,\n and the latter when it falls upon an hour of the forenoon. The\n following are examples :\n</p>\n<p>\n 1st. Suppose the moon to be ten days old, and the shade cast\n by the moon upon the sun-dial to be at half-past two ; or, that the\n shadow cast by the moon falls on the place at which the shadow\n cast by the sun stands at half-past two ; \u2014 what o\u2019clock was it\n then ? The answer is calculated as follows : \u2014 The moon\u2019s age,\n 10 days x 4 = 40 \\\u00b0 = 8. Eight, therefore, is the time when\n the moon was in the meridian, and 8 + 2 \u00b1 \u2014 10^, or half-past\n ten, the hour sought.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2d. Suppose the moon to have been 18 days old, and the\n shadow cast by it on the sun-dial to have marked eleven. This\n time is subtracted from the hour when the moon was in the\n meridian on that day, and from which the hour marked by tha\n shadow must be deducted. The shadow shows here 11 o\u2019clock\n in the forenoon, or one hour before noon, which, deducted from\n 2h. 24m. gives lh. 24m. ; 2| \u2014 1 = If, or 24 minutes past one\n o\u2019clock.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0509/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0509/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0509/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0509/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0509/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0509.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 387580}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"509\">\n<p>\n THE PHYSIOGNOTYPE,\n</p>\n<p>\n MELANGE\n</p>\n<p>\n 177\n</p>\n<p>\n This is a newly invented instrument, by the aid of which a\n person may have a plaster cast of his face taken without submit-\n ting to the usual unpleasant process.\n</p>\n<p>\n It consists of an assemblage of very fine movable wires, con-\n fined closely together within a broad hoop or band, after the\n</p>\n<p>\n manner of the bristles in a\n telescope hearth-brush, but\n not closed at the back, in\n order to allow to the wires a\n free passage.

Thus, provide two glasses, one containing water at\n 58 degrees, and the other at 210 degrees ; place raspings of cam-\n phor upon each at the same time ; the camphor in the first glass\n will rotate for about five hours, until all but a very minute portion\n has evaporated, while the rotation of the camphor in the hot water\n will last only nineteen minutes ; about half the camphor will pass\n off, and the remaining pieces, instead of being dull, white, and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0514/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0514/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0514/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0514/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0514/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0514.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 427654}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"514\">\n<p>\n MELANGE.\n</p>\n<p>\n opaque, will be vitreous and transparent, and evidently soaked with\n water.

The first requisite was that the vessel be extremely\n thin, so that the figures to be formed might be sufficiently clear\n and perceptible. After the vessel has been baked, the figures,\n which were mostly fish, (as those were most appropriate with\n the water,) were formed on the inside ; and, after the colour had\n dried, a second extremely thin coat, of the same substance as that\n of which the vessel was constructed, was laid on the inside and\n varnished.

They will have the hap-\n piness of seeing those they love so dearly become robust, har-\n dy, and full of spirits, instead of being nervous, headachy, and\n spiritless beings ; for there is not a single exercise in the book\n that can really be called dangerous.

Where there is a covered play-ground\n for the winter, these Exercises are the best amusement imag-\n inable, and will render the pupils hardy, healthy and cheerful,\n without unnecessarily exposing them to the inclemency of the\n weather. The Author would suggest that one or more Cap-\n tains or Leaders be chosen trom among the boys of a school\n by the boys themselves, who, with the Manual for their guide\n shall carry them through the various exercises.

Remark \u2014 when in\n crossing, the right leg goes over the left, you must turn your\n body to the right side, and when in crossing, the left leg goes\n over the right, turn the body to the left side.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0621/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0621/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0621/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0621/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0621/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0621.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 313338}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"621\">\n<p>\n ROOK OF GYMNASTICS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 97\n</p>\n<p>\n 1S6.

Every muscle is provided with an adver-\n sary ; they act like two sawyers in a pit, by an opposite pull,\n and what is most remarkable is, that they are almost univer-\n sally so disposed as not to obstruct or to interfere with each\n other\u2019s action. Now, when we reflect upon the number of\n muscles, little short of five hundred known and named, \u2014 how\n near they lie to each other, in layers as it were, one over ano-\n ther, crossing each other, sometimes embedded in each other,\n sometimes perforating each other, yet all having their perfect\n liberty and full play, we are struck with astonishment at the\n wisdom of the arrangement.

Such\n are the general arrangements of a gymnasium, but before the\n youth enters upon regular exercises, he may commence with\n a few preliminary ones.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0679/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 275, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 357}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0679/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 715}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0679/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1102, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1430}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0679/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2204, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2860}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0679/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0679.jp2", "height": 2860, "width": 2204, "levels": 6, "size": 315204}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"679\">\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n BOOK OF GYMNASTICS, 155\n</p>\n<p>\n FIRST COURSE.\n</p>\n<p>\n Exercise 1 .

When\n springing, the height of the leap must be calculated, the breath\n held, the body pressed forward, and the fall should be upon\n the toes and the ball of the foot, although in an extended leap\n 14\n</p>\n<p>\n L\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0686/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 270, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 354}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0686/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 540, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 709}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0686/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1080, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1419}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0686/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2839}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:ke:xt:en:00:un:se:boysownbookexten00unse:boysownbookexten00unse_0686/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/ke/xt/en/00/un/se/boysownbookexten00unse/boysownbookexten00unse_0686.jp2", "height": 2839, "width": 2161, "levels": 6, "size": 403016}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"686\">\n<p>\n 162 faul preston\u2019s\n</p>\n<p>\n this is impossible.
