It is\n not the purpose here to picture those things and hold up the\n church to ridicule; nor even name them by name, except so\n far as it becomes absolutely necessary to call attention to\n them in the discussion which shall follow.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, there are some things in the churches which are\n visible to a blind man.

I believe we have a host of men in busi\u00ac\n ness enterprises whose efforts are conducted on the most\n conscientious plans, and who frown on the unprincipled\n efforts employed by many. Money is no sin per se. Riches\n are not condemned.

Money getting whets the appetite for more money.\n</p>\n<p>\n It creates an insatiable desire for more. It is the incuba\u00ac\n tor of covetousness. Covetousness seldom makes people rich,\n but riches sharpen the greed for gain. Solomon\u2019s words con\u00ac\n tain the gist of the entire statement: \u201c He who loves money\n shall not be satisfied with it.\u201d \u201c Men have, and they covet;\n riches flow in upon them, and yet riches are the only things\n they are still looking after.\u201d While their desires are an\u00ac\n swered, their desires are enlarged. They come to believe\n that the chief end of their lives is to satisfy those desires.\n To that end they live; and if they should attempt to be reli\u00ac\n gious and go to church, they would go carrying a load of\n leather, or cloth, or crockery, or clocks, or mortgages, or\n bank-stocks on their backs with them into the sanctuary;\n and realizing that they have too great a burden of this kind\n to bear, they prefer many times to remain away with their\n load.\n</p>\n<p>\n III. Money getting throws open the flood-gates of tempta\u00ac\n tion.\n</p>\n<p>\n Paul puts it as he had observed it in his day: \u201cThey\n that will be rich fall into a temptation and a snare, and into\n many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown men in\n destruction and perdition.\u201d \u201cThey set their hearts upon\n the wealth of this world, and are resolved, right or wrong,\n they will have it,\u201d is the observation of Matthew Henry.\n Brother, the devil has lived in the world a good while, and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0037/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 282, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 446}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0037/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 565, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 892}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0037/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1131, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1785}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0037/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2262, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3570}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0037/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/wh/ya/re/so/fe/wm/en/in/00/qu/ee/whyaresofewmenin00quee/whyaresofewmenin00quee_0037.jp2", "height": 3570, "width": 2262, "levels": 6, "size": 400420}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"37\">\n<p>\n THE MONEY POWER.\n</p>\n<p>\n 15\n</p>\n<p>\n all this time he has been an ardent student of human nature,\n and when he sees which way the lusts of men carry them, he\n quickly baits his hook accordingly.

I\u2019ll tell you the\n reason. I do not believe it does woman justice. I am con\u00ac\n strained to believe, the average woman thinks, and reasons,\n and questions, as much as the average man. Why is woman\n \u201cnaturally better\u201d than man? Is it because she uses a\n dish-rag while he employs a muck-rake ? Is it because she\n rocks the cradle while he cultivates the soil ? Or, is it be\u00ac\n cause her life of activity is, chiefly, within the home, while\n his is in the world, away from the home?

The one is developed along the reli\u00ac\n gious and aesthetic, the other takes all of that for granted,\n and proceeds upon a life of investigation and discovery.

Her\n endowments are such as to enable her to rise to great heights\n of excellency, or descend to great depths of infamy.

If our women poisoned their bodies with\n alcohol and nicotine as our men do, and were as thoughtless\n and reckless in caring for their souls as our men are, and\n if mothers should set such an example before their children\n as the great majority of them do, I firmly believe that the day\n would soon come when the race would become wrecked\n morally, mentally, physically.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0070/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 282, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 446}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0070/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 565, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 892}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0070/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1131, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1785}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0070/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2262, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3570}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0070/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/wh/ya/re/so/fe/wm/en/in/00/qu/ee/whyaresofewmenin00quee/whyaresofewmenin00quee_0070.jp2", "height": 3570, "width": 2262, "levels": 6, "size": 387165}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"70\">\n<p>\n 48\n</p>\n<p>\n TEN MINUTE CHAPTERS.\n</p>\n<p>\n CHAPTER IX.\n</p>\n<p>\n INTEMPERANCE.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Every inordinate cup is unblessed, and the ingredient\n is a devil,\u201d\u2014 Othello, Act //, Scene 2 .\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMen quite generally indulge in stimulants, or narcotics,\n or both, by which directly or indirectly their sensibilities are\n blunted, and, to a degree, their powers to respond to the\n higher motives impaired.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Fifty years ago less than four gallons of liquor per\n capita was consumed in the United States ; to-day it is twelve\n gallons per capita.

Besides, it is\n fair to presume that many have mistaken dreams and impres\u00ac\n sions for definite calls.

There\n is a reason for it, and a large one is, that many who go forth\n with such claims, have never been able to demonstrate the\n claim, and have added testimony to the Godless and virtue\u00ac\n less who are seeking for such illustrations. Such men add\n nothing to the cause they represent, except a stumbling\n stone, over which other men fall away from the church.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Ministers, too many, are not God\u2019s apostles ; they are too\n much, and too many, their own apostles.\u201d When a man goes\n claiming : \u201cThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me ; because the\n Lord hath annointed me to preach good tidings unto the\n meek; he hath sent me to bind up the broken-hearted, to\n proclaim liberty to the captives, and the opening of the\n prison to them that are bound; to proclaim the acceptable\n year of the Lord, and the day of vengeance of our God;\n to comfort all that mourn ; to appoint unto them that mourn\n in Zion, to give unto them beauty for ashes, the oil of joy for\n mourning, the garment of praise for the spirit of heaviness ;\n that they might be called trees of righteousness, the plant\u00ac\n ing of the Lord, that He might be glorified;\u201d going with\n such claims, the world expects such a man to be able to dem\u00ac\n onstrate his claim, and, if he cannot, he is put down as an\n impostor.

Why people do not tell the truth\n I cannot tell. All excuses are devil-born. The preacher,\n out of a heart that forbids offense, is as harmless as a dove,\n but fails to be as wise as the serpent. He accepts the\n excuses as gold coin. If he does not, he offends, and to\n offend is to be uncharitable. The people soon see their\n excuses are accepted, and they continue to stay away from\n church and offer excuses. The minister continues to accept\n them, and works a moral wrong against such members of his\n congregation. There is one way out of the difficulty: Quit\n accepting excuses.

Some professions are very empirical and demand\n all one\u2019s time and attention; in other professions leisure is\n enjoyed at stated intervals. About some are thrown demoral\u00ac\n izing agencies; about others, a purer and more exhilarating\n spirit. Almost all the professions and occupations are\n represented in the churches. And yet it is with amazement\n that one beholds the indifference with which the church is\n treated by some of the professions. However, the present\n age is in advance of all others regarding the attention\n received by the church from the men of various occupations.\n More professional men, men of skill and acumen, have\n found refuge in the Christian church in the last twenty-five\n years than in any similar period since the Cross was planted\n on Calvary.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe chief glory of any people,\u201d says Samuel Johnson,\n \u201carises from its authors.\u201d Mohammed, in his Tribute to\n Reason, says, \u201cThe ink of the scholar is more sacred than\n the blood of the martyr.\u201d This introduces us to authorship\n and authors. Through this profession a mighty gospel has\n been preached. It has been, chiefly, the gospel of humanity,\n which has enjoyed a graceful evolution. It has taught the\n divinity of reason and thought, and has drawn with it many\n disciples. While the church has burdened its people with\n the yoke of faith and works, authorship has burdened the\n world with the yoke of free thought and humanitarianism.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0087/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 282, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 446}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0087/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 565, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 892}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0087/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1131, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1785}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0087/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2262, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3570}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0087/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/wh/ya/re/so/fe/wm/en/in/00/qu/ee/whyaresofewmenin00quee/whyaresofewmenin00quee_0087.jp2", "height": 3570, "width": 2262, "levels": 6, "size": 439932}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"87\">\n<p>\n SOME OF THE PROFESSIONS.\n</p>\n<p>\n 65\n</p>\n<p>\n Without farther argument, what is the result? Its effect\n upon the world has been visible. The printing press has\n made it possible to reach vast numbers at a reasonable\n expense. One book often reaches many people, and many\n books reach a multitude; so that the author becomes a\n teacher in a large district, with possibilities circumscribed\n only by the world\u2019s circumference. As a rule these books\n are very refreshing and out of the many authors it is not\n difficult to choose to your liking. And instead of listening\n to the prosy preachers on Sundays it becomes a pleasure to\n stay at home and enjoy the author of one\u2019s own choosing.\n But authors themselves are not unmindful of this same\n privilege and they too neglect the church and its blessings.\n Many of them are men of the world whose god is reason ;\n many are semi-religious ; while the consecration of many\n others to the church and its gospel is worthy of remembrance.\n The nineteenth century has seen a wonderful revival along\n this line. Its greatest authors have been Christian men\n paying tribute to the virtues of the Christian religion. Most\n authors of repute are now members of some evangelic body.\n But to-day competing interests among publishers have made\n books very cheap, and private libraries of select volumes a\n possibility to the many. Particularly so is this of fiction.\n The entrancing story is taken from the shelf on Sunday and\n enjoyed amid the sanctities of undisturbed hours while wife\n and children have gone to Sunday-school and church services.\n</p>\n<p>\n My attention is next drawn to journalism, which has\n come to be one of the most important professions in civilized\n life. There are about 20,000 journals published in the world,\n one-half of which are issued in the United States alone. Of\n this 10,000, one thousand are dailies. News for the daily\n press twenty-four hours old is stale. Everything must be\n fresh and sensational; if not, it is rejected, or accepted\n simply as filling.

Business men make special\n efforts to reach the eye of the public by giving special\n advertisements for the Sunday issue. Boys are inveigled\n away from home, Sunday-school and church influences to go\n upon the streets and sell the special Sunday edition. Men\n fall back in their easy chairs and read the sensational news\n until it is too late to get ready for church.

I shall not deny that\n many of the most reputable orders tend to make men good\n citizens and render much needed charity within their mem\u00ac\n bership, but that they make men good Christians may be\n justly called in question. I have heard it repeatedly that a\n man cannot be a good Mason and not be a Christian, but\n facts deny the assertion. This order is not an exception. I\n only use it as an example. In all my observation I am ready\n to say that, as a rule, the most devoted secret society workers\n are the poorest examples for Christians; and, adding to this\n observation, I note that the best Christians make the poorest\n secret order workers. Is this true ? If so, and I believe it to\n be, then there is something between the church and the order,\n written or unwritten, that serves to produce the above result.\n I fear, and I speak candidly, that the operations of the\n order, when men devote themselves to it, are such as to insin\u00ac\n uate a spirit of alienation into its devotees, and, hence, to\n draw them from our Holy Communion, established and made\n sacred by the life and example of the despised and rejected\n Nazarene.

The criticism upon the church is severe enough.\n Indeed, we have made our religion subject to reproach and\n infidelity, because we have drawn our skirts about us and\n abandoned the poor and suffering as unworthy of our atten\u00ac\n tion. Men have said to themselves: \u201cThe church won\u2019t\n take care of me if I become sick, poor or disabled, and many\n suffer for want of attention when in straightened circum\u00ac\n stances.

All this the church\n might do and could do, upon some practical basis, but the\n church does not do it except upon an exceedingly limited\n scale. Men are practical in their thinking, and they see the\n order is practical in its operations, and looking mostly to the\n material side of life and its advantages, they choose the\n order, and the church is, at least nominally, abandoned.\n Shall we blame the men ? Condemn the order ? Or, criticise\n the church ? Whatever you do, be charitable, but note the\n fact \u2014 that the men cling to the order more closely\n than to the church. The order is here to stay; so is the\n church ; and the supporters of the one may become the sup\u00ac\n porters of the other.

No man offers excuse\n but that he has either done wrong, or else to keep his deeds\n from being construed in a wrong light. In either case, guilt\n attaches. In the first instance because of the wrong done;\n in the second instance, because he did not \u201c avoid the\n appearance of evil.\u201d All excuses are devil-born. They are\n far from being righteous. The Tord, in his promise to\n defend his children, never once promised to justify their\n excuses. He could not. Once he came and made a review of\n all peoples in all lands, but found. \u201cThey are all gone\n aside, they are altogether become filthy : there is none that\n doeth good, no, not one.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It is said of the distinguished naturalist, George Cuvier,\n that a fragment of a bone enabled him, in thought, to read in\n it the size, age, habits, specific characteristics of the animal\n to which it belonged. As nothing is hid from God, no diffi\u00ac\n culties are too great for Him and no self-protection is able to\n resist Him. And while some men are able to tell so much ' of\n the animal that lived ages ago, from a fragment of its bone,\n may it not be true that from a flimsy excuse, men under the\n direction of the Spirit of the Lord, are able, in thought, to\n read the size, habits, specific characteristics of the men who\n made the excuses ?\n</p>\n<p>\n It is often difficult to detect the unreasonableness of the\n excuses made by men for not being Christians, or members\n of some Christian church, or regular attendants upon stated\n services in the sanctuary. In the foregoing chapters I have\n endeavored to treat some of these excuses with all candor.\n Many other unsubstantial reasons have been offered why\n men absent themselves from worship.

But, when he has been permitted\n to enter the flood-gates of temptation, he ceases his devotion\n and finds more pleasure in other things. I believe that men,\n in their acquired habits of sin, are more numerous than\n women. Being so, they begin to make excuse. They forget\n their responsibility, and there is coming a time when they\n will be unable to find a scape-goat upon which they may\n saddle their apologies. \u201c What wilt thou say when He shall\n punish thee ?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Self-justification is an old theme and an old sin. It is\n believed by many to be right, but it is forever wrong. The\n first gospel to be preached to such an one is: \u201cLet a man\n examine himself.\u201d Oh, the beholdings in a self-examina\u00ac\n tion !

It implies that \u201cindifference\u201d is the\n principle reason for the absence of men from the church.\n The virtues and dangers of such a remedy may not appear on\n the face of it. It does not believe in the laws of the Medes\n and Persians, but is an antidote of flexibility. It would seem\n < to suggest the thought of self-examination, and then\n from the nature of the disease act according to your own\n judgment. It gives the church the liberty of self-judgment,\n self-justification, or self-correction. It gives it the liberty to\n employ foreign aid and foreign antidotes. It can choose its\n physician, its medicine, its nurse, one or all.\n</p>\n<p>\n One great trouble attaches to this remedy: The sick may\n be able to locate the pain without knowing what the disease\n is ; in which case his judgment of selection is more apt to\n be at fault than otherwise, and the wrong remedy would be\n employed with, perhaps, fatal results.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. Men are usually employed in business efforts where\n business principles are a necessity.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the church business principles are overlooked too\n much of the time. The books are not properly kept, or per\u00ac\n haps not- kept at all. The result is, if anyone desires to re\u00ac\n view the work of the church, and go to the books for records\n and accounts, he leaves it without knowing any more than\n he did before going ; and, it may be, goes away troubled with\n the question: \u201cI wonder what became of all their funds;\n and were they employed honestly?\u201d This question is timely\n and very pertinent.

Every\n local church should keep a full and correct record of all its\n proceedings. Accusations of looseness, dishonesty, or un\u00ac\n principled business cannot then be sustained, and the church\n has gained prestige and honor, all of which is admirable to\n men.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. i( Such a unity between different churches or denomi\u00ac\n nations as that will cause half or two-thirds of the churches to\n be wiped out.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n I am not going to give too much credence to this remedy;\n for it is a question that is debatable. Are there too many\n churches? In some communities this accusation is sustained\n beyond question. In other communities there are not enough,\n and in many communnities there are none. This is true in\n our own country. Interdenominational unity is increasing\n and so far as it is true it is presenting a favorable impression.\n Denominational unity deserves increase, as well, also, as\n local church unity.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0148/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 282, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 446}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0148/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 565, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 892}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0148/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1131, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1785}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0148/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2262, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3570}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0148/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/wh/ya/re/so/fe/wm/en/in/00/qu/ee/whyaresofewmenin00quee/whyaresofewmenin00quee_0148.jp2", "height": 3570, "width": 2262, "levels": 6, "size": 375488}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"148\">\n<p>\n 126\n</p>\n<p>\n TEN MINUTE CHAPTERS.\n</p>\n<p>\n We do make distinctions in Protestant churches such as\n do not obtain in Catholic parishes.

Still another remedy of the club sort is found in\n monthly meetings for men only :\n</p>\n<p>\n Such as James B. Gregg, D. D., of Colorado Springs,\n described in the Advance of July 14, 1892. He observed:\n \u201cThat, while the women of our churches have a great many\n opportunities for getting together socially, very inadequate\n provision is made for the men in that regard. Indeed, for\n the most part, no provision is made at all. There is, of\n course, the prayer meeting, and the church social, but these\n are meetings for both sexes. But women like to get together\n as women, and men perhaps even more like to get together\n as men, as witness the many clubs and lodges and secular\n societies of various sorts to which men only are eligible.\n Now in the church the women have their sewing society, and\n commonly their missionary society, and often their woman\u2019s\n prayer meeting. But the men in a church rarely have any\n organization in which they can come together as masculine\n beings for wholly virile converse.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n To meet this felt want he organized what he called the\n \u201cMen\u2019s Monday Evening Club.\u201d \u201cIt was open to all male\n members of the congregation old enough to be interested in\n its proceedings. A trifling fee of fifty cents, which served to\n buy a record book and postals for notification of the meetings\n for the two winters of the club\u2019s existence, constituted the\n expenses incurred. A brief constitution was drawn up, and\n</p>\n<p>\n 9\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0152/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 282, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 446}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0152/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 565, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 892}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0152/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1131, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1785}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0152/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2262, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3570}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:wh:ya:re:so:fe:wm:en:in:00:qu:ee:whyaresofewmenin00quee:whyaresofewmenin00quee_0152/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/wh/ya/re/so/fe/wm/en/in/00/qu/ee/whyaresofewmenin00quee/whyaresofewmenin00quee_0152.jp2", "height": 3570, "width": 2262, "levels": 6, "size": 456995}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"152\">\n<p>\n 130\n</p>\n<p>\n TEN MINUTE CHAPTERS.\n</p>\n<p>\n a president, and secretary, and treasurer, and executive com\u00ac\n mittee were elected.

That men draw, entice, inveigle,\n persuade, scorn, seduce, wheedle and use every discoverable\n craft, to draw men into crime, is too familiar to every candid\n and honest mind to be gainsaid.

Our business is to teach\n them how to think, for if we can make them think right, we\n need not worry ourselves about their living right. That is\n what God says. Remember the fifty-fifth of Isaiah, \u2018 My\n thoughts are not your thoughts, neither are my ways your\n ways, saith the Lord. \u2019 That is to say, if we thought as God\n thinks, we should walk as God walks.\u2019\u2019 And then he\n remodels the foregoing couplet:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cA boy must eat, and a boy must drink,\n</p>\n<p>\n And a boy must play each day ;\n</p>\n<p>\n For a boy will work, and a boy will think,\n</p>\n<p>\n For a boy is built that way.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n But his thinking must be directed. The philanthropic\n old colored preacher said to his audience : \u201cDe Bible says,\n deah breddern, dat ef yo\u2019 bring up a chile in de way he\n should go, wen he\u2019s old he will not depart frum it; an\u2019 I mote\n add dat de same rule holds good, only in a stronger fashion,\n wen yo\u2019 bring him up in de way dat he shouldn\u2019t go.\u201d We\n are to direct the thinking of the boy. As long as a boy\n thinks right he\u2019ll go right. Right thinking: right living;\n right results; a glorious immortality. \u201cAs a man thinketh\n in his heart, so is he.\u201d Save the boy!

As men are compelled\n into saloons, gambling places, and evil resorts by urgent\n invitations, over persuasions, intimidations, and cunning\n craft, we should show no less skill and zeal in drawing men\n into Christian activities. With the speed of an hart men\n rush into sin ; with the leisure and indifference of the snail\n men come crawling and sneaking out of sin with shame\u00ac\n facedness and remorse. I have often wondered why, and do\n not know, unless it is because of a natural tendency of human\n nature. It is the common experience of Christian workers,\n that men are, with great difficulty, persuaded to make an\n inward, experimental trial of the goodness of God. They\n can not know unless they taste for themselves. By tasting\n they may see. It is like Jonathan\u2019s honey, enlightens\n the eyes. When a man is real hungry, a look at the table\n only enrages his appetite. He may hear others tell of the\n splendid dinner, but that simply increases his hunger. He\n may touch the bread with his hands and scent the steaming\n pudding only to madden his appetite. Nothing but \u201ctaste\n and see \u2019\u2019 will satisfy that hunger.

Indeed, so general has its use\n become that they appear with almost every dish in Italy,\n and the use of them is rapidly increasing in different\n countries.

What is the use of con\u00ac\n secrating the altar if we do not consecrate the sacrifice ; or\n even a house of worship if the members of the congregation\n are not consecrated ? Devotion to principle draws men to\n that principle. If there is no principle involved in Christian\n living there is nothing to be consecrated to. Many of us\n live as if that were true, and hence our unceasing devotion\n to Christ is not a fact but a budget of cant. We do not lead\n men to Christ because we do not know the way; we can not\n point men to the Lamb of God because we do not know the\n direction.\n</p>\n<p>\n Much of our business is conducted as if Christian living\n should not enter the commercial circle. Ministers and\n missionaries are the only people who are expected to give a\n complete demonstration to the law of consecration. Many\n mistaken ideas are held concerning the employment of\n Christian principles in business. The merchant is just as\n much bound to sell for God, as the minister is to preach for\n him. \u201cYou have no more right to sell goods for the purpose\n of laying up money, than he has to preach the Gospel for\n the same purpose.\u201d \u201cYou are bound to be just as pious,\n and to aim as singly at the glory of God, in selling goods, as\n he is in preaching the Gospel. And thus you are as abso\u00ac\n lutely to give up your whole time for the service of God as\n he is. Kvery man should serve God in his calling.
