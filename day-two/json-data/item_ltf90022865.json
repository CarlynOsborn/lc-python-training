Kenilworth without its Caesar\u2019s Ivy and the\n romance thrown over it by Scott, would have little to\n excite enthusiasm; in Heidelburg Castle, history, art and\n architecture unite to form a picture in stone upon which\n the scholar, the poet, and the artist may never tire to\n linger.*\n</p>\n<p>\n As I am not writing a history, it will not answer for me\n to take the reader through the towers, some twenty feet\n thick, along the battlements, into balconies and subter-\n ranean vaults, under massive portals, through vast halls\n and corridors, beneath gateways leading into courts from\n which you see no egress, courts into which fair ladies in\n gold brocades looked down from their medallion-crowned\n windows upon their noble lords clad in glittering armor.\n Alas, what is glory! The very names of the mighty\n ones are unknown but to the antiquary and scholar.\n All that is mortal of them could be held in a baby\u2019s\n hand. Do not these crumbling stones, these Titanic walls\n men vainly thought to be impregnable, teach that only\n One is eternal? How forcibly do the meditations of\n Volney upon the plains of Syria, come to mind. He sits\n gazing upon the fallen pillars of Palmyra and exclaims :\n \u201c Good God ! from whence proceed such melancholy\n revolutions?

We had so lately left\n the rooms at Holyrood, once occupied by Mary Stuart,\n whose misfortunes will ever perpetuate her memory, that\n a memorial of her near descendant was invested with\n an interest it might not otherwise have claimed. Her\n marriage with Frederick was auspiciously celebrated at\n the court of her father, James I. of England.

Young, beautiful,\n gifted, surrounded with luxurious splendor, she might,\n but for her ambition, have here enjoyed as happy a life\n as mortal need attain. In an unfortunate hour the crown\n of Bohemia was offered her husband, who hesitated to\n accept it.

I have seen an excellent engraved\n representation of the ancient garden as it appeared in\n 1G20, which shows more beauty and elegance than that\n of to-day. The garden-terrace is a point much sought\n for by tourists; it constitutes a fine promenade, with a\n prospect of the most attractive part of the Castle. The\n entrance to the vault containing the renowned Heidelberg\n Tun, is a huge portal in the substructure of Frederick\u2019s\n palace ; as you descend the steps, you are watched by\n grand statues of the great ones of Germany, from that of\n Charlemagne to the last of the sixteen Electors.

There\n are, of course, disadvantages attendant upon this mode of\n travel, as there are in smaller parties, but they are reduced\n to a low maximum. To those unfamiliar with the Conti-\n nental languages, and who wish to have the greatest pos-\n sible amount of sight-seeing with the least expenditure of\n time and money, it is difficult to conceive how our advan-\n tages could be excelled. Dr. Tourjee and his coadjutors\n are tireless in their exertions to please ; no sinecure, when\n we consider the great number of their guests, with varied\n tastes, and the constitutional tendency of human nature\n to find fault. We realize that we command privileges that\n individual tourists would have to employ considerable\n finesse to obtain. I am sure there are hundreds of my\n countrywomen upon whom, like myself, the superintend-\n ence of the education of their children devolves, who\n would gladly avail themselves of the advantages of a trip\n from New York to Pompeii, were they assured it could be\n accomplished so safely, with entire exemption from con-\n ventional annoyances, and in the society of people of cul-\n ture, whose friendship will contribute to the happiness\n of life in all future years. Now and then I have been\n betrayed into expressions of discontent, at the seeming\n stoicism of some of our members ; but 1 should not forget\n that my own enthusiasm may be no less unpleasing to oth-\n ers; for there is some truth in the aphorism of Talleyrand,\n that nothing gives greater offence than the enthusiasm of\n zeal. As this book is mainly written for personal friends,\n I may be pardoned for entering a plea in justification of\n the deep feeling I have found it utterly impossible to\n withhold. This trip to Europe, which to many is a mat-\n ter of no more account than a morning ride by rail from\n New York to Philadelphia, was for me a life-dream\n realized.

Although\n there is little trace here of the classical purity of his later\n Madonnas, the modesty and sweetness of this face is un-\n rivalled. There is no introduction of the graces of\n the stately duchesses of Urbino ; it is studied from\n the genuine peasant girl, even to the large hands.\n The beauty of the mother is not shared by the child,\n which is only remarkable for the loveliness of its flesh\n</p>\n<p>\n tint almost redolent of the aroma emanating from the\n</p>\n<p>\n bosom of a lovely babe.

Our American millionaires, whose\n dwellings now in progress on the Pacific slope and in\n New York bid fair to surpass the abodes of royalty, can\n command no skill in Europe by which they can excel the\n elegance of these mural paintings.\n</p>\n<p>\n The walls of Pompeii have been traced on all sides but\n that facing the sea; they were from fifteen to twenty\n feet in thickness, and sufficiently formidable to keep out\n any foe save that which overwhelmed them. The city\n was entered by six gates. The \u201c Herculaneum Gate,\u201d\n which is nearest the sea, is the terminus of a road lined\n with tombs, many of which are seemingly as perfect as\n on the day they themselves were entombed. Here and\n there you see a tomb in the style often reproduced in our\n own cemeteries ; yet one wonders if the fondly-cherished\n memorials of our beloved dead, or those that reverent\n hands may rear over us, will have such tangible existence\n eighteen centuries hence.\n</p>\n<p>\n The site of Pompeii is nearly as commanding as that\n of Naples \u2014 originally on a plateau of lava, from prehis-\n toric eruptions, which rose above the sea, so near that\n every breeze from it swept through the streets and forum.\n Around you are all the natural features which made the\n region so celebrated in the days of Virgil.

From here we have a fine view of Mt.\n Pilatus. When w T e subsequently saw it from. Lucerne, it\n had the appearance of Mt. Ascutney, as seen in the Con-\n necticut Valley; but from this point it is much bolder.\n No two mountains, in such continuity as Pilatus and the\n Rigi, could be more unlike, unless it be Gerizim and Ebal,\n the mounts of blessing and cursing, in Palestine, as\n described in Deuteronomy. If there is a curse on Pila-\n tus from its having been the alleged residence of Pontius\n Pilate, to which to trace its bleak and frowning aspect,\n there is certainly a blessing on Regina Montium, Rigi, the\n \u201c Queen of Mountains. \u201d The legend tells that Pilate,\n after a wretched existence here, filled with remorse and\n despair, flung himself into the lake, which caused fearful\n storms to fall upon the city ol Lucerne. The wise magis-\n trates of that city made it a heavy penalty for any to\n pass over the lake or ascend the mountain. But the\n mantle of Luther had touched a minister of Lucerne.\n Gathering a band of followers, he sallied out in the year\n 1585 to exorcise the evil spirit ; they rowed their boat\n upon the lake, and boldly called upon Pilate to do his\n worst, throwing stones into the water at each appeal. If\n there was any doubting Thomas in that little craft, how\n his heart must have quaked with fear at the temerity of\n his fellows ! But the waters retained their placidity, and\n the evil spirit was dethroned. It is said, and probably\n with some truth, there are simple folk who yet believe in\n the power of Pilate, and see his dread shadow hovering\n over the moonlit lake. Even greater minds are not free\n fromr latent superstition. Miss Sedgwick, Avhom in our\n youth we looked upon as representing the best culture of\n the day, confessed that it made considerable difference to\n her whether she saw the new moon first over her right\n shoulder instead of her left.
