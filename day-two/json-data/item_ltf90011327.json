While the board were not willing, under all\n circumstances, to assume responsibility for any one of\n the Essays in all its points \u2014 they w ere unwilling that\n any one of them should be withheld from publication.\n Deepty interested as they themselves were in the perusal\n of the several articles, contemplating them separately\n and collectively, they were confident that a volume em-\n bodying, on one subject, such an amount of important\n discussion, such variety of argument, such diversity of\n style, and such general agreement in sentiment between\n the several writers located remotely from each other and\n having had no correspondence with one another in ref-\n erence to this subject \u2014 could not fail of proving h ighly\n gratifying and useful to all that portion of the Christian\n public w ' ho interest themselves in this subject.

Now, if this\n position be correct, no baptist can consistently com-\n mune with a Pedobaptist, since Baptists do not rec-\n ognize infant sprinkling as Christian baptism.

Is there such an inseparable connection\n between baptism and the Lord\u2019s supper, that the\n former is an indispensable prerequisite to the privi-\n legesof the latter? Is it required, under all circum-\n stances, that those who come to the table of the Lord\n shall have been previously baptized? From the\n promptness with which this inquiry has received an\n affirmative answer, and the care taken to maintain\n an invariable practice in the churches in accordance\n with it, it might be expected that we should be im-\n mediately pointed to the chapter and verse contain-\n ing the requirement. But no; not a precept of the\n kind can be found within the lids of the Bible. How\n is this to be accounted for? On the supposition that\n baptism is an indispensable condition to communion,\n the fact would be one of the most material subjects\n for precept in the two ordinances; yet Jesus did not\n mention it at the time he instituted the latter ordi-\n nance, nor at any other time. The apostles, in all\n their histories and epistles, in which are numerous\n detailed accounts of the two ordinances, are utterly\n silent respecting it. Under the Jewish dispensation\n none were admitted to the Passover unless they had\n been previously circumcised; and there we find an\n express precept directly in point. u No uncircum-\n cised person shall eat thereof.\u201d Ex. 12: 48. But\n there is no such precept respecting baptism and the\n communion.

They assert that\n baptism had the priority. Suppose this to be admit-\n ted, does it make one an indispensable condition to\n the other? By no means. Preaching was instituted\n prior to baptism, yet who ever thought that no one\n could be baptized, unless he had previously preach-\n ed? Hence, allowing that baptism was instituted\n previously to the institution of the Lord\u2019s supper,\n this proves nothing about any inseparable connection\n between them, or that one must in all cases precede\n the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n Again, to make this argument of any avail to our\n close communion brethren, it is incumbent on them\n to prove that every one of the disciples had received\n Christian baptism previously to the memorable night\n in which the Savior administered to them the em-\n blems of his body and blood; and even that could not\n authorize the position they take. But where is the\n evidence that such was the fact? John the forerun-\n ner of Christ did indeed baptize, and so did some of\n the twelve apostles; but this does not prove the\n point in question. We ask not for conjectures, sup-\n positions, or probabilities. Evidence to establish a\n position so important ought to be unequivocal.

This baptism took place under the Jewish dis-\n pensation. The Jewish dispensation continued in\n force till the death of Christ. Then the veil of the\n temple was rent in twain. Then the great sacrifice\n for sin was offered, and the typical sacrifices ceased.\n It was then that Christ blotted out the hand-writing\n of ordinances, that was against us, and took it out of\n the way, nailing it to the cross. Col. 2: 14. Our\n Savior lived under the old dispensation, and was a\n strict observer of the institutions of Moses; and all\n that was done in the church previous to his death be-\n longed properly to that dispensation. This certain-\n ly is strong presumptive evidence that the baptism of\n John was not a Christian ordinance.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c 2. Christian baptism originated in the express\n command of Christ: \u00a3 Go ye and teach all nations,\n baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of tho\n Son, and Holy Ghost. 5 No such origin can be claim-\n ed for the baptism of John, who baptized for some\n time before he knew Christ , John 1:31. He ascribes\n his commission to the Father, John 1 :33.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c 3. The baptism of John was evidently a prepar-\n atory ordinance. He came to c prepare the way of\n the Lord. 5 He preached to the people that the Mes-\n siah loas coming , and exhorted them to prepare to\n receive him; and in order that they might be pre-\n pared, called them to repentance and baptism.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c 4. One part of the design of John\u2019s baptism, as\n stated by himself, shows it to have been entirely dis-\n tinct from Christian baptism: \u201c That he (Christ)\n should be made manifest to Israel, therefore am I\n come baptizing with water, 55 John 1 :31.

One argument more is all that it will be ne-\n cessary to examine on this point.

Plainly this, that there\n is not a regular gospel church, or a regular gospel\n minister on earth, out of the Baptist pale t This is\n no misrepresentation. The conclusion is unavoida-\n ble from the premises assumed. The course of\n reasoning is this. Immersion is essential to baptism,\n consequently all Pedobaptists are unbaptized per-\n sons; and as baptism is essential to the regular visi-\n bility of a gospel church, none but Baptists can\n compose a regular gospel church. Hence accord-\n ing to this doctrine, every Methodist, Congregation-\n al, Presbyterian, and Episcopalian church in Chris-\n tendom is a nullity \u2014 nay more, an usurpation; all\n ordinations in such bodies are void, every act of\n church relation performed by them is an assumption\n of unauthorized prerogatives, and every time they\n commemorate the Savior\u2019s love by administering the\n sacrament, they profane that sacred ordinance.\n Such in plain, undisguised language, must be the\n sentiment of our close communion brethren, in or-\n der to be consistent with their practice. Such a po-\n sition should be carefully examined before it is tak-\n en by any one.

The church is the repre-\n sentative of Christ on earth, it is his body, compos-\n ed of his elect saints, and through it the authority of\n Christ flows ; the church then, under Christ, and in\n conformity to his will, has the sole right of deciding\n who are reputed believers, and thereby entitled to the\n sacramental elements. Analogy is in favor of this\n rule; for it is generally allowed to be the right of\n bodies to decide who are their members under the\n constitution that governs them, and who are entitled\n to any or all of their privileges. So each church,\n being an independent body under Christ, decides\n who are its members, and who shall be received to\n its communion service.

Is\n it rejoined here, that apart of John\u2019s mission was\n preaching repentance, and that the preaching of re-\n pentance is a part of the ministration of the Christian\n church, and that therefore baptism, another part of his\n ministry, may be also an ordinance of the Christain\n church? Answer; repentance is a doctrine common\n to God\u2019s ministry from the fall of Adam to the end of\n time. The preaching it, is the same thing in every\n age. It was common to the ministry of Noah, Moses,\n John Baptist, and St. Paul. But the building of the\n Ark was peculiar to Noah\u2019s time. The erection of\n the Tabernacle was peculiar to Moses\u2019 ministry.\n The baptism of repentance simply, was peculiar to\n John\u2019s mission and the course preparatory to the in-\n stitution of the ordinances of the Christian church.\n And with the ministration of the Lord\u2019s supper, as\n practiced by St. Paul, Noah, nor Moses, nor John\n Baptist, had aught to do.

Such an\n one, does not, in the symbolical elements, \u201cdiscern\n the Lord\u2019s body.\u201d The rightful participant dis-\n cerns it by faith, saving faith. He that hath not\n faith, cannot, therefore, discern it. And without\n this, (faith,) all other attainments will not make a\n fit communicant. With faith and its legitimate\n fruits, and with nothing else, he is qualified. It ap-\n pears that some in the Corinthian church, in St.\n Paul\u2019s day, were so destitute of faith in Christ, and\n knowledge of the nature and design of the institu-\n tion, that they perverted the Lord\u2019s supper to an oc-\n casion for carnal indulgence, even to gluttony and\n drunkenness.

there is none more re-\n volting and more heart-rending than that which relates to\n the symbols of the death of our common Savior. We in-\n stinctively shrink with horror from such unnatural chil-\n dren as can quarrel over the body of a deceased parent.\n And has it become needful for the members of Christ to\n contend over his body and his blood ? I would not inti-\n mate that there are not instances in which Christians should\n contend for the doctrine on this subject which they be-\n lieve to be true, but I do affirm most unhesitatingly, that,\n if the spotless Gabriel, while disputing merely about the\n body of Moses, durst not bring against even the devil, a\n railing accusation, much less should a fallible Christian,\n when disputing about the body and blood of his Lord,\n dare to bring a railing accusation against his brother \u2014 a\n child of God. The Lord\u2019s supper \u2014 the holy communion\n \u2014 is a subject too solemn, and too closely connected with\n the tie that binds us to the mercy seat, to be approached\n in the spirit of controversy. Here we step on \u201c holy\n ground,\u201d and if there be a place this side of heaven, where\n we should \u201cput off our shoes\u201d and walk softly, this is\n that spot. Here we see Christ set forth evidently cruci-\n fied among us. And can we gaze on the agonizing scene\n over which the bright orb of day wept for the first time,\n and reflect that His death opened to us, perishing sinners,\n the way of life, and yet indulge even a coldness toward\n the least partaker of His sufferings ? Neither should those\n who dispute on this subject, indulge in satire, nor in such\n a style as is calculated to wound the pious heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n These views have not originated from indifference to\n the subject, nor from indecision as to the conflicting sen-\n timents which are held among Christians in relation to\n the Lord\u2019s supper.

The, reader, while keeping this in\n mind, will recollect that it is comparatively but a lit-\n tle time since nearly the whole Christian world be-\n lieved that baptism is regeneration, and that the\n consecrated bread and wine are the real body and\n blood of Christ. The leaders of the Reformation\n were very slow in giving ' up these absurd doctrines.\n Indeed many of them never did renounce them. But\n while these sentiments vanish before the increasing\n blaze of gospel light, their consequent corresponding\n notions will not be so easily detected and forsaken.\n Often when a disease has been subdued, its effects\n adhere to the system with great tenacity. So while\n the doctrine of the real presence has been relinquish-\n ed, its corresponding unscriptural notion, that tho\n mere act of the joint reception of this sacrament\n gives or necessarily implies fellowship with each\n other, is still very generally retained. Hence mul-\n titudes do not approve or allow of real Christians\n receiving the sacred symbols for the single purposo\n of showing Christ\u2019s death.

He says, \u201c The passover was a\n family rite, of which consequently all the family,\n without a prohibition, would naturally expect to\n partake, while there were some of its members who\n were not only uncircumcised, but not under obliga-\n tion to be circumcised. But the Lord\u2019s supper is a\n church ordinance, and there is not an individual mem-\n ber of the church of Christ on whom baptism is not\n obligatory.\u201d* According to his own reasoning, if\n \u201c without a prohibition,\u201d all the family would natur-\n ally expect to partake of a family rite \u2014 so by parity\n of reasoning, without a prohibition, all the family of\n God , the true church , [not merely a part of it,] would\n naturally expect to partake of a church ordinance.\n The law of the Lord as much required the Israelites\n to be circumcised, as it does believers to be baptiz-\n ed, yet in the institution of the passover, the uncir-\n cumcised were excluded \u2014 but in the institution of\n the holy supper, the unbaptized were not excluded,\n therefore all the church may naturally expect to par-\n take. To say that the uncircumcised were entitled\n to the passover would be to deny the law. To ad-\n mit that all Christians are entitled to the Lord\u2019s sup-\n per, is to admit that no condition was made in its\n institution to exclude from its privileges any true\n Christian.

Of course it\n could not be a Christian ordinance unless that may be called Chris-\n tian which did not originate with Jesus Christ. If that which pro-\n ceeded directly from the Father and not openly through the Son, is\n properly called Christian, it follows that the thousand types and\n shadows given under the law are Christian, rites! If the circum-\n stance of Christ\u2019s authorizing his- disciples to aid John in making\n disciples and baptizing them, proves (as Messrs.

It is essential to\n Christian baptism that it be performed in the name of Christ. But\n we have no evidence that John baptized in this name.

And alter his\n resurrection, but about Jive hundred brethren assembled to see him.\n After an addition of three thousand in one day, besides large daily\n additions, it seems that the number of the men that believed at Je-\n rusalem was but five thousand. If John\u2019s disciples were Christians,\n what had become of them? Jesus said that none had arisen greater\n than John the Baptist, and yet that the \u201c least in the kingdom of\n heaven is greater than he \u201d Does not this imply that John was not\n in that kingdom? John\u2019s baptism, being but the baptism of repent-\n ance, did not imply regeneration, consequently it was not Christian\n baptism. John said \u201c I must decrease,\u201d implying that the character\n of his mission was transient. If so, it was not Christian. The re-\n baptizing of the-twelve disciples < jt Ephesus, who had been baptized\n unto John\u2019s baptism, since no explanation is given, leaves just sup-\n position that his baptism was not considered valid as ' a Christian\n institution. Paul says, \u201cAs many of us as were baptized into Jesus\n Christ, were baptized, into [the belief of] his death.\u201d But John\u2019s\n disciples were not baptized into the belief of this doctrine. If John\u2019s\n baptism were Christian baptism, the most of the nation apostatized\n from the faith of Christianity. If so, why is there no allusion to\n this most aggravating circumstance of their guilt? John\u2019s baptism\n was a preparatory rite for a kingdom at hand, but not yet set up, and\n consequently is never spoken of in the Scriptures (as Christian bap-\n tism is,) without some qualifying word to distinguish it*, but is al-\n ways called either John\u2019s baptism, the baptism of repentance, or is\n otherwise distinguished.

There is no particular form\n given in the Scriptures for organizing individual\n churches.

While the constitution and government of a\n church are distinct from its privileges , the admission\n of conscientious unbaptized Christians to the Lord\u2019s\n supper, is not a dispensing with baptism. As well\n might the charge be sustained, that every church\n dispenses with the command which requires per-\n fection , because they receive imperfect Christians to\n their communion. The cases, so far as I can judge,\n are precisely parallel. The command, \u201c withdraw\n yourselves from every brother that walketh disor-\n derly,\u201d proves nothing as to communion, or else it\n proves too much : for it requires us to withdraw from\n the character in question, in every thing which im-\n plies an acknowledgment of his Christianity. If the\n command will apply to the exclusion of honest mis-\n taken Christians from the Lord\u2019s table, it will equal-\n ly prove that all imperfect Christians, being \u201cdisor-\n derly,\u201d are to be rejected from any part in the house\n of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n All the noted works which have been written in\n favor of strict communion, are not only defensive\n and controversial, but have more the appearance of\n mere skirmishes than of a regular battle.

Thus they have never\n brought a single argument to prove their doctrine\n which they are willing to carry out in their treat-\n ment of other Christians. All the Scriptures which\n they quote in defence of their system, are such as\n originally referred alone to immoral persons, or at\n least to such as were not fellowshiped as the chil-\n dren of God. For example, when they would show\n the magnitude of the error of those who substitute\n sprinkling for baptism, they refer to the wrath which\n fell upon Uzziah, Saul, and the sons of Aaron, be-\n cause they departed from the letter of the law, or\n took upon themselves to do such things as had not\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fr:ee:co:mm:un:io:ni:st:00:un:se:freecommunionist00unse:freecommunionist00unse_0162/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 200, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 348}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fr:ee:co:mm:un:io:ni:st:00:un:se:freecommunionist00unse:freecommunionist00unse_0162/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 401, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 697}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fr:ee:co:mm:un:io:ni:st:00:un:se:freecommunionist00unse:freecommunionist00unse_0162/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 802, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1395}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fr:ee:co:mm:un:io:ni:st:00:un:se:freecommunionist00unse:freecommunionist00unse_0162/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1604, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2790}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:fr:ee:co:mm:un:io:ni:st:00:un:se:freecommunionist00unse:freecommunionist00unse_0162/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/fr/ee/co/mm/un/io/ni/st/00/un/se/freecommunionist00unse/freecommunionist00unse_0162.jp2", "height": 2790, "width": 1604, "levels": 6, "size": 397364}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"162\">\n<p>\n 156\n</p>\n<p>\n GENERAL AND\n</p>\n<p>\n been commanded; or they quote such New Testa-\n ment directions as are applicable to none but the\n wicked.

The answer is plain. Their prin-\n cipal distinctive characteristic as a denomination has\n been the Scriptural doctrine as to baptism. On this\n subject their arguments have been unanswerable.\n But when they have argued on the subject of com-\n munion, they have either confounded it with bap-\n tism, expatiating on the clearness of the law on that\n point, or else they have assumed that baptism is an\n invariable prerequisite to the Lord\u2019s supper, and\n throughout all their arguments, frequently asserted\n this position in a great variety of forms, and with\n great confidence.

This being an axiom ,\n needs no proof. There is then nothing in the term\n in Greek that carries the idea of the previous baptism\n of the subjects of this rite; nor that they who surround\n the Lord\u2019s table must think precisely alike on all\n other subjects. It is necessary to have it fairly un-\n derstood in the outset, that the point of difference\n between Freewill Baptists and Close Communion\n Baptists is whether baptism is or is not an indispen-\n sable prerequisite to a proper observance of the Lord ' s\n supper. We and our C. Baptist brethren can cer-\n tainly have no difference of opinion respecting the\n action of baptism; for we all agree that immersion\n is the only water baptism. But the question is, \u201c Is\n this immersion related to the celebration of the\n Lord\u2019s supper in such a manner that without it, it is\n inconsistent and sinfid to come to the Lord\u2019s table?\u201d\n Will any one contend that from the import of the\n term communion in the original a previous immer-\n sion is supposed? Certainly not. But let us look\n at the signification of the term in English. 1.

From this, it is evident our Lord was\n betrayed before the Jewish passover; and that he\n instituted this supper before he was betrayed. At\n the time of the Jewish passover, Palestine was en-\n veloped in darkness \u2014 the temple\u2019s veil was rent\n asunder \u2014 the hills and valleys were shook by awful\n convulsions \u2014 and the lights of heaven refused to il-\n luminate a scene so hellish as the murdering of the\n Son of God ! It is hardly rational to suppose that\n under circumstances alarming as these, that a guilty ,\n murderous community would celebrate a national\n feast. It is highly probable that the Jews did not\n eat the passover at the time the Lord our passover\n hung upon the cross.

Because they have not\n been baptized are their prayers sinful? Christ has\n commanded prayer as often as he has commanded\n the Lord\u2019s supper to be observed. Because they\n have not been baptized, is it therefore not their duty\n to pray ? It is the duty of a Christian to pray both\n in his family and in secret. But if he does not\n pray in his family, is it therefore not his duty to pray\n in secret? Just so in the case now before us. It is\n the duty of every Christian to eat at the Lord\u2019s table\n and be baptized both. But because he has not been\n baptized, is it therefore not his duty to obey the com-\n mand of Christ in the celebration of his supper?

These Christians have the evidence\n that they obey, and that God is pleased with them;\n for he often sends his spirit into the hearts of the\n Pedobaptists, while they sit at his table. Is it then\n a sinful act? Or shall we believe the Holy Spirit\n leads persons to believe they are doing right, when\n they are committing high treason against God? Or\n are none of the Pedobaptists led by the spirit ? I\n said that disciples of Christ are proper and fit sub-\n jects of this ordinance. I presume this will not be\n denied.

The order St.\n Paul would have Christians observe in this ordinance\n was, that \u201c if any were hungry they should eat at\n home, and that one should, in eating, wait for an-\n other. He says he had received of the Lord Jesus\n how it was to be done, that in the night in which he\n w r as betrayed he took bread, Slc. He first took the\n bread and then the cup. This is the established or-\n der. But in the text quoted, 1 Cor. 14:40, what kind\n of order was St. Paul speaking of? He was speak-\n ing of the disposition of spiritual gifts in the church,\n and how they should be improved \u2014 that one only\n should speak at a time \u2014 how the prophets should\n speak \u2014 and that no one should speak in an unknown\n tongue without an interpreter, & c.

In fact, they are hostile to\n the close communion cause, and entirely irrelevant\n to the purpose for which they are brought; for they\n prove that if we break a positive command of God,\n God will not be well pleased with us; and, instead\n of sending his spirit into our hearts, he would send\n his curses upon our heads; and this proves the re-\n verse of what they intend to prove by it, that is, no\n positive command is violated when any of Christ\u2019s\n disciples come around his table, where he refreshes\n them with his Holy Spirit, and fills their souls with\n his love. .

What is meant by disorderly walking?\n</p>\n<p>\n 8. What is meant by the command \u201c to with-\n draw 1 }\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 . What did Paul mean by the tradition ? He and\n Silas had been to Thessalonica and preached before\n this. It was a place of considerable importance, being\n the ancient metropolis of Macedonia, and the church\n had been flourishing. Paul had a short time previous\n to this written them a letter, which was the first epis-\n tle that he wrote. The word \u201c tradition \u201d refers to\n what he with Silas and Timotheus had written in the\n former letter. He evidently did not mean unwritten\n sayings, which were orally communicated from one\n to another, though this is the common sense of the\n term. But the word of God as contained in the for-\n mer letter, which is the only tradition the church of\n God should regard. \u201c Which ye received of us\u201d \u2014\n that is, Paul, Silas, and Timotheus. What was\n that? Is baptism a tradition of men? Is the supper\n a tradition of men? In 1 Thess. 4:11, 12, he tells\n them to \u201c Study to be quiet, and to do your own busi-\n ness, and to work w ith your own hands, as we com-\n manded you, that ye may walk honestly,\u201d & c. This\n then was the original oral tradition afterward com-\n municated in a letter. Then we have the tradition\n before us, with which the rest of the text corres-\n ponds.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. What is meant by disorderly walking? This\n is the grand question in contemplation.

Says the first, you can take up\n your abode with us, if you will conform to our rules\n and regulations.

It prohibits Christ\u2019s ministers from coming to\n the Lord\u2019s table with tTiose very souls they have led\n to Christ, and who are endeared to them by the\n strong ties of Christian love.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6.
