childhood to tottering age, and,\n this doctrine being the foundation of Christianity, to doubt it\n would be, in the eyes of the faithful, an act meet for damnation.\n</p>\n<p>\n Yet, to a Christian stud 3 r ing the Hindu religion, the most\n striking and surprising feature will be the oft recurring description\n of a \u201cdivine spirit\u201d in human form. Considering that the world\n to-day possesses authentic documents in the Sanskrit language,\n which prove beyond a doubt the existence of Rrahminism and\n Buddhism some thousands of years before the birth of Jesus, it is\n rather more than remarkable that scattered through their holy\n books are found descriptions and narratives so similar to the\n story of Jesus, that faith gives way to doubt and doubt is lost in\n amazement.\n</p>\n<p>\n For instance, one of the most prominent personages of\n miraculous birth mentioned in the scriptures of India, is\n \u201cChrisna.\u201d Sir Wm. Jones, one of the first linguists and\n Oriental scholars that England has produced, speaks of him\n as follows in one of his lectures : \u201cOn page 375 of the principal\n Sanskrit dictionary, compiled about two thousand years ago,\n Chrisna is called the divine spirit in human form.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n After expatiating on this theme, he continues: \u201cOne singular\n fact must not be suffered to pass unnoticed\u2014that the name\n (which is similar to Christ) and the general outline of his story\n were long anterior to the birth of our Saviour, and probably to\n the time of Homer, we know very certainly.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Sir Wm. Jones further says, that Chrisna is described as the\n meekest and best-tempered of beings, washing the feet of the\n Brahmas, performing miracles, healing the sick, and comforting\n the poor, etc., etc.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ch:ri:st:pu:pi:lo:fb:ud:00:un:se:christpupilofbud00unse:christpupilofbud00unse_0008/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 161, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 278}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ch:ri:st:pu:pi:lo:fb:ud:00:un:se:christpupilofbud00unse:christpupilofbud00unse_0008/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 323, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 556}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ch:ri:st:pu:pi:lo:fb:ud:00:un:se:christpupilofbud00unse:christpupilofbud00unse_0008/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 647, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1112}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ch:ri:st:pu:pi:lo:fb:ud:00:un:se:christpupilofbud00unse:christpupilofbud00unse_0008/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1294, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2224}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ch:ri:st:pu:pi:lo:fb:ud:00:un:se:christpupilofbud00unse:christpupilofbud00unse_0008/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2589, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4449}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ch:ri:st:pu:pi:lo:fb:ud:00:un:se:christpupilofbud00unse:christpupilofbud00unse_0008/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ch/ri/st/pu/pi/lo/fb/ud/00/un/se/christpupilofbud00unse/christpupilofbud00unse_0008.jp2", "height": 4449, "width": 2589, "levels": 6, "size": 592221}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"8\">\n<p>\n 6\n</p>\n<p>\n After Chrisna\u2019s, another miraculous birth occurred, namely,\n that of \u201c Gautama-Buddha.\u201d His birth is recorded as having\n taken place some six hundred years before that of Jesus, and in\n the southern scriptures of India, as well as in the northern ones,\n the conception of \u201cGautama-Buddha\u201d is described as immaculate.\n In the \u201c Lalita Vistara\u201d (one of the holy books), translated from\n the Sanskrit by Seydel, the conception of Buddha is told as\n follows : \u201c Thus, O monks, Buddha was born, and the right side\n of his mother was not pierced, was not wounded ; it remained as\n before.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Another instance of similarity between the two religions, and\n one equally remarkable, is that Buddhism, like Christianity,\n is founded on a trinity.

Many other expressions of\n \u201c John are repeated literally in his discourses.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Three vital points bearing directly on this question and con\u00ac\n firmed by the gospels must not be lost sight of:\n</p>\n<p>\n I. That Jesus by birth and education belonged to a sect of\n the Jews that never countenanced baptism or confession.\n</p>\n<p>\n II. That John the Baptist had an organization with disciples\n and many followers, who practiced baptism and confession long-\n before Jesus came to join it.\n</p>\n<p>\n III. That Jesus did not begin preaching his new doctrine\n until after he had joined the Essenes party, and that his new\n doctrine, as has been shown by the parallel columns, is a modified\n version of Buddhism, adapted by Jesus to suit the times and\n circumstances of the people to whom he preached.\n</p>\n<p>\n This fact has been recognized and tacitly acknowledged by\n many gentiles. Already a hundred years ago, Sir William Jones,\n a Christian scholar, boldly asserted that it is useless to attempt\n the conversion of the Hindus to Christianity, because the Indian\n religion contains nearly all that the Christian missionaries could\n oiler them. He said, \u201cAs to the general extension of our pure\n \u201cfaith in Hindustan there are at present many obstacles to it.\n \u201cThe Hindus would readily admit the truth of the Gospel,\n \u201c but they contend that it is perfectly consistent with their Sostras.\n \u201cWe may assure ourselves that neither Mussulmen nor Hindus\n \u201c will ever be converted by any mission from the Church of Rome,\n \u201c or from any other Church.\u201d\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":
