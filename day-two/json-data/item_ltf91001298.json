The business of a bowler and striker is\n nearly the same as in Double Wicket.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the striker runs to the bowler\u2019s wicket, and knocks\n the bail from off two stumps placed there, with his bat, and\n returns to his own wicket without having it knocked down\n by the ball, he is entitled to count one notch. After he has\n run one notch, if he start for another, he must touch the\n bowling stump and turn again, before the ball crosses the\n play, to entitle him to another notch. He is entitled to\n three notches for a lost ball.\n</p>\n<p>\n If four, or a less number are at play, then they should\n make all hits before the wicket, with bounds, etc., and not\n move off the ground, except by agreement. Where there\n aj*e more than four players on a side, there should be no\n bounds ; and all hits, byes, and overthrows should be\n allowed. It is, of course, to be understood, that the bowler\n must bowl at the usual distance from the wicket. No more\n than one minute is to be allowed between each ball. When\n the striker hits the ball, one of his feet must be on the\n ground, and behind the popping-crease ; otherwise the\n umpire shall call \u201cNo hit.\u201d The field\u2019s-man must return\n the ball, so that it shall cross the play between the wicket\n and the bowling stump; or between the wicket and the\n bounds ; the striker may run till the ball shall be so returned.\n These are the principal rules and regulations adopted by the\n most experienced Cricket-players, at the game of Single\n Wicket. The distance between the wickets is precisely the\n same as at Double Wicket, consequently, the runner has\n twice the ground to run, in obtaining each notch ; but we\n would suggest, that this evil might be remedied by running\n only a little more than half the usual distance: by this\n method, Single Wicket will be rendered much less fatiguing,\n and far more lively and amusing, at least to the Batsman.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0050/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 465}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0050/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 930}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0050/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1860}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0050/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3720}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0050/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0050.jp2", "height": 3720, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 448794}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"50\">\n<p>\n boys\u2019 own book.\n</p>\n<p>\n 40\n</p>\n<p>\n RACKETS.\n</p>\n<p>\n The ball used in rackets is smaller and harder than that\n used in fives ; it barely exceeds an inch in diameter, and is\n as hard as the nature of the materials will allow, the two\n qualities specially required of it being that it shall be per-\n fectly spherical and shall possess extreme elasticity.\n</p>\n<p>\n The bat, or racket, must be familiar to most of our young\n readers; those, however, who are unacquainted with its\n shape and construction will find it accurately made in any\n toy store.

This is perhaps a too com-\n mon fault with most players ; they fly about and dash\n frantically at almost every other ball ; whereas a really fine\n player, as a rule, takes the ball as late as possible, and\n hardly ever seems to be in a hurry, generally taking the\n whole affair with the most provoking calmness and delibera-\n tion.

Ordinary boots and shoes\n with thick soles and heels are simply inadmissible; first,\n because they would cut the paving of the court to pieces ;\n and secondly, because they are sure to bring their wearer to\n grief sooner or later, by slipping up and letting him down\n after a fashion to which a heavy fall on the ice is mere\n child\u2019s play, and to the imminent danger of breaking half\n the bones in his body.\n</p>\n<p>\n The racket is very liable to warp, and so to play untruly ;\n it should always be kept, if possible, under a weight. When\n a racket has warped so much as to become troublesome, it\n can always be restored by being pressed in a frame made for\n the purpose ; but a little care will render this unnecessary\n for a long time.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0053/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 465}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0053/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 930}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0053/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1860}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0053/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3720}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0053/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0053.jp2", "height": 3720, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 469361}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"53\">\n<p>\n boys\u2019 own book.\n</p>\n<p>\n 43\n</p>\n<p>\n SHINNY, HOCKEY OR BANDY.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is perhaps, next to football, the best of our open-ail\n winter games, and is strongly recommended to our young\n readers, as a very efficient substitute for that nobler sport.\n The spirit of the game is pretty much the same as that of\n football, the object being to strike a ball through a goal\n marked by two uprights, the principal difference being that\n the instrument of propulsion is a stick instead of the foot,\n and that the ball is smaller and of a different make.\n</p>\n<p>\n The game may be played by a very few, but at least six\n or eight are necessary to give it any real interest.

Even if you should strike the ground half an inch\n short, no harm will be done, the taw being sure to touch\n the top of the marble as it leaps from the ground ; and, if\n you should shoot a little too low, your taw will alight plump\n on the marble, and drive it to a distance. If you can\n possibly avoid it, do not let your taw roll towards the marble\n which you mean to strike, because any impediment or ob-\n stacle will be sure to turn it aside.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is worth every boy\u2019s while to practise taw-shooting, if\n only for five or ten minutes a day. He will soon gain an\n amount of precision and confidence which will thoroughly\n repay him for the trouble which he has taken. It must be\n borne in mind, that the reputation of being a certain shot\n at marbles is most useful. Your adversaries will be afraid\n of you. They will not dare to take any liberties with the\n game. They will keep themselves at a respectful distance\n from your taw for fear of being killed; and so you may\n frighten them away from the ring, and pick out all th#\n marbles at your pleasure.\n</p>\n<p>\n S\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0060/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 465}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0060/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 930}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0060/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1860}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0060/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3720}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0060/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0060.jp2", "height": 3720, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 466991}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"60\">\n<p>\n 50\n</p>\n<p>\n boys\u2019 own book.\n</p>\n<p>\n HAKE AND HOUNDS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Choose among your playfellows one who is swift of foot\n and ready in resource to take the part of the hare ; and\n then, when you are all assembled, the game proceeds in the\n following manner : The hare, who provides himself with a\n pocketful of paper cuttings, has ten minutes\u2019 law given him,\n and away he starts. As soon as he is some distance from\n the hounds, he drops the paper cuttings here and there in\n his course, as a guide to the hounds. The paper cuttings\n are technically called \u201cthe scent.\u201d At the expiration of\n the term allowed for law, the hounds follow, at the top of\n their speed, in the direction indicated by the scent ; and the\n game is over when the hare is finally caught, \u2014 which, if he\n be active and ingenious, may take an hour or more. It is\n usual to elect a huntsman and whipper-in from among the\n fastest runners. These direct the hunt, call together the\n hounds, and generally superintend the arrangements. Some-\n times the hare is provided with a horn, which he blows\n when he considers he is far enough from his pursuers. The\n huntsman, too, generally carries a white flag, and the\n whipper-in a red one ; and when the scent is struck, off\n they all go, till they either find the hare, or proclaim him\n lost. It is, in this case, the huntsman\u2019s part to seek the\n trail of the hare, while the whipper-in keeps his hounds\n well together till the track is refound. Then Tally ho ! and\n follow the white flag, wherever it goes, till the hare is fairly\n run to earth. If a long course be taken by the hare, it is as\n well that he should provide himself with a pocket compass,\n or some other means of finding his way back to the starting\n place.\n</p>\n<p>\n HUNT THE STAG.\n</p>\n<p>\n This game differs only from the last in the fact that the\n stag is in sight of the hounds, instead of being hunted by\n scent \u2014 that is, by the pieces of paper dropped on his course.\n The stag has a minute\u2019s start.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0061/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 465}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0061/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 930}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0061/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1860}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0061/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3720}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0061/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0061.jp2", "height": 3720, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 462642}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"61\">\n<p>\n boys\u2019 own book.\n</p>\n<p>\n 51\n</p>\n<p>\n SPORTS OF AGILITY AND SPEED .\n</p>\n<p>\n Many of the previous sports with balls and tops are in\n part games of agility and speed, and so also are several of\n those which will be found among the Miscellaneous Minor\n Sports; but the following pastimes are exclusively games\n either of speed or agility, for which no implements are nec-\n essary.\n</p>\n<p>\n LEAP-FROG.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is a most excellent pastime.

It is very common for novices in the\n art of swimming to make use of corks or bladders to assist\n in keeping the body above water; some have utterly con-\n demned the use of them ; however, they may be of service\n for supporting the body, while one is learning what is called\n the stroke, or that manner of drawing in and striking out\n the hands and feet, that is necessary to produce progressive\n motion. But you will be no swimmer till you can place\n confidence in the power of the water to support you; I\n would, therefore, advise the acquiring that confidence in the\n first place; especially as I have known several, who, by a\n little practice necessary for that purpose, have insensibly\n acquired the stroke, taught as if it were by nature. The\n practice I mean is this*; choosing a place where the water\n deepens gradually, walk coolly into it till it is up to your\n breast ; then turn round your face to the shore, and throw\n an egg into the water between you and the shore ; it will\n sink to the bottom, and be easily seen there if the water be\n clear. It must lie in the water so deep that you cannot\n reach to take it up but by diving for it. To encourage your-\n self, in order to do this, reflect that your progress will be\n from deep to shallow water, and that at any time you may\n by bringing your legs under you, and standing on the bot-\n tom, raise your head far above the water; then plunge under\n it with your eyes open, which must be kept open before go*\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0075/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 287, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 467}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0075/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 575, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 935}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0075/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1150, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1871}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0075/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3742}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0075/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0075.jp2", "height": 3742, "width": 2301, "levels": 6, "size": 507351}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"75\">\n<p>\n boys\u2019 own book.\n</p>\n<p>\n 63\n</p>\n<p>\n ing under, as you cannot open the eyelids for the weight of\n water above you, throwing vourself toward the egg, and en-\n deavoring, by the action of your hands and feet against the\n water, to get forward, till within reach of it.

That the necessary action with\n the arms and legs may be acquired more easily with than\n without them, is clear enough ; ' nevertheless, we are con-\n vinced by experience, that it is better to learn how to keep\n one\u2019s self afloat and to be able to swim ten or a dozen yards,\n at least, no matter how clumsily, without them. We have\n seen several young persons who, after having attained the\n necessary action, in a very superior manner, by the use of\n corks or bladders, were totally unable to keep their heads\n above the water when they relinquished their aid, and were\n thus left precisely in the same situation in which they would\n have been had they not made a single attempt in the art of\n swimming. We have, it is true, known some trifling ex-\n ceptions, but they have been rare indeed. Corks and blad-\n ders, we think, may be useful, but they should not be com-\n menced with. After the learner has made some progress,\n and is able to cross a narrow stream, corks and bladders\n may be occasionally adopted for a short time, in order that\n the pupil, by means of their support, may, at his ease, per-\n fect himself in the action necessary for superior swimming,\n especially with the arms and hands. The action of the legs\n may be much better acquired by means of the plank, as\n \" thereafter directed. The best swimmers we have ever met\n never made use of corks for this purpose, but still they may\n be considered of advantage in the manner we have stat-\n ed.

A piece of plank, about ten or twelve feet in length,\n</p>\n<p>\n two inches thick,\n and a foot and a\n half, or two feet\n broad,, is the best\n size.

The use of the rope is to support\n the learner while practising the action with his legs ; but it\n is very inferior for this purpose to the plank ; as, while the\n pupil keeps himself up, by holding the rope, his body re-\n mains in too perpendicular a position, so that he strikes\n downward rather than backward.

A tall, strong youth, or a grown-up person, takes\n the little learner in his arms, and goes into the water breast-\n high with him ; he then places the pupil nearly flat upon\n the water, supporting him by one hand under the breast,\n and encouraging and directing him to strike out boldly,\n and, at the same time, correctly.

To those\n who ha Vo never swam \u201cin the silver flood,\u201d a circumstance\n of this sort will be thought very lightly of indeed ; but we\n speak the general feelings of swimmers, when we say, that\n the same person who would relish a draught from a stream\n when sitting dressed upon its bank, would feel the greatest\n disgust at taking a mouthful of the same water when swim-\n ming in it.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0086/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 465}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0086/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 930}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0086/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1860}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0086/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3720}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0086/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0086.jp2", "height": 3720, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 443869}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"86\">\n<p>\n 74\n</p>\n<p>\n boys\u2019 OWK BOOK.\n</p>\n<p>\n After the pupil has ventured out of his depth, and feels\n satisfied with the success of his attempt, he grows em-\n .boldened, and increases his distances daily.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO TREAD WATER.\n</p>\n<p>\n All that is necessary for treading water, is to let your legs\n drop in the water until you are upright ; then keep yourself\n afloat in that position by treading downward with your feet,\n alternately, and if necessary paddling with your palms at\n your hips.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO SWIM ON THE SIDE.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lower your left side, and at the same time elevate your\n right; strike forward with your left hand, and sideways with\n your right ; the back of the latter being in front instead of\n upward, the thumb side of the hand downward, so as to\n serve precisely as an oar.

For young beginners\n the former are preferable, as regards safety ; but with the\n latter only can velocity and elegance of movement be\n acquired. A quarter of an inch in thickness, and about\n three-quarters of an inch in height, are proportionate dimen-\n sions for the blades of skates. High bladed skates are dan-\n gerous for beginners, and require considerable exertion of\n the muscles to keep the ankle stiff, while the nearer the feet\n are brought to the ice, without risking their contact, the less\n will be that strain, and the greater the facility of moving in\n all directions. The blades should be slightly curved -at the\n bottom, as this form assists the skater in turning either heel\n or toe outwards or inwards with rapidity. Previously to go-\n ing on the ice, the learner should practise, both walking\n about with his skates on, and balancing himself on either foot.\n The club skate, in which there is no wood, is preferred by\n some to all others.\n</p>\n<p>\n HOW TO PERFORM THE VARIOUS EVOLUTIONS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Before the skater attempts to cut figures and other devices,\n he must be able to skate on the outside edge of the skate, to\n skate backwards, and to turn round. The \u201coutside edge\u201d\n implies what it is by its name ; when acquired, it sends you\n exactly in opposite directions, on both sides, to what the \u201c in-\n side edge \u201d does. In explanation : \u2014 Suppose that you are skat-\n ing on the right foot, it is easy to turn to the left, but not so\n to the right, to effect which you must use the outside edge,\n by striking out upon it either foot, inclining at the same\n time the skate, the leg, the body, and the head, toward which-\n ever side you are skating, holding the other foot raised up\n behind, and rounding the arms.\n</p>\n<p>\n The right hand should be raised towards the head in skat-\n ing on the left outside edge, and the left hand when skating\n on the right outside edge.

When, however, you are used\n to this manner of skating, it will appear natural and toler-\n ably easy of execution. The backward curve is of equal\n importance with the ordinary curve on the outside edge, and\n constitutes the base of all retrograde or backward figures.\n In this evolution the position of the arms and head is not\n the same as for the ordinary curve on the outside edge.\n When executing the outward retrograde curve, your face\n must be turned towards the left shoulder, and the right hand\n raised towards the head.

He must be fearless, but not too violent in his\n motions, and should never be in a hurry. He must avoid\n looking downwards to see how his feet act, and should re-\n cover his balance between each stroke. For safety his body\n may be bent slightly forward during his first essays, but\n when he has acquired sufficient confidence, he should bear\n himself erect, carry his head well up ; and always turn his\n face in the direction of the line he proposes describing.\n</p>\n<p>\n He should wear flannel next his chest to absorb the per-\n spiration caused by the exercise, and avoid skating against\n the wind, if. of a delicate constitution. When unexpected\n danger arises, he should strive to be perfectly collected. If\n surrounded by rotten ice he must crawl on his hands and\n knees, that the support of his weight may be distributed. If\n he fall upon rotten ice at full length, he must roll away from\n it toward firmer ice ; and should he be so unlucky as to get\n into a hole, he must extend both arms outward in opposite\n directions upon the surface of the ice, and tread water until\n assistance come. A plank or ladder offers the best means of\n extrication, either being easily pushed along the ice ; or a\n rope may be thrown to a person immersed ; but we hope our\n young readers, by prudence and caution, will avoid the ne-\n cessity of their application.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0100/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 465}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0100/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 930}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0100/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1860}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0100/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3720}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0100/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0100.jp2", "height": 3720, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 456115}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"100\">\n<p>\n 88\n</p>\n<p>\n boys\u2019 own book.\n</p>\n<p>\n HIDE AND SEEK.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is very like the preceding game ; a handkerchief, or\n some other trifle, is concealed by one player, and the rest\n attempt to find it ; the discoverer takes the next turn to hide\n the article.

It sometimes happens that three or four of\n the out-players\u2019 ducks lie so close together, that the player\n who is duck can stand in a situation to be within reach of\n all of them ; in this case, they cannot, without running the\n risk of being touched, pick up, until one of those who are\n at the offing is lucky enough to strike the duck off the\n large stone ; then before its owner can replace it, which\n he must do before he can touch a player, they all take up\n their ducks and run to the offing, where, of course, they art*\n safe.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0101/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 287, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 467}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0101/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 575, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 935}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0101/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1150, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1871}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0101/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3742}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0101/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0101.jp2", "height": 3742, "width": 2301, "levels": 6, "size": 607425}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"101\">\n<p>\n boys\u2019 own book.\n</p>\n<p>\n 89\n</p>\n<p>\n The construction of the swing is simple : two ropes of\n equal lengths are to be suspended from any branch or cross-\n piece of timber, of adequate strength; at the bottom of\n these ropes a seat is to be securely fastened, and the party\n who takes the seat must be propelled by another on the\n ground: a rope for this purpose must be fastened to the\n back part of the seat.\n</p>\n<p>\n TUG OF WAR.\n</p>\n<p>\n This game is played by two parties, whose numbers ar\u00ab\n equal ; they all take hold of a rope, and the object of each\n party is to pull those belonging to the other across a chalk\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0102/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 465}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0102/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 930}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0102/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1860}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0102/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3720}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0102/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0102.jp2", "height": 3720, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 478456}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"102\">\n<p>\n \u2014 \u2014 \u2014 \u25a0 \u2014 -r-3 ; * \u2014 T\n</p>\n<p>\n 96 boys\u2019 own book.\n</p>\n<p>\n line on the ground, by means of a rope.

This is a very lively sport,\n any number may join in it, and it affords capital exercise\n and much amusement.\n</p>\n<p>\n TIP-CAT.\n</p>\n<p>\n Tip-cat, or, perhaps, more properly, the game of cat, is a\n well known pastime. Its denomination is derived from a\n piece of wood, called a cat, with which it is played ; the cat\n is about six inches in length, and an inch and a half or two\n inches in diameter, and diminished from the middle to both\n the ends, in the shape of a double cone ; when the cat is\n laid upon the ground, the player, with his stick, strikes it\n smartly, it matters not at which end, and it will rise with a\n rotary motion, high enough for him to beat it away as it\n falls, in the same manner as he would a ball.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are various methods of playing the game of cat, but\n we shall only notice the two that follow. The first is ex-\n ceedingly simple, and consists in making a large ring upon the\n ground, in the middle of which the striker takes his station;\n his business is to beat the cat over the ring. If he fails in\n so doing he is out, and another player takes his place : if he\n be successful, he judges with his eye the distance the cat is\n driven from the centre of the ring, and calls for a number,\n at pleasure, to be scored toward his game ; if the number\n demanded be found, upon measurement, to exceed the same\n number of lengths of the stick, he is out ; on the contrary,\n if he do not, he obtains his call. The second method is to\n make four, six, or eight holes in the ground, in a circular\n direction, and as nearly as possible at equal distances from\n each other, and at every hole is placed a player with his\n stick ; one of the opposite party, who stand in the field,\n tosses the cat to the batsman who is nearest him, and every\n time the cat is struck, the players are obliged tft change\n their situations, and run once from one hole to another in\n succession ; if the cat be driven to any great distance, they\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0103/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 287, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 467}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0103/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 575, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 935}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0103/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1150, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1871}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0103/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3742}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0103/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0103.jp2", "height": 3742, "width": 2301, "levels": 6, "size": 435581}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"103\">\n<p>\n boys\u2019 owk book.\n</p>\n<p>\n 91\n</p>\n<p>\n continue to run in the same order, and claim a score toward\n their game, every time they quit one hole and run to another;\n but if the cat be stopped by their opponents, and thrown\n across between any two of the holes before the player who\n has quitted one of them can reach the other, he is out.\n</p>\n<p>\n HOP-SCOTCH.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is played with an oyster-shell, in the following manner ;\n \u2014 Draw, with chalk, on the ground, a\n figure similar to the cut in the margin.\n</p>\n<p>\n Toss up for innings.

All\n arrows should have their nocks or notches cased with horn,\n and the nocks should be of such a size as to fit the string\n with exactness, and be neither too tight nor too loose.

If the silk should come off\n the string, it ought to be re-whipped without delay ; other-\n wise it will be in danger of breaking ; and this is not the\n only mischief, for from the breaking of a string oftentimes\n ensues the snapping of the bow. It is also advisable to whip\n the noose and eye of the string, although many archers do\n not trouble themselves to do so. At one end of the bow-\n string an eye is made ; it is left for the archer himself, bows\n being of different lengths, to make the other ; this, to a\n young archer, will be found rather difficult ; his best plan\n will be to inspect the mode of making the noose on an old\n string. The young archer will do well, if any of the threads\n of his string break, to throw it by and use another.

If he shoot point-blank\n at a mark, the arrow, if it miss, will strike along, and so\n bury itself in the grass as to defy the keenest eye, in many\n instances, for a very considerable time, to discover it. This\n inconvenience may be remedied by shooting at a proper ele-\n vation, for then the arrow will descend in such a manner as\n to leave the feathers visible; they will also be saved from\n that injury which frequently occurs to them by the moist-\n ure of the grass or ground, when shot point-blank. Ar-\n rows should not be used of different lengths, nor should the\n young archer shoot alone ; for in solitary shooting, he falls\n into habits of negligence and indifference ; if he practice\n with others, he will strive to emulate his companions ; and,\n instead of a careless, unskilful marksman, soon become an\n adept in the pleasant pastime of Archery.\n</p>\n<p>\n 5 *\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0118/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 465}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0118/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 930}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0118/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1860}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0118/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3720}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0118/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0118.jp2", "height": 3720, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 654752}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"118\">\n<p>\n 106\n</p>\n<p>\n boys\u2019 own book.\n</p>\n<p>\n GYMNASTIC EXERCISES.\n</p>\n<p>\n The necessary fittings-up of a gymnastic ground are as\n follows : \u2014 An horizontal bar, a vaulting-horse, a leaping-\n stand, parallel bars, a climbing-stand, and ladders of rope\n and wood.\n</p>\n<p>\n The best time for performing gymnastics is early in the\n morning.

the most\n eminent. Various accounts have been given of its origin.\n Some say it was first played at the siege of Troy, being in-\n vented by Palamedes to amuse the Giecian chiefs, disgusted\n with the tediousness of the siege; but the most probable\n conjecture is that of Bochartus, who makes it of Oriental\n extraction, and to come to us from Persia through Arabia ;\n as most of the terms employed in the game are either\n corruptions or translations from the Persic or Arabic words.\n Thus, check is plainly derived from the Persian schach,\n or king; and mat, in the same language, signifies dead;\n hence check-mate, or, the king is dead.\n</p>\n<p>\n Chess is highly beneficial to the improvement of the mind ;\n nothing in it is governed by chance\u2014 judgment is every-\n thing. A player, therefore, cannot lay the blame of his\n losing on fortune, but must ascribe his miscarriages to de-\n ficiency of judgment, or inattention ; and for this reason it\n is the most interesting of games. It acts strongly, too, on\n the sense of honor ; irascible persons should therefore avoid\n it, unless they have learnt to acknowledge that the acutest\n minds may be guilty of an oversight. Chess has one splen-\n did advantage over almost all other sedentary games : that\n its lovers do not play at it for wagers, the honor of the vic-\n tory being the only reward of the conqueror.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE VARIOUS PIECES.\n</p>\n<p>\n Bishop.

The king, however, is never actually taken ;\n but if he be checked by one piece, and can neither take the\n hostile man, interpose any of his own, nor move into any\n other square without being in check from another, he loses\n the game.

The bishop, therefore, always keeps\n the same colored squares as that on which he is placed at the\n beginning of the game.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE KNIGHT.\n</p>\n<p>\n The knight is particularly useful at the beginning of the\n game, and should be one of the first pieces brought into\n play. The knight moves in a peculiar way, leaping from\n the square on which he stands into either of the next that\n has a corner in contact with one of the farther corners of\n the square over which he leaps. He always moves, there-\n fore, from white to black, or the contrary. As, for an ex-\n ample, from B 1 to A 3, C 3, or D 2. The move of the\n knight is one of the most difficult points of chess to explain\n in writing ; and we therefore recommend our young friends\n to take an opportunity of looking over a game of chess while\n playing, and fix the whole of the moves in their minds.\n A knight may be placed on any one square of the board,\n and conveyed hence into every one of the other squares in\n sixty-three moves. We subjoin an example of this curious\n problem at the end of the article.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE PAWNS.\n</p>\n<p>\n The pawns are of great consequence in defending the king;\n and are very useful in attacking and repelling the pieces,\n under the management of a good player. If a pawn can\n proceed across the field to the rear line of the enemy,\n that is, from 2 to 8, or from 7 to 1, he is exchanged for\n a queen, or any other piece of his color that he chooses to\n demand. Thus, you may have a second queen, even\n though you should have lost none of your pieces. The pawn\n moves straight forward, and only a single square at a time ;\n except on its being first moved, when the player may ad-\n vance it either one square or two, as from 2 to 3, or to 4,\n and from 7 to 6, or to 5; or when one takes a man from\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0168/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 465}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0168/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 930}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0168/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1860}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0168/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3720}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0168/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0168.jp2", "height": 3720, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 445833}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"168\">\n<p>\n 152\n</p>\n<p>\n boys\u2019 own book.\n</p>\n<p>\n the enemy, which is always done diagonally, or across the\n corners of the squares.

For example, the pawn G 2 cannot\n be moved to G 4, if there be an enemy\u2019s pawn on H 4\n or F 4, without that pawn\u2019s having option of taking him\n on G 3, as he passes.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE CHESS-BOARD.\n</p>\n<p>\n The common draughts-\n 8 board, containing sixty-\n 7 four squares, one-half\n 6 white and one-half black,\n is also a chess-board.

It\n is, however, perfectly optional; this, as well as all the rest\n of his moves, being regulated either by some plan which\n the player has formed for attacking his enemy, or as he may\n find a necessity of defending himself from his enemy\u2019s at-\n tack. The object of the game, which is to give the enemy\n check-mate, can scarcely be effected without some settled\n plan. The player must look forward through a considerable\n number of moves, which will be requisite to bring his men\n into a given position, and also to provide, from time to time,\n against his antagonist\u2019s attempts to frustate his design or\n attack him in turn. He must seek to penetrate his adversary\u2019s\n plots from the moves he makes. He is not obliged to take\n a man when it is in his power; but, when he does, the man\n with which he takes it, must be placed on the square oc-\n cupied by the man taken. When the king is in such a\n situation that another move could take him, were he not\n king, he is in check. The modes of extricating the king\n from check are as follows : \u2014 If the man that checks him be\n in an adjacent square, the king may take such man if he be\n not guarded ; that is, if another man of his own color have\n it not in his power to move into the square in which the\n man is placed if he be removed from it ; since, in this case,\n the king would place himself in check again. For example,\n suppose the king in E 1, and an enemy\u2019s pawn, advanced to\n D 2, give him check ; the king cannot take the pawn, if the\n enemy have another pawn, or a bishop in C 3 or E 3, or a\n rook or queen anywhere in the open row D D, etc. The\n man that checks may also be taken by some other man, to\n whose attack he is open ; or a man may be placed between\n the king and the checking man (unless it be the knight) if\n there be a vacant square between them. Lastly, the king\n may be moved into anothsr square which is not commanded\n by the adversary\u2019s pieces.

If your plan be discovered and frustrat-\n ed, it is better to form a new one than to persevere in the\n old. Your plan should not only be concealed from your\n adversary, but you must also discover, if possible, what your\n adversary can do to counteract your moves. A plan may be\n most effectually concealed by excluding the queens and\n rooks, or by executing it through the agency of inferior\n pieces or pawns, or by masking the pieces intended to effect\n it behind men which are apparently indifferent. The skil-\n ful player, if his moves be calculated with precision, will\n sacrifice his most important pieces without hesitation, to\n mislead his antagonist, or, when necessary, to the accom-\n plishment of his plan ; nay, he will often do this intention-\n ally, to lead his opponent into the hope of winning, and give\n his antagonist check-mate, when he fancies he has the game\n in his hands. To give check without having it in your\n power to follow it up, is, in general, bad play. If your\n checking piece can immediately be repulsed, you lose a\n move ; never proceed to an attack therefore without good\n preparation ; and if your attack proceed well, do not suffer\n yourself to be drawn aside after any bait that your antagonist\n may throw in your way.

Sacrifice your own\n willingly, when the loss of them will open the line of de-\n fence adopted by your opponent.\n</p>\n<p>\n If a man of the enemy be exposed, examine whether it\n were left so from necessity, oversight, or design. You do\n not always gain by taking a piece, you may be check-mated\n in consequence of taking even a queen. Be not eager to\n take a pawn in front of your queen ; for, as your antagonist\n cannot take him, he is frequently a better protection than a\n man of your own. If you cannot save a piece, endeavor to\n take one of the enemy\u2019s; or, by improving your situation, ob-\n tain a compensation for the loss.

A man that can-\n not move is often worse than lost, by standing in the way.\n Endeavor to crowd your antagonist\u2019s game, in which you\n may succeed, if he bring out his pieces too early, by driving\n them back with your pawns.

It is important the rover should do all he can for\n his side. Always recollect that in making a roquet it is\n only necessary to reach the ball : and when you want to\n run a hoop that is not in a direct line with your ball, play\n behind the hoop, at an angle, so as to allow you to run the\n hoop when your turn comes round again.

These two movements force the horse to raise his\n head, and putting his body in motion, he prepares to execute\n the order which has been transmitted to him. This is called\n gathering up your horse. In order to walk straight ahead,\n the rider lowers his hand, and consequently the reins cease\n to pull the bit in the mouth of the horse, which, finding\n himself not held back, naturally walks. On feeling himself\n pressed and driven on by the knees and legs of the rider,\n which act simultaneously with the hand, he again moves\n quickly. But if, through not being well trained, or by ca-\n price, the horse misunderstands the rider, and refuses to ad-\n vance, then the legs of the rider are carried behind the girths,\n and he applies the spurs to the flanks of the animal, who,\n in order to relieve himself from the pain, hastens forward.\n If the rider wishes to pass from a walk into a trot, or from\n a trot into a gallop, the bridle is still more loosely held,\n which diminishes the pull of the bit in the horse\u2019s mouth,\n and by a sharp action of the spurs the rider informs his\n horse that he wishes to go at a quicker pace.

But, as in\n this movement, the horse can turn his body crosswise, the\n rider keeps his legs against the body of the horse, which,\n from fear of the spurs, does not dare to throw his legs out\n either to the right or left. If the rider wishes to turn to the\n right, he holds his hand on the side, which causes the bit to\n press harder on one side of the horse\u2019s mouth than on the\n other ; and he naturally gives way this side to escape the\n pain. He therefore turns his head in this direction, and\n the rider hastens his movements by applying the spur to\n this side.

All the first exercises are usually practised\n without stirrups, and with the aid of a snaffle-bridle, which\n is less painful than the ordinary bridle to the mouth of the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0204/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 465}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0204/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 930}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0204/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1860}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0204/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3720}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0204/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0204.jp2", "height": 3720, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 475198}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"204\">\n<p>\n 186\n</p>\n<p>\n BOYS* OWN BOOK.\n</p>\n<p>\n horse. At his first essay, the pupil does not run the risk of\n making his horse turn and back ; but holds his reins in a\n manner which compels the horse to go forward, and at the\n same time keeps him firm in his seat on the animal\u2019s back.\n When the young horseman has acquired some confidence on\n his horse, he can pass into a trot, and then into a gallop.\n Once arrived at the power of being able to easily guide his\n horse with his legs and hand, so as to make it go at all paces\n and to stop it, he is taught, as we have explained, the action\n of the bit and the reins, the manner of producing this action\n by the movement of the hand, the movements of the legs,\n and lastly, the accordance which there should be between\n the hand, the bridle, and the reins, between all the move-\n ments of the rider and his horse.\n</p>\n<p>\n The side of the horse from which the rider mounts and\n dismounts is generally the left, but it is as well to accustom\n one\u2019s self to mount and dismount on both sides, so as not to\n be embarrassed when unforeseen circumstances oblige you to\n mount or dismount on the right side. In order to mount a\n horse, seize the upper part of the reins with the right hand,\n raise them until you feel the reins are pretty tight, then pass\n the little finger of the left hand between the two reins, the\n three other fingers on the right rein, and the thumb on the\n left; then lay hold as well as you are able, with the left\n hand, of the horse\u2019s mane, and in this position the left hand\n should be ready to check the horse, should he commence to\n start. Then raise the left knee, and put the left foot in the\n stirrup, put the right hand on the saddle, raise yourself up\n by a spring until your right leg is on a level with your left,\n then pass the right leg over the saddle, and place the foot in\n the stirrup, drawing the right hand away from the saddle,\n Then separate the reins, \u2014 hold one in each hand, the upper\n part of each rein being held steady by the pressure of the\n thumb. This is the safest way for a beginner to hold the\n reins ; but he will gradually acquire the more masterly way of\n holding them, and which he will easily understand by notic-\n ing the way in which an experienced horseman holds them.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":

He will generally get up\n of himself. A horse that is apt to stumble must be kept\n well in hand, and also be kept active with whip and reins,\n so that he may know you are master. A kicking horse\n should have a kicking strap ; and when he shows any inten-\n tion to indulge his propensity, give him a sharp reminder\n with the whip over the head and back. A shying horse\n must be coaxed and soothed \u2014 not whipped. An experienced\n driver will endeavor to encourage his horse by his voice\n and rein rather than with the whip.

The sides here meet at\n a sharp angle, by which the boat is enabled with greater\n facility to cut through the water. The small points pro-\n jecting upwards from the sides of the boat, two on each side,\n are termed the row-locks. In these the oars are placed, and\n by means of them the rowers obtain the purchase necessary to\n enable them to propel the boat. They are formed of flat\n pieces of wood, generally oak or asli, and the one nearest the\n rower, when he is seated in position with his oar in the row-\n lock, is termed the thowl-pin, while the other is known by\n the name of the stopper. Against the thowl-pin the oar is\n pushed back and pulled, while the other, as its name im-\n plies, serves the purpose of staying the oar from slipping\n forward after the rower has made his stroke. To these two\n small pieces of wood the rower is thus principally indebted\n for his power of control over the motions of the boat. The\n seats for the rowers are called the \u201c thwarts.\u201d They stretch\n across from side to side of the boat, a few inches below its\n edge, or, as it is technically termed, the wall. At the\n bottom of the boat, in front of the rower, a board is fixed,\n against which he places his feet. This board, called the\n \u2018 \u2018 stretcher, \u201d is generally movable at will, according to the\n height of the person seated, or, to speak more clearly, ac-\n cording to the length of his legs. When properly adjusted,\n the foot-board is of considerable service in enabling him to\n keep his body in proper position, and, by the purchase given\n to his movements, assisting the power of his stroke. At the\n stern of the boat is a seat for the coxswain or steersman,\n who holds the lines of the rudder in his hands ; although,\n 9\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0214/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 465}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0214/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 930}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0214/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1860}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0214/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3720}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0214/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0214.jp2", "height": 3720, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 520059}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"214\">\n<p>\n 194\n</p>\n<p>\n boys\u2019 own book.\n</p>\n<p>\n when two rowers of any experience are engaged, it is by no\n means necessary that any one should steer, provided that\n the oarsmen keep sufficient look-out occasionally to see\n where they are going.

The end of the boat is called the stern, and here is\n placed the rudder, which, when one person is steering,\n directs by its movements the course of the boat. He takes\n one of the lines attached to the rudder in each hand, and by\n pulling either the left or the right line, a corresponding\n turn is given the boat.

This move-\n ment is called \u201c feathering,\u201d and has the effect of bringing\n the oar cleanly out, the water glancing from the blade. The\n original position should then be resumed, the arms and the\n body thrown forward again, and so with every stroke.

As to the degree of the immersion of the sculls, in the\n middle of the pull the blades must be covered by the water.\n The beginner generally dips them too deeply ; but that\n ought to be avoided, especially in calm weather. In the\n whole of the return, the tops of the sculls should, in calm\n weather, be two or three inches above the water; and in\n rough weather they should be higher, in order to clear it.\n The head should be well balanced and pliant, so that you\n may turn it easily with the direction of the boat.\n</p>\n<p>\n Young boatmen should begin with a boat large enough to\n hold two, so that when one is tired the other may take the\n sculls.

In making the next stroke, how-\n ever, you again turn the scull so that it dips edgewise in\n the water. This is not so easy to describe as to do; but\n when you have once done it, you can do it always. Feather-\n ing is the very acme and perfection of good and graceful\n sculling. Be careful, however, not to raise the scull too high\n out of the water, or you will not be able to make a good\n stroke next time.

This is a general rule, and will apply to\n any number of pieces.

They are fast and handy to use. The\n Lugsail has a portion of the sail before the mast which\n causes it to come round quickly in tacking. The Spritsail\n has the canvas abaft, and is therefore less easy to pull round.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0230/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 465}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0230/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 930}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0230/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1860}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0230/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3720}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0230/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0230.jp2", "height": 3720, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 471577}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"230\">\n<p>\n 210\n</p>\n<p>\n boys\u2019 own* book.\n</p>\n<p>\n LUGSAIL.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of the two, the lugsail is to be preferred, as you have more\n power over the boat than with the spritsail ; though the\n canvas in the latter is flat to the wind.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Schooner has two masts, with fore and aft sails, and\n sometimes a third sail, a jigger, raised on a spar at the\n stern.\n</p>\n<p>\n Cutter-rig , with Boom Mainsail . \u2014 A yacht with this form\n of rig is generally understood to be a good sailer.

But the rig has great driving power;\n though for a pleasure-boat it is decidedly inferior to those\n already mentioned.\n</p>\n<p>\n We now come to the practica 1 instruction for the manage-\n ment of the yacht.\n</p>\n<p>\n PRACTICAL ADVICE.\n</p>\n<p>\n The first thing you have to do. when on board your pleasure-\n boat, is to get wider weigh, that is, to sail from the harbor\n or starting-place. How are you to manage this ? The\n ordinary directions given by yachtsmen and seamen would\n be something like this: \u201cShip the tiller; set the mainsail;\n hoist the throat nearly close up, and half hoist the peak.\n Bend and haul the jib out of the bowsprit end; bowse the\n bobstay and bowsprit well taut. Hoist the jib, and bowse it\n well up. Get the topmast stay, backstays, and rigging well\n taut. Hoist the foresail ready to cast her when her moor-\n ings are let go. Send a hand to the helm; overhaul the\n mainsheet and the lee runner and tackle ; lower the throat,\n and hoist the peak of the mainsail taut up. Hoist the gaff-\n topsail, keeping the tack to windward of the peak halyards ;\n and haul the slack of the sheet out before you hoist the sail\n taut up. Set the tack, and heave the sheet well taut.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, do you think you could follow these directions? I\n fancy you would be somewhat nonplussed to translate the\n various nautical terms into colloquial English. Therefore,\n your best plan will be to make yourselves acquainted with\n the principal phrases in use on board a yacht. You will not\n find it necessary to master all the puzzling phraseology in\n which the Dick Fids and Tom Taffrails of naval novelists\n indulge; but there is quite en )ugh to puzzle a landsman,\n unless he familiarizes himself with a few necessary peculi-\n arities of the language of the sea.\n</p>\n<p>\n When we say a vessel is close-hauled , or on the wind, or\n plying to windward, we mean that she is steering close to\n the wind.

I do not em-\n ploy the word in its mere dictionary form, as meaning\n \u201cphrases used by the low, the vulgar, and the ignorant;\u201d\n but as expressing the fact that the law, the army, the count-\n ing-house, the manufactory, and the shop, have each and all\n their well-understood and accepted technicalities. To be a\n barrister or a solicitor, a soldier or a merchant, a manufac-\n turer or a trader, it will be necessary to familiarize yourself\n with the language peculiar to each calling. So also with\n boating and sailing. To become a yachtsman you must not\n be ignorant of the slang of the sea.\n</p>\n<p>\n Setting Sail. \u2014 As already explained, your first task is to\n hook on the bobstay, and bowse down the end of the bow-\n sprit. Then you must cast off the lashings which held the\n mainsail furled; look to the foresail and jib, that they are\n ready to be hoisted, and see that the mainsheet is clear of\n obstructions. Before you set the headsails you must set the\n mainsails, and haul out the jib on the bowsprit ; but do not\n hoist it until the mainsail is set, and her moorings slipped.\n The boat should never be loosed from her moorings till the\n mainsail is fairly set, and the anchor weighed \u2014 that is, raised\n from the water, and made fast to the side of the boat. Run\n up the foresail directly the vessel is free. The boat\u2019s head\n will be canted or brought round by hauling the foresheet\n a-weather. When fairly under way, run up the jib, being\n careful that the jibsheets (or ropes) are clearly and properly\n trimmed. Then having got your main fairly up, haul up\n the peak. If there are many craft near you, so as to leave\n but little room for turning, you must drop or lower the\n peak, and set the headsails. Then, by hauling the foresheet\n a-weather, you can turn the boat in a very little more space\n than its own length.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0234/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 465}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0234/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 930}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0234/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1860}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0234/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3720}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0234/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0234.jp2", "height": 3720, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 427301}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"234\">\n<p>\n 214\n</p>\n<p>\n boys\u2019 own book.\n</p>\n<p>\n Reefing Sails.\u2014 Caution and expedition are necessary in\n this operation.

Much of the suc-\n cess achieved by a yacht, however, is due to the manner in\n which it is managed ; to a careful attention to the trim of\n the sheets and the adjustment of her sails. In sailing to\n windward \u2014 that is, in beating against the wind \u2014 the sails\n should be set as flat as possible, so that they may be eased\n off for running free, and sailing on a bowline. The art of\n sailing a boat against the wind by various zigzag tacks is a\n performance that needs the nicest skill, a keen, watchful\n eye, and frequent practice \u2014 that is, if you would do your\n work in a seamanlike manner.\n</p>\n<p>\n But the art is by no means difficult to acquire. The\n helmsman must be careful to keep an eye on the luff of the\n mainsail, and should steer as close to the wind as he can.\n In simpler language, he must endeavor so to steer the craft\n as\u2014 while keeping as close to the wind as possible \u2014 to keep\n the sails full without allowing them to flap to and fro. In\n smooth water you can keep closer to the wind than in rough\n seas. \u201cKeep her full\u201d is a maxim with all yachtsmen;\n that is, keep the sails well blown out with the wind.\n</p>\n<p>\n In sailing up a narrow channel to windward, the best plan\n is to furl the jib, and depend only on the main and foresail.\n Large jibs are dangerous at such times, as their driving\n power is apt to be too much for the steersman. When the\n vessel goes free, help her all you can, by easing the tacks\n whenever practicable.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sailing to Leeward, or Scudding, is the art of sailing\n the boat when she is running before the wind. Skill and\n caution are more requisite than when you sail against the\n wind, because the sails are apt to unexpectedly gybe, when\n a mast or a sail may be carried away before you know where\n you are. Much, very much, depends on the watchfulness\n and skill of the helmsman.

The movement of the feet on either side of\n the driving wheel is simply an up-and-down motion similar\n to that of walking ; and by the impulsion thus given a\n quicker or slower pace is accomplished at the will of the\n rider. The seat, or saddle, is fixed on a bar of iron a few\n inches above the fore wheel. The hands rest on a horizontal\n handle in front. This handle works on a pivot, and serves\n as a balancing pole, the equilibrium of the rider being\n preserved by a slight inclination of his body to the right or\n left. Indeed, the whole secret of riding a Bicycle depends\n on the attention given to the balance of the machine, and\n it is only by great practice that excellence on this machine\n can be attained. The two-wheeled Velocipede runs on the\n same principle as the Hoop; while it is kept upright, it\n travels forward safely. Both the Bicycle and the Tricycle\n are furnished with a brake, the application of which stops\n the motion of the wheels; and, if he is not very careful,\n topples the rider to the ground.\n</p>\n<p>\n The following are the rules furnished by a master of the\n art for the guidance of tyros on the Bicycle : \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Run beside your iron horse, leading it, as it were, with\n your hand, so as to familiarize yourself with its move-\n ments : this will be an affair of a few minutes merely. Then\n commence practicing with it on a slope, and after mount-\n ing it, let it move forward of its own accord, while you oc-\n cupy yourself with studying the effects produced by the\n inclination which you give to the balancing pole or handle\n of the machine.

The plain imported reel\n is very good ; but if you are able to obtain a multiplying\n reel, get an American one, as those made in England are\n very apt to be fitted with brass internal wheels, the cogs of\n which are very poor.

For catch-\n ing shiners, a stout piece of homespun thread will answer,\n and with this, and a No. 11 hook, you can capture a half-\n pound sunfish or perch, if need be. For your principal line,\n a plaited silk, or well twisted hemp, is best, measuring fifty\n yards. It should be boiled in linseed oil before being used,\n which will add to its durability, and render it less liable to\n kink. For large pike, where you troll for them, you should\n get a stout cotton or hemp line.\n</p>\n<p>\n FLOATS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Floats are usually made of corks or quills \u2014 sometimes of\n red cedar or white pine, and are either egg-shaped, or made\n like two long, narrow cones, joined at their bases.

The\n time of taking them is from April to July, and they are\n treated, either to the fly, worms, or minnows. You want a\n heavy rod, with a very large reel, and from three to six\n hundred feet of line. A swivel sinker and cedar float are to\n be used, when you fish with live bait, and your hook is a\n No. 0, 1, 2, or 3, Limerick, with a strong leader of twisted\n gut, from three to six feet in length.\n</p>\n<p>\n For worm-fishing, put on your worm head first, and leave\n about a half inch of the tail to wriggle ; throw gently in\n the current, draw it up quietly after it has floated down,\n keeping the bait continually in motion. Keep a tight line\n when he bites, but do not strike too soon. Allow him to\n gorge, then strike suddenly and sharply. If the bite should\n be only a sudden jerk, pay no attention to it \u2014 it is merely a\n nibble, but wait till he returns. When he does, look sharp.\n Play him gently but firmly. Let him have line enough as\n he goes from you, but as he returns, reel up. Try and keep\n him clear of stumps and rocks ; be patient, and as cool as\n you can, and he will exhaust himself. Draw him gently to\n shore, put the hook in his gills, and land him,\n</p>\n<p>\n .

He will be found everywhere, especially in\n muddy bottoms, and boys need no instruction about catching\n him. Bobbing for eels is very amusing sport. You string\n worms on threads, by running a blunt-pointed long needle\n through them from head to tail. When you have enough\n strings threaded, you tie the ends together, and then fold\n them into a regular hank, like a hank of yarn. This you\n double and treble, until it is about four inches long. Through\n the middle you tie a stout cord, to the bottom of which is a\n round dipsy. Over this last the two ends of the bunch,\n which should be about the size of a boy\u2019s fist, hang. You\n anchor your boat on the muddy flats of a river, at high tide,\n or lean over the bank of a creek or river at a muddy bottom,\n and drop in your bob and sinker. Presently you feel a sharp\n pull.

instrument is to represent,\n in a dark room, on a white wall or cloth, a succession of\n enlarged figures, of remarkable natural or grotesque ob-\n jects. The figure on this page is a representation of one.\n It consists of a tin box, with a funnel on the top, repre-\n sented by e, and a door on one side of it. This funnel, by\n being bent, as shown in the figure, serves the double pur-\n pose of letting out the smoke, and keeping in the light. In\n the middle of the bottom of the box is placed a movable\n tin lamp, a, which must have two or three good lights, at\n the height of the centre of the polished tin reflector, c. In\n the front of the box, opposite the reflector, is fixed a tin\n tube, m, in which there slides another tube, n. The sliding\n tube has, at its outer\n extremity, a convex\n lens, of about two\n inches diameter ; the\n tube, m, also has a con-\n vex lens fixed in it, as\n shown in the figure, of\n three inches diameter.\n</p>\n<p>\n The focus of the small-\n er of these lenses may\n be about five inches.\n</p>\n<p>\n Between the tube, m,\n</p>\n<p>\n and the lamp, there must be a slit or opening (as at ii), to\n admit of the passage of glass slides, mounted in paper or\n wooden frames, such as are represented on next page ; upon\n which slides it is that the miniature figures are painted,\n which are intended to be shown upon the wall. The dis-\n tinctness of the enlarged figures depends not only upon the\n goodness of the magnifying glass, but upon the clearness\n of the light yielded by the lamp, a.

To increase the surprise, you may make the\n loop as small as possible. This apparent piece of manual\n dexterity is performed by passing that end of the string\n marked a, as quickly as possible round the top of the thumb,\n so as to come between the forefinger and thumb : it will\n thus get into the loop, and you will seem to have passed the\n end through it.\n</p>\n<p>\n TO SUSPEND A RING BY A BURNT THREAD.\n</p>\n<p>\n The thread having been previously soaked two or three times\n in common salt and water, tie it to a ring, not larger than\n a wedding ring.

The nature of elastic springs will require no other\n apparatus for its elucidation than Jack-in-the-box and the\n numerous leaping-frogs and cats with which the play-room\n abounds. The leathern sucker will exemplify the nature of\n cohesion , and the effect of water in filling up those inequali-\n ties by which contiguous surfaces are deprived of their attrac-\n tive power ; it will, at the same time, demonstrate the nature\n of a vacuum , and the influence of atmospheric pressure. The\n squirt will afford a further illustration of the same views, and\n will furnish a practical proof of the weight of the atmo-\n sphere in raising a column of water.

Were it not for this resistance\n of the air, a hailstone falling from the clouds would acquire\n such a momentum, from its accelerated velocity, as to descend\n like a bullet from a gun, and destroy every thing before it ;\n even those genial showers which refresh us in the spring and\n summer months, would, without such a provision, destroy\n the herbage they are so well calculated to cherish.

It is a force of very extensive\n application ; there is scarcely a machine wherein the elasticity\n of one or more solids is not essentially concerned. Nature,\n also, avails herself of this property to accomplish many of her\n purposes. Fleas and locusts are enabled to jump two hun-\n dred times the height of their own bodies by means of a\n springy membrane, easily visible by a microscope ; so that,\n supposing the same relative force to be infused into the body\n of a man six feet high, he would be enabled to leap three\n times the height of St. Paul\u2019s.

When I whirled round the sling, I im-\n parted a projectile force to the stone, but it was prevented\n from flying off in consequence of the counteracting or cen-\n tripetal force of the string ; but the moment I let go my hold\n of this, the stone flew off in a right line : having been released\n from confinement to the fixed or central point, it was acted\n upon by one force only, and motion produced by a single\n force is, as you have just stated, always in a right line.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c But,\u201d observed Louisa, \u201c the stone did not proceed in a\n straight, but in a curved line : I watched its direction from\n the moment it left the sling till it fell to the ground.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cYou are perfectly correct,\u201d replied Mr. Seymour; \u201cit\n described a curve, which is called a parabola ; but that wa#\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0350/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 465}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0350/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 930}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0350/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1860}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0350/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3720}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0350/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0350.jp2", "height": 3720, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 482597}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"350\">\n<p>\n 78\n</p>\n<p>\n PHILOSOPHY IN SPORt\n</p>\n<p>\n owing to the influence of a new force which came into play\n viz., that of gravity, the effect of whicli I shall have to ex\n plain hereafter.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 44 I cannot understand,\u201d said Tom, \u201c why the stone should\n not have fallen out of the sling when you whirled it round\n oyer your head.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n 44 Because, my dear, it was acted upon by the centrifugal\n force, which counteracted that of gravity ; but I will render\n this fact more evident, by a very simple and beautiful exper-\n iment.

Now, since the\n power of gravity and the resistance of the ' air will always be\n greater than any force of projection we can give a body, the\n latter must be gradually overcome, and the body brought to\n the ground ; but the stronger the projectile force, the longer\n will those powers be in subduing it, and the further will the\n body go before it falls. A shot fired from a cannon, for in-\n stance, will go much further than a stone thrown from your\n hand. Had 1 lie two forces which acted upon the stone, viz.,\n those of projection and gravity, both produced uniform mo-\n tion, the body must certainly have descended through the\n diagonal ; but since gravity, as you have already learned, is\n an accelerating force, the body is made to describe a curve\n instead of a straight line. This law, however, will require\n the aid of a diagram for its explanation. Let x represent the\n ball at its greatest alti-\n tude, x r the force of\n gravity drawing it\n downward; and x z\n that of projection. We\n have here, then, two\n lorces acting in the di-\n rection of the two sides\n of a parallelogram .

It is from a\n similar cause that the bullet, unless rifled, will have a ten-\n dency to go to the right or left, from any unequal impulse\n which it may have received at the moment of its exit from\n the barrel. I have yet one other question, and, as its answer\n will lead us into the consideration of a mechanical subject of\n some importance, I must beg you to bestow all your atten-\n tion. In trundling your hoop, have you not often observed\n that, although the blow inflicted upon it by your stick might\n have been violent, yet the effect produced by it was compara-\n tively small, in consequence of the hoop having been struck\n by a disadvantageous part of the stick ?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Certainly ! I have frequently observed that, if the hoop\n is struck by the stick either too near the hand, or too neai\n the end, much of its force is lost ; and I have also noticed\n the same thing in striking the ball with my cricket-bat.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n u The fact is,\u201d said Mr. Seymour, \u201c that every striking\n body has what is termed its center of percussion , in which all\n the pei cutient force of a body is, as it were, collected ; thus\n a stick of a cylindrical figure, supposing the center of motion\n at the hand, will strike the greatest blow at a point about\n two-thirds of its length from the wrist.

Let\n a b o be a top spinning in an ob-\n lique position, having the end of\n the peg, on which it spins, brought\n to a fine point. It will continue\n to spin in the direction in which\n it reaches the ground, without the\n least tendency to rise into a more\n vertical position ; and it is by its\n rotatory or centrifugal force that it is kept in this origina.\n position : for if we conceive the top divided into two equa.\n parts a and b, by a plane passing through the line x o, and\n suppose that ut any moment during its spinning the connec-\n tion between these two parts were suddenly dissolved, then\n would any point in the part a fly off with the given force in\n \u00ab,he direction of the tangent, and any corresponding point in\n the part b witli an equal force in an opposite direction '\n while, therefore, these two parts remain connected together\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0368/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 465}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0368/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 930}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0368/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1860}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0368/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3720}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0368/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0368.jp2", "height": 3720, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 492849}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"368\">\n<p>\n 96\n</p>\n<p>\n PHILOSOPHY IN SPORT\n</p>\n<p>\n during the spinning of the top, these two equal and opposit\u00ab\n forces a and b will balance each other, and the top will son*\n tinue to spin on its original axis. Having thus shown that\n the rotatory or centrifugal force can never make the top rise\n from an oblique to a vertical position, I shall proceed to ex-\n plain the true cause of this change, and I trust you will be\n satisfied that it depends upon the bluntness of the point. Let\n a b o be a top spinning in an oblique position, terminating in\n a very short point with a hemispherical shoulder p\u00abm, It\n is evident that, in this case, the top will not spin upon a, the\n end of the true axis x a, but upon p, a point in the circle p m\n to which the floor i f is a tangent. Instead, therefore, of re-\n volving upon a fixed and stationary point, the top will roll\n round upon the small circle p m on its blunt point, with very\n considerable friction, the force\n of which maybe represented\n by a line o p at right angles to\n the floor i f, and to the spher-\n ical end of the peg of the top :\n now it is the action of this\n force, by its pressure on one\n side of the blunt point of the -i\n top, which causes it to rise in\n a vertical direction. Produce\n the line o p till it meets the axis\n o ; from the point o draw the\n line o t perpendicular to the axis a x, and t o parallel to it ;\n and then, by a resolution of forces, the line t o will represent\n that part of the friction which presses at right angles to the\n axis, so as gradually to raise it in a vertical position; in\n which operation the circle p m gradually diminishes by the\n approach of the point p to a, as the axis becomes more per-\n pendicular, and vanishes when the point p coincides with the\n point a, that is to say, when the top has arrived at its vertica.\n position, where it will continue to deep, without much friction,\n or any other disturbing force, until its rotatory motion fails\n and its side is brought to the earth by the for 3e of gravity.\u2019\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0369/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 287, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 467}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0369/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 575, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 935}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0369/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1150, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1871}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0369/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3742}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0369/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0369.jp2", "height": 3742, "width": 2301, "levels": 6, "size": 393010}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"369\">\n<p>\n MADE SCIENCE IN EARNEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n 97\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Seymour, having observed his children busily engaged\n at the game of Trap and Ball, determined, as usual, to make\n it subservient to scientific instruction.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Now, lorn, let me see how far you have profited by our\n late conversation.

All, therefore, that is necessary, is to\n keep the working barrel within the limits of atmospheric pres-\n sure ; we have then only to fix a continued straight pipe to\n the top of the barrel, and to lengthen the piston-rod in the\n same proportion, and the water will continue to rise at each\n successive stroke of the pump, until at length it will flow over\n the top of the pipe, or through a spout inserted in any part of\n its side.

The next point, there-\n fore, was to ascertain whether the\n two sides of the bow were in equi-\n librio, which he determined by\n balancing the lath on the finger,\n and observing whether it remained\n horizontal, or dipped on either side.\n</p>\n<p>\n This adjustment having been accomplished, Mr. Seymour next\n continued the string from d across the skeleton to the oppo\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0419/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 287, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 467}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0419/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 575, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 935}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0419/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1150, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1871}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0419/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2301, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3742}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0419/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0419.jp2", "height": 3742, "width": 2301, "levels": 6, "size": 455163}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"419\">\n<p>\n MADE SCIENCE IN EARNEST.\n</p>\n<p>\n 147\n</p>\n<p>\n lite notch a, giving it one turn round the lath in *ts way\n from a it was carried to/\u2019 and wound round the top of th\u00ab\n lath, and then again fastened at d ; from d it was extende d\n rather more than midway down the lath, and having been\n secured at b, was finally carried to, and secured in the notch\n a.

If you will look at this,\n arrow, you will perceive that the feathers are placed nearly,\n but not quite, in planes passing through it : if the feathers\n were exactly in this plane, the air could not strike against\n their surfaces when the arrow is in motion : but since they\n are not perfectly straight, but always a little aslant, the air\n necessarily strikes them as the arrow moves forward ; by\n which force the feathers are turned round, and with them the\n arrow or reed ; so that a motion is generated about its axis ;\n and its velocity will increase with the obliquity of the feathers.\n You will therefore observe that, in order to enable the feathers\n to offer a necessary resistance to the air, they must possess a\n certain degree of stiffness or inflexibility.

From the death of Richard till\n the splendid victories of Edward III., we hear little of the\n cross bow as a military weapon. Its use appears to have\n been principally confined to the sieges of fortified places, and\n to sea-fights. In 1346, at the battle of Cressy, a large body\n of Genoese soldiers, who were particularly expert in its man-\n agement, were in the service of the French ; but at the com-\n mencement of the action, a sudden shower wetted the strings\n and prevented the archers from doing their usual execution,\n while the English were still capable of annoying their enemies\n by the long bow with complete success ; both this victory\n and that of Poictiers, ten years afterward, were chiefly as-\n cribed by the English to their archers. In 1403, at the battle\n of Shrewsbury, where Hotspur was slain, the archers on both\n sides did terrible execution ; and the victory of Agincourt, in\n 1415, was entirely owing to their skill. Under Edward IV.\n an ordinance was made, that every Englishman and Irish-\n man, dwelling in England, should have a bow of his own\n height, to be made of yew, wych, hazel, ash, or any other\n seasonable tree, according to their power. By Henry VII.\n and his son Henry VIII. the use of the cross-bow was en-\n tirely forbidden ; and a penalty of ten pounds was to be\n inflicted on every man in whose house one might be found.\n From this time they seem to have been chiefly used for killing\n deer.* Henry VIII. compelled every father to provide a\n long-bow and two arrows for liis son at seven years old.\n Edward VI., Elizabeth, and James, all encouraged archery ;\n John Lyon, who founded Harrow school in 1590, two years\n before his death, drew up rules for its direction, whereby the\n amusements of the scholars were confined to \u2018 driving a top,\n tossing a hand-ball, running, and shooting.\u2019 The last-men-\n tioned diversion is in a manner insisted on by the founder,\n who requires all parents to furnish their children with bow-\n string, shafts, and tresters, to exei cise shooting.

In the first place, you acknowledge that\n your imagination had been previously excited during your\n ramble through the wood, and more especially by your rev-\n erie at the statue* of Time ; now it is well known that such a\n condition of the mind prepares and adapts the organs ot\n vision for those illusions which I am about to explain.

The actual state of the eye itself will also greatly as-\n sist in completing such an illusion ; for, in consequence of the\n small degree of light, the pupil expands to nearly the whole\n width of the iris, in order to collect every ray, and in such\n a condition it cannot accommodate itseff to see near objects\n distinctly ; so that the form of a body actually becomes more\n shadowy and confused when it comes within the very dis\n , ' ance at which we count upon obtaining the best view of it.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c You have certainly explained the reason why bodies seer\n under a faint illumination may appear distorted and carica-\n tui-ed ; indeed, I now remember that Sir Walter Scott, In hij\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0456/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 293, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 465}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0456/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 586, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 930}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0456/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1172, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1860}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0456/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2344, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3720}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bo:ys:ow:nb:oo:kc:om:pl:00:un:se:boysownbookcompl00unse:boysownbookcompl00unse_0456/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bo/ys/ow/nb/oo/kc/om/pl/00/un/se/boysownbookcompl00unse/boysownbookcompl00unse_0456.jp2", "height": 3720, "width": 2344, "levels": 6, "size": 488901}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"456\">\n<p>\n 184\n</p>\n<p>\n PHILOSOPHY Ui SPORT\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018 Pirate,\u2019 has given us a very good illustration : for Cleveland,\n when abandoned on Coffin-bay, is said to have seen many s\n dim and undefined specter in the misty dawn.

It was on a moonlight night last August, when stroll-\n ing along a neighboring meadow, enjoying the beauties of the\n evening, that I met a young farmer, an intelligent person,\n although a little inclined to a belief in the marvelous, who,\n on approaching with a hasty step, thus accosted me : \u2014 \u2018 You\n have often ridiculed my belief in fairies, and of their being the\n cause of those rings which go by their name; you may now,\n if you please, satisfy yourself of their reality, if you will only\n \u2022\u2022et lrn with me to the elm-close, which, as you know, abounds\n with fairy-rings. Within the last few minutes I have actually\n see them at their gambols under the great elm ; they are, sir,\n tiny beings, which, as far as I could judge at a distance, can-\n not be more than a few inches in height ; but there they are,\n frisking away most merrily to tinkling musio.

I have stated that they may be re-\n ferred to three principal classes ; but I must at the same time\n observe that, in some cases, the vibrations of solid bodies are\n made to co-operate with those of a given portion of air ; for\n example, trumpets and various horns may be said to be\n mixed wind instruments, since their sound is produced by the\n joint vibrations of the air and a solid body; and in certain\n stringed instruments, as in the violin, the immediate effect of\n the strings is increased by means of a sounding-board, which\n appears to be agitated by their motion, and to act more pow-\n erfully on the air than the strings could have done alone.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c I apprehend that this mixture must obtain more or less\n in all instruments,\u201d said the vicar.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Not at all.

This property of sounding bodies,\n</p>\n<p>\n which to the ignorant must appear as an inexplicable species\n of sympathy, will be more fully explained in a note (15) ; at\n present we shall merely give one or two examples of its\n effects. A singer has been known to break into pieces a large\n tumbler-glass by the power of his voice ; and a violin sus-\n pended against a wall may be heard to yield the same notes\n as those produced by a performer on a similar instrument in\n the same room. To produce such an effect, however, one\n condition is indispensable, that the body to be put in vibra-\n tion must be in unison, or agreeing in pitch, with the one com-\n municating the sound. Hence the necessity of so adapting\n the capacity of the mouth, in playing the Jew\u2019s-harp, as to\n make the column of air which it contains to reciprocate the\n sound of its tongue. The subject was agreeably concluded\n by some anecdotes which were related by Miss Villers, in\n proof of the astonishing powers of this little instrument when\n directed by the skill of a master. For the sake of those who\n may be curious upon this subject, we have introduced an ac-\n count of two great performers, in an additional note (16).

Suppose the image\n on the retina had vanished at the same time with the with-\n drawal of the object ; we should, in that case, have been un-\n able to see the things immediately around us in due connec-\n tion with each other ; the objects must have appeared isola-\n ted, in detached parts, by means of separate impressions\n which the eye would be unable to combine into a whole, un-\n less indeed they came to us at a very acute angle.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c I admit the plausibility of your theory,\u201d said the vicar ;\n \u201c but it appears to me that objects frequently linger on the\n sight for a longer period than that which you assign to them.\n I well remember seeing the flame of a candle for several sec-\n onds after it had been suddenly withdrawn from the apart-\n ment.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI admit that si rong lights frequently continue for some\n time thus visible in the \u2018 mind\u2019s eye and it is well known\n that such impressions are often followed by images of similar\n shape, successively assuming different colors.
