The ancestors of this extra-\n ordinary man, in the year 1657, emigrated from Eng-\n land to America, and settled in the colony of Vir-\n ginia ; here, by unremiting industry they became\n opulent and respectable, and gave their name to the\n parish of Washington, in Westmoreland county\u2014\n George Washington, the hero of the following his-\n tory, was tne fruit of a second marriage, and was\n born in the settlement of Chotank, in the above-\n mentioned county, on the lltii of February, (O.S }\n I733i '\n</p>\n<p>\n . extensive settlement of Chotank was origin-\n ally purchased by the Washington family ; the ex-\n treme fertility ot the soil induced those settlers to\n cultivate tobacco in several plantations ; for this pur-\n pose they purchased a number of negro slaves, and\n consequently population was rapidly increased\u2014\n At the time our hero was born, all the planters\n throughout this extensive settlement were his rela-\n tions hence, his youthful years glided away in all\n the pleasing gaity of social friendship. He received\n a private education, and was initiated in the elements\n of Religion, Morality, and Science by a private tutor ;\n and, fr < m the tenor of his actions it is manifest, that\n uncommon pains were taken to cherish the best pro-\n pensities of human nature in his heart:\n</p>\n<p>\n In the 10th year of his age, he had the misfortune\n to lose an excellent father, who died in 1742, and the\n patrimonial estate devolved to an elder brother \u2014\n Tins young gentleman had been an officer, in the\n Colonial troops sent in the expedition against Car-\n thagena. On his return he called the family mansion\n Mount \\crnon, in honour of the British Admiral,\n and destined his brother George* to serve in the navy.\n</p>\n<p>\n Accordingly, in his 15th year, our hero was entered\n as a midshipman, on board a British frigate, station-\n ed on the coast of Virginia.

The aggressions of\n France now alarmed Mr. Adams\u2019 administration, and\n that they might be prepared to resist open hostility\n they found it expedient to embody their army. Con-\n vinced of the abilities and integrity of that venerable\n man, whose valour had been instrumental to the\n emancipation of his country, Congress appointed\n Washington Commander in Chief of the armies.

Some trees were to be cut\n down, and others preserved. On Friday, the day be-\n fore he died, he spent some time by the side of the\n river, marking the former. There came a fall of\n snow, which did not deter him from his pursuit, but\n 1 he continued till his neck and hair were quite cover-\n !i ed with snow. He spent the evening with Mrs,\n Washington, reading the newspapers, which came by\n the mail that evening : he went to bed as usual about\n 9 o\u2019clock, waked up in the night, and found himself\n extremely unwell, but would not allow Mrs. Washing-\n ton to get up, or the servants to be waked. In the\n morning, finding himself very ill, Dr. Craik of Alexan-\n dria, was sent for. Soon after his arrival, two con-\n sulting physicians were called in, but all would not\n avail. On Saturday he died. He said to Col Lear a,\n little before his death, \u201c bury me decently, and not\n till two days after my decease.\u201d To Dr. Craik he\n said, \u201c I die a very hard death, but I am not afraid to\n die.\u201d Before he breathed his last, he laid himself on\n his back, placed his hands before him, and closed his\n own mouth and eyes.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Philadelphia, Dec. 19.\n</p>\n<p>\n On Saturday the 14th inst. died at his seat in Viry\n | ginia, General George Washington, Commander in\n 1 Chief of the Armies, and late President of the Con-\n gress, of the United States of America \u2014 mature in\n years, covered with glory, and rich in the affection*\n F 2\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bi:og:ra:ph:ic:al:me:mo:00:co:rr:_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0_0066/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 185, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 330}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bi:og:ra:ph:ic:al:me:mo:00:co:rr:_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0_0066/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 371, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 661}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bi:og:ra:ph:ic:al:me:mo:00:co:rr:_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0_0066/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 742, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1322}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bi:og:ra:ph:ic:al:me:mo:00:co:rr:_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0_0066/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1484, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2645}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bi:og:ra:ph:ic:al:me:mo:00:co:rr:_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0_0066/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bi/og/ra/ph/ic/al/me/mo/00/co/rr/_0/biographicalmemo00corr_0/biographicalmemo00corr_0_0066.jp2", "height": 2645, "width": 1484, "levels": 6, "size": 429329}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"66\">\n<p>\n 6S LIFE OF WASHINGTON\u2019.\n</p>\n<p>\n of a free people, and the admiration of the whole civ >\n ili zed world.\n</p>\n<p>\n When men of common character are swept from\n the theatre of life, they die without the tribute of\n public concern, as they had lived without a claim to\n public esteem \u2014 but when personages of great and ex-\n alted worth are summoned from this sublunary scene,\n their death calls forth a burst of general regret, and\n invigorates the flame of public gratitude.

Not unconscious, in the outset, of the\n inferiority of my qualifications, experience in mvown\n eyes, perhaps still more in the eyes of others, has\n strengthened the motives to diffidence of myself;\n and every day the increasing weight of years admon*\n islies me more and more that the shade of retirement\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bi:og:ra:ph:ic:al:me:mo:00:co:rr:_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0_0077/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 188, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 330}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bi:og:ra:ph:ic:al:me:mo:00:co:rr:_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0_0077/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 376, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 661}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bi:og:ra:ph:ic:al:me:mo:00:co:rr:_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0_0077/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 752, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1322}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bi:og:ra:ph:ic:al:me:mo:00:co:rr:_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0_0077/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 1505, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2645}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:bi:og:ra:ph:ic:al:me:mo:00:co:rr:_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0:biographicalmemo00corr_0_0077/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/bi/og/ra/ph/ic/al/me/mo/00/co/rr/_0/biographicalmemo00corr_0/biographicalmemo00corr_0_0077.jp2", "height": 2645, "width": 1505, "levels": 6, "size": 444641}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"77\">\n<p>\n It\n</p>\n<p>\n LIFE OF WASHINGTON \" .\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00bb* as necessary to me as it will be welcome.
