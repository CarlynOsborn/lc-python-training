He expressed the\n opinion, that the publication of a book of this char\u00ac\n acter would not only be highly interesting, but that\n it would be the means of making the Jews better\n understood, and consequently insure for them greater\n esteem and regard from their brethren of other creeds.\n Having pondered over his remarks, and concluded\n that there was much force in them, I decided to write\n such a volume. The object, therefore, of this book,\n is to give a faithful and authentic account of our pub\u00ac\n lic and private religious, domestic, and ceremonial\n observances, as established in former years, accompa\u00ac\n nied by characteristic illustrations and explanations\n of them.
