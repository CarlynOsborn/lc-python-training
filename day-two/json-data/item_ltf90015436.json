And by the time\n the Council had finished its course of tyranny and crime,\n they were ready to act. After the death of Huss and Je-\n rome the Bohemians were not to be trified with.

Zwingli came\n from a shepherd\u2019s hut; Malancthon, from an armorer\u2019s\n work shop ; Luther from a miner\u2019s cottage ; Calvin from an\n humble French village home.

Weak and discouraged, he was about\n to retire to his room to fast, when, in a moment of absent-\n mindedness, he paused in front of a house, and bent his\n head in sad reflections.

This was an additional blow to the\n Papacy. Pope Pius II. had pronounced excommunication\n against any one, though he be the emperor, who should so\n impugn the supreme authority of the Pope. The general\n feeling of the German people so endorsed the position of\n Luther that the Pope became alarmed, and suddenly made\n overtures for reconciliation. Rome always so acts when\n she wants to allay popular indignation and mistrust. She\n is playing that card in the United States at present. And\n as Rome plays this act of high deception it is difficult to\n tell, whether her spirit of hypocrisy, or ways of sophistry,\n excel.\n</p>\n<p>\n In carrying out his attempt at reconciliation, the Pope\n dispatched a special nuncio to Germany.

The cause of truth was moving up,\n with a growing power that was sweeping him on farther\n than he knew. His sermons at Wittemberg, and as well\n his lectures, were heard by immense multitudes. The most\n distinguished young men of the empire flocked the univer-\n sity. Luther wrote to a friend : \u201c Our city can scarce hold\n the numbers that are coming.

It was a passion \u2014 a\n mania, indeed. To keep up their power and splendor, the\n Popes were everlastingly originati ng new plans to drain the\n countries of Europe of money. Every ecclesiastic had to\n give the Pope the first year\u2019s income. Besides this, they\n had frequent special taxes laid upon them. The most de-\n sirable vacancies were put up at auction, and sold to the\n highest bidder.

The most holy teachings of the Scriptures\n were made to fit into this. Christ had shed more blood\n than was really necessary. This additional, or surplus\n blood, the priests had at their disposal, and would dispose\n of, for money, to give pardon to those who would buy.\n</p>\n<p>\n PAGAN ORIGIN OF PURGATORY.\n</p>\n<p>\n But this was only available for sins committed, after con-\n necting with the Church. There was no opportunity on\n earth to expiate sins committed prior thereto; and for\n those committed even after joining the Church, and not ab-\n solved by the priests. Hence some provision had to be de-\n vised for this to be done after this life. The ancient Pa-\n gans had a notion that there was a purifying fire, in which\n souls were to be purified. Some of the early priests of the\n Church held to the same thing. It could be made a great\n source for gain in the Roman Church. So the Pope issued\n his bull, m2i^uig purgatory a doctrine of the Church. He\n declared that men expiated in this place those sins not ex-\n piated in this life, and that indulgences could be purchased,\n freeing them from the sins that held them in bondage in\n purgatory. It is remarked how well the doctrine of purga-\n tory, and that of the indulgences, suited each other. It was\n a double-header. It did great credit to a court that was af-\n ter money, and cared nothing for the present or future wel-\n fare of the souls of its subjects.

It opened a rare chance for revenue, and it\n was not in the mind of any Pope to overlook such an op-\n portunity. Leo had a mighty scheme in his plan for the\n extension of personal and Papal power. He would push\n the trade in indulgences in all the world, and accumulate\n vast fortunes to carry on the designs of the Papacy, and\n pay the enormous expenses required for the pleasures of\n the Papal court. Leo dispatched the indulgences to Ger-\n many, and designated Archbishop Albert commissioner to\n direct the sale. Albert was himself to have a goodly share\n of the money gathered in by the sale. He was fired with a\n desire to make the sale larger than any other country. He\n appointed the corrupt Dominican friar, Tetzel, his chief\n agent, and put him in the field.

Amid sun and storm, lightning glare and\n thunder roar, they would live among the heights. This\n proved a mighty training for the thoughtful mind. It\n could not but develop the heroic elements of both heart and\n mind. Such was the task of young Zwingli for a number\n of summers. It proved a great training ground for him.\n It was to him what Horeb was to Moses, and the wilderness\n was to John the Baptist. There was unmistakable provi-\n dence in it. His lungs were being filled with the stimulating\n air of the Alps, as his mind was being expanded by com-\n munion with the very sublimities of nature, and reflection\n on the attributes of God.

The Pope flattered him with\n an annual gift to purchase books. But when he began to\n suspect that it might be an attempt to win him to the Papal\n intention, to crush out the independence of the Swiss Can-\n tons, he told the Papal agents, in clear and express terms,\n that they must not fancy, that for their money he would\n withhold one iota of the truth ; so they might take back, or\n give, as they pleased.\n</p>\n<p>\n When chaplain in the army, he often addressed his coun-\n trymen in arms on devotion to country and allegiance to\n the cause of liberty, justice and independence.

Living in the very citadels of the\n Alps, along the slopes of the inaccessible ihountains, and\n upon the shores of lakes which had no name in history,\n they were being prepared for centuries, by God and their\n natural environs, to be ready, in the fulness of the right\n time, to follow a prepared leader. Zwingli arose, a pre-\n pared patriot, to lead prepared patriots to liberty and in-\n dependence. Germany did not dispatch her own Reforma-\n tion over into Switzerland. The brave Swiss began their own\n Reformation, on their own volition, out of their own native\n spirit of freedom, and under their inherited sense of Swiss\n rights and liberties, the traditions of which had been pre-\n served through the centuries, during which Rome had been\n growing in oppressive measures.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ro:ma:np:ap:ac:yi:ts:ri:00:he:rs:romanpapacyitsri00hers:romanpapacyitsri00hers_0248/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 305, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 498}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ro:ma:np:ap:ac:yi:ts:ri:00:he:rs:romanpapacyitsri00hers:romanpapacyitsri00hers_0248/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 610, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 997}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ro:ma:np:ap:ac:yi:ts:ri:00:he:rs:romanpapacyitsri00hers:romanpapacyitsri00hers_0248/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1221, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1994}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ro:ma:np:ap:ac:yi:ts:ri:00:he:rs:romanpapacyitsri00hers:romanpapacyitsri00hers_0248/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2442, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3989}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ro:ma:np:ap:ac:yi:ts:ri:00:he:rs:romanpapacyitsri00hers:romanpapacyitsri00hers_0248/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ro/ma/np/ap/ac/yi/ts/ri/00/he/rs/romanpapacyitsri00hers/romanpapacyitsri00hers_0248.jp2", "height": 3989, "width": 2442, "levels": 6, "size": 625336}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"248\">\n<p>\n 224\n</p>\n<p>\n THE ROMAN RAP ACT,\n</p>\n<p>\n HOW LIBEETY AHD EDUCATION WERE LOST.\n</p>\n<p>\n Botli liberty and education bad once bad a borne in those\n Swiss Cantons north of the Rhone.

Schools\n were general, and high in quality.

X., at Bologna, in 1515. The\n agreement arrived at resulted in a complete sacrifice of the\n rights of both Church and State to the Pope and king, who\n had agreed to divide between them the trophies of their\n unseemly spoliation. Later, in the cathedral at Bologna,\n the king ratified this Papal treaty.

Geneva, having neither army\n nor territory, was to be elevated into a free republic\n by pure moral strength. It conquered as a city of the\n mind, a republic of thought ! It was a city of gray an-\n tiquity. We frequently meet with it in the writings of\n Caesar. It had long felt the throes of liberty ; but not un-\n til the sixteenth century did it see its way clear to throw\n off the Papal yoke.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Papacy was both tyrannical and corrupt in dealing\n with the people. At the time Calvin went to Geneva bishops\n and dukes were equally odious. The Genevese could no\n longer endure \u201cPopes who were Caesars, nor Caesars who\n were Popes.\u2019\u2019 Under Calvin the strivings for liberty were\n to be realized in established freedom. He was to make\n Geneva the metropolis of the sixteenth century liberties.\n In his plan for a free Church and a free state, bishops were\n to give place to pastors, and dukes to give way to repre-\n sentatives of the people. It was a long stride in represen-\n tative government.\n</p>\n<p>\n ORIGIN OF OUR PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM.\n</p>\n<p>\n He laid deep and lasting one of the mud sills of intelli-\n gence in religious matters, when he organized for the\n Genevese a general system of education. This was the\n origin of our common school system. The Papal Church\n had not only done nothing for common education, but had\n opposed and finally destroyed a public school established\n in the fifteenth century, by a layman.

This idea\n of the inherent superiority of ecclesiastical over civil law,\n must inevitably erase the first principles of liberty from the\n breast, and place the mental operations wholly at the\n disposal of the priesthood. In our large cities in the\n United States, in the State Legislatures, and in the manage-\n ment of national legislation at Washington, the hand\n of the priest is too often laid upon the civil operations ;\n and this is the hand of the ecclesiastical boss, which\n is invariably accompanied with a threat. The man of high\n and honorable character does not take kindly to such priest-\n ly interference. He is told he is not wanted.

Seventy thousand Italians came to the United States\n in 1806, and fifty thousand of them could not read or write.\n And yet education has progressed greatly in that country\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ro:ma:np:ap:ac:yi:ts:ri:00:he:rs:romanpapacyitsri00hers:romanpapacyitsri00hers_0343/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 305, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 498}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ro:ma:np:ap:ac:yi:ts:ri:00:he:rs:romanpapacyitsri00hers:romanpapacyitsri00hers_0343/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 610, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 997}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ro:ma:np:ap:ac:yi:ts:ri:00:he:rs:romanpapacyitsri00hers:romanpapacyitsri00hers_0343/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1221, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1994}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ro:ma:np:ap:ac:yi:ts:ri:00:he:rs:romanpapacyitsri00hers:romanpapacyitsri00hers_0343/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2442, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3989}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ro:ma:np:ap:ac:yi:ts:ri:00:he:rs:romanpapacyitsri00hers:romanpapacyitsri00hers_0343/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ro/ma/np/ap/ac/yi/ts/ri/00/he/rs/romanpapacyitsri00hers/romanpapacyitsri00hers_0343.jp2", "height": 3989, "width": 2442, "levels": 6, "size": 399399}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"343\">\n<p>\n 2 HE ROMAN PAPACY.\n</p>\n<p>\n 319\n</p>\n<p>\n during the last twenty years, because of the growing power\n of the State in affairs of education.

The\n principle of the Inquisition is found in the Roman Church,\n long before we meet with its organized form. As an organ-\n ized institution, or qualified tribunal to try heresy, it appears\n in the thirteenth century. It was the contrivance of the\n monk, Dominic, who was made the first Inquisitor General,\n by the Pope. Dominic was the founder of the Dominican\n order of monks, and had specially committed to them the\n Inquisition. The Council of Toulouse, in 1234, formally en-\n trusted the charge of the Inquisition to this order. In this\n early form it was instituted for the immediate purpose of\n suppressing the Bible readers in Spain, southern France,\n and the Piedmont country.\n</p>\n<p>\n The so-called Spanish Inquisition began in 1480, and was\n designed to destroy the Moors and Jews in Spain ; then it\n was directed against the Protestants.

And this grew out of two things, one of which\n is newly discovered in the ideas which were liberated by\n the revolution in the Netherlands. The divine right of\n kings was overthrown among the marshes of the low coun-\n tries of Holland. Philip\u2019s violent reign forfeited the claim\n of any divine right, in the opinion -of Dutch reason. If\n Philip II. had no divine right to rule, without the assent\n of. the people, then no ruler, by the accident of accession to\n a throne, held any divine right over a people, independent\n of their choice or will. From the surrender of the idea of\n the divine right of kings, it was an easy step to a like sur-\n render of the idea of the divine right of Popes. Priestcraft\n was a greater evil in the Netherlands than kingcraft.

Eome had never been\n taught this until Geneva established, from religious mo-\n tives as well as municipal expediency, a free republic, and\n made the conservation of her liberties a part of the relig-\n ious duties of citizens.

In our large cities in the\n United States, in the State Legislatures, and in the manage-\n ment of national legislation at Washington, the hand\n of the priest is too often laid upon the civil operations ;\n and this is the hand of the ecclesiastical boss, which\n is invariably accompanied with a threat. The man of high\n and honorable character does not take kindly to such priest-\n ly interference. He is told he is not wanted.

The beneficent\n influence upon the world, of the higher moral and intellect-\n ual impulse of Scotch civilization, has not been paralleled\n by that of any other country ; while the Scotch influence\n upon educational institutions, and the contribution of\n Scotland to the ranks of illustrious men, have been most re-\n markable. In the sixteenth century already Scotland\n brings forth the intellectual giants of Europe. The Scotch\n Reformation invaded the university, as well as the pulpit\n and the home. The Reformation in that land upheld\n scholarship, even with piety. The early Scotch Book of\n Discipline of the Reformed Church in Scotland contains a\n most thorough system of education. Education was looked\n upon as a religious duty, which they owed to God, as well\n as to themselves.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ro:ma:np:ap:ac:yi:ts:ri:00:he:rs:romanpapacyitsri00hers:romanpapacyitsri00hers_0432/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 305, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 498}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ro:ma:np:ap:ac:yi:ts:ri:00:he:rs:romanpapacyitsri00hers:romanpapacyitsri00hers_0432/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 610, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 997}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ro:ma:np:ap:ac:yi:ts:ri:00:he:rs:romanpapacyitsri00hers:romanpapacyitsri00hers_0432/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1221, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1994}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ro:ma:np:ap:ac:yi:ts:ri:00:he:rs:romanpapacyitsri00hers:romanpapacyitsri00hers_0432/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2442, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3989}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ro:ma:np:ap:ac:yi:ts:ri:00:he:rs:romanpapacyitsri00hers:romanpapacyitsri00hers_0432/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ro/ma/np/ap/ac/yi/ts/ri/00/he/rs/romanpapacyitsri00hers/romanpapacyitsri00hers_0432.jp2", "height": 3989, "width": 2442, "levels": 6, "size": 626549}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"432\">\n<p>\n 408\n</p>\n<p>\n THE ROMAN PAPACY.\n</p>\n<p>\n OUE CIVIL ATTD EELIGIOUS LIBERTIES ADVANCED.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our civil and religious liberties have received incalcula-\n ble benefits from the Scotch war upon the Papacy ;\n while the moral progress of the nation has been aided by\n those stout-hearted reformers to a most prodigious extent.\n As we think of them, meeting on the dark morasses, in the\n forests and among the hills, drinking peat water, and sleep-\n ing on heather, we are reminded of the times of Israel\u2019s\n prophets ; of Moses wandering about the foot of the moun-\n tain, which he is to climb in a mission to the fire-girt foot\n of God ; of Elijah in the cave listening to the mighty wind,\n the earthquake and the fire-chariots which go before the\n Lord ; of Ezekiel, astonished on the banks of the Chebar,\n or gazing on the valley of dry bones ; of John the Baptist,\n feeding on locusts and wild honey in the lone wilderness,\n and clad in garments of camel\u2019s hair.

It was a J une morning when he turned his\n back on Edinboro Castle, and walked slowly down Canon-\n gate Street, to Holyrood Palace, a mile away. Old Canon-\n gate is Scottish history fossilized. Here every tall building,\n with its winding stairs, armorial bearings, tapestried walls,\n and crazy roofs, has its tragic story of heroism, romance,\n and crime. Down this street tramped the followers of\n Douglas, and marched the courtiers of Queen Mary ; James\n rode up this street to Flodden Field ; here Jenny Oeddes\n flung the stool at the priest ; up this street came John\n Knox to his house, after his interview with Mary at Holy-\n rood ; here David Hume thought out his opinions on king-\n craft and priestcraft ; here Burns, the Ayrshire farmer, un-\n covered his head before the grave of poor Furgesson ; down\n this street, too, daily limped the boy, Walter Scott, peering\n into every close and lounging at every tavern. At every\n step is met some ghost of the long ago, and the shadows of\n centuries fall in grotesque figures over your path.

At times she seemed about to favor the\n Huguenots, as she thought she saw a way to advance her\n own ambitions. But such a move never gave any disposi-\n tion of just motive on her part. She was a fully ripened\n sample of the unscrupulous and selfish brutality of Papal\n womanhood, made so by mental and moral forces which\n were distinctly Romish. It is an open question, if she\n even felt any genuine emotions of love for right or for\n country. She belonged to a foreign family, which had\n never displayed any characteristics, or performed any acts\n of patriotism. One of her most constant companions asserted\n that she never displayed so much energy as in her efforts\n to deprave her own children.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cbloody mart\u201d of ENGLAND.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mary of England, another representative of Papal woman-\n hood, was so highly esteemed by the Popish leaders, that\n they held her up as a model to Mary Queen of Scots.

This\n furnishes us with an additional instance of the perfidy of\n Papal rulers, when under vows of clemency and protection.\n Mary exhibited towards the Protestants an insatiable cruel-\n ty.
