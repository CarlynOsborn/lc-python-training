No. 55\n</p>\n<p>\n 1901\n</p>\n<p>\n Copyrighted, 1901\n</p>\n<p>\n 3E impression which\n the preliminary de-\n scriptions of the Pan-\n American Exposition\n makes upon the read-\n er is that the artists\n have painted their\n fair red, and that the\n hilarious effects o f\n this achievement are\n going to color the atmosphere of the whole\n show. The actual effect, upon at least one\n observer, was quite different. As soon as my\n eye could untangle a little the maze of spires\n and towers, the blue dome of the government\n building caught and held it and set my mem-\n ory searching for those lines of Drake\u2019s,\n which aver that \u201cShe tore the azure robe of\n night,\u201d and which make some remarks about\n \u201cThe milky baldric of the skies.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Elue, not red, is the dominant note in this\n color scheme, which has set all the artists of\n the country bubbling with delight. The idea\n that the sky itself has been robbed, to give\n distance, majesty and freedom to the atmos-\n phere of this show of continents of freedom,\n is first forced upon you by the Government\n Building, but it is supported by the neighbor-\n ing domes of the Temples of Music and Eth-\n nology and the domes at the four corners of\n the Manufactures Building, which, at this\n fair, is called, rather pompously, the Building\n of Liberal Arts.\n</p>\n<p>\n It takes some time before the richness and\n warmth of the acres of red tile roofing and\n the gorgeous glory of some of these porticos\n impresses itself upon the eye. Even the bar-\n baric yawp of the red bases to the pillars of\n the arcade of the most prominently placed\n restaurant does not hold the eye more surely\n than the blues of these wondrous domes.\n</p>\n<p>\n I say blues advisedly, for there are two\n of them and they are not twins by a good\n deal. One come into the family on the Green\n side and the other is first cousin to the\n Whites and Grays. That brings us, right at\n the start, to the only family jar in the fair.\n I intended to leave the quarrel to the art-\n ists, but even a casual visitor can\u2019t help no-\n ticing that there is trouble among the Blues\n and it is as well to explain it at the start and\n then let the matter alone.\n</p>\n<p>\n The color scheme of the entire fair was\n put into the hands of the noted artist, C. Y.\n Turner. That is, everybody supposed it had\n been, only to find out at the last minute\n that it had not. Mr. Turner evolved a color\n scheme, beginning in the Machinery and\n Transportation Building with a ground tone\n</p>\n<p>\n almost as light as the dazzling White City\n at Chicago, and progressing by almost im-\n perceptible gradations around the Electric.\n Tow r er and down the sides of the Esplanade,\n where the ground tones grow darker, until\n away off across Mirror Lake, in the confines\n of Lincoln Park, you get things like the\n Forestry Building and the Woman\u2019s Build-\n ing, of the dull brown of our primitive log\n cabins, with touches of tropic richness in\n the Honduras Building and some of the\n homes of the Latin American countries.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Turner had six domes to paint right\n in the thick of the fair, and he chose for\n them a soft, grayish blue with broad ribs\n of gold. Near these, at the end of the T\n of the Esplanade, is the large United States\n Government Building, with a dome almost\n copied from that of the Congressional Library\n at Washington. That building was put up\n under the charge of the supervising archi-\n tect of the Treasury. Without regard to\n the feelings of the other buildings, he chose\n for his great dome a greenish blue which\n stands right up in meeting and cries out,\n \u201cLook at me.\u201d You have to look, too. It\n is a ceautiful crown of a beautiful building\u2014\n by itself. In the company in which it is\n placed \u2014 well, women w T ho have worn pale\n blue ball gowns only to meet this particular\n shade of greenish blue on the floor will\n understand the situation.\n</p>\n<p>\n If you hear people talking about color dis-\n cord at the fair this is what it means, and\n all it means. It is not a killing matter, but\n as color is the thing which distinguishes this\n fair from all its predecessors and the point\n in which Buffalo will set the pace for all fairs\n to be held for some time in the new cen-\n tury, it is well to get it out of the way first.\n On the day after the informal opening Mr.\n Turner said that his building stood in the\n fair like the instruments of an orchestra be-\n fore a concert, all waiting to be tuned. He\n was to devote the three weeks between the\n informal and the formal openings to putting\n them all in tune. That he did and did most\n successfully, with the one exception that he\n was not allowed to throw Buffalo clay at the\n dome of the Government Building and soften\n its radiance a little.\n</p>\n<p>\n But this simile of the orchestra puts the\n matter too seriously. It is more like a\n chorus where some of the singers occasional-\n ly sing flat. The trouble is momentary and\n only acutely musical ears appreciate it fully.\n Most of the music is all right. So you can\n wander for hours about this parti-colored\n fair without a discord striking the eye, and,\n at every turn of the head, with the richest,\n</p>\n<p>\n warmest strangest harmonies delighting the\n sight, dfie would hate to have to live up, to\n a house decorated with the richness and daz-\n zle of the porticos of the Building of Mines,\n for example, or those of the Temple of Mu-\n sic or the Electricity Building, while a town\n which had its city hall painted like the ma-\n jolica facades of the Horticultural Building\n would inevitably have a Coney Island and a\n Bowery. But for a six months\u2019 show the\n coloring adds richness and variety and at-\n tunes the fair to a festive note which is not\n to be appreciated until one has wandered\n around and feasted his eyes on its brilliance.\n</p>\n<p>\n The real standard of comparison for these\n buildings is not the serious architecture of\n a town intended to endure, but the mimic\n scenes of a theater. One would not care to\n keep house in the Temple of Thebes, as it is\n put upon the Metropolitan Opera House\n stage in \u201cAida,\u201d but it is great fun to see the\n gorgeous procession of Rhadames march\n through it to Verdi\u2019s music. This is a show,\n too, and that tropical magnificence and opu-\n lence is precisely the effect which the archi-\n tects and painters have created. After a\n man has met groups of Mexicans, Indians and\n Filipinos wandering around in their joy\n clothes, reveling in all this splendor, he feels\n that he should absorb pousse cafes to get\n himself into the warmth and glow of thd\n picture.\n</p>\n<p>\n But if you care anything about the artistic\n signficance of the fair, when you start to see\n it start right. I say this with the more posi-\n tiveness, because I tried to do so and failed,\n and because the practical sense of the Buf-\n falo street car managers has made the front\n door of the fair very hard to get at. That\n front door is through Lincoln Park and\n across the bridge of the large park lake.\n From that point the architects and painters\n have designed a slow crescendo up to the\n climax of the Electric Tower, which is to\n this fair what the Eiffel Tower was to Paris.\n But this Lincoln Park entrance is almost a\n mile from the tower, and the railroad com-\n panies have put trolley terminals down at\n the Midway, within a quarter of a mile of\n the Electric Tower, and the steam terminals\n even a shorter distance directly behind the\n tower. Thus they carry you right into the\n heart of the show in the shortest .time,\n which is what nine people in ten want. So\n general is this desire to save time and steps\n that if you ask for the car going to the Lin-\n coln Park entrance the average policeman or\n landlord will send you to one of the lines\n where the crowd is going. When you find\n what has happened it is too late; you have\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0006/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0006/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0006/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0006/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0006/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/gu/id/et/op/an/am/er/ic/00/un/se/guidetopanameric00unse/guidetopanameric00unse_0006.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 1035470}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"6\">\n<p>\n JOHN G.M1LBUR.N\n \\PR EVIDENT PAN ,\n \\ AMERICAN /\n</p>\n<p>\n vVnEXPosiTioN.rvi\n</p>\n<p>\n GUIDE TO THE PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION. 1901.\n</p>\n<p>\n seen the buildings first from the wrong side.\n That is what happened to me. Perhaps if\n you ask for the cars going out Forest ave-\n nue you may bring up at the real front door\n of the fair \u2014 unless your guide thinks you\n have made a mistake and sends you to the\n Elmwood avenue line instead. Then say\n firmly, \u201cForest is my friend, not Elmwood,\u201d\n and you may get your first sight of the fair\n as the artists and architects know that it\n ought to be seen for the first time.\n</p>\n<p>\n You will find the unfinished Albright Li-\n brary, a beautiful, classic structure in white\n marble at your left as you enter the Park.\n It has nothing to do with this fair, thanks\n to its incompleteness, but it will be a perma-\n nent addition to the beauty of Buffalo and a\n present joy when all these piles of glowing\n staff are but a memory. Right across North\n Bay, still at your left, is the smaller but\n equally classic New York State Building,\n which is also to be permanent, but which\n the workmen have left just in time for its\n use for official functions this summer. It\n is beautiful in the Greek style and with the\n simplicity with which we are familiar in our\n older public buildings. It has not very much\n relation to the rest of the spectacle, but it\n is useful as a sign board to show how far\n the architects have traveled along the road\n of fantasy in their temporary structures.\n</p>\n<p>\n As you cross this arm of the lake you get\n the philosophic and artistic germ of the\n complex structure. This fair is intended to\n typify the Ascent of Man and his triumph\n over nature. In this foreground you get the\n simple, primitive buildings and the primitive\n colorings and you ascend slowly until you\n reach the complex green and blue and gold\n of the Electric Tower, the very last cry in\n the way of brilliant and dazzling exterior\n color, with the green of the Niagara Rapids\n as its foundation tint.\n</p>\n<p>\n That sounds beautifully on paper and it\n has the practical advantage of getting the\n smaller and less sought for buildings off on\n the lake side, where they do not interfere\n with the spectacular glories around the great\n Esplanade. This arrangement bunches in the\n center the buildings which people will be\n most anxious to see and puts them all close\n to the Midway\u2014 -which experience has shown\n is the strongest magnet at every fair. Space\n never was utilized to better advantage if the\n idea had been solely to save the visitor from\n all unnecessary walking.\n</p>\n<p>\n The only place outside of the central bunch\n to which there will be a great rush is the\n temporary Art Building, away off on the\n shore of the lake in the southeast corner of\n the fair. It was put there partly because,\n when it became evident that the Albright\n gallery would not be ready, all the central\n space had been appropriated, and partly, I\n imagine, because its precious contents would\n be out of the way of fire, if one should start\n from the crossing of any of the million elec-\n tric wires which run beneath these acres\n of staff. All the partitions of the Art Build-\n ing are of brick, but the further it is from\n the electric heart of this blazing fairyland\n the more willing will the artists be to send\n their choicest works there.\n</p>\n<p>\n Standing in front of this building is an im-\n posing equestrian statue of General Sher-\n man, w ' hich was designed by St. Gaudens.\n Sherman is riding a war horse, leading which\n is a figure of Fame. This statue in plaster\n was exhibited at Paris, and won for its de-\n signer the grand prize. It is to be erected\n in bronze in New York on some site yet to\n be chosen. It is making its \u201cfirst appear-\n ance\u201d in America at the Pan-American Ex-\n position.\n</p>\n<p>\n The exhibits are divided into four groups.\n</p>\n<p>\n including paintings, sculpture, etchings, en-\n gravings, illustrations and architectural\n pieces. All told they number about 1,600.\n In addition the Canadian Gallery contains 125\n pictures, and there are seven pieces of Ca-\n nadian sculpture in the Sculpture Court. Al-\n bert Lynch, the well known Parisian artist,\n \u2022who is a native of Peru, has several repre-\n sentative paintings, as have Miss Campbell\n McPherson of Newfoundland, Simon Goonza-\n lez of Chili and others.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of the nost noteworthy paintings on\n exhibition is one entitled \u201cThe Penance of\n Eleanor, Duchess of Gloucester.\u201d This\n picture was painted by Edwin A. Abbey, who\n</p>\n<p>\n signed as sculptural ornaments for the Hunt\n Memorial in the park wall on upper Fifth\n avenue and will appear as such in bronze.\n</p>\n<p>\n Two other interesting exhibits are recent\n creations in sculpture \u2014 one of which is an\n equestrian statue of General Slocum and the\n other an equestrian 6tatue of Lafayette. The\n Lafayette statue is to be in bronze in the\n Place du Louvre. It was unvailed in tenta-\n tive shape at Paris, with the horse and rider\n in plaster and staff, on July 4 of last year.\n Elaborate festivities attended the ceremony,\n as Americans who were in Paris at the time\n will well remember.\n</p>\n<p>\n was recently commissioned by England\u2019s new\n King to paint the coronation. It was ex-\n hibited at the Royal Academy in London in\n the spring of 1899. St. Gaudens\u2019 \u201cShaw Me-\n morial,\u201d which appears in bronze on the\n Boston Commons, is reproduced here in\n plaster. Daniel C. French, the widely\n known sculptor, has two figures on exhibition.\n One of them is entitled \u201cPainting and Sculp-\n ture\u201d and the other \u201cArchitecture.\u201d These\n .were recently finished. They were de-\n</p>\n<p>\n In assembling the paintings on exhibition,\n especial pains were taken to secure paint-\n ings by artists who had done much to ad-\n vance the American school of painting. This\n includes six or seven landscapes by George\n Inness and a group of water colors by Wins-\n low Homer.\n</p>\n<p>\n All of the prominent American artists at\n home and aoroad arc represented in the gen-\n eral collection shown here, and there are im-\n portant groups by artists of individual meriCj\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0007/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0007/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0007/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0007/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0007/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/gu/id/et/op/an/am/er/ic/00/un/se/guidetopanameric00unse/guidetopanameric00unse_0007.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 918079}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"7\">\n<p>\n GUIDE TO THE PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION, 1901.\n</p>\n<p>\n s\n</p>\n<p>\n including Elihu Vedder, D.

Those women, however,\n who wish to compete in arts and manufac-\n tures will do so side by side with men in\n the regular exhibits, asking no odds for their\n</p>\n<p>\n sex. That is the attitude which the compe-\n tent women workers have taken ever since\n the day when Georges Sand signed a man\u2019s\n name to her books so that they might be\n judged by a man\u2019s standard. The Woman\u2019s\n Building will be headquarters for visiting\n delegations and clubs and its only exhibit\n will be women.\n</p>\n<p>\n This brief consideration of the first build-\n ings encountered when one enters by the\n Lincoln Park gate, takes one to the double\n bridge which marks the Esplanade. Here\n two tall towers, elaborately decorated, guard\n the entrance to the heart of the fair. They\n balance the Electric Tower, nearly half a\n mile further on, and the Esplanade and foun-\n tains between and the large buildings on\n either side are to Buffalo what the Court of\n Honor was ' to Chicago.\n</p>\n<p>\n Here one gets his first full impression of\n the originality of the architects who planned\n this fair. The effect is less uniform, less\n classic, possibly less dazzling, than at Chi-\n cago. But it is far more various, the coloring\n gives it a richness and warmth to which the\n other fair was a stranger, and above all It\n is American to an extent which no exposi-\n tion has ever been.\n</p>\n<p>\n That enthusiastic American, our fellow\n citizen by adoption and grace, Helena Mod-\n jeska, objected to the Chicago show because\n it was decorated with Greek goddesses in-\n stead of typical American art. She would\n make no such complaint in Buffalo and she\n ought to come home and raise a Polish pean\n over this triumphant Americanism. There\n are Greek gods and goddesses, to be sure, but\n they have been banished to the back door \u2014\n here called by the high sounding name,\n Propylaea \u2014 and are really a screen to shut\n out the ugly sight of arriving and departing\n steam cars.\n</p>\n<p>\n The dominant sculptural figure is the buf-\n falo, which has been modeled in several at-\n titudes by various sculptors, notably the\n fighting buffalo of Harry Schrady, on the\n western approach to the tower, which has\n been reproduced so much that it is familiar\n the country over.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the right and left of the bridge the\n Esplanade branches out like the top of a\n capital T, the main avenue running down\n to the Electric Tower at the foot of the T.\n To the right is the massive and beautiful\n Government Building, in the French style,\n representing the progress of man. In front\n of it is a great Fountain of Man, filled with\n sculpture, carrying out this central idea.\n Facing the Government Building to the left\n of the bridge is the Building of Horticulture,\n the most fantastic and pan-American struct-\n ure in the grounds, and close by it the\n Building of Mines. These two typify Nature,\n and in front of them is a fountain filled\n with sculpture, representing primitive man\n in his struggle with nature. The buildings\n at each end of the top of the T extend around\n a curved arcade, so that they balance each\n other finely and, with the two contrasting\n fountains in front, help to carry out the\n central idea of the triumph of man over na-\n ture and his progress up to the point where\n the combination of science and art make3\n such a wonder as the Electric Tower possi-\n ble. The Electric Tower bears also the\n crown of all the sculpture, the Goddess of\n Light, a figure as impressive as our Diana\n on the Madison Square Garden, and one\n which dominates every view about tho\n grounds as Diana does the neighborhood of\n Madison Square. But if the goddess is the\n crown, the fountain is the symbolic sculpt-\n ure of the Court of Fountains, between tha\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0008/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0008/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0008/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0008/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0008/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/gu/id/et/op/an/am/er/ic/00/un/se/guidetopanameric00unse/guidetopanameric00unse_0008.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 982556}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"8\">\n<p>\n GUIDE TO THE PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION, 1901.\n</p>\n<p>\n 6\n</p>\n<p>\n Government and the Horticultural Build-\n ings. Of these the Savage Age, a group\n by J. J. Boyle, is the beginning, followed\n by the Despotic Age, by Isadore Konti and\n H. A. McNeil; the Age of Enlightenment,\n by Herbert Adams; the Fountain of Pro-\n metheus and the Fountain of Lycurgus,\n by Hinton R. Perry, and, in front of the\n Government Building, the superb Fountain\n of Man. by Charles Grafly. Mr. Boyle\u2019s\n Savage Age has two groups representing\n primitive man of the East and of the West,\n when the whole race was even more warlike\n than Emperor \" William. His Tartars steal-\n ing women will attract less attention than\n his Indians executing a war dance, the lat-\n ter especially appropriate to an American\n fair.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Grafly\u2019s Fountain of Man is even more\n highly symbolic. The crowning figure, \u201cMys-\n terious Man,\u201d is draped and half vailed and\n stands like a conqueror upon a group of fig-\n ures representing the five senses, while lower\n down in the fountain is a sculptured alle-\n gory representing the virtues struggling with\n the vices.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is no space to describe all the sculp-\n ture designed for decorative uses under the\n direction of Carl Bitter, as there are 125\n original groups and about 500 single statues,\n all told. But these fountains are typical of\n the skill with which the work has been\n adapted to the central idea of the fair, while\n the familiar reproductions of the Goddess and\n the Buffalo vouch for the beauty and\n strength of much of the work.\n</p>\n<p>\n One must, however, spare just a word for\n the symbolio sculpture with which Carl Bit-\n ter has covered the bridge across which you\n approach the Esplanade. The four piers of\n</p>\n<p>\n this structure are a hundred feet high and\n each is surmounted by a sculptural group.\n The chief of these, a giant youth on horse-\n back, typifies the struggle of the people of\n the United States to free themselves from\n despotism. Other allegorical figures of\n Peace, Power, Hospitality, Truth, Patriotism\n and Liberty, with the fountains of the Atlan-\n tic and Pacific Oceans and the waterfall into\n Mirror Lake and the subterranean grotto\n make this bridge the chief rival of the Elec-\n tric Tower as a decorative masterpiece.\n</p>\n<p>\n With the sculpture it is well to abandon\n the symbolical significance of the exposition\n and see the buildings simply for themselves\n and for what they contain. Four buildings of\n greatsizeline the Esplanade, the Government\n and Horticultural buildings already men-\n tioned and those devoted to Transportation\n and Machinery and Manufacturers and Lib-\n eral Arts, which balance each other just In\n front of the Electric tower. Close by these\n latter two and flanking the tower are others\n about half their size devoted to Electricity\n and Agriculture. In these, the smaller build-\n ing of Mines and the far away Art Gallery,\n the chief exhibits of the exposition will be\n found. There are innumerable smaller build-\n ings valuable for their decorative effect, like\n the Temples of Music and Ethnology, which\n flank the Esplanade, and the building of\n Graphic Arts, which balance the building of\n Mines in the architectural scheme, and others\n like the Forestry and Dairy buildings, in\n which the exhibits form a valuable part of\n the show, although the interest in them is\n not so general as in the main structures.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is the great electric fair, and more\n interesting than anything which the electric\n exhibit can chow of machines or methods\n is the effect of the 5,000 horse power current\n when it is turned on at night. The illumi-\n nation of the Court of Honor at Chicago was\n a wonderful thing and since that time a good\n deal has been done in the electric lighting\n of fountains, as may be seen at Prospect\n Park plaza all summer. But all those things\n pale before the illumination of this Electric\n tower. This, with the 300,000 other incan-\n descents, bathes the whole scene in a mel-\n low light, under which the blue domes and\n the ardent glow of tropic cornices and por-\n ticos fade away.\n This is no lon-\n ger a Rainbow\n city, but a Gol-\n den city, and\n one can only\n</p>\n<p>\n UNITED STATED GOVERNMENT\n -dUiLDING FROM ESPlANADtCjS\n</p>\n<p>\n think of that line about \u201cthe radiancy of\n glory\u201d in the old Latin hymn. This may not\n be \u201cJerusalem the Golden, with milk and t\n honey blest,\u201d but surely beneath its con-\n templation \u201csink heart and voice oppressed.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It is like Niagara, one of those wonders I\n which stills adjectives and leaves one con- j\n tent simply to stroll about and bask in the !\n glow. Description would be so utterly be- i\n neath the effect as to be worthless. The i\n magic follows you far into the night, for j\n all the way back to the heart of the city I\n that glowing tower stands, like a pillar of |\n molten gold, proclaiming the latest and great-\n est wonder of applied science, the most com-\n plete triumph of man over the forces of\n nature.\n</p>\n<p>\n A feature which will be of universal in-\n terest will be the souvenirs of the fair.\n These have been arranged so far as possible\n to protect the public from a competition in\n worthless trash fiercer than that of the Ni-\n agara hackmen. The concession for the sale\n of all official souvenirs in the grounds has\n been granted to the American Souvenir Com-\n pany, which has forty booths in the various\n buildings and has provided some very beau-\n tiful spoons for a wide range of prices and\n some really artistic cups, saucers and plates\n commemorating the occasion. There is an\n admirable plan by which the sale of most\n small objects connected with the fair Is con-\n fined to the Bazaar building, which stands\n near the Serivce building at the West Am-\n herst gate, where most of the trolley visitors\n will enter.\n</p>\n<p>\n There remain two features of the fair not\n yet reached because they occupy the two\n corners behind the Electric tower. One is\n the Stadium, which we shall read about all\n summer on the sporting page. It is the big-\n gest amphitheater in America. It is 840 feet\n long and 400 wide, almost four times as large\n as the original stadium at Athens, from\n which it borrowed its name and its shape.\n There is a ball ground in the center sur-\n rounded by a running and bicycle track and\n the seats outside of all this will hold 12,000\n people. Incidentally the architecture and\n proportions of this structure are admirable,\n but that will count less than its roominess\n in making it the popular sporting arena of\n the summer.\n</p>\n<p>\n The other corner\u2014 and a good big corner it\n is\u2014 is occupied by the Midway. It has come\n to be an accepted thing in great fairs that\n the Midway is the popular feature. That at\n Chicago was a surprise and something of a\n shock, but we have had Omaha and Paris\n</p>\n<p>\n since and every\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n one connected\n with expositions\n has come to un-\n derstand that\n the public de-\n mands, for on*\n hour of instruc-\n tion, four hours\n of fun.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this devel-\n opment of the\n pass Ion for\n amusement the\n makers of mid-\n ways have not\n stood still.

There will be fakes\n In the Midway, that is a matter of course,\n but the Midway Itself is no fake. There are\n shows there like the Streets of Mexico, the\n Trip to the Moon and the Indian village\n which are worth far more than they cost\n and of which the salary list would astonish\n the average observer, who puts down his\n half dollar with the general notion that he\n is going to be swindled. In this case he will\n get the worth of his money oftener than he\n loses it and for the human side of the Pan-\n Americanism of the fair he will have to go\n to the streets of Mexico, the Indian, Ha-\n waiian and Filipino villages.\n</p>\n<p>\n For the Americanism which is not \" pan\u201d\n \u2014or anything else flat\u2014 but is equal in alert-\n ness to the sharpest competition of Wall street\n or of the Bowery, one may safely go to the\n makers of the Midway. Men like McGarvie\n of the Streets of Mexico, Thompson of the\n Trip to the Moon and Cummings of the In-\n dian village are wonders of ingenuity and\n resource. Possibly Thompson is the greatest\n wonder of them all. He designed the exte-\n rior of all but five of the buildings in the\n Midway and the architecture down there\n bears no mean contrast to that of the main\n fair itself in its variety and suitability to the\n uses to which it is put. The cost probably\n had to be closely considered, but the effect\n is not cheap and shabby, but bizarre in an\n artistic way. Thompson has done much for\n his neighbors, but more for the inside of the\n two shows in which he is directly interested,\n A Trip to the Moon and Darkness and Dawn.\n Both of these rely largely upon the effect\n of stage magic upon the spectator sitting in\n darkness and they spring upon him a pano-\n rama of weird effects which will make the\n old days, when the wonders of \u201cThe Black\n Crook\u201d were new, seem pale and tame. Dark-\n ness and Dawn contrasts for the spectator\n the mysteries of heaven and the infernal re-\n gions and some of the transformations and\n devices in the Moon show are not less start-\n ling.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Streets of Mexico, on the other hand,\n has an ethnographic value which would jus-\n tify it in being given in one of the regular\n buildings of the fair. The architecture of\n the street, restaurant and theater are Mexi-\n can and the musicians, who are the chief\n human document, are born dandies, beside\n whom a shirt waist man in all his glory in\n August will pale into insignificance. They\n are slight, graceful little fellows with closely\n cut ' garments\n which set off\n their litheness\n to the best ad-\n vantage. Some\n of them with\n suits of paie\n gray wear ser-\n apes of pale\n checks or some-\n times of a deli-\n cate pink, over\n their shoulders.\n</p>\n<p>\n The combina-\n tion matches in\n blue affected by\n blonde girls with\n delicacy the\n pale gray and\n pink cheeks,\n while no New\n York store can\n show anything\n half so gor-\n geous as their\n big straw hats.\n</p>\n<p>\n Others wear\n</p>\n<p>\n suits of black with gilt or silver buttons and\n over their shoulders carry serapes of glow-\n ing scarlet, which light up their sw ' arthy\n faces and the surrounding landscape. The\n bull fighters, of whom there are several, are\n no such paragons of grace, but great, hulk-\n ing brutes with bulging muscles and hardly\n the claim to animal beauty of the average\n prize fighter. The women are nearly as\n homely as the bull fighters; that is in a mass\n on a stage at the far end of the theater.\n</p>\n<p>\n On that same stage I witnessed a little\n scene which showed that they are far less\n stolid than they look. They had been col-\n lected to sing for a party of 30 or 40 news-\n paper people. The chief bull fighter was\n hanging around the edges of the crowd, eying\n every woman who passed him after the man-\n ner of his kind, and devoting close attention\n to the stage. Suddenly there was a pause\n and a stir around two of the women singers.\n Half a dozen of the group left the stage\n hurriedly, others looked about uneasily and\n the managers, scenting trouble, dived behind\n the scenes. Afte: five or ten minutes the\n stage gradually filled again and national\n songs were sung, with one woman of con-\n spicuous costume absent from the front row.\n The explanation was that the bull fighter had\n been making eyes at two of the women and\n that one of them, discovering the duplicity,\n had flown at her rival\u2019s eyes. Like veritable\n Carmens they had their fight out right there\n and let the show wait or disappear until\n the war was over. By that time only the\n victor was able to reappear, but that fact did\n not move the star bull fighter in his corner.\n Things may not always be as quiet as they\n seem in the streets of Mexico.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Indian Congress, with representatives\n of forty-one different tribes in its reserva-\n tion, is a display of a\n stage of our progress\n</p>\n<p>\n that, but it will open the eyes of thousands\n who have never seen the banks of the Mis-\n souri to the life which goes on beyond it.\n The Navajo blankets, at $1:0 to $250 each, as\n well as the baskets and other specimens of\n native Indian work, will make delightful\n souvenirs for those who can afford them.\n My most interesting example of Indian work,\n however, was seeing the squaws run up the\n poles of the tepees while the men lounged\n about and looked on. That is one of the\n poetic native customs which is being killed\n by the cruel hand of the Anglo-Saxon.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Streets of Cairo is the old Coney\n Island show enlarged and recostumed. Bos-\n tock\u2019s animal show is bigger, but like the one\n he gave on Halsey street during the street\n fair last fall, save that Bostock himself did\n not then have picturesque strips of court\n plaster covering the ravages made by the\n latest of his tigers who essayed to dally with\n his flowing hair, and so was not a walking\n proof of the fact that the beasts are fierce.\n There are scenic railways and boat ways\n here which are merely intensives of the\n Coney Island chutes and there are other\n shows which will not strike the Brooklynite\n as novel. But the fact remains that by and\n large the Midw r ay is bound to be the most\n attractive single feature of the fair.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Midway puts one in mind of eating\n because most visitors will think that the best\n chances for refreshment are to be found in\n its borders. The Midway is the seat of a\n stern rivalry between native and imported\n beer. The native beverage is set out in the\n restaurant of one of the great Milwaukee\n brewing firms, tvhich furnishes abundant and\n good food for prices as reasonable as are to\n</p>\n<p>\n (Continued on Pnge 10)\n</p>\n<p>\n which is rapidly disap-\n pearing even from the\n West. The Indian village\n was one of the most in-\n teresting features of the\n Omaha fair and this is not\n essentially different from\n</p>\n<p>\n lii!\n</p>\n<p>\n : ;vX ; > N; vv\n \u2022X ; v ' \u2018\n</p>\n<p>\n A GLIMPSE OF THE\n ENTRANCE !N DISTANCE\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0010/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0010/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0010/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0010/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0010/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/gu/id/et/op/an/am/er/ic/00/un/se/guidetopanameric00unse/guidetopanameric00unse_0010.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 772031}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"10\">\n<p>\n Exposition Grounds\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n o\n</p>\n<p>\n -*2T\n</p>\n<p>\n Jfi|\n</p>\n<p>\n ^\n</p>\n<p>\n t*\n</p>\n<p>\n It\n</p>\n<p>\n l\n</p>\n<p>\n I\n</p>\n<p>\n O*\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 fio\n</p>\n<p>\n /\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n ?n m\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n Wt\n</p>\n<p>\n The moat comprehensive view of the exposition is. perhaps, obtained from the Esplanade from\n % point a few rods north of the Triumphal Causeway. Here the visitor, with one sweep of the\n \u2022ye, may see nearly all of the principal buildings of the exposition. The TriumDhal Causeway,\n behind him, is a magnificent structure, designed by John M. Carrere, chairman of the Board of\n Architects. Four tall pylons are connecteu by swinging cables. The pylons are surmounted by\n four standard bearers, designed by Karl Bitter, the director of sculpture. The bridge, as a whole,\n is intended to express the pride of the American people in their achievements. The standard\n bearer represents a mfuscular youth upon a rearing horse. Below him are trophies indicative of\n feudalism, slavery and. tyrannical power, the whole expressing the triumphal struggle of the people\n of the Arnericas to free thermal ves from the institutions of despotic ages and governments. Ter-\n minating the buttresses of the piers are four groups of trophies typifying peace and power,\n modeled by Augustus Lukeman. In the niches on the side of the bridge are statues symbolical of\n hospitality, love of truth, patriotism, liberty, etc. On each side of the bridge are fountains of\n rearing horses and figures clustered about tall poles which carry huge silken flags. The fountain\n on the east typifies, the Atlantic Ocean, and that on the west the Pacific Ocean, with one base\n uniting the two. The sculptor of these is Philip Martiny. Beneath the bridge are subterranean\n grottoes modeled after the famous Buttes de Chaumont.\n</p>\n<p>\n Turning now to the eastern wing of the Esplanade, the observer will note the group of three\n great government buildings, ft ' he open space being embellished with sunken gardens, fountains and\n</p>\n<p>\n statuary.

For people who wish to eat\n far from the flavor of the Midway there are\n four or five large restaurants in the heart\n of the grounds, in buildings which form\n part of the architectural and color scheme,\n and which have room enough to care for a\n multitude. All of these are in the conces-\n sion of the Bailey Company and their ser-\n vice is said to be excellent.\n</p>\n<p>\n Back of and behind this exposition is a\n spectacle vaster and more imposing. Ni-\n agara looms grandly on the consciousness of\n every visitor to Buffalo, even as it does on\n that of the European traveller starting on\n his first journey of exploration of our land.\n A difference Detween Niagara and ancient\n Rome is that, whereas all roads led to Rome,\n there are few leading to Niagara and of\n these it will not surprise Brooklyn readers\n to learn that the best is in Brooklyn con-\n trol. This is the International Belt Line,\n of which the first step, the approach from\n Buffalo by water, is in the hands of the In-\n ternational Navigation Company, a Brook-\n lyn corporation of which M. C. Ebel of Brook-\n lyn is the general manager. The boats of\n this company leave every hour from the\n foot of Ferry street, just where Lake Erie\n merges into the Niagara River, and proceed\n to a landing about three miles above the\n Falls. These are fine large boats with obser-\n vation decks.\n</p>\n<p>\n These steamers connect with the gorge\n railroad, the most expensive trolley line on\n earth, its seven miles from the top of the\n gorge down to Lewiston having cost $1,400,-\n 000. The company went into bankruptcy, but\n the road remains and it gives the most per-\n fect and complete view of the falls and the\n rapids below them to be had anywhere. You\n go down, down, down in an observation car,\n getting closer and closer to the rapids and the\n whirlpool as you run, until at Lewiston you\n</p>\n<p>\n cline and make more of the journey up\n stream upon the top of the great bluff which\n the river has cut through. Here, too, you\n get more of the historic monuments con-\n nected with the falls and see the gorge\n through which the river once ran. The line\n takes you past the fails themselves, giving\n</p>\n<p>\n opportunity for all the choice views and\n finally leaves you at the dock ready for the\n steamer back to Buffalo.\n</p>\n<p>\n The trip should consume the better part of\n a day, as it did with our party, but it gives\n the crowning glory, one without which the\n Buffalo Exposition is lame and incomplete.\n</p>\n<p>\n HAMILTON.\n</p>\n<p>\n Following are the dates on which leading\n musical organizations of the continent are\n to play at the exposition:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2022Mexican Artillery Band, 60 men, Captain\n Ricardo, director.

It was\n originally intended to exclude exhibits from\n the court, and fill in its space with flowers,\n</p>\n<p>\n the gems exhibited represent fortunes in\n themselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n Near this marvelously rich assemblage Is\n the exhibit of the Gorham Manufacturing\n Company, which occupies about the same\n amount of space and which rivals the Tiffany\n display in richness and in originality of de-\n sign. Near at hand is the superb collection\n of draperies and floor stuffs arranged by W.\n & J. Sloane. Never was a more magnificent\n collection of this kind placed on exhibition.\n</p>\n<p>\n The rest of the court is given over to dis-\n plays of potteries, artistic furniture, china,\n decorative ware and other things properly\n classified as art manufactures.

The object of\n the test is to get the exact cost of produc-\n tion of butter and cheese, and to see which\n breed of cattle will make the best showing\n with the least expense.\n</p>\n<p>\n According to the first week\u2019s test the\n queen of the herd or herds, rather, is a Hol-\n stein cow, which has a record of 70 pounds of\n milk (two and one-half pounds of butter) in\n a single day. The test i 3 being conducted\n in a barn near the Dairy Building. This\n building is interesting to dairymen for an-\n other reason, and that is that it includes\n everything in the line of modern sanitary\n and hygienic appliances used in the produc-\n tion of butter, cheese, etc. Every breed of\n cows, noteworthy as milk producers, is rep-\n resented in the test with the exception of\n the Devons. Edward Van Alstine of Kin-\n derhook, N. Y., is in charge of the test.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the Dairy Building proper there are\n interesting displays of machinery and appli-\n ances used in the making of butter and\n cheese. Among the firms represented are the\n Star Milk Company of Haddonville, N. J.;\n the Iron Clad Manufacturing Company of\n New York; the De Laval Separator Company\n of New York and others. New York and\n other dairy states have fine displays showing\n the extent in which the industry is carried\n on.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Agricultural Building.\n</p>\n<p>\n New York\u2019s exhibit occupies a prominent\n location in the center of the Agricultural\n Building. In point of variety and extent it\n is the most interesting display in the build-\n ing. Every agricultural product of the\n state is represented. One section contains\n 400 varieties of wheat grown on one farm.\n This exhibit was sent on by a wheat en-\n thusiast in Central New York, who has de-\n voted the greater part of his life to the task\n of ascertaining how many kinds of wheat\n might be propagated from the parent vari-\n ety. Comparatively few of the kinds shown\n in his collection are known to commerce,\n and a layman would have more or less diffi-\n culty in distinguishing the rarer kinds from\n those in common use.\n</p>\n<p>\n Illinois\u2019 exhibit is housed in a \u201cPalace of\n Corn,\u201d remarkable chiefly for its showing\n of the extent to which the ordinary varieties\n of corn may be employed for decorative\n purposes. The columns supporting its roof\n are made of ears of yellow corn, wrought in\n curious and unique designs, and the shingles\n of its roof are fashioned of tiny slices of\n red corn in the ear. Encircling the edge\n of the roof is a beautiful frame work of\n different colored varieties. The display ccx:-\n</p>\n<p>\n tained in this corn palace consists of the\n cereal itself in infinite shapes and varieties\n together with the products of the same\n turned out by the mills of the state which\n arranged the exhibit.\n</p>\n<p>\n In one of the villages of Connecticut there\n still stands a mill which was built away\n back in 1640. This venerable grinder the\n Connecticut commissioners have reproduced\n in corn. Standing near the mill, separated\n from it by a winding stream, is the miller ' s\n caljin. Connecting the two is an old-fash-\n ioned bridge. All of this is done in corn.\n</p>\n<p>\n Louisiana seems to have been the only\n Southern state with agriculturists sufficient-\n ly enterprising to make an exhibit. The\n display from this enterprising Southern\n commonwealth is devoted, naturally enough,\n to the exploitation of her sugar industry.\n The different stages through which this con-\n diment passes on its way from the cane to\n the table are fully explained and illustrated.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the northerly side of the building the\n Southern Railway Company devotes consid-\n erable space to \u201cthe only tea farm in\n America,\u201d a plantation located In one of the\n Carolinas. Pictures of the \u201cfarm\u201d are\n shown, with young negroes at work gath-\n ering the leaves, and samples of the tea\n thus produced are exhibited for the inspec-\n tion of passers by.\n</p>\n<p>\n Wisconsin, Missouri, Minnesota, Michigan\n and other states have representative exhib-\n its, chiefly of cereals, grasses tobaccos, etc.\n</p>\n<p>\n Argentine Republic, Bolivia, Costa Rica,\n Guatemala, Nicaragua, Peru, Porto Rico and\n Salvador have collective exhibits in this\n building. None of these countries exhibits\n its products in any other building on the\n grounds. The displays consist of cereals,\n fibers, hides, minerals, woods, fruits, wool,\n etc., most of which came packed in mahog-\n any \u201cdry goods boxes.\u201d The Argentine Re-\n public occupies considerable space with its\n showing of wool in various stages of devel-\n opment, from the raw product to the manu-\n factured article.\n</p>\n<p>\n Manitoba occupies the entire space origi-\n nally allotted to the Dominion of Canada.\n The other provinces backed out in order that\n Manitoba might have sufficient room in which\n to display her cereals and products, which\n are manufactured therefrom in that section\n of Canada.\n</p>\n<p>\n Machinery and Transportation Building\n Interest in the displays in the Machinery\n and Transportation Building centers large-\n ly in the comprehensive exhibit of railroad\n transportation equipment, shown in a sepa-\n rate building, an annex of the main struct-\n ure. In the easterly section of this build-\n ing the floor space is given over to half a\n dozen sets of railroad tracks on which stand\n trains looking as if they were ready to be-\n gin record breaking journeys.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Lackawanna has a passenger coach,\n a box car and a coal dump all in one train.\n Tho seats had been removed from the pas-\n senger coach, and on its walls are pictures\n forming a panoramic view of scenes along\n the Lackawanna line. In the box car are\n samples of articles manufactured in towns\n through which the Lackawanna passes. The\n coal car contains a miniature coal mine and\n breaker in operation.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Lehigh Valley has a big Mother Hub-\n bard engine on a track near at hand. On the\n same track stands a single expansion freight\n engine built for the Buffalo and Susque-\n hanna Railroad. These constitute part of\n the exhibit of the Saldwin Locomotive\n Works, but the most fascinating feature of\n that company\u2019s showing is an engine with\n the Vanderbilt fire box and Va* < S 3 rbilt ten-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0015/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0015/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0015/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0015/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0015/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/gu/id/et/op/an/am/er/ic/00/un/se/guidetopanameric00unse/guidetopanameric00unse_0015.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 838842}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"15\">\n<p>\n GUIDE TO THE PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION, 1901.\n</p>\n<p>\n 13\n</p>\n<p>\n der, which was built for the Illinois Cen-\n tral, and which will be used on that line.\n This locomotive and its tender are suspend-\n ed In mid air, and the mechanism of the en-\n gine is running at full speed.

The collection includes more than\n 140 varieties and embraces nearly every kind\n of wood that can be grown in a northern cli-\n mate. Great care was taken in getting these\n Oregon woods ready for exhibit, and consid-\n erable ingenuity was exercised in giving to\n the display a sense of variety which adds\n greatly to its interest.\n</p>\n<p>\n The background of the booth consists of\n great planks, some of which are 25 feet tall\n and 5 feet wide. All told the background\n contains more than five hundred feet of lum-\n ber. Huge sections of the logs of different\n trees are backed against w ' hite dressed lum-\n ber, showing the change wrought by man\u2019s\n inventive genius.\n</p>\n<p>\n Longitudinal and cross sections, finished in\n oil and varnish so that every fine tracing of\n the grain and coloring is revealed, surmount\n the tops of the logs.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then there are specimens of every variety\n of lumber grown in the state, finished, pol-\n ished and grained, so as to show that all of\n these may be used in interior decorative\n work. Particularly interesting are the sam-\n ples of Oregon myrtle. This -wood is as hard\n as iron and of wonderful grain and color.\n Samples of it are shown in white, green,\n black, brown and other shades. The Oregon\n exhibit also includes immense pine cones,\n peculiar wood growths and many freaks of\n forestry.\n</p>\n<p>\n One of the features of the exhibit is the\n largest sage plant ever grown. It is a foot\n in length, and more than 15 inches in diame-\n ter. Part of the exhibit is given over to a\n display of the birds and animals to be found\n in the forests of this productive Western\n state.\n</p>\n<p>\n Back of the Government Building, on a\n side track, is a flat car on which is a big log\n from Oregon. It occupies the entire width of\n the car and is as high as an ordinary box-\n car. What to do with it is a problem that is\n now worrying those in charge of the forest-\n ry exhibit. It was intended to go in the\n Forestry Building, as a part of the Oregon\n display, but where to find room for it in that\n building no one seems to know. While the\n Oregonian display is the most prominent one\n In this building, other lumber producing\n states are not far behind. Michigan and\n other Central Western States have splendid\n exhibits, bespeaking the wealth of their\n acres and acres of forests, and revealing the\n</p>\n<p>\n magnitude of their lumbering and wood\n working industries.\n</p>\n<p>\n Both of the Carollnas, Georgia, Florida\n and other Southern commonwealths compete\n with their Northern and Western sister\n states in the extent and variety of their\n forestry exhibits. Ontario, too, has a show-\n ing which awakens wonder and admiration\n in the minds of those unfamiliar with the\n prominent part that province plays in fur-\n nishing this country with lumber. Many of\n the states have arranged indigenous trees as\n if they were growing naturally in their for-\n est homes. In the branches of some of these\n wild animals, to be found in the forests\n whence came the trees, are mounted and\n placed here and there in life-like attitudes.\n This building also contains everything in the\n line of improved wood-working, machinery\n and planing mill supplies.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Acetylene Building.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Union Carbide Company\u2019s exhibit oc-\n cupies with the allied acetylene industries the\n entire Acetylene Building. Here is to be seen\n the generators for the making of acetylene\n gas from carbide, the carbide itself and a\n beautiful display of lamps, burners and other\n fixtures for using the gas, also an electric\n furnace in which carbide is made.\n</p>\n<p>\n This is the first recognition that carbide\n and acetylene gas has had from any expo-\n sition, consequently the exhibitors are mak-\n ing a display which is calculated to convince\n the world at large of the merits of acetylene\n gas and the value of carbide from which it\n is generated.\n</p>\n<p>\n The building is one of the most brilliantly\n illuminated on the grounds, over 60,000 can-\n dle power in light from acetylene jets being\n used in the big sign and in the outside dec-\n orations of the building. The inside is light-\n ed by a number of especially designed chan-\n deliers of an appropriate Pan-American pat-\n tern. The aisles are thickly studded with\n jets and every exhibit booth in the building\n is surmounted by an arch of lights.\n</p>\n<p>\n An interesting feature of the exhibit is a\n dark room, in which the Union Carbide Com-\n pany demonstrates the many good qualities\n of acetylene gas and its superior lighting\n power over other llluminants. Major A. M.\n Wheeler is superintendent of the building.\n</p>\n<p>\n By request of the Exposition Company,\n acetylene gas is used for lighting the Ma-\n chinery and Transportation Building and the\n railroad station. The Ohio State Building is\n also made brilliant with acetylene gas.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Canadian Corundum Company\u2019s ex-\n hibit occupies a large space In the handsome\n pavilion erected by the Province of Ontario\n in the Mines Building. A large and compre-\n hensive showing of corundum In its various\n forms is made, ranging from the crude ore,\n a felspar rock, to a flour like powder made\n to take the place of emery for use in grind-\n ing and polishing.\n</p>\n<p>\n RECITALS AT TEMPLE OF MUSIC.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Temple of Music is situated west of\n the Esplanade and south of the Machinery\n Building. The building is 150 feet square,\n with a dome rising 180 feet above the main\n floor, and cost $85,000. The auditorium is\n capable of seating 2,200 people, and contains\n one of the largest pipe organs ever built In\n the United States. Daily organ recitals will\n be given by some of the most famous organ-\n ists In this country and Canada. The prin-\n cipal national holidays will be celebrated by\n musical festivals and famous bands from foth\n the old and the new world will give concerts\n in the temple.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0016/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0016/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0016/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0016/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0016/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/gu/id/et/op/an/am/er/ic/00/un/se/guidetopanameric00unse/guidetopanameric00unse_0016.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 1024371}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"16\">\n<p>\n 14\n</p>\n<p>\n GUIDE TO THE PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION, 1901,\n</p>\n<p>\n EAGLE INFORMATION BUREAU ALWAYS READY TO HELP\n</p>\n<p>\n T HE Eagle in 1S93 established what\n was the beginning of its system of\n information bureaus by opening in\n Chicago a bureau of information for visit-\n ors to the World ' s Fair. The sole purpose\n of the bureau was to furnish a headquarters\n for Brooklyn and New York people visiting\n the fair; a place where they could meet\n their friends, find where their friends were\n stopping, secure copies of the New York pa-\n pers, and what was probably the most impor-\n tant feature, the securing of hotel and board-\n ing house accommodations for its patrons and\n friends.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Chicago bureau was one of the most\n successful enterprises ever established by a\n newspaper. Because it was of such a helpful\n nature it became very widely known, not only\n in its local field, but throughout the country.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is on the ground floor, making it most\n accessible at all times.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the opening of the Buffalo office the\n Eagle management has foreseen the immense\n probabilities of the exposition. It believes\n that this fair will be the most successful,\n financially and in point of attendance, of\n any that has ever been held. Its central\n geographical situation being within a day\u2019s\n ride of over 40,000,000 of people -will alone in-\n sure a vastly greater attendance than that\n enjoyed by the World\u2019s Fair at Chicago. Buf-\n falo itself is, next to Chicago, one of the\n greatest railroad centers of the country.\n Every railroad and steamship line will, dur-\n ing the next five months, bring thousands. of\n people within Buffalo\u2019s boundaries.\n</p>\n<p>\n Discounting this large attendance the lead-\n ing hotels, of which there are but a few, im-\n</p>\n<p>\n A special feature of the office will be a\n daily register of visitors. The convenience\n of this will be at once apparent. A friend\n has gone to Buffalo two or three days ago,\n you arrive the following week and want to\n stop at the same house. You do not know\n where your fyiend is. You step into the\n Eagle Information Bureau, look at the visi-\n ters\u2019 register, find your friend ' s name, with\n his Buffalo address, and the date of his in-\n tended departure.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another feature of the office which will be\n thoroughly appreciated will be the postal\n facilities. Letters and telegrams can be ad-\n dressed care of the Brooklyn Eagle Exposi-\n tion Bureau, and will be kept until called\n for or forwarded upon instruction. The bu-\n reau has a long distance telephone, so that\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n \\ iPfS 1\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n IflfUtl\n</p>\n<p>\n EAGLE INFORMATION BUREAU,\n</p>\n<p>\n The Chicago bureau secured accommoda-\n tions for more than fifty thousand people dur-\n ing the World Fair. Its efforts were so suc-\n cessful that at the close of the fair a home\n information bureau was established for tour-\n ists and resort hotels. As every one in\n Brooklyn is aware, the Information Bureau\n in the Eagle Building has been in existence\n some eight years, during which time its field\n of usefulness has widened so that to-day, as\n indicated by its name, it endeavors to answer\n nearly every question which any one desires\n to ask of it. During this period, branch bu-\n reaus were established in the Borough of\n Manhattan, in Washington and in Paris,\n France, all of which have been thoroughly\n appreciated and largely patronized by the\n general public.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the Pan-American Exposition, the Eagle\n has seen another opportunity of helping its\n readers, and has added to its already exten-\n sive system of bureaus a handsome head-\n quarters in Buffalo.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Pan-American Exposition Bureau of\n the Eagle in Buffalo is located at 233 Main\n street, on the corner of Seneca. The location\n of the office is most central. It is on the\n main thoroughfare, within a few blocks of\n all the depots, and the docks of the lake\n steamers. Nearly every street car line lead-\n ing to all parts of the city, to the exposition\n grounds and to Niagara Falls pass its door.\n</p>\n<p>\n mediately announced an increase of rate dur-\n ing the exposition period. At the same time,\n thousands of householders decided to open\n up their residences to paying guests instead\n of entertaining friends. Thus, the hotel prop-\n osition, which at first seemed to be a diffi-\n cult problem, has been solved to a large ex-\n tent by the facilities offered through some of\n the best residences of the city. The purpose\n of the Eagle Buffalo Bureau Is to secure an\n excellent list of the best accommodations\n which can be had at private houses in the\n city, in addition to all of the hotel accommo-\n dations. All houses listed with it are in-\n vestigated before they are recommended to\n the Eagle\u2019s readers. Every particular is se-\n cured concerning a house, as to its location in\n regard to the exposition and depots, its con-\n veniences, and even as to the frontage of the\n house. Thus the Bureau will be enabled to\n assign east, west, north or south front rooms.\n</p>\n<p>\n The office is equipped with a competent\n force of clerks, thoroughly posted concern-\n ing the city, its attractions, the various ex-\n cursions from it, so that not only will it\n be a bureau to secure rooming accommoda-\n tions, but it will be a place where one can\n ask any kind of a question on any subject\n relating to Buffalo. It will also be able to\n give information about the arrival and de-\n parture of trains, the best routes of travel\n to any point, and to quote rates of fare.\n</p>\n<p>\n visitors at the exposition grounds can tele-\n phone to the bureau and ascertain imme-\n diately whether there are any telegrams or\n mail matter awaiting their attention. If it\n is required, guides can be secured through\n the Eagle\u2019s bureau, carriages hired or theater\n tickets engaged. Other helpful features will\n be introduced as the demand arises.\n</p>\n<p>\n The bureau will be kept open from 8 o\u2019clock\n in the morning until late at night, for the\n convenience of early and late arrivals.\n Should one arrive in Buffalo without having\n secured accommodations in advance, he can\n go at once to the Eagle\u2019s headquarters and\n secure, either by messenger or telephone, a\n room. The office is furnished with the idea\n of comfort and elegance.

There are more\n than 200 hotels that can take\n care of 30,000 guests; there are\n 650 boarding houses with room\n for 18,500 persons, while 7,000 householders\n have opened their homes to exposition visit-\n ors. These private homes will accommodate\n 100,000 guests. Beside this, tents on the ex-\n position grounds have been provided for vis-\n iting organizations in uniform. These tents\n will afford room for 250 men.\n</p>\n<p>\n Two companies have established huge\n camps outside the grounds with comfortable\n tents capable of accommodating 7,500 per-\n sons for the benefit of those who wish to\n enjoy the novelty of camp life while at-\n tending the exposition. A large number of\n buildings throughout the city have been\n remodeled for hotels. Altogether, Buffalo\n can accommodate at least 150,000 strangers.\n To this may be added accommodations for\n at least 50,000 at the surrounding towns of\n Tonawanda, LaSalle, Niagara Falls, Lock-\n port, Williamsville, Gardenville, Depew and\n Lancaster, all within a short trolley ride\n of the city.\n</p>\n<p>\n Rates in hotels range from $1 a day up-\n</p>\n<p>\n ward. At the Iroquois, the most expensive\n hotel in the city, the rate for one in a room\n without bath is $3 and upward; for two in\n a room without bath it is $5 and upward.\n The rates for a room with bath for one\n person is $5 and for two in a room it is\n $7.50. This hotel is on the European plan.\n</p>\n<p>\n Rates at the Broezel are $4 to $5 a day for\n two or more in a room. This is strictly on\n the American plan. Meals are 75. cents each.\n The Genesee charges from $2 upward on the\n European plan. Rates at the Mansion\n House, on the European plan, are from $1.50\n a day upward for two in a room. The New\n Tifft House charges from $2.50 to $3 per day\n for a room without bath and from $3.50 to $5\n with bath, on the European plan. These\n hotels, with the Stafford House, are within a\n few blocks of Niagara square, from whence\n cars run to the exposition grounds. Accom-\n modations can be secured in many other ho-\n tels at rates ranging from $1 a day upward.\n</p>\n<p>\n Among the private homes of the city good\n accommodations may be secured from $1 to\n $2 per day, and in nearly all cases families\n will furnish breakfast at 25 cents to 50 cents\n each, while regular boarding houses make\n rates to fit all pocketbooks.\n</p>\n<p>\n Following will be found a list of hotels\n and boarding houses.

There are many\n conventions scheduled for that month and\n President McKinley and his Cabinet are due\n at the exposition by the latter end of June.\n It is quite important, therefore, that per-\n sons planning to visit the exposition should\n secure their accommodations in advance and\n the safest way to do it will be to write to\n the Brooklyn Eagle Pan-American Exposi-\n tion Bureau, at 233 Main street, Buffalo, and\n have their reservations made. In writing\n the instructions should be very explicit; the\n number of persons in the party, the date of\n arrival, the length of stay, the number of\n rooms required, whether American or Eu-\n ropean plan preferred, and the price it is de-\n sired to pay should all be given. It will be\n much safer also to inclose in the letter at\n least $2 as a deposit on each room. A re-\n ceipt for this money will be taken from the\n proprietor which will be applied toward the\n payment of the bill when the visit is ended.\n</p>\n<p>\n Further information, if desired, concerning\n the facilities of the Buffalo office of the\n Eagle can be obtained at any time at the\n main office of the Eagle Information Bureau\n in the Eagle Building, Brooklyn.\n</p>\n<p>\n FAIR TRULY PAN-AMERICAN.\n</p>\n<p>\n ATIN America is making a brave\n showing at the Pan-American\n Exposition. That this would be\n the case was indicated at a very\n early stage in the preparations\n for the big show, and these indications have\n been fully realized. Twenty-three of these\n countries are represented in some way at the\n Exposition, and nine of them have exhibits\n in special buildings, these being Brazil, Chili,\n Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Ecuador, Hon-\n duras, Guatemala, Mexico and Porto Rico,\n while the other countries that are repre-\n sented by exhibits of greater or less extent\n are the Argentine Republic, Bolivia, Colom-\n bia, Costa Rica, Hayti, Nicaragua, Paraguay,\n Peru, Salvador, Uruguay, Venezuela, Jamaica,\n Martinique and Guadalupe.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Argentine Republic appropriated $30,-\n 000 in gold for its exhibits at the Exposition,\n and occupies 1,500 square feet of space in the\n Forestry building, and 3,700 feet in the Agri-\n culture building. The wonderful resources\n of that country are but little appreciated by\n the public and this opportunity to study them\n is worthy of very general attention. The Re-\n public is represented by Lieutenant John S.\n Atwell.\n</p>\n<p>\n Bolivia has 2,400 square feet of space, dis-\n tributed in the Agriculture, Mining and Eth-\n nology buildings. The country is particular-\n ly rich in its mining resources. Bolivia is\n represented by Senor Don Ramon Pandohijo,\n son of the president.\n</p>\n<p>\n Brazil has established a Brazilian Fazenda\n in miniature, showing the cultivation of cof-\n fee, rubber and other products and occupies\n 600 square feet in the Agriculture building.\n</p>\n<p>\n Chili is making a magnificent showing, hav-\n ing appropriated a larger sum than any other\n country for her presentation at the Exposi-\n tion, the amount being $170,000 in gold. Its\n buildings cost $28,000 and the exhibit is an\n elaborate one, showing her wonderful advance\n in culture and all the arts of civilization.\n Chili is represented by a commission of elev-\n</p>\n<p>\n (Continued on Next Page.)\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0018/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0018/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0018/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0018/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0018/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/gu/id/et/op/an/am/er/ic/00/un/se/guidetopanameric00unse/guidetopanameric00unse_0018.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 854817}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"18\">\n<p>\n 16\n</p>\n<p>\n GUIDE TO THE PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION. 1901.\n</p>\n<p>\n en members with Senor Don Enrique Budge,\n commissioner general.\n</p>\n<p>\n Colombia is represented by Senor Dr. Luis ^\n Cuervo-Marquez, special commissioner, but\n has no special exhibits.\n</p>\n<p>\n Costa Rica occupies 1,660 square feet in\n the Horticulture, Forestry, Ethnology and\n other buildings, having some very interest-\n ing features.

Since that day a beautiful city of\n more than one hundred buildings has sprung\n into existence. The magic of twentieth cen-\n tury methods has wrought a wondrous work\n in the construction of this beautiful and cost-\n ly exposition, which, on Wednesday, May 1,\n was formally opened for a six months\u2019 fes-\n tival.\n</p>\n<p>\n The completed exposition, is a distinct tri-\n umph for every one concerned in the mam-\n moth enterprise. It may be said to the credit\n of Buffalo that her citizens have furnished\n the money for it, receiving no government aid.\n The entire amount appropriated by the fed-\n eral government for this exposition, has been\n expended under the direction of the govern-\n ment board of federal exhibits exclusively.\n The New York State appropriation has also\n been expended under the same conditions.\n The total ' cost of the exposition, including\n the government and state- appropriations, the\n cost of the Midway and other buildings, ' is\n conservatively estimated at $10,000 ' 000.\n</p>\n<p>\n The exposition was first proposed by a\n number of citizens at the Cotton States Ex-\n position at Atlanta in 1895. Its official history,\n however, began in June, 1897, when a com-\n pany for its development was organized 1 by.\n several prominent citizens and received \u2022 the\n approval of the city, state and -national ' gov-\n ernments. It was at first intended; to hold\n the exposition in 1899, but the Spanish- Ameri-\n can war caused its postponement to the pres-\n ent year. -The preliminary organization wa3\n superseded by a larger one with ample cap-\n ital for the exposition, and, from the time of\n the reorganization the work has moved for-\n ward rapidly. This organization consisted of\n twenty-five directors, ' with John G. Milburn\n as president 1 Edwin Fleming, secretary;\n George L. AVilliams, treasurer, and John N.\n Scatcherd as chairman of the Executive Com-\n mittee.\n</p>\n<p>\n William I. Buchanan, at that time United\n States minister to the Argentine Republic,\n was unanimously elected director general,\n November 1, 1899. He had previously been the\n director of agriculture, live stock and for-\n estry at the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition\n at Chicago. His ability as an organizer and\n director of a great enterprise was at once\n manifest, as the work of the exposition had\n gone forward without apparent friction or de-\n lay. The original plan called for some twenty\n large exhibit buildings and to these many\n more have been added. The exposition plot\n consists of 350 acres in the northern part of\n the city, accessible from every direction by\n electric cars, and having as favorable a steam\n railway service as could possibly have been\n chosen. The general architecture of the ex-\n position follows the Spanish Renaissance.\n The plan was worked out by a board of eigiilt\n leading architects representing several of the\n leading cities of the country.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0020/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0020/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0020/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0020/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0020/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/gu/id/et/op/an/am/er/ic/00/un/se/guidetopanameric00unse/guidetopanameric00unse_0020.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 814928}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"20\">\n<p>\n 18\n</p>\n<p>\n GUIDE TO THE PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION, 1901.\n</p>\n<p>\n CAR ROUTES TO THE EXPOSITION\n</p>\n<p>\n j\u00a3) UFFALO is known the world over\n as \u201cthe city of homes,\u201d and\n the multitudes of strangers who\n visit the city will have an ex-\n cellent opportunity to find out\n what the Buffalo homes are like. The resi-\n dence part of the city is located west of Main\n street \u2014 between Main street and the Niagara\n River \u2014 and in this section of the city are\n thousands of comfortable and convenient\n temporary homes for visitors. The streets\n and avenues on the west side of the city\n are all very broad, asphalted thoroughfares,\n resembling the streets of Washington or\n Paris. Nearly every house has a broad, well\n kept lawn and the houses are large and\n modern.\n</p>\n<p>\n The principal streets run nearly north and\n south, and as in ancient times all streets\n led to Rome, so all of the principal streets\n of Buffalo lead to the Pan-American Exposi-\n tion. It is scarcely necessary to give di-\n rections to strangers coming to Buffalo re-\n garding the best way to reach the exposi-\n tion, because it would be much more difficult\n to avoid than to reach it. Nearly every one\n coming from the eastern part of the country\n will arrive by the New York Central, Lehigh,\n Lackawanna or Erie. All of these roads land\n their passengers within a block of Main\n street, and once upon that thoroughfare the\n problem of reaching the exposition is solved.\n Three trolley lines run direct to the grounds\n and each of these lines traverses Main street\n for several blocks through the lower part of\n the city.\n</p>\n<p>\n For example, the visitor coming into Buf-\n falo by either the New York Central, West\n Shore, Lackawanna, Lehigh or Erie should\n proceed up Main street as far as the corner\n of Exchange or Seneca, and there he will\n have his choice of three street car lines, each\n landing him at the exposition gates and each\n passing through an interesting and beautiful\n portion of the city.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Elmwood trolley line is the most di-\n rect and- most used. That leads to the\n</p>\n<p>\n (SEE MAP OX OPPOSITE PAGE.)\n</p>\n<p>\n West Amherst gate and gives the visitor an 1\n opportunity to see the best residence portion\n of Buffalo.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Main street line lands its passengers |\n at the East Amherst gate and also leads !\n through a very delightful part of the resi- I\n dence and business section and affords a\n good view ' of the park and country adjacent |\n to the exposition.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Niagara street line leads off tow\u2019ard |\n the western part of the city, following the i\n Niagara River ' more closely, and transfers its\n passengers to the Forest avenue line, which\n comes in at the North gate of the exposi-\n tion.\n</p>\n<p>\n The street car service is extremely effi-\n cient. Trains of three or more cars are run\n express on several lines, between the center\n of the city and the grounds. The street car\n routes to the different entrances will be as\n follow ' s: Elmwood avenue. Main street and\n Michigan street, to the west gate; Baynes and\n Hoyt, West Grant, Niagara and North Main,\n to Zoo line, to the east gate; Jefferson,\n Niagara Falls, Lockport, Kenmore and Her-\n tel, to the north gate.\n</p>\n<p>\n An automobile service affords rapid tran-\n sit to the exposition, and a bus route pro-\n vides for those who have time to take in the\n beauties of the residential sections of Buffalo\n on their way to the Rainbow City. The com-\n pany that operates this bus is capitalized at\n $50,000 and runs stages, buses or wagon-\n ettes by fifteen different routes to the\n grounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n Those w ' ho wish to drive should follow\n Delaware avenue, said to be the most beau- ,\n tiful residence street on the American con- j\n tinent, passing through the park and arriv-\n ing at the Lincoln gate.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another and quicker w T ay to reach the\n grounds is to take the New York Central\n Belt line steam railway at the New York\n Central or Terrace stations and reach the\n exposition in five minutes and for five cents\n at the North gate.\n</p>\n<p>\n The principal hotels of Buffalo are grouped\n along Main street, within a few blocks of the\n railway stations, where most of the Eastern\n visitors W ' ill land. The Iroquois Hotel is\n at the corner of Main and Eagle, the New\u2019\n Tifft on the east side of Main, a block far-\n ther north; the Genesee on the west side of\n Main, two blocks farther north, with the\n smaller hotels at equally convenient points.\n A large number of comfortable and com-\n modious exposition hotels have been erected\n within easy walking distance of the grounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n The business section of the city \u2014 that is\n to say, the retail section \u2014 also is found on\n Main street and adjacont streets a short dis-\n tance from the railway stations. All of the\n large stores are w ' lthin a few blocks of the\n principal hotels, w ' ith most of the principal\n libraries and buildings of Interest near by.\n</p>\n<p>\n The exposition being located adjacent to\n and north of the city park, makes it neces-\n sary for the visitor to pass through the park\n or some portion of it in getting to the\n grounds, and this adds much to the enjoy-\n ment and refreshment of all pilgrims to the\n Rainbow City, as the Pan-American Exposi-\n tion is very appropriately called. In fact, a\n part of the exposition is located on park\n property, and when the visitor becomes\n weary with the bewildering sights of the ex-\n position he may withdraw from the tiresome\n crowd and find rest and comfort floating\n about on the park lake or cooling off in the\n shadow of the park forest and still remain\n within the exposition inclosure.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Front is another delightful spot in\n the city that should not be missed by any\n visitor. That is a beautifully terraced part\n of the park system that stretches away for\n nearly two miles overlooking the point w ' here\n Lake Erie empties its waters into the Niag-\n ara River. From this spot a beautiful view\n of the lake and the neighboring shores of\n Canada is obtained. Fort Porter, a United\n States Army post, is also within this part of\n the park. The Front is reached by the Niag-\n ara trolleys.\n</p>\n<p>\n BICYCLE TRIPS TO BUFFALO\n</p>\n<p>\n ROM information received at\n Exposition Headquarte r s it\n would appear that bicycle tour-\n ing parties to Buffalo will be\n something of a fad. Parties\n formed for the purpose of making this\n wheeling tour have been organized in a num-\n ber of vicinities. Some of these parties are\n of the personally conducted order\u2014 a stipu-\n lated amount peing paid, in installments or\n otherwise, to the organizer or conductor of\n the party who assumes all the responsibility\n and attends to all the business details. In\n other instances clubs are formed on the co-\n operative plan, officers are chosen and week-\n ly or monthly payments made to the club\n treasurer.\n</p>\n<p>\n In planning a tour of this kind there should\n be a large enough party to command respect\n and attention from landlords of hotels, and\n yet not so large that the party cannot be\n comfortably housed and fed, where the stop\n is made at a small town that does not offer\n large accommodations for strangers. A man-\n ager can easily look after a party of twenty\n or thirty cyclists, and the trip can be so ar-\n ranged that it will be possible to stop over\n</p>\n<p>\n ] night in towns able to accommodate at least\n that number.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the selection of the route depends much\n of the success of the tour. The best route is\n not always the shortest. Due consideration\n must be given to the grades, condition of ' the\n roads and sidepaths, scenic, historic and\n other points of interest, as well as the ho-\n tel accommodations en route. This informa-\n tion can be obtained from the books and\n pamphlets published by the different divis-\n ions of the League of American Wheelmen,\n the advertising matter of the railroads and\n the publicity bureau of the Pan-American\n Exposition.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is best to set the day\u2019s run at fifty miles\n and possibly under that. It may be neces-\n sary to ride farther on some days so that a\n particular point can be reached at night, but\n the ordinary wheelman is unable to ride 75\n or 100 miles a day and spend his evenings\n seeing the sights. It is well also to carry\n as little baggage as can be gotten along with.\n The best way is to send the baggage ahead\n by express, so that the tourist may have a\n bath and a change of clothes in the evening\n after his long, dusty ride. It is best to es-\n timate the hotel expenses at $2.50 a day, al-\n though there Is scarcely a town between New\n York and Buffalo where good accommoda-\n tions cannot be secured for $2 a day.\n</p>\n<p>\n The many miles of cycle paths in New York\n State offer great inducements to make the\n trip awheel, but it should be borne in mind\n that any one using a cycle path in this state,\n constructed under the sidepath law, without\n having a sidepath tag prominently displayed\n on his wheel renders himself liable to arrest.\n The tags are sold at 50 cents to $1, and en-\n title the purchaser to use the sidepaths any\n where in the state during the calendar year.\n Non-residents of the state may purchase the\n tags from any county sidepath commission,\n while residents of the state must buy them\n from the commission of the county in which\n they reside.\n</p>\n<p>\n Wheelmen desiring to tour through the\n beautiful and romantic lake region of Cen-\n tral New York will be able to do .so over the\n sidepaths this season. The Seneca County\n commissioners expect to put the path from\n Seneca Falls to Geneva in good condition.\n In Ontario County the path will be finished\n between Geneva and Oak Corners and on\n through Phelps and Canandaigua to the west-\n ern boundary of the county. With these\n paths completed wheelmen will have a con-\n tinuous route of paths from Auburn to Buf-\n falo.

This\n train service can be and will be trebled by\n the simple expedient of running trains in\n three sections whenever the traffic demands\n it. If that doesn\u2019t give trains enough more\n will be put on. Nobody in Greater New\n York shall stay away from the Pan-Ameri-\n can exposition for lack of a train to carry\n him there if the railroads can help it.\n</p>\n<p>\n It will require hard work and lots of it to\n care for those who want to see the Pan-\n American Exposition, according to the pro-\n phecies of the transportation experts. D. I.\n Roberts, the general passenger agent of the\n Erie Railroad, estimates that 500,000 people\n will go from New York to Buffalo during the\n Exposition.\n</p>\n<p>\n George H. Daniels, General Passenger\n Agent of the New York Central, thinks 500,-\n 000 people is not an over-estimate of the num-\n ber who will go from this city to the Expo-\n sition.\n</p>\n<p>\n All the roads running excursions to the\n exposition. The excursions are divided\n into four classes known as A, B, C, D. For\n the excursion known as class D, the rate is\n the same on all the roads \u2014 $9. Tickets pur-\n chased for these excursions are limited to\n five days, including the date of sale, and\n for continuous passage in both directions.\n None of the roads will honor these tickets\n in Pullman or sleeping cars, and they will\n not be accepted by the Central on the Fast\n Mail nor on the Empire State Express.\n They will not be honored for passage by\n the Lehigh on the Black Diamond Express.\n The other roads will accept the tickets on\n all trains carrying day coaches. The tick-\n ets will be available for passage on Tuesday\n of each week in May.\n</p>\n<p>\n Tickets for class C excursions are $12 on\n all roads, with the exception of the Central,\n which makes a charge of $13.75 in view\n of the superior train service offered. These\n tickets are limited to ten days, and are good\n only for continuous passage in both direc-\n tions, with the exception that tickets pur-\n chased through to Niagara Falls at this\n rate will permit stop over in Buffalo in\n either direction, but not in both. Class C\n excursion tickets will be on sale only during\n May. They will be honored by all roads\n in Pullman cars upon payment of Pullman\n charges. They will not be accepted by the\n Central on the Empire State Express nor\n by the Lehigh on the Black Diamond Ex-\n press. Other roads will honor the tickets\n on all trains.\n</p>\n<p>\n Class B excursion tickets continue on\n sale from June 1 until October 31. The\n tickets are limited to fifteen days for con-\n tinuous passage in both directions. They\n provide for the same stop over in Buf-\n falo on Niagara tickets as the class C tick-\n ets. These tickets are $13 on all roads ex-\n cept the Central, -which charges $14.75. They\n will be honored on Pullman cars upon\n</p>\n<p>\n payment of Pullman charges, but the Cen-\n tral will not accept them on the Empire\n Express nor the Lehigh on the Black Dia-\n mond Express. It is very essential that\n visitors to the exposition should remember\n to have their tickets stamped by the Joint\n Agent, at 50 Exchange street, Buffalo. None\n of the roads between this city and Buffalo\n will honor the return portion of the tick-\n ets in classes D, C and B unless they are\n presented to the Joint Agent for identifica-\n tion of signature. In the case of tickets\n purchased to Niagara Falls, where the pas-\n senger does not care to stop over at Buf-\n falo, the ticket may be presented to the\n company ' s ticket agent at the Falls. Un-\n less the matter is attended to at the Falls\n or Buffalo the tickets will be void. This is\n not necessary in the case of class A tickets.\n</p>\n<p>\n Tickets in Class A excursions are good for\n the season and will permit stop over en route.\n They are $16 on all roads except the Central,\n where they are $17. They are now on sale\n and will continue on sale until October 31.\n They are limited to this date for return pas-\n sage except on the Central and D., L. and W.\n where they will be good until November 30.\n They will he honored on all trains, including\n the Empire State Express and the Black Dia-\n mond Express, and on all Pullman and sleep-\n ing cars with the payment of the usual addi-\n tional charges. The Lehigh, however, will\n charge 50 cents additional in each direction\n where these tickets are used on the Black\n Diamond Express.\n</p>\n<p>\n In addition to these excursions which are\n for the general public all the roads will\n charter trains to societies and organizations,\n and the West Shore will make an especially\n low rate to parties of more than one hun-\n dred traveling alone. Such rates may be had\n upon application to the general passenger\n agents.\n</p>\n<p>\n From the fact that the Lake Shore limited\n does not take passengers for Buffalo or\n points east of there, the company has put on\n another train especially for the Exposition,\n and similar in running time and equipment\n to the Lake Shore Limited. Special cars\n have been built for the train, and new en-\n gines, like those that draw the Lake Shore\n Limited, are used. This new train leaves\n New York at 9:30 A. M. and arrives in Buf-\n falo about 8 o\u2019clock in the evening.\n</p>\n<p>\n Aftqr June 1 the Lehigh will take off the\n Western Night Express and will add another\n day train. It will be a faster train than the\n day express, leaving somewhat later in the\n morning and arriving in Buffalo earlier in the\n evening. The Lehigh\u2019s train will be equip-\n ped with new cars that have just been turned\n out of the shops, and the engines have been\n constructed with the object of making fast\n time. The train will leave New York at\n 10 a! M., Brooklyn at 9:50 A. M. and will ar-\n rive in Buffalo at 9 P. M.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Delaware, Lackawanna and Western\n Railroad, which boasts of a roadbed permit-\n ting a speed of seventy miles an hour with-\n out shaking loose the teeth of its passen-\n gers, will make a special bid for the patron-\n age of visitors to the Pan-American Exposi-\n tion. All its main line trains make fast\n time to Buffalo, and passengers have the\n choice of night or day trains, as -well as\n an opportunity to suit their pocketbooks.\n All the fast trains of this railroad are\n equipped with vestibuled sleeping and din-\n ing cars.\n</p>\n<p>\n The inducement that the Erie will offer to\n travelers is the fine new day coaches that\n they have added especially for the comfort\n of Exposition visitors. They are the finest\n day coaches in use between New York and\n Buffalo. The seats have been built with unus-\n ually high backs and head rests and in the\n end of each car there is a very cozy lounging\n and smoking room for men.

Illinois spent $75,000\n for a building, which is just to the right of\n the fore court. The Maryland building, cost-\n ing $25,000, is north of the ordnance build-\n ings. Southwest of the Indian mounds is a\n building two stories high and 100x40 feet,\n for which the State of Michigan appropriated\n $40,000. Minnesota spent $30,000 for its. build-\n ing. Connecticut, Rhode Island and Massa-\n chusetts combined their appropriations, mak-\n ing an aggregate sum of $70,000, with which\n they constructed what is known as the New\n England Building. It is 100x50 feet and two\n stories in height, its fiat roof being sur-\n rounded by a balustrade. It is on the east\n side of the fore coupt. The Missouri and the\n New Jersey buildings cost respectively $50,-\n 000 and $25,000. North of the Illinois Build-\n ing is the Ohio Building. It is rectangular\n in shape, two stories high, with a capacious\n porch and balcony surrounding the entire\n building. It occupies a space 120x80 feet and\n cost $30,000. The Wisconsin Building, on\n which the state spent $25,000, is the first\n building on the right, crossing the bridge\n from the east side of the fore court. It is\n a two story building, with gabled roof and an\n ornamental veranda on the western end. The\n other states that have buildings are Wash-\n ington, ' 3b,000; Oregcs. $20,000; Idaho, $15,-\n 000; North Dakota, $10, 300, and Alabama,\n $25,000.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0023/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0023/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0023/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0023/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0023/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/gu/id/et/op/an/am/er/ic/00/un/se/guidetopanameric00unse/guidetopanameric00unse_0023.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 1108537}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"23\">\n<p>\n GUIDE TO THE PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION, 1901.\n</p>\n<p>\n 21\n</p>\n<p>\n ELECTRICITY AT THE FAIR.\n</p>\n<p>\n LECTRICITY is playing a con-\n spicuous part at the Pan-\n American Exposition. It is the\n energy that makes the\n \u201cwheels go round,\u201d it cre-\n ates new and startling effects on the Mid-\n way, it propels the launches on the canals,\n and it is the force that carries mill-\n ions of people to and from the grounds. At\n night electricity lights the grounds and\n illuminates the buildings, fountains, cascades\n and basins to a degree of beauty and brill-\n iancy never witnessed before. And all this\n force is generated at Niagara Falls, 20\n miles away.\n</p>\n<p>\n Aside from the wide use of electricity as a\n motive power, there is a magnificent\n exhibit of electrical appliances in the Elec-\n tricity Building. This structure is of Span-\n ish Renaissance architecture, covered with\n staff, artistically colored and adorned with\n</p>\n<p>\n sculpture, its dimensions being 500 by 150\n feet. Two of the splendid towers of the\n building rise to a height of 158 feet, while\n those at the north entrance are 128 feet\n high. It was the chief aim to make the\n electrical exhibit a collective rather than\n an exclusively commercial one. Following\n out this purpose there are a number of\n retrospective exhibits of a historical inter-\n est, showing the advances in the art and\n science of electrical development. The com-\n mercial exhibit is not neglected, how-\n ever, and every appliance possessing dis-\n tinctive merit is on exhibition.\n</p>\n<p>\n Chief among the exhibits in the electricity\n building is the showing made by the General\n Electric Company. This includes a ten ton\n</p>\n<p>\n mining locomotive of the latest type, an elec-\n tric hoist and high pressure electrically oper-\n ated pumps such as are used in mining.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another interesting feature demonstrates\n the most improved electric motor arrange-\n ment for operating surface railway and other\n cars. This exhibit consists of the floor of\n a car, with trucks attached, the whole sus-\n pended four or five feet above the floor of\n the building. The motive power is in the\n trucks. The wheels revolve with lightning\n rapidity, but are easily controlled by the\n perfected brake arrangement. Another in-\n structive demonstration is that of the three\n rail electric traction system, known as the\n surface contact system. This consists of con-\n tact points placed equally distant along the\n rail. The rail is made alive by the passage\n of the car over these points. The General\n Electric Company also illustrates the alter-\n nating constant current arc lighting system,\n by means of which the entire building is\n illuminated.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Westinghouse exhibit occupies the en-\n tire central area of the building. Among\n other things, it numbers a 300 horse power\n</p>\n<p>\n gas engine of the latest type. This engine\n drives a dynamo, which furnishes energy for\n the Nernst lamps and electric signs, which\n light the dome of the building most bril-\n liantly. There are more than 100 Nernst\n lamps in the dome, giving between 40,000\n and 50,000 candle power light to that center.\n In the Westinghouse exhibit there are as\n well heavy mining locomotives, dynamos, etc.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Stanley Electric Manufacturing Com-\n pany has a 1,000-kilowatt (equivalent to a\n 1,500-horse power dynamo) in its exhibit.\n This machine is Lot in operation. The claim\n made for it is that it is built on the latest\n lines, and is capable of generating 12,000\n volts.\n</p>\n<p>\n Students of electrical energy are interested\n</p>\n<p>\n in the two models of the Niagara Falls trans-\n former plant shown here. One shows the\n general layout of the great power building at\n the Falls and the other a cross section of the\n present station at the Falls, with one of the\n units in operation.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Edison Manufacturing Company has\n personal inventions of Thomas A. Edison on\n exhibition, and creations of the company, too.\n The new Edison storage battery thermo-elec-\n tric batteries are shown her./. Considerable\n enterprise is shown by the Stromberg-Carlson\n Telephone Manufacturing Company in ex-\n ploiting its system. This company has in\n operation a free telephone system connecting\n all of the buildings on the grounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Kellogg Switchboard and Supply Com-\n pany of Chicago has as the most striking\n feature of its exhibit a complete central\n \u2019phone office, with \u201chello girls\u201d at work, as\n well as a remarkibly interesting showing of\n thel latest appliances and devices in tele-\n phonic mechanism.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another display around which many linger\n is that of the National Carbon Company of\n Pittsburg. This concern has its many prod-\n ucts arranged in attractive shapes and housed\n in a commodious booth made of large blocks\n of carbon.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another branch of electrical industry is\n well illustrated in the exhibit put on by R. W.\n Wagner & Co. of Chicago, which conssists of\n electric-therapeutical apparatus, including\n two large stactic machines and an interesting\n assortment of X-ray appliances. Electric\n signs, excessively brilliant and original in\n design, are scattered through the building.\n Its interior in the evening is bathed in a flood\n of resplendent brightness.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the west end of the building there is a\n collective historical exhibit, which furnishes\n opportunity for study to those not familiar\n with the beginnings of the art. It includes\n pioneer work by the Edison and other com-\n panies. Many of the things shown look re-\n markably crude in comparison with the crea-\n tions of to-day.\n</p>\n<p>\n While the Columbian Exposition was the\n first to remain open at night, the illumina-\n tion there was far inferior to what it is\n at the Pan-American. For its power, elec-\n trical displays and nightly illumination, the\n exposition receives from the power com-\n pany about 5,000 horse power, which un-\n dergoes a loss of 20 per cent, in transmis-\n sion. Probably the most elaborate and\n beautiful electrical display is the\n Electric Tower and Fountain. The tower\n is 409 feet in height, the base being 80 feet\n square, on the east and west sides of which\n two colonnades, 75 feet high, turn to the\n south. When the tower is under full illu-\n mination it is covered with more than\n</p>\n<p>\n 40.000 incandescent lamps. Consummate\n skill has been employed in placing the lights,\n so that the illumination is even over\n the entire surface. The interior of the tow-\n er is a hive of industry. There are\n restaurants, roof gardens, loggias, pavil-\n ions and cupolas. In addition to the lights\n upon the tower, there are distributed\n over the grounds more than 500,000 electric\n lights, the illumination from which ex-\n ceeds in quantity that of any other equal\n area artificially illuminated. At the base\n of the tower is the basin, which supplies\n</p>\n<p>\n 1.500.000 gallons of water per hour to the\n electric fountains. These are played upon\n at night by 100 large sized searchlights.\n</p>\n<p>\n During the months in which the exposition\n is to be open the Buffalo-Niagara region is to\n be the scene of the greatest searchlight ex-\n hibition ever witnessed. For miles on every\n side of Buffalo and the exposition grounds\n there flash through ' the sky and across\n the country, even to Hamilton and Toronto,\n beams, of light projected from the lamps\n operated by Niagara power. Two powerful\n thirty inch projectors are placed on the\n 360 foot level of the Electric Tower, and the\n rays from these are met miles away by\n similar beams from a projector of equal\n brilliancy installed on the top of the\n great Observation Tower ' at Niagara Falls,\n twenty-two miles away. The two beams of\n light meeting in the sky form a crown of\n light, not only for the exposition, but for the\n enti re surrounding country, -\n</p>\n<p>\n SOUTH ENTRANCE OF ELECTRICITY BUILDING.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0024/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0024/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0024/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0024/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0024/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/gu/id/et/op/an/am/er/ic/00/un/se/guidetopanameric00unse/guidetopanameric00unse_0024.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 857976}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"24\">\n<p>\n 22\n</p>\n<p>\n GUIDE TO THE PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION, 1901.\n</p>\n<p>\n Work of the Board of Women Managers\n</p>\n<p>\n ' HE Board of Women\n Managers, made up\n of twenty-five wom-\n en, mostly from\n Buffalo, have gener-\n al charge of the ex-\n ] hlbits which repre-\n sent essentially the\n</p>\n<p>\n j handiwork of their\n</p>\n<p>\n sex and the societies founded and maintained\n oy them. The scope of- the committee\u2019s\n functions, is, in fact, quite as broad and in-\n formal as this phrase suggests. For not\n only does the board represent, in a sense,\n the industrial and the social activities of the\n women of the nation, but the various socie-\n ties whose general character and membership\n are essentially feminine. There is no sep-\n arate building devoted expressly to inter-\n ests of this character. That is, no women\u2019s\n building, but the exhibits are scattered\n through the various buildings.\n</p>\n<p>\n The board maintains headquarters, a cut\n of which is presented herewith, and here\n may be found at all times some of its mem-\n bers. These headquarters are arranged ex-\n pressly for the accommodation and enter-\n tainment of women visitors to the exposi-\n tion, with especial reference to the accom-\n modation of delegates to the board who\n come from distant states. Many of the mem-\n bers of the board who are permanently as-\n signed to the women\u2019s displays have their\n apartments in this building, and others will\n be entertained so far as the accommodations\n will admit.\n</p>\n<p>\n The situation of this building on the\n grounds is ideal. The house faces the Elm-\n wood Gate, one of the main entrances to the\n grounds. It is directly opposite the New\n York State Building, which occupies a com-\n manding position in the broad, beautiful\n parklands, and is a permanent structure of\n white marble. To the south the Woman\u2019s\n Building faces the park lake, where a great\n electric fountain is one of the scenic beau-\n ties of the fair. To the east it faces the Ex-\n position rose gardens, which are marvels\n of fragrance and loveliness.\n</p>\n<p>\n Broad, roomy verandas surround the house,\n and all about the building tall flag poles are\n set, so the Pan-American colors float about\n the Woman\u2019s Building, the Stars and Stripes\n occupying the olacfe of honor.\n</p>\n<p>\n The interior of the building is very artistic.\n A large, airy hall with a roomy fireplace\n first attracts the visitor. A good sized dining\n room and several tea rooms can be used for\n small entertainment. A large apartment on\n the ground floor is o ccupied as a reading and\n magazine room, and occasionally is set aside\n for small conventions of women. It is also\n used for entertainments.\n</p>\n<p>\n The offices of the Women\u2019s Board are on\n the ground floor qf the building. Upstairs\n are attractive resting rooms and dressing\n rooms, also a large apartment facing the\n Amherst Gate, which can be used for wom-\n en\u2019s conventions and congresses and for en-\n tertainments.\n</p>\n<p>\n The house is prettily- furnshed in light,\n summery style. It is sufficiently removed\n from the main Exposition buildings to .be\n a restful retreat to those tired of sight-\n seeing, yet from windows, doorways and\n verandas one may watch the visitors on the\n grounds or gliding along the beautiful wa-\n terways.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some mention of the individuals who make\n</p>\n<p>\n up this board may be of interest in this\n connection.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. William Hamlin, president of the\n board, is a daughter of the late George B.\n Gates. She is actively engaged in philan-\n thropic Work in Buffalo.

The elaborate development of the\n trolley system in and about the city will put\n scores o\u00a3 these side trips within the reach\n of the great crowds for ten to fifty cents,\n while similar advantages are offered by the\n many water route excursions.\n</p>\n<p>\n The trolley car lines in and about the city\n are operated and controlled by the Interna-\n tional Traction Company, which has no ies3\n than 325 miles of track in active and success-\n ful operation. This Is a system that would\n reach nearly across the Empire State, and to\n operate it requires the use of 735 cars, a num-\n ber which it is likely will soon be increased.\n A trolley trip worth taking is the ride from\n Buffalo to Niagara Falls over the Buffalo\n rnd Niagara Falls branch of this system.\n Funning some miles through prominent\n streets of the city, the cars are soon speed-\n ing across the open country, through the\n Tonawandas, the country\u2019s great lumber\n market, on to La Salle, the historic village\n where the first boat that plied the Great Up-\n per lakes was built, and then into Niagara\n Falls. Another lire skirts the Canadian cliff\n and shore from a point far above the falls\n to Queenston, seven miles away. The cars\n run in front of Prospect Park and pass out\n of the United States into the Dominion of\n Canada over the upper steel arch bridge, the\n greatest structure of the kind in the world.\n It is about 1.2C8 feet long from cliff to cliff,\n and the span of the arch proper is about 850\n feet. As the trolley crosses the bridge, mag-\n nificent views of the lower river, the falls\n and the gorge are obtained. There is so\n much to see that it is confusing. As the\n car passed up through Victoria Park,\n on the Canadian side, the American\n and Horseshoe Falls can be seen. The\n trolley winds Its way down the hillside\n to the village of Queenston, and from here\n it is possible to cross, by way of the only\n suspension bridge over the Niagara River, to\n the New York side, where the car runs over\n the tracks of the Niagara Gorge Railroad,\n along the water ' s edge, back to the falls.\n Having viewed the Whirlpool and Whirlpool\n Rapids from the top of the high bank on the\n Canadian side, this trip back along close to\n the water is enjoyable in the extreme. This\n belt line trip about the Niagara Gorge is,\n without doubt, one of the most enjoyable\n scenic trolley trips in America.\n</p>\n<p>\n Still another delightful trolley trip out\n from Buffalo is to Olcott, on the shore of\n Lake Ontario, by way of an extension of the\n Buffalo and Lockport line. This trip carries\n one through the rugged scenery about Lock-\n port, the county seat of Niagara, and on\n through the great fruit belt of Western New\n York. The trip terminates at a most pict-\n uresque bluff on the shore of Lake Ontario.\n Olcott is a popular summer place, and has 1\n</p>\n<p>\n boating, bathing and fishing attractions. To\n go from Buffalo to Olcott by trolley is to\n ride from the county seat of Erie, through\n the county seat of Niagara over a magnifi-\n cent stretch of country between Lake Erie\n and Lake Ontario, and this at a nominal price\n and Without change of cars.\n</p>\n<p>\n The trip out to Lancaster and Depew by\n another suburban line affords opportunity to\n spend a day in looking over the great rail-\n road shops located there and to study the\n system by which thriving towns are built by\n railroads.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another attractive line is that known as\n the International Belt Route. Comfortable\n steamers and up-to-date trolley cars are in\n service on the line. A feature of the trip\n are the searchlight illuminations from the\n steamers at night. By taking one of these\n boat trips, it wi ' l be possible for passengers\n to see all the places of interest along, the\n Upper Niagara River, the beautiful scenery\n surrounding the Falls and the wonders of the\n Gorge and Whirlpool Rapids, at a trifling\n expense.\n</p>\n<p>\n Leaving the Exposition Grounds by trolley,\n the tourist will be taken to the toot of Ferry\n street, where the docks of the International\n Navigation Company are located. Here he\n will beard one of the company ' s steamers\n and obtain a magnificent view of Lake Erie\n and Fort Erie just across the river on the\n Canadian side. This will recall the battle\n near Fort Erie, when the Americans, to the\n number of 1,000 regulars and 1.000 of the\n militia, made a sortie and took the British\n works about 500 yards from their line and re-\n turned in triumph. Sailing down the Ni-\n agara River, the tourist will pass Black\n Rock, where eighty-three years ago the\n Walk-in-the-Water, the first of lake steam-\n boats, was launched. He will then pass un-\n der the famous International Bridge. Con-\n tinuing down the river, the steamer passes\n Grand Island, dotted with handsome club\n houses and summer residences on one side\n and the Canadian shore with its quaint and\n homely farmhouses and magnificent scenery\n on the other.\n</p>\n<p>\n Five miles from Lake Erie the traveler will\n find that the river is eight miles wide and\n embraces, before it reaches the Falls, about\n forty islands. Of these the largest are Grand\n and Navy. Navy Island belongs to Canada\n and contains 304 acres. Grand Island is the\n property of the United States. It is twelve\n miles long and contains 17,384 acres of well\n timbered, rich and productive soil. After\n coasting along past the picturesque and\n beautiful Dufferin Islands, the steamer\n touches at Slater\u2019s Point, Canada. This point\n is interesting as having been at one time a\n famous ship-building yard of the Niagara\n frontier. Here the tourist will disembark\n and board a trolley car. He will be carried\n through the old town of Chippewa, once a\n prosperous manufacturing city, past the his-\n toric battlefields of Chippewa and Lundy\u2019s\n Lane to the old Welland canal, which con-\n nects Lake Erie and Lake Ontario. It com-\n mences at Port Maitland, near the mouth of\n Grand River, on Lake Erie, forty-eight miles\n west of Buffalo, runs in a straight line across\n Mainfield marsh, crosses the Chippewa River\n by means of an aqueduct and so enters Lak^\n</p>\n<p>\n Ontario. The canal is forty-two miles long\n and fifty-six feet wide, and the entire de-\n scent from one lake to the other, three hun-\n dred and thirty-four feet, is accomplished by\n means of thirty-seven locks.\n</p>\n<p>\n At Queen Victoria Park the first view of\n the wonderful Falls of Niagara is obtained.\n The car proceeds through the Canadian vil-\n lage of Niagara Falla, past the new canti-\n lever bridge. After passing Clirton, the site\n of the old suspension bridge, the car runs\n along the edge of the high river bank, from\n which the gorge and whirlpool rapids are in\n constant view, to Queenstown, a quaint and\n historic old Canadian village at the foot of\n the mountain, upon which stands Brock\u2019s\n monument. From this mountain a fine view\n is obtained of Lake Ontario, and on a clear\n day Toronto can be seen forty miles away.\n Leaving Queenstown the car crosses the low-\n er suspension bridge to Lewiston on the\n American side. Lewiston has several inter-\n esting historical associations. Here Daniel\n Webster appeared in court as an attorney;\n here some of Fenimore Cooper\u2019s famous\n novels were written; here La Salle, the\n French explorer, built his cabin in 1678, and\n here, the first railroad of the United States\n was built up the mountain side. It was en-\n tirely of wood and runners were used in place\n of wheels.\n</p>\n<p>\n From Lewiston the trolley descends into\n the great gorge and thence along the water\n edge until it reaches the site of the old sus-\n pension bridge on the American side of the\n river. The route traversed through the\n gorge gives one the grandest imaginable\n views of the lower rapids and the whirlpool.\n A mile below the whirlpool is the Devil ' s\n Hole, where the river cuts away two acres of\n the rock laterally and perpendicularly.\n Carved by nature on the rock near Devil\u2019s\n Hole is the Demons Head. Upon the return\n trip to Buffalo on the American side, the\n car passes the Niagara Falls Power Plant,\n which supplies all the motive power and\n light for the big fair. All the electric pow-\n er utilized at the exposition will be gener-\n ated by the energy of the great cataract.\n One mile above the Falls on the American\n side stands the site of old Fort Schlosser\n erected in 1750. Nothing remains of the fort\n but the entrenchments and an old chimney.\n A stockade was built there in 1672. Before\n the construction of the Erie Canal all busi-\n ness between the lakes was interchanged by\n means of land carriage from Fort Schlosser to\n Lewiston. A further ride on the cars from\n Fort SehlosseT to Buffalo brings this trip to\n a close.\n</p>\n<p>\n Within a few miles of Buffalo are many\n small summer resorts which are easily ac-\n cessible by trolley or water routes.

Near the foot of the lake is Col-\n oron, which is the Coney Island of that part\n of the state.

There are\n bridges a*, convenient points and statuary\n adds much to the picturesque effect.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Ellicott Square Building, which Buf-\n falo people think is the largest office build-\n ing in the world, is ten stories high and\n contains about twelve hundred rooms. Its\n total cost was $3,350,000, and the steel and\n concrete foundation, weighing 5,500 tons, ex-\n tends nineteen feet below grade.

That was, per-\n haps, the very least of the difficulties. Tne\n main trouble was the extreme cheapness of\n steam coal.\n</p>\n<p>\n No sooner had the plan of utilizing the\n forces of Niagara been mooted than there\n was brought forward the fact that good steam\n coal could be purchased in Buffalo, and in\n all the district north of Pittsburg, for $1.50\n a ton. Cheap coal meant cheap steam power,\n and when those who had the Niagara plan\n at heart went to capitalists with their plans\n they were met with the objection that it\n would be impossible to obtain from Niagara\n cheaper power than that already obtainable\n from steam.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is a sermon in the fact that, of all\n the capitalists approached on the subject,\n J. Pierpont Morgan, Francis Lynde Stetson,\n John Jacob Astor and W. K. Vanderbilt were\n practically the only men who would listen.\n Under the title of the Cataract Construction\n Company these men, with some other capi-\n talists, provided the money and the brains\n which built the first power canal at Niagara\n Falls.\n</p>\n<p>\n To-day steam coal is hardly used in the\n forty mile circle of which Niagara Falls is\n the center. Buffalo, from one of the smoki-\n est of cities, has become one of the cleanest.\n All the street cars are operated by elec-\n tricity, all the streets are lighted, the news-\n papers are .printed, the docks are operated\n and the power for the Pan-American Exposi-\n tion is provided by electrical current fur-\n nished by the Falls of Niagara.\n</p>\n<p>\n And from all over the country factories\n needing cheap and plentiful power are mov-\n ing to Buffalo and Niagara Falls.\n</p>\n<p>\n It will be interesting, just here, to de-\n fine, as exactly as may be, what is meant\n by the \u201cforce\u201d of Niagara Falls.\n</p>\n<p>\n To the engineer \u2014 and, for that matter, to\n the layman also \u2014 Niagara Falls means 6,000\n cubic miles of water pouring down over a\n cliff 165 feet high. That immense amount\n of water is supplied by a reservoir area\n in the upper lakes of 90,000 square miles.\n</p>\n<p>\n This torrent of water comes pouring down\n the Niagara River until it reaches a point\n at which the river\u2019s one mile of width is\n reduced by interfering islands to two chan-\n nels aggregating only 3,800 feet.\n</p>\n<p>\n At this narrow point the river becomes a\n rapid, and, in less than half a mile,\n it drops fifty-five feet.\n</p>\n<p>\n Having obtained this momentum, together\n with a depth of about twenty feet at the\n crest of the cataract, the Niagara River then\n plunges 165 feet over the Horseshoe Falls\n into the lower river. In effect, therefore,\n the torrent has fallen 220 feet from the upper\n level of the river.\n</p>\n<p>\n Professor Unwin of England is consid-\n ered to be the best authority upon what\n might be called the mathematics of Niagara.\n He has estimated the ordinary flow of the\n Falls to be about 275,000 cubic feet per\n second.\n</p>\n<p>\n This, in its daily force, is estimated to\n be equal to the latent power of all the coal\n mined in the world each day \u2014 an amount\n which is represented by more than 200,000\n tons a day.\n</p>\n<p>\n Professor Unwin says that the power of\n Niagara Falls is more than 7,000,000 horse\n power.\n</p>\n<p>\n The rvay in which this vast storehouse of\n power has been tapped is simple enough\n when it is understood.\n</p>\n<p>\n Power can be obtained wherever there is\n a high and plentiful fall of water. The Ni-\n agar River, as has been said in the fore-\n going, drops 220 feet in going over the Falls.\n</p>\n<p>\n All that it w r as necessary to do, therefore,\n was to cut a canal which should tap the main\n stream of the river at a point just above\n the .rapids and which should then edge off,\n sideways, from the river.\n</p>\n<p>\n At a quiet place at the end of that canal a\n very deep and wide pit was dug. From the\n bottom of the pit a large tunnel extended\n to a point below the Falls.\n</p>\n<p>\n To express this in the very simplest terms\n it meant that the Niagara Falls Power Com-\n pany had constructed a miniature Niagara\n for themselves \u2014 the canal representing the\n Niagara River, the deep pit taking the\n place of the Horseshoe Falls, and the tun-\n nel at the bottom acting in the place of the\n continuation of the Niagara River below the\n falls.\n</p>\n<p>\n Right over the deep pit at the end of\n the canal the power company constructed\n a big building to contain the power plant.\n From the canal head there opened a num-\n ber of great pipes, called \u201cpenstocks,\u201d which\n dipped down to the bottom of the pit. At\n the bottom of each one of these \u201cpen-\n stocks\u201d was a large turbine.\n</p>\n<p>\n A turbine is a w r ater wheel with its blades\n so arranged that it revolves in a horizon-\n tal position. An ordinary water wheel re-\n volves in a vertical position. A turbine\n wheel looks a litle like a child\u2019s paper\n windmill. Hold such a windmill upright\n and blow down upon it and you will get a\n very good idea of the way a turbine wheel\n revolves when water falls upon it.\n</p>\n<p>\n These turbine wheels, having been placed\n at the bottom of the \u201cpenstocks, \" which\n were to furnish them with water, had in\n its center a big shaft reaching upward and\n into the power house. The main shaft of\n each one of these turbines was then connect-\n ed with the main shaft of an enormous\n dynamo.\n</p>\n<p>\n It followed that when watey was admitted\n to the canal it w T ould arrive at the power\n house. There it would be allowed to fall\n down the various \u201cpenstocks.\u201d In falling\n it would operate a turbine -wheel, and that,\n in its turn, would make the attached dy-\n namo revolve at a high rate of speed.\n</p>\n<p>\n In that way electrical current was gen-\n erated, which, by means of wires, could be\n distributed to the various factories, street\n railroads and lighting plants which re-\n quired such power.\n</p>\n<p>\n That is the story of the way in which\n man has harnessed a part of the power of\n the Falls of Niagara and made nature serve\n his purpose, but it is by no means the end\n of the story of the application of the power\n so obtained. It is only a few years ago\n that practical electricians declared that two\n miles was as far as the Niagara generated\n current could be transmitted. It was said\n that the current would all leak away if\n any attempt was made to send it any fur-\n ther.\n</p>\n<p>\n To-day the current which is generated at\n the Niagara Falls power house is used forty\n miles away and nothing is thought of it. In\n fact, when an electrician of to-day is asked\n to define the available area for Niagara\u2019s\n current he puts one point of his compasses\n upon Buffalo and extends the other point\n until its radius is 500 miles. Then he draws\n a circle.\n</p>\n<p>\n That circle extends a litle beyond Chi-\n cago, and, in its circumference, includes\n most of the important cities and towns\n east of Lake Michigan.\n</p>\n<p>\n In every one of those towns and cities\n cheap power is needed, and needed badly.\n Modern insulation and the methods which\n the tremendous power of Niagara have ren-\n dered necessary will probably solve this\n problem also.\n</p>\n<p>\n ROLLING CHAIRS ARE CHEAP.\n</p>\n<p>\n Excellent facilities for getting about the\n grounds are provided. The wheel chairs,\n pushed by guides, most of whom are college\n men, afford an easy method of seeing the\n Exposition. The rates for their use are much\n lower than at previous expositions. The\n chairs are a great improvement in many ways\n over those used at Chicago. They have ball\n bearings, rubber tires, and a spring gear,\n making them very comfortable. All the lead-\n ing universities are represented among the\n guides who push the chairs. Applications\n were received from over 3,000 college men\n to act in this capacity. The uniform is a\n dark blue suit, decorated with red braid, and\n an automobile cap with red trimmings and\n a nickel badge. The wheel chairs will go\n outside the gates if their patrons desire.\n</p>\n<p>\n The rate for the use of a chair with the\n service of a guide for one hour, 50 cents.\n Use of a chair without guide, for one hour,\n 25 cents. No chair is rented for less than one\n hour and fractions of an hour less than\n thirty minutes are considered as one-half\n hour. For the use of a chair and service\n of a guide for a day of eight hours, $3.50 ia\n charged.\n</p>\n<p>\n The miniature railway affords not only an\n interesting feature for the children who like\n to ride for the sake of riding, but affords\n also a convenient way of getting from place\n to place about, the grounds. Especially con-\n venient in this respect is the stretch of track\n that runs from the East Amherst gate, past\n the Six Nations stockade, back of the Ord-\n nance exhibit, to the art gallery and the\n approach. One line of this railway runs\n from the north side of the Indian Congress\n on the Midway, back of the various conces-\n sions, along the west fence to a station at\n the West Amherst gate. From another sta-\n tion on the north side of the Mall at the\n same gate the line runs to a point near the\n Terminal station exhibit building. Another\n transfer station is here, from whence the\n line runs to the north side of the East Am-\n herst gate. The miniature engine is com-\n plete in every detail and is an interesting\n study for railroad men. The cars all have\n ball bearings and many of them a canopy\n top and they are lighted by electricity. Each\n car carries from four to eight persons and\n about ten cars constitute a train. The en-\n gines are 38 inches high, burn hard coal, are\n capable of pulling twenty-five tons and of\n running at the rate of twenty miles an hour.\n The miniature railway track is 15 inches\n wide. A five cent fare will take one person\n over one line and twenty cents will enable\n one to make almost a complete tour of the\n grounds.\n</p>\n<p>\n The electric launches which ply on the\n Grand Canal and the gondolas afford a pleas-\n ant way of journeying from one part of the\n grounds to another. The round trip may be\n made in the electric launches or gondolas\n for 25 cents, or with a stop-over ticket, good\n any time during the day of issue, 35 cents.\n A gondola and a gondolier may be hired for\n $2 an hour, and gondola, gondolier, singer\n and two instrumental musicians for $5. The\n gondolas will carry 14 or 15 people and the\n electric launches 30.\n</p>\n<p>\n EMERGENCY HOSPITAL.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is an emergency hospital on the\n grounds and tho exposition company has pro-\n vided a competent sta3 of physicians who\n will be in constant attendance. There are\n well equipped operating rooms and all the\n conveniences and improvements ?f a modern\n hospital.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0031/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0031/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0031/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0031/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0031/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/gu/id/et/op/an/am/er/ic/00/un/se/guidetopanameric00unse/guidetopanameric00unse_0031.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 917363}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"31\">\n<p>\n GUIDE TO THE PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION. 1001.\n</p>\n<p>\n 29\n</p>\n<p>\n SPORTS AT THE STADIUM,\n</p>\n<p>\n O more elaborate programme\n for athletic and general sport-\n ing contests has ever been\n planned than is that for the\n handsome Stadium.

The officials of the league announce\n that the meet will be the largest in the his-\n tory of that organization. The central loca-\n tion of Buffalo, which is within easy wheel-\n ing distance of the localities which have\n shown the greatest interest in that sport,\n make certain the attendance of a very large\n representation of wheelmen, and the league\n officials calculate that the attendance of\n riders, professional and amateur, will be\n not less than 10,000. The fine quarter mile\n track of the Stadium will be put in first\n class condition for the cycle events, and all\n of the great riders of the country will be on\n hand.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of no less interest will be the meet of\n the Automobile Club of America, whoso\n board of governors was quick to decu-\n that Buffalo would be the place of as.\n places for the annual session. A pro-\n gramme of long and short distance races\n has already been provided, drawn up by a\n committee of automobilists acting with the\n sports and athletic committee of the expo-\n sition, with the central event a two hun-\n dred mile road race, from Buffalo to Erie and\n return. This contest will he as important as\n the one recently held in France, and there\n will be many of other events calculated to\n bring out all of the possibilities of the self-\n propelling vehicle, such as hill climbing con-\n tests, brake contests and pursuit and relay\n races. In addition to the Buffalo-Erie con-\n test, there will be another long distance event\n in the shape of a run, open to vehicles of all\n kinds, from New York to Buffalo. This will\n not be a speed contest, its object being to\n bring out the general possibilities of the au-\n tomobile; consequently the awards will be\n made on the following basis:\n</p>\n<p>\n First\u2014 Vehicles making the fewest stops en route.\n</p>\n<p>\n Second \u2014 Vehicles carrying the highest percentage\n of pay load.\n</p>\n<p>\n Third\u2014 Vehicles requiring the least repairs.\n</p>\n<p>\n The present plan is to hold this tournament\n during the week beginning September 16.\n</p>\n<p>\n Aquatic as well as land sports will be well\n represented in this general programme. Dur-\n ing July there will be amateur championship\n swimming contests, consisting of 100 yards,\n 200 yards, 440 yards, half mile and mile events\n in the beautiful lake situated in that part of\n Delaware Park, which is included within the\n exposition grounds, and there will also be\n I water polo championship games for all reeia-\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n A CORNER OE THE STADIUM.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0032/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0032/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0032/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0032/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0032/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/gu/id/et/op/an/am/er/ic/00/un/se/guidetopanameric00unse/guidetopanameric00unse_0032.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 902554}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"32\">\n<p>\n 30\n</p>\n<p>\n GUIDE TO THE PAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION, 1901.\n</p>\n<p>\n tered teams.

Included in these exhibits are fine\n displays from the Navy Department and\n the Department of State, and another which\n gives a complete picture of the great fresh\n and salt water fishing industries and the\n manner in which they are encouraged by the\n government.\n</p>\n<p>\n A specially interesting feature of the Navy\n Department\u2019s exhibit is a great 8 by 20 foot\n map of the world, on which are desig-\n</p>\n<p>\n nated, in large letters, the names and loca-\n tion of the principal maritime ports of the\n world and of the United States navy yards\n and stations, at home and abroad. This map\n is drawm upon white canvas, the various di-\n visions of land and water are appropriately\n colored and the exposed surface treated to\n several coats of transparent varnish, the\n whole being mounted on linoleum to prevent\n the canvas from buckling, which would other-\n wise occur, because of atmospheric changes.\n Thus prepared, the map is placed on a spe-\n cially designed table. It covers the globe,\n from the sixtieth parallel north to the six-\n tieth parallel south, and upon it is placed\n 307 miniature lead models each representing\n a battleship, cruiser, monitor, gunboat, tor-\n pedo boat, submarine boat, sailing vessel,\n</p>\n<p>\n collier or tug of the United States Navy, in\n commission, in ordinary, under repairs or\n under construction. The models of cruising\n vessels are painted white, the torpedo boats\n green, the colliers and sailing vessels black\n and the tugs and yard boats orange. The\n largest of the models is not more than 1M\n inches in length.\n</p>\n<p>\n The position of each model upon the map\n shows the location each day of the corre-\n sponding vessel of the Navy. Each model\n flies a pennant, with its namo printed on it\n in bold type. The display of a tiny flag on\n the model signifies that the corresponding\n vessel of the Navy is in commission for\n service, and when no flag is displayed it sig-\n nifies that the corresponding vessel of the\n Navy is laid up in ordinary, under repairs or\n under construction.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Bureau of Medicine and Surgery has a\n full-size representation of the sick bay of a\n battleship. There is the dispensary, with\n ite long line of alcoholic tinctures; a com-\n bined sick bay and operating room, with its\n four comfortable berths and its up-to-date\n glass operating table; an exhibit of the in-\n struments allowed the medical department of\n every ship; an X-ray outfit and a library of\n</p>\n<p>\n BUILDING.\n</p>\n<p>\n professional works issued to each naval ves-\n sel; a model of the hospital ambulance ship\n Solace.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is an elaborate display of fish and\n fish productions which will do a great deal\n toward enlightening the general public in re-\n gard to the importance of this vast industry.\n At present about $60,000,000 is invested in\n the United States fisheries, which give em-\n ployment to 200,000 persons, producing an-\n nually about $50,000,000 worth of the various\n forms of fish. Although the great bulk of\n this business is carried on along the Atlantic\n and Pacific coasts, there is invested in the\n fisheries of thp Freat Lakes more than $6,-\n 000,000 which yields to- *he fishermen $2,600,-\n 000 a year requiring the services of 10,000\n persons.\n</p>\n<p>\n ETHNOLOGY\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0033/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0033/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0033/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0033/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0033/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/gu/id/et/op/an/am/er/ic/00/un/se/guidetopanameric00unse/guidetopanameric00unse_0033.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 835814}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"33\">\n<p>\n GUIDE TO THE PAN- AMERICAN EXPOSITION, 1901.\n</p>\n<p>\n 31\n</p>\n<p>\n COLOR SCHEME IS RESTFUL.\n</p>\n<p>\n Exhaustion Due to Eye Strain Caused\n by Glaring White, so Prevalent\n at Chicago, Absent\n at Buffalo.\n</p>\n<p>\n ISITORS to the Pan-American\n exhibition do not suffer one of\n the serious inconveniences in-\n cident to the historic world\n fair at Chicago eight years ago.\n Beautiful as they were, there can be no doubt\n that the masses of white buildings at Chi-\n cago, with the sunlight making them posi-\n tively dazzling to eyes which were at all sen-\n</p>\n<p>\n by eye strain due to the glaring white every-\n where. In exjressiug himself on this ques-\n tion he said: ,\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI should say that there can be no question\n that the glaring white of the Chicago\n buildings must have been responsible for\n much physical exhaustion, the exact cause\n for which perhaps may not have been fully\n realized by the persons who were affected.\n The use of the eye produces effects exactly\n like those resulting from the use of other\n muscles of the body. If a man who has been\n accustomed to walk, say, five miles a day,\n attempts to walk twenty-five, and to keep\n it up, he will get tired. And so if the retina\n of the eye is forced to do more than it has\n been accustomed to do, it will rebel. Func-\n tionally, tho eye is very sensitively connected\n with the nervous system, and when the eye\n becomes tired, the entire nervous system is\n likely to be more or less affected. Corres-\n</p>\n<p>\n physical exhaustion until the system has be-\n come adapted to the strain.- Nor is this\n exhaustion experienced entirely by persons\n whose eyes are naturally weak or defective,\n for a man who may not have to wear glasses\n for any use of his eyes may not be equal\n to this strain. It is simply a case of the\n eyes getting tired out by lights to which they\n are not accustomed; and, of course, any eye\n is likely to get tired.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Arthur Matthewson of 139 Montague\n street, one of Brooklyn ' s ablest oculists,\n and a man whose reputation goes far be-\n yond the confines of this city, agrees with\n the substance of Dr. Callan\u2019s declaration.\n He said:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cSo far as my personal experience is\n concerned I cannot pronounce definitely\n upon the effect of the white buildings of\n the world fair. That is, I did not go to\n the fair myself while it was in progress,\n</p>\n<p>\n MACHINERY AND TRANSPORTATION BUILDING AND COURT.\n</p>\n<p>\n sitive, were the indirect cause of much phy-\n sical and nervous exhaustion. There are no\n white buildings at Buffalo; the general color\n scheme of the structures is calculated to re-\n lieve the ey;s and consequently to conserve\n the nervous system and the physical strength.\n</p>\n<p>\n That the gii re of the White City really\n W 26 responsible for much physical exhaus-\n tion is a theory which is indorsed by one of\n New York\u2019s expert oculists, Dr. Peter A,\n Callan, who is one of the consulting surgeons\n of the New ' York Eye and Ear Hospital, on\n Second avenue, and an acknowledged authori-\n ty on optical matters. Dr. Callan says that\n much of the exhaustion ro general among\n visitors at Chicago undoubtedly was produced\n</p>\n<p>\n pondingly, nervous exhaustion is certain to\n tell upon the general physical strength.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThere is an affection of the eyes which\n we call snow blindness, and it is caused by\n very marked while lights, such as we get\n from ihe sunlight on snow or any masses\n of glaring white like those produced by\n strong lights on big white structures sim-\n ilar to the world fair buildings. Such blind-\n ness, partial, temporary or complete for\n all time, Is experienced by arctic explorers\n or by persons w r ho, without being accustomed\n to it, are subjected much to the fierce glare\n of the tropical sun. And whether or not\n this strain upon the eyes results in actual\n blindness, it is certain to cause nervous and\n</p>\n<p>\n although I cannot doubt that, in some cases\n much of the exhaustion complained of at\n Chicago may have been due to the very\n bright light thrown off by the white build-\n ings. Some eyes, of course, are more sensi-\n tive than others; and different colors or\n light and shade effects affects different eyes\n in different ways. But a brilliant white light\n is likely to be trying to most eyes, and\n I should say that the buildings at Buffalo,\n which present a more varied color scheme,\n will be restful to the eyes.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The ordnance exhibit at the Pan-American\n Exposition surpasses any display of the kind\n ever made at an exposition.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0034/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0034/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0034/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0034/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0034/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/gu/id/et/op/an/am/er/ic/00/un/se/guidetopanameric00unse/guidetopanameric00unse_0034.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 861018}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"34\">\n<p>\n 32\n</p>\n<p>\n GUIDE TO THE TAN-AMERICAN EXPOSITION, 1901.\n</p>\n<p>\n GREAT PLACE FOR CAMERAS.\n</p>\n<p>\n Amateur Photographers Can Fairly\n Eevel in Attractive Subjects.\n Rules and Restric-\n tions.\n</p>\n<p>\n T WOULD really be difficult for\n an amateur photographer to\n take snap shots at the Pan-\n American Exposition and not\n get something worth having,\n and I will tell you why,\u201d said F. F. Helmer,\n who Is in charge of designs and printing for\n the Bureau of Publicity.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt is not a place made up only of vast\n courts and big buildings, though the courts\n are indeed larger than those of any previous\n exposition. The courts are more of the na-\n ture of great gardens filled with the sort of\n things that go to make up interesting pict-\n ures \u2014 trees, vases, fountains, beds of flowers,\n arbors, fantastic seats covered with awnings,\n flagstaffs and banners, pagoda, terraces and\n balustrades, with a wealth of statuary set out\n amid ' trees or under the spray of fountains.\n And when you look at the buildings it is al-\n most impossible to get a view without some\n of these attractive bits in the foreground.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThere is no straight, unbroken facades\n that are so unsatisfactory in photographic\n compositions, for the buildings are closely\n massed together, giving their towers a chance\n to group in endless charming combinations,\n while on all sides are trees, fountains, lakes,\n canals or vine-covered pergolas that cannot\n fail to furnish relief to the architectural lines.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cImagine yourself in the Court of Foun-\n tains, for instance. At one side of you is\n the great basin of the court splashing and\n shimmering under its many jets of water;\n along its margin are balustrades, seats cov-\n ered with awnings, a strip of grass plot and\n trees making backgrounds for some of the\n choice works of St. Gaudens, MacmonDies\n and other famous sculptors. You here get\n out your camera and point it, say northwest,\n toward the Machinery Building. In your\n finder you see a tree or bit of statuary that\n has got to come in \u2014 very well \u2014 by shifting a\n little you get one of the magnificent en-\n trances to the building, or a corner pavilion,\n between the breaks of the foliage, with tow-\n ers \u2014 a host of them \u2014 looming up above all.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cEverybody is bound to find favorite views\n \u2014 a certain angle of a choice building, a par-\n ticular pavilion, a special sight from one of\n the pergolas, a look here or nook there \u2014\n something which if preserved will more\n clearly take one back to the exposition and\n set him once more in the midst of all its\n enjoyments than any panorama or birdseyo\n view.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cYou may think, perhaps, I am a little too\n enthusiastic, that I have dreamed over this\n till I begin to see things in a superlative,\n advertising form. Not at all. I have han-\n dled pictures till one might easily have tired\n of the exposition, but I did not tire of it.\n My enthusiasm has constantly ris^n even at\n the sight of unfinished work in trying sea-\n sons of bare fall and winter. \\{ has been\n necessary many times to tramp over the\n grounds to find what we had available in\n these unauspicious seasons for illustrations in\n our exposition matter, and I must truthfully\n say that it required but little imagination\n with such knowledge as I had of the statuary\n that was coming, and the plans of courts\n</p>\n<p>\n i then laid out on paper, to see the whole place\n ! a veritable photographers\u2019 paradise.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cOutside of the exposition, Buffalo\u2019s lake\n j front and her shady streets and parks also\n J offer excellent opportunities, while with a\n bicycle or automobile the photographer will\n find himself master of the hunt on one of\n the richest courses for picture chasing in all\n America.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cTo catch views of Niagara Falls on all\n sides and bring your game home, you need\n but the ordinary possession of bicycle and\n camera, while up and down the Niagara\n River, at historic Queenston, Lewiston, and\n Fort Niagara and even inland, the wheeling\n photographer will find subjects of inherent\n interest ' and artistic possibilities of prize\n taking value. I know from the rare material\n that Buffalo amateurs have brought to the\n Bureau of Publicity, for use in our folders,\n that there is sport royal for the photographer\n in all directions about us.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Under certain restrictions, a pictorial rec-\n ord can be made of the many attractions of\n the great exposition. The regulations re-\n stricting the use of cameras on the grounds\n of the Pan-American Exposition, under the\n concession granted to C. D. Arnold, provide\n that no cameras exceeding four by five\n inches shall be allowed within the gates.\n Sterescopic cameras and tripods will not be\n admitted under any circumstances. The fee\n for the admission of cameras four by five\n inches or under w ' ill be 50 cents for a day\n or $1.50 for a week.\n</p>\n<p>\n BEST OF MINERAL EXHIBITS.\n</p>\n<p>\n HE mineral exhibit at the Pan-\n American Exposition is one of\n the most complete collections\n ever gathered. Some of the\n finest specimens of gold and\n gold nuggets in the world have been secured\n for the display. Dr. David T. Day of the\n United States Geological Survey, with\u2019a corps\n of efficient assistants, has been engaged for\n some months in getting together the speci-\n mens for the Goverment exhibit. Many of\n the finest specimens of the Goverment\u2019s col-\n lection were taken to the Paris Exposition,\n but they are shown at the Pan-American,\n in addition to many others that have been\n on exhibition before.\n</p>\n<p>\n The largest gold nugget found in America\n during the last decade, the one taken from\n the Ladies\u2019 Canyon placer mine, is included in\n the display. The nugget weighs nearly sixty\n ounces, and its value as a nugget is $1,400.\n As the centerpiece of the gold exhibit there\n is a still larger nugget that has been stored\n in Paris for the last fifteen years. Its bullion\n value is $3,000, but as a specimen it is esti-\n mated to be worth at least $20,000. It has a\n great scientific value, as it shows every form\n of crystallization that gold ever takes. There\n has never been so valuable a nugget taken\n from the earth. There are fine exhibits of\n the nearly pure gold taken from the Grass\n Valley section of California, and several\n specimens from \u2022 Oregon and Washington,\n both of these states having recently produced\n nuggets about the size and shape of a lady\u2019s\n hand. There are also several specimens from\n the Eastern states, some of w r hich weigh ten\n pounds. A plaster cast of every bar of gold\n ever taken out of the Haile mine. South\n Carolina, is shown in the exhibit. The Klon-\n dike and Cape Nome have ' sent nuggets and\n specimens, and New. Mexico is well repre-\n sented in a gold exhibit.\n</p>\n<p>\n The exhibit of silver is not surpassed b y\n</p>\n<p>\n that of the gold, and it includes one famp\n</p>\n<p>\n that w^as taken out of the Molly Gibson\n mine, Colorado, having a bullion value of\n $3,OOC. The silver nuggets from Cripple\n Creek are worth at least $75,000. Some are\n dissected to show the mixture of silver, cop-\n per, iron and gold.\n</p>\n<p>\n New Mexico has a fine exhibit of turquoises\n and Wisconsin has sent diamonds that were\n washed down to her from Canada by glacial\n action. There are rubies and sapphires from\n Montana and garnets that were picked up\n in ant hills. The Carolinas also have sent\n sapphires and rubies, although the percent-\n age of pigeon blood stones is very small.\n North Carolina has sent ten other varieties\n of gems, among which is the rubelite, a spe-\n cies of garnet that is very attractive.\n</p>\n<p>\n Maryland\u2019s exhibit includes specimens of\n coal and the fine white marble of which\n the Washington memorial is built. Georgia\n has a display of clay and kaolin. Canada\n has an elaborate exhibit of precious metals,\n in addition to some fine specimens of baser\n metals.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is a large collective exhibit of the\n mineral products of Peru, Brazil and Chili,\n and specimens of the iron products of Cuba.\n It is said that the character of Cuba\u2019s iron\n ore \u2014 chrome iron \u2014 indicates that platinum,\n asbestos, soapstone and gold are to be found\n in the vicinity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Pennsylvania and California have exhibits\n of petroleum, and these will include maps\n showing the oil country and the section\n through which the oil is to be found. Be-\n side \u2022 Montana\u2019s other exhibits, there is a\n large heroic statue shaped from Montana\n copper.\n</p>\n<p>\n The AJines Building is one of the three fine\n buildings that have been artanged in the\n form of a horseshoe. It is the heel calk in\n the group, and is connected with the Horti-\n cultural Building, which forms the toe calk,\n by means of the two handsome conserva-\n tories that flank the Horticultural Building\n on the north and south. The Mines Build-\n ing is 150 feet square, having four corner\n pavilions, each reaching to a height of 100\n feet.\n</p>\n<p>\n ARCHAEOLOGICAL EXHIBITS.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Ethnology Building is full of fine\n archaeological specimens. One of the most\n unique exhibits in the building is from Alas-\n ka. This exhibit occupies the place which\n had been assigned for the New York State\n Archaeological display.\n</p>\n<p>\n While this Alaskan exhibit is not of great-\n er scientific value than smaller material col-\n lected from New York State, it is doubtless\n of greater interest to most of the visitors\n to the exposition on account of the distance\n from which it comes and on account of the\n fact that the archaeology of New York State\n is very similar to that of large portions of\n this country, while the archaeology of Alaska\n is unique. It occupies a quadrant of the\n ground floor in the Ethnology Building.\n</p>\n<p>\n The southern quadrant of the building is\n devoted to an exhibit from Mexico, and the\n eastern quadrant to the exhibits from the\n other southern Latin-American countries.\n Canada and the United States are repre-\n sented in the balcony.\n</p>\n<p>\n WHERE THE PLAZA IS.\n</p>\n<p>\n At the northern end of the grounds three\n large buildings form a square, 350 by 500 feet,\n in the center which is the Plaza.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2022 The first permanent settlement was made\n at the mouth of Buffalo Creek in 1792, but\n the village was burned by the British in\n 1812 .\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0035/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0035/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0035/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0035/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0035/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/gu/id/et/op/an/am/er/ic/00/un/se/guidetopanameric00unse/guidetopanameric00unse_0035.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 519422}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"35\">\n<p>\n ' * ' * ' *\u2022* ABSOLUTELY FIRE-PROOF J\n</p>\n<p>\n THE\n</p>\n<p>\n EAGLE\n</p>\n<p>\n Company*\n</p>\n<p>\n 28 to 38 Fulton St.\n</p>\n<p>\n BOROUGH OF BROOKLYN\n</p>\n<p>\n TELEPHONE No. 499 MAIN.\n</p>\n<p>\n Household Goods, Merchandise, etc., Carefully Stored\n</p>\n<p>\n This Warehouse is Centrally Located for Downtown New York Merchants.\n</p>\n<p>\n SAFE DEPOSIT AND SILVER VAULTS.\n</p>\n<p>\n CARPETS CLEANED AND RE-LAID.\n</p>\n<p>\n GOODS PACKED AND TRANSPORTED\n</p>\n<p>\n IN COMPANY\u2019S OWN VANS.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0036/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 340, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 491}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0036/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 680, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 983}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0036/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1360, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1967}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0036/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2720, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3935}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:gu:id:et:op:an:am:er:ic:00:un:se:guidetopanameric00unse:guidetopanameric00unse_0036/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/gu/id/et/op/an/am/er/ic/00/un/se/guidetopanameric00unse/guidetopanameric00unse_0036.jp2", "height": 3935, "width": 2720, "levels": 6, "size": 960740}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"36\">\n<p>\n LIBRARY Ol- UUNuncoa\n</p>\n<p>\n iiiuiiiiiiiiiniiiiiiiiiiiiiiii\n</p>\n<p>\n 0 019 770 496\n</p>\n<p>\n Sotng jingwhere\n</p>\n<p>\n TJhis Summer P\n</p>\n<p>\n ^jff n yin/ormation 2/ou ^Desire\n</p>\n<p>\n 2/ou Can Obtain Jree of Charge at the\n</p>\n<p>\n ffiroo/c/yn *Dcti/y < Sagle\n information f/3ureau,\n Stoom 2 3 Cagle S3 u tiding,\n</p>\n<p>\n Washington St Johnson Sts, borough of tProoklgn .\n Buffalo Office\n</p>\n<p>\n ? a in Street.\n</p>\n<p>\n Circulars, Cirne Cables, 77/aps, illustrations\n</p>\n<p>\n jtnd, in fact, all details regarding\n</p>\n<p>\n Sfotels, S3 carding houses, Railroads, and\n Steamship Hines will bo cheerfullg given gou\n tft. 0?.
