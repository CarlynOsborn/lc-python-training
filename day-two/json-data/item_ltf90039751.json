Gen .\n</p>\n<p>\n WAR DEPARTMENT, >\n July 21, 1812. 5\n</p>\n<p>\n Sir,\n</p>\n<p>\n By information received from Major Gener-\n al Dearborn, it appears that the detachments from the\n militia of Massachusetts for the defence of the mari-\n time frontier, required by him under the authority of\n the President, by virtue of the act of the 10th of\n April, 1812, have not been marched to the several\n stations assigned them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Inasmuch as longer delay may be followed with\n distress to a certain portion of our fellow citizens, and\n with injurious consequences to our country, I am com-\n manded by the President to inform your Excellency\n that this arrangement of the militia was preparatory\n to the march of the regular troops to the northern\n frontier. The exigencies of the service have requir-\n ed, and orders have accordingly been given to Major\n General Dearborn, to move the regular troops to that\n frontier, leaving a sufficient number to man the guns\n in the garrisons on the sea- board. The execution of\n this order, increases, as your Excellency cannot fail\n lo observe, the necessity of hastening the detached\n militia to their several posts as assigned by General\n Dearborn ; in which case they will of course be con-\n sidered in the actual service and pay of the United\n States.\n</p>\n<p>\n The danger of invasion which existed at the time\n of issuing the order of the President, mcreases ; and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sp:ee:ch:of:hi:se:xc:el:00:ma:ss:_0:speechofhisexcel00mass_0:speechofhisexcel00mass_0_0024/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 147, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 280}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sp:ee:ch:of:hi:se:xc:el:00:ma:ss:_0:speechofhisexcel00mass_0:speechofhisexcel00mass_0_0024/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 295, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 560}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sp:ee:ch:of:hi:se:xc:el:00:ma:ss:_0:speechofhisexcel00mass_0:speechofhisexcel00mass_0_0024/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 591, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1121}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sp:ee:ch:of:hi:se:xc:el:00:ma:ss:_0:speechofhisexcel00mass_0:speechofhisexcel00mass_0_0024/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1183, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2242}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sp:ee:ch:of:hi:se:xc:el:00:ma:ss:_0:speechofhisexcel00mass_0:speechofhisexcel00mass_0_0024/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2366, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4484}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sp:ee:ch:of:hi:se:xc:el:00:ma:ss:_0:speechofhisexcel00mass_0:speechofhisexcel00mass_0_0024/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sp/ee/ch/of/hi/se/xc/el/00/ma/ss/_0/speechofhisexcel00mass_0/speechofhisexcel00mass_0_0024.jp2", "height": 4484, "width": 2366, "levels": 6, "size": 741832}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"24\">\n<p>\n 20\n</p>\n<p>\n I am specially directed by the President to urge this\n consideration to your Excellency, as requiring the\n necessary order to he given for the immediate inarch\n of the several detachments specified by General Dear-\n born, to their respective posts.\n</p>\n<p>\n I have the honour to be, very respectfully,\n</p>\n<p>\n Sir, your Excellency\u2019s obedient servant,\n</p>\n<p>\n WILLIAM EUSTIS\n His Excellency Caleb Strong, 7\n Governor of Massachusetts . 3\n</p>\n<p>\n Boston August 1 , i8U.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Honourable the Justices of the Supreme Jndi\n cial Court of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts .\n</p>\n<p>\n Gentlemen,\n</p>\n<p>\n Having laid before the Council of this State a let-\n ter from the Secretary of War of the 12th of June\n last, and letters dated June 22, and July 15, 1812,\n which I received from Maj.
