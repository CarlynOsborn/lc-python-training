Jas. C. Furman, on the first\n Lord\u2019s day of January, 1838. The sermon was subsequently given to\n Dr. James P.

Their first\n settlement was at Pennepeck,f in what is now the State of Pennsylvania.\n Here they continued a year and a half, during which time the church in-\n creased from twelve to twenty-seven. From this place they removed to\n another point, then in the province of Pennsylvania, but now in the State\n of Delaware, having purchased a tract of thirty thousand acres of land,\n from individuals who had derived their possession from William Penn.\n They built themselves a house of worship, and until this time the church\n continues to exist under the appellation of the Welsh Tract Church. J From\n this church several others have originated, and among them the church\n which is established here.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1737, thirty individuals, bearing the family names of James, Devon-\n ald, Evans, Jones, Wilds and Harry removed from the Welsh Tract into\n this neighborhood, \u00a7 and in January, 1738 were constituted into a church.\n At that time there were but two other Baptist churches in Carolina, viz. :\n Charleston and Ashley River. The latter of these having become ex-\n tinct, this church is the next oldest within the State. The first name by\n which it was known was that of the Pee Dee Church, but in process of time,\n when other churches had been planted in the same region, it became nec-\n essary to give it a more distinctive appellation. It was then called the\n Welsh Neck Church. Many years afterward, when the house of worship\n upon the bank of the river had been abandoned, and one at Society Hill\n occupied in its stead, it was determined to make a corresponding change\n in the name, but this decision was in a short time reversed.\n</p>\n<p>\n Much of the early history of this body, as has been intimated, is irre-\n coverably lost. Like the churches in apostolic time, they supplied the\n place of a public edifice for divine worship by assembling in a private\n house, so that they might immediately after their organization have been\n styled \u201cthe church in the house of John Jones. \u201d|| They, however, early\n</p>\n<p>\n * Described by Morgan Edwards as \u201ca church emigrant and sailant.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n f (Pennepeck.)

Morgan Edwards, prepared in 1772, and entitled\n \u201cMaterials towards a history of the Baptists in the Province of South Car-\n olina.\u201d He thus remarks: \u2018In 1747, a tumult arose in this church, in con-\n sequence of a sermon that was delivered by one of their preachers\n (Brown), wherein he advanced some curious speculations relative to the\n first resurrection; the process of the last judgment ; degrees of glory in\n heaven, etc. ; but when the sense of the Philadelphia Association and that\n of other ministers were obtained, both parties perceived that they were\n only making \u2018much ado about nothing.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Brown\u2019s pastoral care of the church was of very short continuance.\n He was succeeded by Rev. Joshua Edwards, a native of Wales, baptized\n in the Welsh Tract, and ordained at the Pee Dee. His successor was the\n Rev. Robert Williams. In the sermon occasioned by his funeral, his char-\n acter is thus described by Mr. Pugh : \u201cHe was kind to the poor, and re-\n markably so to the afflicted ; a man of excellent natural parts; and a\n minister who preached the Gospel to the edification and comfort of souls,\n as many have testified to me ; and, to crown all, a sincere Christian.\u201d His\n connection with the church w T as of short duration. He was the grand-\n father of the late Gen. David R. Williams, formerly Governor of the State.\n</p>\n<p>\n The records which have been preserved begin in his time, and notwith-\n standing the favorable account of his character above given, the first ar-\n ticle in the record brings to view the dissatisfaction of the church with his\n conduct.

Nicholas Bedgegood, Morgan Edwards thus\n writes : \u201cHe was born Jan. 30, 1730 or \u201931, at Thornburg, in Gloucester-\n shire. Bred a churchman, came to America in 1751. Embraced the sen-\n timents of the Baptists July 19, 1757, and had the ordinance adminis-\n tered to him at Charleston by Rev. Oliver Hart. The means of determin-\n ing his suspense about the validity of infant baptism was a sermon of Dr.\n Watts, calculated to establish the point. He concluded that the Doctor\n had said the best that could be said on the subject, and if so, saw that the\n best only proves that ^sprinkling is an unscriptural practice. He was or-\n dained in February, 1759, and became minister of this church in the\n month of April following. One sermon of his, preached before a society\n of planters, {Quaere, The St. David\u2019s Society?) is printed, and shows\n him to be a classic scholar, and a man of good understanding. Mr.\n Bedgegood received his first serious impressions under the ministry of Mr.\n Whitefield, and was for some time his agent in the orphan house in Geor-\n gia, for which employ he was very capable, as he had, in his younger\n days, studied the law under the direction of an able Master in Bristol.\u201d\n He took charge of the church in 1759 and held it until 1765. He then\n preached to a branch of the Charleston Church, on James Island, until\n 1767, when he resumed his office here, and held it until his death in 1773\n or \u201974.\n</p>\n<p>\n During the short time of his absence the Rev. Evan Pugh was pastor.\n Born in Pennsylvania, he was educated a Quaker. He became a Baptist,\n however, when a young man, studied theology, \u201cbecame a minister in\n 1763, and continued in that office nearly forty years. He was a cordial\n friend to the American Revolution and a member of the State conven-\n tion which formed the constitution of South Carolina in 1790. ... He\n was a man of genuine piety, of sound judgment, of plain, unaffected man-\n ners, and of a cheerful conversation.\u201d History of Charleston Association.\n</p>\n<p>\n The successor of Mr. Bedgegood was the Rev. Elhannon Winchester.\n He assumed the care of the church in 1775 or 1776, and continued it un-\n til some time, probably September, in 1779. Mr. Winchester is said to\n have been a man of some uncommon powers, of an engaging address, and\n remarkable memory. The late Dr. Maxey is known to have mentioned\n a conversation in which he remarked to Mr. Winchester that it was said\n of him he knew the Bible by heart. Mr. Winchester replied that he did\n not profess such a knowledge of the Bible, but if any passage were quoted\n he could undertake to quote every parallel passage, or if any doctrine\n were asserted he would repeat the passages in which it was to be found.\n Mr. Winchester evidently enjoyed the affections of the church during his\n connection with them. During the last year of his pastorate an exceed-\n ingly large addition was made to the number of members. Two hundred\n and forty persons were baptized.

This may be at-\n tributed to that state of feeling which attends a revival of religion, when\n a deep solicitude about the salvation of others, and the prevalence of\n strong consolations in the bosoms of Christians themselves, predispose\n them to hope the best in every case where any encouraging appearances\n are seen.\u201d But it is more than likely that his conduct is to be explained\n by a change in his sentiments which he afterward avowed, and which it\n is probable had at this time taken place. He subsequently became a\n preacher of one form of Universalism, and wrote and published a book\n upon the subject. The following remarks are extracted from Benedict\u2019s\n History of the Baptists : \u201cThe rage for this doctrine prevailed for a time\n to a considerable extent, but it was at length found to be easier to let sin-\n ners into a disciplinary purgatory than it was to get them out algain ; and\n this visionary scheme is now exploded by all, among the Baptists at least,\n who have any regard for gospel truth. Those ministers who embraced it\n generally descended into errors ' of a blasting nature, or else sunk into ob-\n scurity and insignificance. Mr. Winchester, the author, or rather reviver\n of it in modern times, was for a while a very popular preacher among the\n Baptists. He was indeed in some respects, and particularly in memory, a\n prodigy of nature, and his talents and address were such that he was sure\n to command followers and applause of some kind or other wherever he\n went, and whatever he preached. His theory of Universalism was bor-\n rowed from a German author, to which he added some things from the\n reveries of his own eccentric imagination. His scheme appears never to\n have been well digested, and it is thought by many that he would have\n abandoned it had it not been for the difficulty of saying, \u201cI was mista-\n ken.\u201d But he died rather suddenly in the midst of his singular career,\n and those who knew him best entertain different opinions respecting his\n acquaintance with the religion of the heart. Yol. 1, p. 276.\n</p>\n<p>\n Immediately after the resignation of Mr. Winchester, a call to the pas-\n toral office was extended to the Rev. Edmund Botsford, who had been la-\n boring with great success in Georgia. Mr. Botsford having visited the\n church in Nov., 1779, accepted the call. The troubles of war induced\n him to retire in June of the following year into Virginia, whence he re-\n turned in 1782. During the time of his absence the church w T as supplied\n by the Rev.

Several incidents in his youth, a\n native eccentricity of character, a strong understanding diligently ap-\n plied to the study of the word, devoted piety, a happy art of writing dis-\n played in his letters and several printed pieces, and a preparation for\n heaven effected by the trials of long and severe affliction patiently en-\n dured, are circumstances which throw an interest around the life of this\n man of God.

Of this portion of the church ' s history\n there is from some cause no record. Under the article, \u201cBethel Associa-\n tion,\u201d in Benedict\u2019s History of the Baptists, I find the following account\n of Mr. Lilly : \u201cDavid Lilly was an eminent minister in this Association\n nearly, if not quite, from its establishment until the Edgefield Association\n was taken from it, when he united with that body and died within its\n bounds about 1809. There were sufficient materials for an interesting\n memoir of his life which his friends proposed to publish, and from which\n I intended to select a biographical sketch of his character, but this tribute\n of respect which was due to an eminent and worthy minister of the gos-\n pel has never been paid.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The next pastor was the Rev. Frame Woods. He occupied the office\n about eight years, vacating it in 1807.\n</p>\n<p>\n There was no record in 1808.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1809, the Rev. Daniel White was chosen pastor. Mr. White was a\n Scotchman by birth. His conversion, in common with that of a large\n number of others, occurred under the preaching of Daniel McCarthy, an\n uneducated highlander, who, having been brought to the knowledge of the\n truth, appealed to the simple word of God as the standard of faith and\n practice, and having adopted views as to the nature of experimental re-\n ligion and of Christian duty essentially different from those in which he\n had been brought up, preached the gospel with Apostolic boldness and\n fervor, and became the instrument of conversion to a large number of his\n neighbors. Convinced by the tenor of the New Testament that it was the\n imperative duty of believers to be baptized in obedience to the command\n of Christ, he traveled on foot in company with several others a consider-\n able distance, in order to secure the services of a minister to perform the\n rite. Mr. White was one of these companions. He subsequently removed\n to this country, and at the call of this church settled with them as their\n pastor.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1811 he resigned the pastoral charge of the churcb, but at their re-\n quest he acted as their supply during the ensuing year.\n</p>\n<p>\n In June, 1813, Rev. William Dossey was invited, and in February,\n 1814, signified his acceptance of the invitation to become pastor. From\n this period the church experienced a more rapid extension than it had be-\n fore. Mr. Dossey \u2019s pastoral labors ended in Dec., 1832, at which time he\n resigned his place.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the absence of a pastor the church enjoyed only occasional supplies\n during an interval of two years, after which time the present incumbent\n was settled among them. Of these later periods, although ampler records\n would enable us to speak more fully, yet it is evidently proper that this\n work should be left to those who will come after us.\n</p>\n<p>\n The individuals whose names are known as deacons and who are now\n deceased, with the exception of one who is still living, but who resigned\n the office of deacon for the wider labors of the ministry, are John David,\n Abel Edwards, Samuel Evans, Samuel Wilson, Evander Mclver, Peter\n Edwards, John Kirven, William Kirven and Daniel Campbell.

Their choice of deacons seems to have been directed to men of\n honest report, full of the Holy Ghost and wisdom.\n</p>\n<p>\n The subjoined list* exhibits an account of the number baptized, and the\n number excluded between the years 1760 and 1834 inclusive, embracing\n a period of 74 years. There is reason, however, to believe that previous\n to the time of Mr. Dossey\u2019s ministry the cases of persons baptized were\n not always recorded. Of several years the records were either never kept\n \u2022at all or are wholly lost. This is true of the year 1780 and part of 1781,\n the period of Mr. Botsford\u2019s absence in Virginia, and of the years 1799,\n 1800, 1801, 1802, and part of 1803. Deducting the seven years, the\n records of which are defective, from 74 we have 67 years left. During\n these 67 years the number of persons baptized was 840; the number of\n those excluded, 127. If we extract the number excluded from the num-\n ber baptized, we have 713 left as the number of persons who professed\n religion and maintained their profession by a correspondent life. But\n 127 is too large a number to allow for the finally excommunicated, inas-\n much as many of these individuals were brought to repentance by the\n blessing of God upon the discipline of the church and were subsequently\n restored. But allowing this large number to represent the excluded we\n have an average of between 10 and 11 persons for each year, concerning\n whom we have evidence to believe that they were truly converted and\n made heirs of eternal life. The amount of good they effected we cannot\n calculate. Conceptions far more vast than any human mind can form are\n necessary to estimate the value of an immortal soul, and the importance\n of its salvation. Throughout eternity, when all the glories of earth shall\n have passed away like the illusions of a dream, many, many will dwell\n with adoring gratitude upon the fact that a church of Jesus Christ was\n established at Society Hill \u2014 that God recorded his name there, and there\n came unto his people, and blessed them there ! What unutterable joy\n must fill the bosoms of that little company, who, 100 years ago, when they\n pitched their tent upon the banks of the Pee Dee, sought first of all \u201ca\n dwelling place for the God of Jacob,\u201d when they behold the results of\n their pious cares and labors. For surely we may hope that that God who\n has been the consolation and defence of his church lo these hundred\n years, will continue to be \u201ca wall of fire round about her, and the glory\n in the midst of her.\u201d But a numerical statement of the number baptized,\n who walked worthy of their vocation, does not exhibit all the good which\n has in this way been accomplished. It is with churches as with individ-\n uals, their usefulness is not to be measured by the results of their own\n individual labors alone. They may in some sense be considered as living,\n \u2022acting and doing good in those who were excited to action by their agency\n or example. Like the first link in a chain, without which all the rest\n would be of no avail, so in society there have been rare and active spirits\n to whom may be traced the rise of other individuals of kindred excel-\n lence, who but for them would have remained in obscure inaction.

This\n church was probably divided into the churches known as the Upper and\n Lower Forks of Lynch\u2019s Creek, and (another whose name is not given.)\n</p>\n<p>\n There is one matter in which our expectations are disappointed in re-\n viewing the history of the church, viz: the small number of persons\n brought into the ministry from the church. As has been already stated,\n their first pastor seems to have been raised up from among themselves. Until\n as late a period as 1817, we find no mention of any other being licensed.\n In that year Ivey Walke received permission from the church to exercise\n his gifts. It is believed his subsequent conduct after a removal from the\n State, was not consistent with his profession. Thomas Mason was licensed\n in 1819, still lives, and is esteemed among the churches as a Godly man\n and useful minister. Clement D. Wallace, a licentiate of the Sugar Creek\n Church, in North Carolina, was called by this church to ordination in\n 1824, an act of the church, which, if it were possible, they would gladly\n undo. In February, 1830, John Holroyd, and in May following, William\n Kirven, were licensed to preach. The former has gone to his rest, la-\n mented by his brethren as an amiable and intelligent man and an accept-\n able preacher of the Gospel. The latter still lives, though in a distant\n section of the country, universally regarded by those who know him as a\n \u201cgood minister of Jesus Christ.\u2019\u2019* In regard to the work of the ministry,\n it must be feared that many lived and died who never did their duty.\n It may deserve note here that one of those who were licensed by the\n church has declared, his solemn conviction, that if it was his duty to\n preach at all it was so years before he began.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are a few geneneral matters which it is proper to mention. The\n change of the location of the meeting house from the bank of the river to\n Society Hillf has been already stated. This took place some time pre-\n vious to the year 1803, but during that period of several years of which\n the record is lost. The precise date of this removal is unknown.\n</p>\n<p>\n During a number of years the church practiced the washing of feet,\n regarding it as an ordinance of Christ. In process of time, however, the\n practice which was adopted with hesitation, was observed with more and\n more reluctance, and finally was laid aside altogether.\n</p>\n<p>\n So far as the records furnish evidence, the church was never either\n paralyzed or annoyed by the anti-nomian spirit of opposition to works of\n</p>\n<p>\n *Manly\u2019s sermon, page 55, says : \u201cJ.

May every hundredth year, as it tells\n its solemn period, witness a still increasing stream of spiritual benefits\n flowing from the pious labors of those men, who in 1738 sent up the first\n song of praise, and the united prayer of the first worshipping assembly\n upon the banks of the Pee Dee !\n</p>\n<p>\n With this prayer for the church, the pastor of fifty years ago closed his\n discourse of the fulfillment in the history of this church of the promise of\n God, \u201cIn all places where I record my name I will come unto thee and I\n will bless thee.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It is occasion for profound gratitude that his life has been spared\n through a half century of fruitful labors, and that we have the honor of\n his presence and the benefit of his counsel as the church again assembles\n to consider the lessons of their history, and to have him share with us in\n our thanksgiving over the goodness of God, who has continued his blessing\n in this place where his name is recorded.\n</p>\n<p>\n But the duty of narrating the subsequent history of the church de-\n volves upon another now.

These faithful men, in those pioneer days of general\n license and perhaps rough manners, maintained a high standard of life\n and character. It was regarded as essential to church fellowship that the\n members should be present at the church meetings, and the brother who\n failed to show interest to this extent might expect a \u201ccommittee of care\u201d\n to wait on him. He would be required to state his excuse, or to ask for-\n giveness in public assembly. The church was accustomed to \u201ccensure\u201d\n disorderly members, and to \u201csuspend them\u201d from the privilege of com-\n muning at the Lord\u2019s table. One is tempted to smile at the quaint style\n of the record of some instances of discipline, as, for example, where a mes-\n senger of care was sent to a certain brother, \u201cto admonish him for his late\n disorderly conduct, having drank to . excess and attempted to dance in\n public company.\u201d The admonition was effectual in this case, for we find\n that shortly afterward this brother \u201cmakes acknowledgment of his crime\n before the congregation, and was restored to the communion.\u201d But in cases\n where admonition was not successful, the church asserted its authority and\n dignity by withdrawing fellowship, or, as is sometimes recorded, \u201cvoting\n out of the covenant.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1782, there appears a reference to the library of the church, in the\n record of a loan of books from it to Rev. Joshua Lewis. Deacon Edwards\n was desired to take an account of the books lent and a receipt for them.\n I regret to have to say that considerable difficulty was experienced in\n getting those books lent to Bro. Lewis returned, but great persistency was\n shown in the effort. When this library was formed and how, no one can\n tell now, but the fact that the church had the good sense, intelligence and\n enterprise to procure a library for itself, at that day, is certainly suf-\n ficiently remarkable to be noted in this narrative, and may we not say,\n this excellent feature of church life \u2014 the maintainance of a good library\n \u2014 is worthy of imitation in these latter times.

He says : \u201cHe was born Jan. 26th, 1776, in Eastern North Caro-\n lina It is known that he entered the ministry before\n</p>\n<p>\n his marriage at an early period of his life, and that he early became dis-\n tinguished as an energetic servant of God, a popular preacher and an effi-\n cient and useful pastor of the churches.\n</p>\n<p>\n About 1814, upon the withdrawment of that venerable man of God,\n the Rev. Daniel White, from the pastorship of the Welsh Neck Baptist\n Church, Brother Dossey removed to Society Hill (the seat of the church),\n and became its pastor. To a very large extent the churches throughout\n the eastern half of South Carolina shared in the gratuitous labors of this\n devoted missionary pastor, and all the public convocations of the churches\n enjoyed the benefit of his counsels and influence.\n</p>\n<p>\n He had an easy, flowing and graceful elocution, not formed upon the\n technical rules of the art, but polished and rendered attractive by good\n taste and by familiarity with society and good books. His doctrinal\n views were decidedly Calv^tnistic, avoiding the extremes of Arminians\n and Anti-nomians alike, and his views of the organization and discipline\n of churches were generally sound. As a pastor he had a due mixture of\n vigilance, fidelity, kindness and prudence, and rarely omitted a duty, or\n made a mistake. During the period of his regular pastorate, no one could\n be more beloved by a people than he was.\n</p>\n<p>\n While his sermons were always instructive and never long or wearisome,\n the distinguishing peculiarity of his pulpit efforts was an insinuating,\n subduing pathos, that stole into the heart and held all its sensibilities un-\n consciously at his control.

Furman, who\n within a year succeeded Elder Dossey in the pastorate, has given some\n recollections and incidents which we are glad to append to Dr. Manly\u2019s\n sketch.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Furman says: Of brother Dossey \u2019s ministry in the pastorate I\n knew nothing by direct observation, not having seen Society Hill until\n after he had for some time vacated his office, nor after I went there was\n there much opportunity to learn anything. There had been some un-\n pleasant things connected with the breaking up of the old relation ; and\n the good people of his former charge did not allow themselves even to\n whisper anything to the new comer that would at all disparage their\n old pastor. It was a beautiful instance of delicate regard to an incum-\n bent of the sacred office, as such to be highly esteemed in love for his\n work, even though in that work he may exhibit human frailty. My inter-\n course with himself and family was entirely unconstrained and cordial\n during the time of his remaining at Society Hill. But the reticence\n which is thus accounted for is itself an explanation of my having heard\n less about his ministry than I might otherwise have done.\n</p>\n<p>\n My impressions (not obtained at Society Hill, but in other places,) are\n that brother Dossey, in his endeavors to correct errors in opinion and\n wrong tendencies in practice, sometimes indulged in a freedom and point-\n edness of rebuke from the pulpit, which to some persons appeared of-\n fensively personal. The effect of this was to drive off certain parties who\n had been regular attendants at the church, and when the parties so af-\n fected began to take measures looking to a separate church organization,\n this did not abate the vigor of his hostile blows against what he regarded\n as serious error. Some of these efforts did not accord with what judicious\n members of the church thought best. This want of thorough-going sup-\n port from his members, instead of moderating his zeal, only exasperated\n it. He struck the harder, and they winced the more. Nor was this the\n worst of it. Some of the members of the church were aggrieved and be-\n gan painfully to consult what might be done to remedy the existing un-\n happiness. The pastor became apprized of some of these things, and\n took the ground that members of a church speaking censoriously of the\n pastor ought to be brought to discipline. The deacons did not move in\n the matter, and the old gentleman was fretted thereby. Just here oc-\n curred an incident which I have often thought of as illustrating the worth\n and power of a really fine character. It came to Mr. Dossey\u2019s ear that a\n female member of the church had said of a particular sermon that she was\n neither reproved, nor edified, nor comforted by it. Who said it he did\n not know, but the author of such a disrespectful remark ought to be dis-\n ciplined. He demanded the name of the offender, but the deacons de-\n clined to give it to him. This was an additional grievance, and the old\n gentleman earnestly protested. Just then the blunt good sense of deacon\n Daniel Campbell responded in his Scotch brogue, \u201cWull, brother Dossey,\n if you wull know who said it, seester Wulliams said it.\u201d \u201c Did sister\n Williams say it?\u201d \u201cShe did.\u201d \u201cThen it was so.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n As a strong Calvinist he sometimes provoked the ire of the disputa-\n tious abettors of opposite doctrine.

The\n church faithfully and lovingly contradicted this aspersion of the godly\n character of their former pastor. His unblemished words and his devout\n piety were never called in question in a long pastorate of nearly twenty\n years. I never heard any allusion to him that savored of discredit to the\n purity of his purposes.\n</p>\n<p>\n I heard too little of brother Dossey \u2019s preaching to be a competent\n j judge of it. The little I did hear left me with the impression that (as\n was not uncommon with preachers of that day) it was somewhat dramat-\n ic \u2014 sometimes with fine effect. I heard Mr. Hartwell say that J udge\n Evans referred once to a passage in a sermon of Mr. Dossey, in which he\n pictured the scene of the women on the way to the sepulchre perplexed\n \\ with the question, \u201cWho shall roll ns away the stone?\u201d The Judge pro-\n nounced this one of the most eloquent things he had ever heard.\n</p>\n<p>\n Whoever enquired after his health might always be sure of the an-\n swer\u2019s being prefaced with \u201cThrough mercy.\u201d Although a sort of stereo-\n typed prefix, it was always so uttered as to make it the index of a real\n sentiment.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have given large space, proportionally, to the descriptive accounts\n of Mr. Dossey, but in the long list of pastors he deserves extended no-\n tice, both on account of his character and because of the length and in-\n fluence of his ministry. He was pastor for nineteen years. When he came\n in 1814, the church had fairly begun to realize its strength and its op-\n portunity. He found it a noble company of earnest and pious men and\n devout women. Evander Mclver and Samuel Evans were deacons, while\n the Kirvens (John and William), Daniel Campbell, John F. Wilson, with\n men of less ability and influence, followed hard after these chosen leaders.\n Already a preaching station had been opened on Cedar Creek at Mclver\u2019s\n (now Sherrill\u2019s) mill. The new pastor encouraged this effort to lengthen\n the cords. Preaching was his delight, and his preaching was a delight to\n the people. We soon hear of appointments in other neighborhoods \u2014 at\n William Byrd\u2019s, out of which the church at Antioch sprung, and at\n Bethel, five miles from the seat of the church on the road to Cheraw.\n The membership of the church was widely extended, especially to the\n northwest and northeast.\n</p>\n<p>\n Renewed interest was felt in the discipline of the church. The church\n covenant was revised and enlarged. The article as to doctrine and ordi-\n nances was divided, and the portion as to the ordinances was made defi-\n nite and emphatic. Rules of decorum withal were adopted, in which are\n set forth unmistakably certain strong notions as to the dignity and pre-\n rogatives of the moderator. This pastor proposed to have it understood\n that there is such a thing as pastoral authority. Roll call at meetings is\n now the order, and absent brethren have an uncomfortable time of it ex-\n plaining to committees. \u201cAll at it and always at it\u201d is the idea now.\n</p>\n<p>\n Frequent references to social prayer-meetings abound, and days of fast-\n ing, and prayer, and humiliation before God, were no uncommon thing.\n The monthly communion season was a high day.

The preaching service be-\n gan at eleven o\u2019clock. The erect and commanding figure of the pastor\n towered aloft in the elevated box pulpit. Over head hung the sounding\n board. The church is crowded both in the roomy square family pews, and\n in the rear seats, and in the gallery, and in the spacious shed along the\n south side where the^olored brethren listen responsively. Such singing !\n The preacher leads, using the hymn book he \u201c.compiled,\u201d \u201cThe Choice,\u201d\n and perhaps a hymn of his own composition, such as \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAmidst the vernal season\n , As forth I roved abroad,\n</p>\n<p>\n The flowers addressed my reason\n And pointed up to God.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n His voice is clear, full, melodious. It is easy to follow him, and the peo-\n ple follow with right good will. The singing of those days is famous.\n The sermon is a warm and tender presentation of some doctrine of Free\n Grace. The faces of his hearers begin to glow, tears, penitent tears,\n grateful tears, start freely, and responses cannot be restrained in the an-\n nex. At the close of the sermon the preacher begins a stirring spiritual\n song, perhaps,\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe glorious light of Zion\n Is spreading far and wide,\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n and, coming down from the pulpit, moves slowly along the aisles, greeting\n his brethren in the Lord with a hand grasp of fellowship and love. So\n tradition pictures the scene, and it is pleasant to linger over it.\n</p>\n<p>\n Frequent seasons of revival were enjoyed. The record of one, in con-\n nection with a camp meeting at Bethel in 1832, appears. Perhaps the\n revival of 1829 was the most remarkable the church has ever known. Of\n that we have some account given by Mr. Dossey himself in a letter to the\n \u201cColumbian Star and Christian Index,\u201d of date Sept. 26, 1829. In this he\n says : \u201c . . . I may venture to say that there is, and has been for some\n months past, a gracious revival of religion amongst the people of my\n charge.\n</p>\n<p>\n Early in the year some were added to the church by baptism ; but\n nothing more than such a gradual ingathering as had often been our lot\n for years together at different times appeared until the opening of the\n Spring. And when the tenth of May was fully come, we were together\n with one accord at Antioch (a house of worship within the bounds of the\n Welsh Neck Church), and suddenly an awful solemnity pervaded the con-\n gregation. Instantaneously every bosom throbbed, every mind was sol-\n emnized, and every countenance expressed anxiety Since\n</p>\n<p>\n that memorable day, the pastor of the above named church has baptized\n and connected with it one hundred and two professed believers. These\n taken in connection w r ith those previously admitted makes over one hun-\n dred and twenty-three within the present year, besides those reclaimed\n from a back-slidden state.

Soon after he became pastor he\n announced his views, and induced the church to agree with him. An\n examination of the record leads to the supposition that this rite was ob-\n served irregularly and rarely, and was abandoned before Mr. Dossey\u2019s\n resignation of the pastorate. It is understood that Mr. Holroyd\u2019s opposi-\n tion was specially effective in bringing about the reaction. Mr. Holroyd\n was an intelligent and pious man \u2014 coming here from the North. He\n taught the St. David Academy, for a number of years, and was licensed\n to preach by this church, and after removing to Cheraw, served the\n church there as pastor.\n</p>\n<p>\n Towards the close of Mr. Dossey\u2019s ministry, as has been intimated in\n the letter of Dr. Furman, there was alienation without and some friction\n within the church.\n</p>\n<p>\n The final disruption of the tie that had bound pastor and people to-\n gether through so long a term of Christian service w T as, however, exceed-\n ingly painful. The church and the retiring pastor bore themselves with\n dignity and frank Christian courtesy.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is the purpose of the writer to arrange in the closing pages of this\n paper, the recorded and otherwise available matter relative to the work\n of the church throughout the last seventy years in the different depart-\n ments of missions, ministerial education, Sunday school instruction, & c.,\n and so we will not dwell now upon Mr. Dossey\u2019s ministry as related to\n these features of the life and work of the church, but it should be record-\n ed that he proved himself the fast friend and progressive leader of all\n such good work.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Dossey resigned the care of the church on Dec. 1st, 1832.\n</p>\n<p>\n The church was impressed by the gravity of the situation. They\n seem to have acted prayerfully and prudently. A correspondence was\n opened with Rev.

The son of the distinguished Dr.\n Richard Furman, James C. Furman inherited, in large measure, his\n father ' s ability, and enjoyed the advantage of his example and training\n until he was sixteen years old. He was about to enter Charleston College\n when he was bereft of that father\u2019s wise care. After leaving college he\n began the study of medicine, but soon after his conversion in 1828, he\n consecrated himself to the ministry of the Word. Mr. Furman had been\n preaching some five years when the Welsh Neck Church determined to\n ask for his pastoral services, and these five years were years of fruitful\n toil, embracing the memorable period of the great revivals that prevailed\n so widely throughout the South. Mr. Furman had devoted himself for\n the most part to evangelistic work in this period, and his services were\n in demand far and near. His name, his youthful appearance, his singular-\n ly effective gift of persuasive speech, his culture and his piety, and his\n earnest zeal all combined to render him an exceedingly popular and suc-\n cessful preacher.\n</p>\n<p>\n He was living in 1833 at the home of his wife\u2019s father, Col. Davis, in\n Fairfield District, and preaching to four country churches. This church\n became intent upon a visit from him, but he could not leave his charge,\n and so, after further deliberation, and increase of desire toward this young\n minister, a committee of two of the younger brethren were appointed to\n visit him, and personally solicit a visit from him. The brethren, R. W.\n Mclver and I. D. Wilson, betook themselves to their sulkies, and cheer-\n fully traversed the long distance, and secured the promise of a visit at an\n early day. The visit was made, a hearty call was given by the church,\n and in Oct. 13, 1833, the record of its acceptance was made.\n</p>\n<p>\n The new pastor came at the beginning of 1834, very frail, and in feeble :\n health ; indeed, it was necessary for him to take five months\u2019 leave of ab-\n sence in the first year of his pastorship, to travel and recruit his health.\n Meantime, Brother Hard, a student of the Furman Theological Institu-\n tion, was engaged as supply.\n</p>\n<p>\n At the beginning of Mr. Dossey\u2019s ministry the church was strong. It\n was now stronger in various elements \u2014 in members, in wealth, in culture,\n in social influence, and in ready and intelligent activity. The tempera-\n ment of the new pastor was adapted to the peculiar condition of the church\n and congregation. There was no asperity in his speech or manner. A\n gracious attraction went out from him upon all, and brethren dwelt to-\n gether in unity about this devout and gentle pastor.\n</p>\n<p>\n In Mr. Dossey\u2019s pastorship the church experienced a more rapid ex-\n tension than it had before. In Mr. Furman\u2019s it enjoyed a higher develop-\n ment of its spiritual character, of its missionary zeal, and beneficence, and\n an increase of its influence in the denomination in the State and at large.\n The venerable and trusted John F.

Furman\u2019s pas-\n > toral care, attained its highest development, and was accorded a position\n second to none in the denomination in the State, on account of its effi-\n ciency, intelligence and liberality.\n</p>\n<p>\n A parsonage, the first the church ever built, was made ready for the\n pastor the second year of his ministry. It stood on land given by D. R.\n W. Mclver, adjoining the Wilds place. The meeting-house began to be\n too strait for the congregation, and so there appears, early in this period,\n record of some discussion as to what shall be done. A sister\u2019s gift of $200\n for alterations and repairs was the originating cause of this discussion.\n Decision in the matter was postponed, but the question could not get it-\n self settled. Again and again it appears : \u201cShall we repair the old house\n or build a new one?\u201d At last, in June, 1840, the people had a mind to\n build ; a committee was appointed, and work was soon begun.\n June 4th, 1843, the house that we now occupy was dedicated. The rec-\n ord is : \u201cMet at 9 o\u2019clock for special prayer, that the presence and\n blessing of God may be with us in the solemn service of tne day. At\n 11 o\u2019clock commenced the solemn and interesting services of dedicating to\n God our new house of worship. Dr. Curtis, of Charleston, preached af-\n appropriate sermon from Malachi 1:11, and Brother J. 0. B. Dargan on\n fered the dedication prayer. A large congregation attended, together\n with several ministering brethren.\u201d The account concludes with this\n devout petition : \u201cMay the Lord accept the offering and make it truly a\n house of prayer.\u201d Can we not this day record, \u201cThis is indeed the house\n of the Lord\u201d? To how many it has been as the very gate of Heaven !\n The new house of worship \u2014 the fourth erected by the church, was con-\n structed of the best materials and with excellent workmanship, and cost,\n according to the building committee\u2019s recorded report, $7,159.57. It may\n interest some to know that even in that day it was sometimes necessary\n to repeat subscriptions to church building enterprises, and that there were\n some who seem to have given more than their share. Most of the sub-\n scriptions were large. It is to be feared that our fathers did not appre-\n ciate the power of pennies. A subscription list for such an object nowa-\n days would be a good deal longer.\n</p>\n<p>\n While mentioning the building enterprises of the church of this period,\n it may be well to note that soon after the meeting-house was finished, a\n baptistery was constructed on the site of the present one, a most conven-\n iently situated piece of ground being deeded to the church by Mrs. Hale,\n in consideration of being furnished a pew during her life-time. This bap-\n tistery was built of material taken from the old meeting-house. Until\n this time, 1843, baptism had been administered in the lower mill-pond.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1835, the church was requested by the State Convention to allow\n the pastor to serve that body as agent. But this seemed to be asking too\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0025/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 272}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0025/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 544}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0025/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1088}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0025/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2176}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0025/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4352}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0025/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/ic/al/sk/et/ch/00/so/ci/_0/historicalsketch00soci_0/historicalsketch00soci_0_0025.jp2", "height": 4352, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 777801}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"25\">\n<p>\n 28\n</p>\n<p>\n much. However, the church cheerfully permitted him to give a season\n of seven weeks to an agency for the Convention.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1837, the pastor was elected to a professorship in Furman Theo-\n logical Institution, and he laid the matter before the church, that they\n might aid him by their advice and prayers to come to the right decision.\n The church agreed to observe their next meeting day as a season of fast-\n ing and prayer, in reference to this so important matter. Right solemnly\n and earnestly did these devout men deliberate upon it when that day\n came, and again a month later ; and when one reads the resolutions\n adopted, it is manifest that there prevailed among them a most noble\n spirit. There seemed to be no narrowness, no selfishness in their view of\n the situation. While they had a dignified sense of the importance of the\n work of their church and could not contemplate without pain a dissolu-\n tion of the happy connection existing between the pastor and the church,\n they recognized the importance of the station to which he had been called,\n and they felt the force that certain circumstances gave the call. They\n could not object, if he were to deem it his duty to accept. Meantime,\n they would pray that the path may be made ve.ry plain to him. Happily\n for the church, the professor waited upon the pastor, and the church made\n a sort of thank-offering of his services for a temporary agency for the in-\n stitution that had coveted possession of him.\n</p>\n<p>\n The church observed January 7th, 1838, as a day of thanksgiving to\n God, for having preserved and prospered the church during the period of\n one hundred years, and the pastor preached the sermon that has furnished\n us the history of the earlier years of our church life.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the close of 1840, the pastor received a call to the Second or Went-\n worth Street Church in Charleston. The peculiar circumstances of that\n church, recently organized ; the persuasion of influential brethren, that\n his services specially were needed ; the expectation of doing a work of\n great importance at that juncture \u2014 all combined to move his mind to ac-\n cept the call. This church felt bound to acquiesce, as they had commit-\n ted the matter to the Lord. At this point in the record, we find a series\n of resolutions that are alike honorable to the church that could formulate\n and adopt them, and to the pastor whose devoted and effective ministry\n justified them.\n</p>\n<p>\n The church seems to have had an impression that the pastor\u2019s work\n was not done yet \u2014 that the removal to Charleston was an episode. It is\n related that good deacon Wilson would insist upon it that \u201cBrother Fur-\n man\u201d would return, and so the church made only temporary arrange-\n ments. Brother Wilkins, of Antioch, and Brother Richard Furman, of\n Cheraw, were engaged to supply the pulpit. At the close of the year, the\n church invited their late pastor to return, and, when he was compelled to\n decline, they continued their temporary arrangements, until toward the\n middle of the year the record breaks out into a sort of doxology over the\n gratifying intelligence that \u201cBrother Furman will return.\u201d It is pleas-\n ant to picture the scene, on Lord\u2019s day, July 3d, when, after divine\n service, the venerable \u201cDeacon Wilson, in behalf of the church, gave the\n right h and of fellowship to the Rev.

Already young brethren were seeking his instructions in a private\n way, and the Trustees of the Theological Institution were pressing him to\n devote himself to this work, for which so few were prepared \u2014 a work\n sorely needed, too, among the Baptists of South Carolina. He could no\n longer refuse, and communicated to the church, on Dec. 15th, 1844, his\n purpose to accept the professorship offered him.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is a pathetic interest about the record at this point : \u201cIt was re-\n solved that we come together fasting on next Lord\u2019s day, and after divine\n service spend some time in prayer to God, for His guidance and direction.\u201d\n \u201cLord ' s day, Dec. 22d. \u2014 The church assembled fasting.

Omit-\n ting the time of his connection with the Wentworth Street Church of\n Charleston, he was actually engaged with the church nine and a half\n years. He has been heard to refer to this period in his life as \u201cgolden\n days\u201d \u2014 and certainly they seem to shine with a peculiar lustre in the his-\n tory of this church.\n</p>\n<p>\n The church soon secured the pastoral services of Rev. Samuel Furman,\n an elder brother of Dr. Jas. C. Furman. Mr. Samuel Furman was, pre-\n viously and subsequently to his residence with this church, a citizen of\n Sumter County, where he spent a long life in the ministry. The mate-\n rial available is insufficient for making an extended or satisfactory notice\n of him, or of his ministry here. That ministry was without marked feat-\n ures. He found the church strong and diligent, and left it so. His\n preaching was sound, clear and scriptural, but lacked some of the popu-\n lar qualities that distinguished his brother\u2019s, and his manners and social\n habits were not so engaging. He had the profound respect of the church\n and served them acceptably and efficiently.\n</p>\n<p>\n On Feb. 28th, 1846, the licensing of Brother Peter C. Edwards to\n preach the gospel was recorded, and soon after this the church gave him,\n another rich personal gift, to the cause of higher education.

It may be safely said that the church never had a member\n who better illustrated what church membership should be. He was a de-\n vout Christian, a zealohs and untiring worker, and a liberal and intelli-\n gent friend of all good enterprises. He \u201cused the office of a deacon well\n and purchased to himself a good degree and great boldness in the faith\n which is in Christ Jesus.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Samuel Furman resigned the care ol the church on Dec. 4th, 1847.\n On Dec. 19th, his son, Rgv. Richard Furman, then Secretary of the South-\n ern Baptist Publication Society, was elected, and began his ministry here\n the next month. Mr. Richard Furman\u2019s election was not a venture on\n the part of the church. They knew him well. He had spent some time\n here with his uncle, Dr. Jas. C. Furman ; had preached frequently for the\n church ; had served them, indeed, during the time Dr. Jas. C. Furman\n was with the Wentworth Street Church in Charleston; had married one\n of the elect ladies of this church, the eldest daughter of Dr. John K.\n Mclver. He knew the church and the church knew him, and admired\n him for his gifts and loved him for his pure character and devoted piety.\n The church and the pastor were well suited. There seems to have been\n little that was remarkable occurring during his pastorship. The church\n did its work with a high degree of efficiency, and grew in grace and in\n the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ under the fervent ministry of\n their devoted pastor. The church, however, became perceptibly weaker\n in some elements during the latter part of Dr. R. Furman\u2019s ministry.\n Death and emigration caused irreparable losses in her ranks.\n</p>\n<p>\n On July 28th, 1851, deacon John F. Wilson died. A prince in Israel\n fell that day. He \\Vas the faithful servant of the church in all self-deny-\n ing labor for her interests. A generous supporter of every good cause,\n ready for every good word and work ; the worthy representative of the\n church in all general meetings; the jealous guardian of the purity and\n spirituality of the church, Deacon Wilson was a good gift of God to the\n Welsh Neck Church, and his godly character impressed itself deeply upon\n the church.\n</p>\n<p>\n On Dec. 18th, 1853, Dr. Furman tendered his resignation to accept the\n call of the Greenville Church. The work of the Greenville Church had\n acquired additional importance because of the location of the denomina-\n tional college, Furman University, in their city. They demanded supe-\n rior ability and leadership, and found what they wanted in the pastor of\n Welsh Neck Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n The church was much grieved by his removal, and in a series of\n resolutions expressed their appreciation of his ministry. This statement\n in it deserves a place here : \u201cFor a period of more than five years has\n the relation of pastor and flock existed of reciprocal endearment of feel-\n ing and spiritual improvement to ourselves without the slightest approach\n to discord or the introduction of a single circumstance to mar the uniform\n feelings of kindness and attachment.

For five years we w^\u2019e privileged to be un-\n der his faithful pastoral care, and some of us recollect our heartfelt grief\n when he left us for a larger field at the Master\u2019s call. As a man, he had\n a noble intellect, the highest culture, polished manners, a most gentle,\n kind and affectionate spirit. His dignity and firmness of principle\n commanded respect akin to reverence from all who knew him. As a pas-\n tor he was faithful, visiting and comforting, and sympathizing with his\n people, and especially kind to the poor and afflicted, who dearly loved\n him. As a preacher he was fluent, earnest, often impassioned in pre-\n senting the truth, melting and moving for the time every hearer. Lit-\n erally \u2018his zeal consumed him,\u2019 yet that zeal was according to knowledge\n and was tempered with prudence.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n From an appreciative sketch prepared after his death by his uncle\u2019s\n pen and published in The Baptist Courier, we take the following: \u201cA\n nephew by blood, and a son in the faith by divine grace, he was naturally\n to us the object of close and scrutinizing attention, and we gratefully re-\n cord that we have never known a more godly man \u2014 a man more thor-\n oughly conscientious and more truly humble.\n</p>\n<p>\n He began to preach when sixteen years of age, giving promise in the\n beautiful polish of his diction, in the reach of his thought and the intense\n earnestness of his address, of the powerful ministry which he exercised in\n subsequent years. . . Large congregations ever waited on his ministry,\n and no wonder, for there was a perpetual freshness in his pulpit work.\n One who heard him for years, himself afterwards a minister (Rev. J. W.\n Burn), once remarked to us that he had never known a preacher whose\n sermons showed such freshness and variety, and no wonder, for he was a\n constant and diligent student. . . And to this habitual industry was added\n the rare power of thorough mental composition which enabled him, like\n Robert Hall, to reproduce with verbal exactness what he had previously\n I determined to say. In the pulpit he over-exerted himself. . . Often and\n j often the night which followed his weekly labors in the pulpit witnessed\n j his sleeplessness in the midst of severe bodily suffering. And yet the\n \u2022 ! people for whom such labor and such suffering were undergone were not\n allowed to know of it. . . And so he went on toiling and suffering, the\n signs of acute pain sometimes visible in the very expression of his eye,\n when with vehement earnestness he was pressing upon his hearers a nec-\n essary attention to their eternal interests.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The church lost no time in electing a successor to Dr. R. Furman. Rev.\n</p>\n<p>\n N < W AM . W in g ats-was- their choice.

J. C. Phelps, at that time a theological student in\n the Presbyterian Seminary in Columbia, was elected pastor, and signified\n his acceptance at once. His ministry began Nov. 15th of that year,\n when he was ordained here, the ordination occurring while the Welsh\n Neck Association was in session with the church. Events proved that\n the election of Mr. Phelps was a grievous mistake. He was a man who\n seemed incapable of either feeling or inspiring any generous and warm\n affection. He had no faculty for affairs, was in no way a leader, and\n while he constructed good sermons was not an attractive preacher. His\n character was without reproach, but it was also without strength, and\n there were few in the congregation who did not feel a repelling rather\n than an attractive force proceeding from the pastor.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let it stand to the credit of the church that they went on with their\n work under the lack of leadership, until it became apparent that the\n welfare of the church was already sacrificed, and that amid the trying cir-\n cumstances of the civil war it was impossible to retain him. Mr. Phelps\n resigned (?) Nov. 5th, 1861.\n</p>\n<p>\n A few years ago (in 1880) he returned to this community, having a sad\n and pitiful tale to tell of ecclesiastical wanderings and shipwreck. He\n was then a Presbyterian minister, but proposed to return to the ranks of\n the Baptist ministry, and would like for our church to receive him, and\n restore him to ministerial position. His proposition was promptly but\n kindly declined, a purse was given him to relieve his pressing necessities,\n and he went forth not knowing whither he was going !\n</p>\n<p>\n When Mr. Phelps left the church in 1861, the dreadful throes of civil\n war were upon the people. The male membership of the church had be-\n come reduced before the war began. The elder men had died, but few\n young men came into the church during the last pastorate. The call of\n the State to arms did not therefore sweep into the army so large a propor-\n tion of this church, as of some others, but some of her noblest sons went\n to the field, and some, alas ! returned no more.

Mr.\n Rice\u2019s capacity for sermonizing was of a high order, and his preaching\n encouraged and stimulated the church.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Rice\u2019s pastorship covered the period of reconstruction. The people\n were bravely trying to adjust themselves to changed conditions. The\n church exhibited throughout this period an earnest spirit of toil and sacri-\n fice. Perhaps never before in its history did the church have to struggle\n harder to sustain the pastor, and to meet the increasing demands for its\n own equipment for effective service. Meantime, the general work of the\n denomination was appealing most forcibly to the church that was wont\n to be so loyal and so generous. Right noble was the response. The\n blessing of God rested upon their work. This was decidedly aggressive\n work. The Sunday school became, what it has continued to be, one of\n the most efficient in the land. The poor had the Gospel preached to\n them, and the church was united in love and good works.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1867, the peaceable secession of the large body of colored members\n occurred. It was manifestly better for both them and their white\n brethren that a separate organization should be formed. This was done\n in all courtesy and good feeling, the church granting letters of dismission\n to all in good standing who applied for them.\n</p>\n<p>\n Brother W. C.

He\n closed his ministry for the church at the end of 1872, when he removed\n to Newberry county, to occupy an important pastorate, whence he re-\n moved, after two years, to his native county, where he now resides and\n ministers to neighboring churches.\n</p>\n<p>\n The church was without a pastor during 1873, but was again served by\n neighboring ministers, frequently and efficiently. Of these, special men-\n tion should be made of Rev. J. W. Burn, pastor of the Hartsville Church,\n residing in this community, however ; Rev. F. W. Eason, pastor of the\n Darlington Church, and Rev. T. W. Hart, pastor of the Cheraw Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n A gracious revival interest prevailed, and a number of valuable members\n were received.\n</p>\n<p>\n On the first Sunday of January, 1873y*the present incumbent began his\n ministry, having been called from the pastorship of the Newberry Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n Like his venerable predecessor in this line of service, he may ask to be\n excused from commenting upon his own ministry. The work of the\n church in this period of fourteen years may be regarded independently of\n that, and certainly should receive some attention, for the sake of com-\n pleting the historical view from the standpoint of this sesquecentennial\n occasion.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the period 1850-1865, there was a gradual decline and loss of the\n resources and vigor of the church. In 1866, the tide of her affairs began\n to turn, and 1874 the new pastor found the church progressive and ag-\n gressive, ready for every good work. The membership had increased\n considerably, and, though they were still struggling with the misfortunes\n incident to the great social revolution, they were disposed to practice severe\n self-denial, if need were, in order that the efficiency of church life and work\n might be maintained. The church was a harmonious body, and has con-\n tinued so. Brotherly love has prevailed. There have been no seasons\n of feverish excitement, but we have enjoyed revivals and have had some\n notable times of ingathering. And we have frequently had the satisfac-\n tion of receiving members through baptism in the ordinary course of our\n work.\n</p>\n<p>\n A marked feature of the church life has been the prayerful interest and\n careful attention given to children and young people, and this has borne\n good fruit. A large proportion of our young people are like olive plants\n round about the table of the Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n Progress has been made in distributing the work of the church among\n the members, male and female ; and a good measure of success has been\n secured in the efforts to draw the financial support of the church from the\n entire church. At least, enough has been done in these two lines to give\n great encouragement in pressing forward. 1\n</p>\n<p>\n It is worthy of mention that an increasing regard for the comfort and 7\n conveniences of the congregation in public worship has been observed,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0032/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 272}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0032/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 544}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0032/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1088}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0032/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2176}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0032/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4352}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0032/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/ic/al/sk/et/ch/00/so/ci/_0/historicalsketch00soci_0/historicalsketch00soci_0_0032.jp2", "height": 4352, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 869932}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"32\">\n<p>\n 30\n</p>\n<p>\n and concern that all the appointments of God\u2019s house and the arrange-\n ments for administering the ordinances shall be suitable has been mani-\n fest : Better lights and seats have been provided ; a large supply of hymn\n books and the excellent pipe organ we now use have been purchased ;\n the present chorus choir has been organized ; two Sunday school class-\n rooms have been constructed by private liberality ; the baptistery ha\u00ae\n been rebuilt ; Memorial Hall has been comfortably furnished.\n</p>\n<p>\n The care of our cemetery, too long neglected, has become a recognized\n duty of the church, the necessary means for keeping it in attractive order\n being largely supplied by income from a legacy of $400, bequeathed for\n this purpose by Brother Allison Smoot, who died in 1880.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is believed that the systematic attention to the external and material\n part of the interests of the church have had a happy effect in increase of\n zeal in her service.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was thought advisable, in 1873, to sell the lecture room, to secure\n funds to make some necessary repairs to the meeting-house.

It has been a matter of\n great satisfaction to this writer in exploring the recorded history of our\n church to find that our high and honorable lineage and estate has been con-\n stantly remembered. The church seems to have borne in mind that it\n was doing business in the world for the Lord Jesus, and it has deported\n itself with becoming dignity. Many illustrations might be cited. Notice a\n few : The position and practice of the church as to corrective discipline\n has been firm and consistent. It has insisted that the divinely derived\n authority of the church should be respected; and especially in the earlier\n times, when, let us say, public manners were not so orderly as now, it in-\n stituted careful enquiry if any brother was reported as walking dis-\n orderly, and required of him reparation of wrong, and public confession\n of repentance. It gives one a strong impression of the authority that all\n recognized in the church, to read the minutes of the earlier church con-\n ferences. It has sometimes been the case that the church has had to deal\n with persons of influence and high social position, but its attitude has been\n the same to all. The dignity of the church has been maintained.\n</p>\n<p>\n Early in the history of the church one of her ministers, for some occult\n reason, became offended with his brethren, avoided their meetings and\n when remonstrated with ignored their authority. The record is tolerably\n full at that point, and it seems that our fathers acted with all patience\n and kindness, but did not falter in their purpose to assert the authority\n of the church. The case proceeded to his exclusion, and though the\n Charleston Association interposed, the church stood firm, and proposed\n that he should be restored to fellowship only as any other refractory\n member might be.\n</p>\n<p>\n A minister who had retired from the pastorship of the church, but was\n residing in the community, \u201cinquired if this church would object to his\n baptizing any person within their bounds who might come forward and\n relate to him a satisfactory Christian experience.\u201d To which it was\n answered that \u201cthe late pastor has the right as a minister of the Gospel\n to baptize any person who may relate to him a Christian experience, but\n it will be optional with the church to receive such persons as members.\u201d\n The church had rights and duties in the premises which could not be\n set aside.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. An important chapter in the history of this church might be entitled\n Denominational Loyally. The earliest recorded covenant, that of 1760,\n is sound to the core, and the subsequent covenants of 1783 and 1814 ex-\n hibit no change except in the way of a fuller and more explicit statement\n of distinctive Baptist principles ; and if it were deemed expedient to\n formulate the present doctrinal position of the church, these covenants\n would furnish the substance of it.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1751 the church became associated with two others, the First Church\n of Charleston, and the church on Ashley River (now extinct), the\n articles of association being the same as those of the Philadelphia Associa-\n tion, and from that date to the present the interests and work of the De-\n nomination have been very dear to this church.

Maintaining as we do with all Christians, that \u201cAll Scripture is\n given by inspiration of God,\u201d we see nothing in the views of our\n pastor as set forth in his correspondence with the Foreign Mission Board\n inconsistent with the Bible teaching on this subject, or with any doctrine\n held by this church.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. We have discovered nothing in the public and private teaching of\n our pastor during the years of his ministry with us tending to destroy or\n weaken the faith of any in the Holy Scriptures as the revealed will of\n God; but on the contrary w T e recognize that it. has been a distinct and\n special feature of his ministry to stimulate and organize the work of study-\n ing God\u2019s word, and we record the fact that at no time in the history of\n this church has so large a number of the members and congregation been\n regularly engaged in the reverent study of the Bible.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. We heartily endorse the stand taken by our pastor for liberty of\n thought and conscience in an open question of Biblical interpretation in\n an issue that has been forced by others ; and we hereby express the fullest\n \u2022confidence in him, both as to the soundness of his faith and the efficiency\n of his ministry, and w r e regard the notion that it would be dangerous to\n entrust him with the duty of preaching the Gospel to the heathen as pre-\n posterous in the extreme.\n</p>\n<p>\n These resolutions are given here in illustration of the jealousy of the\n church over its soundness in the faith.

Leaders and deacons of their own choice-\n were recognized by the church, and these had large influence and respon-\n sibility. Bearing in mind the religious temperament and demonstrative\n disposition of the race, the church arranged that they should have services\n of their own, but endeavored to keep these within proper bounds. Care-\n ful attention was given to instructing and examining applicants for mem-\n bership, special meetings of the church being held for this purpose, and\n patient and forbearing faithfulness was exercised in discipline. It is\n within limits to say that one-third of the record from 1780 to 1861, is\n devoted to the concerns of the colored membership.

For over fifty years the Sunday school work of the church has been\n in special favor. Bro. William 0. Edwards, now in his eighty-first year,\n remembers seeing a Sunday school at the Cedar Creek meeting house\n when he was a boy. The school teacher, one William Dean, taught it,,\n and had grim old men \u2014 Revolutionary soldiers \u2014 for scholars. The ordi-\n nary books and methods of the week-day school were employed.\n</p>\n<p>\n In January, 1834, just after Dr. Jas. C. Furman began his ministry, a\n committee was appointed to enquire into the propriety of establishing a\n Sunday school connected with this church. The committee reported\n favorably, and the following officers and teachers were appointed by the\n church : Rev. J. C. Furman, President ; John F. Wilson and John K. Mc-\n Iver, Superintendents ; Mrs. Smith, Mrs. Grant, Miss E. Sparks (after-\n wards Mrs. T. P. Lide) and Miss E. Grant, female teachers ; D. R. W.\n Mclver, H. J. Foster and I. D. Wilson, male teachers. The pastor was-\n requested to give notice that the school would go into operation on the-\n 3rd Sunday in January, and to request that parents, and particularly\n those of the church, would unite in its support. That school has had no-\n vacation. The present pastor repeats the request made fifty-three years\n ago, \u201c That parents, and particularly those of the church, would unite in\n its support.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n After the war Sunday school work all over the South took on more life\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0037/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 272}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0037/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 544}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0037/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1088}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0037/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2176}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0037/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4352}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0037/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/ic/al/sk/et/ch/00/so/ci/_0/historicalsketch00soci_0/historicalsketch00soci_0_0037.jp2", "height": 4352, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 840429}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"37\">\n<p>\n 35\n</p>\n<p>\n and vigor.

The relation of the church to Missions and Education has been a\n notable thing in its history. The Charleston Association within the first\n decade of its organization was actively engaged in raising funds for\n Ministerial Education, and in 1783 Mr. Williams, a member of this\n church, \u201c was nominated to receive contributions for Rhode Island Col-\n lege (now Brown University).\u201d In 1792, the church entered upon\n systematic work in connection with the Charleston Association, \u201c to provide\n means to assist pious young men in their studies for the ministry;\u201d and\n from that time to the present, the interest of the church in this line of\n work has been maintained. Reference has been made to her munificent\n personal gifts to the cause of Ministerial and Christian Education. The\n contribution of money can not now be summed up. It is significant of\n the high estimate the church of the present places upon Christian Educa-\n tion, that the thank offering of this occasion is a gift of $700 to the en-\n dowment of Furman University.\n</p>\n<p>\n The earliest mission work of the church, apart from the extensive\n evangelizing work done in the region round about her seat, was among\n the Catawba Indians in this State and North Carolina. This work was\n begun in 1802. \u201c In 1806\u201d \u2014 a friend cites Mr. Wood Furman as au-\n</p>\n<p>\n thority \u2014 \u201cat a meeting of the Charleston Association with* the Welsh\n Neck Church, the Indian, Robert Mursh, preached with acceptance to a\n large And affected audience.\u201d This Indian preacher was present doubt-\n less as an agent for Indian Missions.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1813, the Charleston Association met with this church, and Luther\n Rice was present to tell the story, then so fresh and thrilling, how God\n had opened to the Baptists of America a door of Foreign Missions. Mr.\n Rice had arrived that year from India, leaving his colleague Adoniram\n Judson there, while he proposed to organize the Baptist brotherhood in\n the home-land to support and prosecute the work. Thus the Welsh Neck\n has the honorable distinction of being in an important sense the birth-\n place of Foreign Mission work in South Carolina.\n</p>\n<p>\n The church entered into the organization of the Baptist State Conven-\n tion in 1820, and through that Convention has been engaged in the State\n Mission work of that body, and the representatives of this department of\n missions have always found a cordial greeting and a cheerful response to\n their appeals in this church.\n</p>\n<p>\n The For.eign Mission sentiment of the church seems to have had strong\n and vigorous development in the period of Dr. James Furman\u2019s pastor-\n ship. In 1838, it is recorded, \u201cThe present state of our Foreign Mission-\n ary Board requires us to contribute immediately for their relief;\u201d where-\n upon $500 was contributed and forwarded. In 1842, the church\n appropriately observed the first Lord\u2019s Day in October, in celebration of\n the fiftieth anniversary of the establishment of the Foreign Mission of our\n brethren in England.\n</p>\n<p>\n The record of April 6, 1842, was, \u201cAfter some time spent in the con-\n sideration of the state of our Foreign Mission Board and our duty in re-\n gard to it : It was resolved that we make an effort, within our church\n and congregation, to raise a sufficient sum to support a missionary in Bur-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0038/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 272}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0038/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 544}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0038/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1088}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0038/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2176}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0038/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4352}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0038/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/ic/al/sk/et/ch/00/so/ci/_0/historicalsketch00soci_0/historicalsketch00soci_0_0038.jp2", "height": 4352, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 772641}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"38\">\n<p>\n 36\n</p>\n<p>\n mah ; and should the amount be raised, that we apply to our Board to\n assign to us Bro.

The activity and efficiency of the organizations maintained by the\n ladies of the church have been remarkable.\n</p>\n<p>\n Since 1835, the ladies have had a society to work not only for local ob-\n jects, but for missions and education. The record book of the early\n society shows that much real work was done, and the minutes of the As-\n sociation bear testimony to the generous feeling of those noble women\n toward missions. The local work has often been very important and con-\n siderable, amounting to large sums, given to improve the church building,\n or in some yray to add to the comfort of the congregation, or to increase\n and better the facilities for church work.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1872, at the suggestion of the venerable Mrs. Jane Grano, Cor-\n responding Secretary of the Woman\u2019s Mission Society of the Baltimore\n Baptist Churches, our esteemed sister, Mrs. Ellen C. Edwards, began to\n collect special contributions for the Woman\u2019s Mission to Woman Work.\n In 1874, a formal organization of a Woman, s Mission Society was effected,\n and this society has had a continuous existence. It has enjoyed a healthy\n growth in members and interest and contributions, and has exercised a\n strong influence upon the entire church and congregation. The contribu-\n tions of the society from February, 1874 \u2014 date of organization \u2014 to the\n present time, have amounted to $1,433.77.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1874, soon after organizing, the attention of the society was directed\n to the opportunity before it : to advance the work of Foreign Missions in\n the State by correspondence of individual members with their acquaint-\n ances in the churches, suggesting co-operation where Woman ' s Mission\n Societies had been organized, and proposing the work where it had not\n been undertaken. This correspondence developed decided interest. It\n became apparent that the Baptist women of South Carolina were anxious\n to do more and . better work for missions, and especially that the propriety\n and expediency of an organized woman\u2019s mission work would be appreci-\n ated generally, if brought to their attention.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1875, one of our ladies, Miss M. E. McIntosh, was requested by the\n Chairman of the Foreign Missions Committee of our State Convention,\n Dr. J. A. Chambliss, to undertake the work of soliciting funds from the\n women of our churches, for a mission residence, then much needed, in\n Canton, China. Consent was given on condition that Woman\u2019s Mission\n Societies for further work for missions might be organized.

To this cause, more, perhaps, than to any other, may be ascribed\n national peculiarities \u2014 those traits of character which distinguish one\n people from all others. It would seem as if Great Britain and Ireland,\n stocked by the white race, and occupying the same locality on the sur-\n face of the globe, washed by the same tides and encompassed by the\n same atmosphere, would show a population distinctly homogeneous in\n character ; but the facts do not accord with this expectation. The\n Englishman has a character of his own ; the Scotchman, a character of\n his own ; and the Irishman a character of his own. Latitude and longi-\n tude \u2014 insular position \u2014 the breath of the frozen north behind them, and\n mellowing atmospheric influence borne on the bosom of the Gulf Stream\n in front of them, would seem to promise a pervading uniformity of char-\n acter ; but the promise is broken to our experience. The Scotchman is\n born to abstract speculation ; the Englishman to blunt business and fair\n play; and the son of Erin to the irrepressible drollery which sees analo-\n gies which no one ever saw before, and by the key of his humor brings\n to light a fund of amusement which, but for his mental dexterity, would\n have remained forever locked up. This gift of the Irish mind is ac-\n counted for, if we suppose that some time in the long past, some man was\n born in Ireland with a large endowment of the power of wit, just as\n later, in England, Shakespeare was born with a large endowment of dra-\n matic power. It is easy to see how this first born wit would exhilarate\n and delight the minds around him by the scintillation of his fancy ; how\n he would become a centre of attraction, and how his practice would im-\n part the idea to others, and excite in them the desire of doing just what\n he had done. Thus the taste and the habit of tracing fanciful analogies\n would be formed and propagated, and by the law of heredity would pass\n down from sire to son, just as the young hound more readily takes the\n trail of deer or fox, and the young setter stands in pause at sight of the\n partridge.\n</p>\n<p>\n But whatever may be true of national characteristics, there can be no\n question that the lik.eness in families, especially in the manner of speak-\n ing and in general bearing and demeanor, are greatly affected by this\n one cause. It was more plainly seen under our old domestic institution\n than now, when the connection of servants with the household is sub-\n jected to constant change.

A promise\n is either a declaration in words of an intended good \u2014 or it is the subject\n matter, the content, of such predictive declaration, the thing which the\n promise indicates. This case of double but related meanings of a word\n is very common. Thus a gift may be the act of giving, or it may be the\n thing given.

Now, the prom-\n ises made to Abraham, that, if willing and obedient, his descendants\n should eat the fat of the land, was a promise which, in the first sense,\n every Israelite held as an inherited possession, but only those who com-\n plied with the prescribed conditions, came into possession of the blessing\n contained in the promise. So, here, the persons alluded to are consid-\n ered as having, \u201c by faith and patience,\u201d appropriated, and as now en-\n joying the blessings promised, \u201c an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled,\n and that fadeth not away, reserved in heaven for them who are kept by\n the power of God through faith unto salvation, ready to be revealed in\n the last day !\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n We do not propose to go further into the meaning of our text, and to\n show how faith and patience are connected with the glory hereafter to\n be revealed \u2014 and how they, therefore, constitute elements of the noblest\n example which human beings can set before human beings. We use the\n text simply as suggesting a leading thought appropriate to this special\n occasion.\n</p>\n<p>\n The hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the founding of this church\n naturally turns our thoughts back to the men who founded it. They\n crossed the waste of waters, not with the hurrying, holiday speed of\n modern ocean transit, but with the tedious delays incident to the naviga-\n tion of the deep in lumbering vessels propelled only by winds and sails,\n at one time stopped by deadly calms, and at others driven from their\n course by adverse winds. Perching for awhile near the Delaware, they\n again took wing, and alighted at length on the rich alluvion of the Great\n Pee Dee. Of them it may be said, as Mrs. Sigourney, with more of\n poetry than of truth, has said of the Pilgrim Fathers, \u201cthey left unstained\n what here they sought, freedom to worship God. \" And this not because\n they were better men than the Puritans, but because they held better\n views of church polity.

The Divine plan of\n church government makes this a logical necessity ; and as cutting off the\n very possibility of religious persecution, it constitutes one of the evi-\n dences that the plan is the Divine one. And yet, as these same churches\n held that a professed regeneration is a condition of membership, it is easy\n to see how personal holy living and combined activity in good works should\n become characteristic of them.\n</p>\n<p>\n The church, as a body, had more than half completed the last ten of a\n hundred years of its existence when it became my lot to form a personal\n acquaintance with the worthy men and women, who in the succession of\n three generations were standing in the places of the original Welsh immi-\n grants. It is of some of these I desire to recall some personal reminis-\n cences. Doubtless the church, as I knew it, owed much of its character\n to the first settlers and their immediate successors, godly men and\n women, whose works followed them, when they themselves were resting\n from their labors. Certain it is, that in the long past this church was one\n of the little coterie of churches which took the .lead in those different\n public measures, which looked to association and co-operation. It was\n one of the three (Euhaw, Charleston and Welsh Neck) that formed the\n first Association in South Carolina. What a halo of glory is around the\n head of this trio of churches ! To go annually to Charleston from the Pee\n Dee was to encounter difficulties and hazards, of which we hardly dream;\n imperfect roads, swamps, broad and boggy, streams unbridged, and not\n always supplied with ferriage ; and yet, like the ancient pilgrims, who\n made the barren valley of Baca a well, these men of the olden time for-\n got privation and peril in the thought of the goodly fellowship of their\n brethren in the Lord. When the little nucleus was formed in Columbia,\n of what has now grown to be the Convention of the denomination in the\n State, this church, true to her character in the past, took her place with\n the far-seeing few who did not \u201cdespise the day of small things.\u201d In the\n past, not so remote, if the history of the church were to be given in \u00ab\n single expression, I think it might freely be described as a perpetuated ex-\n ample of Christian activity and refinement. Years ago, when a lady from\n another part of the State, and of a keen relish for worldly amusements,\n had resided for some time at Society Hill, she was asked how she liked the\n place. With perfect candor she replied that she did not like it at all,\n because it ivas Sunday all the week ' round! Years after this, one of our\n brethren, remarkable alike for the accuracy of his observations, and for a\n happy power of expressing them ( Dr. J. A. B.), upon a visit to Society\n Hill, observed to a friend, \u201cWhat a delightful aroma of refinement there is\n about the place.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Just so ; there was such an atmosphere\u2019of refinement, and it was that re-\n finement which springs from genuine piety \u2014 the piety that is not held for\n occasions, that governs on week-days as well as on Sundays. It is to the\n honor of my predecessor, who filled a pastorate of nearly twenty years,\n that I found a community remarkably free from the perverted use of the\n tongue. James calls our attention to the fact that he who governs the\n tongue is able to govern the whole body, and certainly the Welsh Neck\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0045/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 272}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0045/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 544}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0045/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1088}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0045/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2176}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0045/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4352}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0045/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/ic/al/sk/et/ch/00/so/ci/_0/historicalsketch00soci_0/historicalsketch00soci_0_0045.jp2", "height": 4352, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 766883}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"45\">\n<p>\n Church, in 1834, was remarkably free from tattlers and vain-talkers.

But, so far as I knew, this charge had no ap-\n plication at Society Hill. There were saintly women here, in whose pres-\n ence a tale-bearer would have stood abashed. And, besides, in default of\n any interesting topic of profitable conversation, there was always at hand\n a selected volume, the reading of which would give wholesome and pleas-\n ant direction to the thoughts.\n</p>\n<p>\n Paul says in his letter to the Corinthians : \u201cI speak as a fool; ye have\n compelled me.\u201d He alludes to the fact that the empty boaster ' s manner\n of speaking includes a frequent reference to self ; a noticeable and re-\n dundant use of the first personal pronoun. But it is quite possible, as in\n Paul\u2019s case, that what the fool is doing all the time, one may do on occa-\n sions without being foolish. Already I have found it necessary to allude\n to myself, and may have to do so still more frequently, but I shall de-\n pend for my excuse on the nature of the case, and on the intimation from\n yourselves that the presentation of personal reminiscences would comport\n with your wishes.\n</p>\n<p>\n My coming to Society Hill was on this wise : The pastorate had be-\n come vacant by the resignation of Mr. Dossey, who had occupied the place\n about nineteen years. From some cause, the thoughts of the church were\n turned toward myself, and letters were written, Whether these letters\n contained a call or merely solicited a visit, I do not remember. But they\n did not accomplish their object, and the church remained pastorless. At\n that time a young minister was a great rarity in the State, and the church\n was greatly troubled to know what to do, except in the one case ; they did\n not agree as to the eligibility of parties named. The matter was made\n the subject of special prayer for Divine guidance, and on one particular\n occasion, one of the deacons delivered himself to the brethren, as having\n obtained some new light : We have been praying to the Lord that we\n may be united, and we are united on one man, and can\u2019t unite on any\n other. And we have written fo him to come to us and he has declined,\n and we keep on praying to God to direct us ; but it seems to me we ought\n to stop praying until we do more than we have done. The Lord said to\n Moses at the Red Sea, \u201cWhy callest thou upon me? say unto the children\n of Israel that they go forward.\u201d And so he urged that instead of a letter,\n special messengers should be sent to see the brother on whom their hearts\n were set, and to lay the case before him. Accordingly two brethren,\n Major D. R. W. Mclver and Col. I. D. Wilson, were deputed to visit Fair-\n field District and make the wishes of the church known. The messengers\n made their way to Fairfield, but did not find the object of their pursuit,\n for he was near Baton Rouge, in Chester county, just then lying very\n low from a second relapse ot fever, and was in the hands of consult-\n ing physicians. The messengers, however, made their way to Chester\n and obtained a promise that if I was permitted to recover my strength,\n I would visit Society Hill and see the church face to face.\n</p>\n<p>\n Accordingly, in the fall of 1833, near the close of a three days\u2019\n journey, one Friday afternoon, just as I was completing my way across\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0046/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 272}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0046/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 544}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0046/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1088}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0046/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2176}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0046/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4352}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0046/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/ic/al/sk/et/ch/00/so/ci/_0/historicalsketch00soci_0/historicalsketch00soci_0_0046.jp2", "height": 4352, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 749918}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"46\">\n<p>\n 44\n</p>\n<p>\n a dam which held back a lively little stream, I was stopped by a\n portly form, which I recognized as one which, in my boyhood, I had\n seen as a visitant at my father\u2019s house in Charleston. It was Deacon\n John F. Wilson, of blessed memory. I soon learned that Leavensworth,\n with its shady water oaks and its broad verandahs, was to be my\n resting-place for the night. If I may compare small things with great,\n it was my Appii Forum in my progress toward my point of destination.\n My kind-hearted brother and his motherly wife had provided that a love-\n ly company of Christian young women should meet me. I mention their\n names: Elizabeth Wilson, Martha and Ellen Grant, Jane Kirven, Han-\n nah Dabbs and Jane Lide. Most of these names were subsequently\n changed by marriage, and almost all of those who bore them have passed\n into that better life where the mutations of earth are felt and feared no\n more, leaving behind them the fragrant memorials of decided Christian\n character.\n</p>\n<p>\n Oti Saturday morning we were at the church conference, and my first\n pulpit work was performed with the old Welsh Neck. The effort sent\n me to bed for that day and the next, but somehow \u2014 in what way, I do\n not now distinctly recollect, the church and myself came to the con-\n clusion that it was the will of the Lord that I should transfer my labors\n to the Pee Dee country.\n</p>\n<p>\n About ten years of my life \u2014 not counting an interval of about 15\n months, when I was absent from Society Hill, being pastor of the\n Second Baptist Church in Charleston \u2014 were spent here ; and if a pastor\n ever received from a people, greater tolerance, more considerate atten-\n tions, more delicate sympathy, it has not come to my knowledge. The\n only drawback to this delightful experience was the pastor\u2019s conscious-\n ness, that he could not adequately requite the abounding kindness and\n confidence of a beloved people. He felt as all through his ministerial\n</p>\n<p>\n life he has felt that a deficiency of early advantages diminished his\n</p>\n<p>\n means of illustrating and enforcing Divine truth, either in the inter-\n pretation of the word itself or the use of that varied knowledge which\n may be reaped by industry in the fields of science and history, and\n may be used in illustration. He was often pained at the meagreness\n of the repast which he spread, especially when he saw that those who\n partook did so with a healthful spiritual appetite, which would keenly\n have relished better fare, but yet made no fastidious complaints of the\n poorness of the cuisine. More than once he consulted privately with\n</p>\n<p>\n the deacons as to his own wish, to repair to Newton, that he might\n</p>\n<p>\n gain the advantage of better training, but as often was over-ruled by\n the protests of these good brethren, so that he surrendered his own\n judgment to the wishes of brethren who had the highest claim to his\n affection and gratitude.

But this is not possible. We cannot even name them all. Let\n us start from apoint in the suburbs. At Centre Hall are M.rs. Grant and her\n daughters. At Myrtle Hill is Mrs. Jane Dranghon Edwards, watching\n over her family group of two sons and two daughters with even more\n than usual maternal care and anxiety. Hard by is \" Mrs. Dubose, with\n her fatherless children, Joshua and Jane Kirven. Then there is the resi-\n dence of Mrs. Governor Williams, with the regular and occasional occu-\n pants of the same, her sister-in-law, Mrs. Mclver ; her beloved friend,\n Mrs. Fort, and Miss Charlotte Kirven. Hard by is another home, pre-\n sided over by Mrs. Alexander McIntosh, the eldest daughter of Pastor\n Dossey, admired from her girlhood as very pretty and very amiable, and\n as I saw her in her matron life, a charming specimen of Christian sim-\n plicity and affection. On the other side of the Williams residence is the\n summer resort of another family, where the wife and mother is wielding\n over a family of sons the kind of influence which a superior intellect,\n combined with genuine piety and fine culture, does exert. She was the\n</p>\n<p>\n daughter of Hansford, Esq., a lawyer of ability, and the wife of\n</p>\n<p>\n Alexander Mclver, Esq., for years solicitor of the Northeastern Circuit.\n In that group of boys was one who now sits as a justice of the Supreme\n Court of South Carolina. Making our way toward the village, we pass\n the former abode of Judge Wilds, now presided over by his daughter,\n the wife of Major D. R. W. Mclver. Mrs. Mclver inherited the talents\n of her father, and the scintillation of wit in her conversation and her\n letters answered to the brightness of her lustrous eyes. Passing to the\n village proper, her mother, now the wife of Dr. Thomas Smith, with\n courtly manners dispensed a cordial hospitality, never better pleased than\n when, with her own hand, she was preparing some little delicacy to grat-\n ify the appetite of some suffering sick one. In the large mansion form-\n ing the background to quadruple rows of water oaks, was Mrs. Dr. Mc-\n lver, with the blood of the Greggs and the Marshalls in her veins, and\n with a trembling Christian hope, which was destined, notwithstanding\n her fears to the contrary, to flower out in the dark hour of death with\n the beauty of the night-blooming cereus. On the adjoining lot stood\n the former residence of the venerable Mrs. McIntosh, whose hardness of\n hearing partially excluded her from the pleasure of general society, but\n only endeared the more the pleasure of special conversation with a friend\n and the reading of her Bible and of religious books. The observer who\n formed her acquaintance ' could not fail to see in her a Quaker-like simplic-\n ity, united with a ruling love of order and an exquisite neatness. The\n knocker upon the door and the andirons and their accompaniments upon\n the background of brick-work brightened with turkey-red, shone like\n Corinthian brass, while her cap and kerchief always looked as if fresh\n from the hands of the laundress. And these outward signs had their\n counterpart in the attributes of her character. Without ceasing she was\n seeking God\u2019s blessing on her son and his family \u2014 prayers which God\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0048/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 272}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0048/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 544}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0048/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1088}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0048/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2176}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0048/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4352}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0048/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/ic/al/sk/et/ch/00/so/ci/_0/historicalsketch00soci_0/historicalsketch00soci_0_0048.jp2", "height": 4352, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 733862}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"48\">\n<p>\n 46\n</p>\n<p>\n has answered with signal blessing. In the next home is Mrs. Alexander\n Sparks, an eminently prudent and judicious woman, of whom her husband\n once said that he had never made but two bad bargains in his life, and\n in those cases he did not consult his wife. Now, if any one should infer\n that Mrs. Sparks was a noisy, blustering, self-asserting woman, nothing\n could be further from the fact. Her strength was the result of sound\n practical sense and great goodness of heart \u2014 a goodness of heart which\n made her hand ready to help in every call for aid. Across the street in\n the home of Mr. David Gregg was his noble wife, who, though not a com-\n municant, desired to be so. In the equipoise of quiet dignity, of a meek\n and gentle spirit, Mrs. Gregg left memorials of her influence in her daugh-\n ters, Mrs. James H. McIntosh (now dead), Mrs. Etsell Adams and Mrs.\n John J. Mclver, and in her only son, Bishop Gregg, of Texas. In the\n adjoining residence, the home of Mr. Caleb Coker, was his honored wife,\n still numbered with the living, and of whom, for that reason, I cannot\n further speak than to say that sons and daughters, fulfilling life\u2019s great\n end, rise up and call her blessed. A little further back from the main\n artery of the village was the home of Miss Nancy Mclver, of Miss Eliza\n Evans, Miss Rachel Hollow\u2019ay and Mrs. Griffin and her bright boys and\n loving daughter. This was an abode where Jesus would have felt at\n home as in the house of Martha and her sister Mary. Miss Eliza Evans\n was too deaf to hear much of conversation, but she read constantly, and\n having a strong taste for the poetical, she charged her memory with pass-\n ages tender or beautiful or sublime, and in her own peculiar manner\n would repeat them to others. Of dear Mrs. Griffin I must say, that if\n gentle, earnest sympathy and unsparing attention to the suffering consti-\n tute a claim to the title, she deserved to be called a sister of charity.\n But the time would fail me to speak of Mrs. Watson and her daughters,\n of Mrs. Betsy Edwards and Mrs. Bouie, of Mrs. Douglas and the vener-\n able Mother Sparks, and others still to whom the welfare of the church\n and the glory of God were objects of prayerful interest.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have taken this bird\u2019s eye glance at the honorable women of the\n old Welsh Neck in the expectation of dwelling a little more at length on\n that group of them found in the home which has been referred to as\n the Williams residence, a home whose hospitality the young pastor and #\n his household were permitted to share during the time when a parsonage\n was being erected. The central figure in that group was Mrs. Williams\n herself, the widow of Gen. David R. Williams, an ex-Governor of the\n State and an ex-member of Congress. Mrs. W. belonged to the old family of\n Witherspoon, her father and uncle having an heroic record in the account\n of the Revolutionary struggles of our forefathers. Mrs. Williams was a\n tall, finely proportioned woman, with regularly formed features, a clear\n cut mouth ; lips neither too thick nor too thin ; a nose slightly acquiline,\n soft hazel eyes, a complexion too sallow for beauty, and a voice and man-\n ner in which truth, sincerity, kindness and dignity seemed unmistakably\n blended together. In a sermon occasioned by her death, I remember to\n have employed a comparison of the transparency of her character with\n the limpid clearness of the streams of limestone water, where the behold-\n er sees distinctly the very pebbles on the bottom.\n</p>\n<p>\n Before I formed a personal acquaintance with Mrs. Williams, my for-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0049/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 272}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0049/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 544}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0049/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1088}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0049/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2176}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0049/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4352}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0049/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/ic/al/sk/et/ch/00/so/ci/_0/historicalsketch00soci_0/historicalsketch00soci_0_0049.jp2", "height": 4352, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 759514}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"49\">\n<p>\n 47\n</p>\n<p>\n mer pastor, the Elder Basil Manly, had said to me other, \u201cShe is fit to be\n the wife of a president of the United States.\u201d This, bear in mind, was\n said at a time when the presidents were models of dignity and worth ; when\n Martha Washington, Mrs. Adams and Mrs. Madison were in the speak-\n er\u2019s eye. One of the Welsh Neck ministers once quoted to me the re-\n mark of another, that if a person could be saved without conversion, it\n seemed to him Mrs. Williams was that person. The day that she died I\n alluded, in conversation with her step-son, Col. Nicholas Williams, to the\n fine remark of Wm. Jay, that notwithstanding the vulgar prejudice, many\n a step-mother has been a mother indeed, when with the the tears rolling\n down his manly cheeks, he said: \u201cMy dear sir, I have never known the\n difference.\u201d Time and again, when special calls would be made for chari-\n table contributions, has she transmitted through the hands of her pastor\n her willing gifts \u2014 sometimes a hundred dollars at once, and always with\n the request that the donor should be unknown, and with the added re-\n quest for prayer, that God would enable her to be a faithful stewardess of\n what was committed to h\u00abr hands.\n</p>\n<p>\n Some incidents connected with the commencement of her hope in Christ\n were remarkable. She had long been the subject of deep religious im-\n pressions, but the question of her relationship to Christ had never been\n satisfactorily settled to her own mind. One of her regular daily habits\n was a devout reading of the Holy Scriptures. An edition of the Bible in\n four volumes was always at hand, and as soon as the breakfast things\n were cleared away, she took her accustomed seat and commenced he r\n reading. At the time referred to, her husband, Gen. Williams, was car-\n rying on a very heavy piece of work, in the construction of a bridge over\n the stream and swamp of Lynch\u2019s Creek, some 50 miles from Society\n Hill. The size of this stream entitled it to be called Lynch\u2019s River, for\n in volume of water and extent of flow, it surpasses many another stream\n in the State, designated with the name of river.\n</p>\n<p>\n On a given morning at the breakfast table, Mrs. Williams stated she had\n a very vivid and unpleasant dream the night before. She had dreamed\n that a special messenger (Smart), one of the General\u2019s favorite servants,\n riding \u201cthe clay-bank mare,\u201d one of the numerous animals taken to the\n scene of labor, had brought word that some accident had occurred, and\n that General Williams was fatally injured. The table having been cleared\n away, Mrs. Williams took her seat as usual and opened the volume before\n her, when the noise of the opening of a gate on the eastern side of the lawn\n attracted her attention, and sure enough there was Smart, riding the\n clay-bank mare. Powerfully impressed by the stange co-incidence, she\n cast her eye upon the volume before her and read the words, \u201cBe still;\n and know that I am God.\u201d Just then and there, as she subsequently\n averred, did she bow herself absolutely to the righteous sovereignty of\n God. In the exercise of an unqualified submission, she accepted Christ as\n of God made unto us wisdom and righteousness, and sanctification and re-\n demption. Thus in an hour of deepest darkness, light sprang up. The\n messenger had brought word that General Williams, though badly crushed\n by fallen timbers, was still alive, and Mrs. W., accompanied by the\n accomplished and skillful family physician, Dr. Thos. Smith, was soon on\n the way to the scene of the disaster.

He blamed him-\n self for an unnecessary risk, in raising heavy timbers, involving danger to\n others, as well as to himself, and then he was a fine example of a type of\n character, which the patriarchal form of Southern society tended to nour-\n ish \u2014 a just, generous, noble care for the well-being of dependents.\n</p>\n<p>\n But to return to the domestic group, of which Mrs. Williams was the\n centre figure. One of these was the venerable Mrs. Mclver, the widowed\n sister of Governor Williams. Nervous disease, attended with very acute\n paroxysms, confined her to the house, and largely to her chamber. Yet\n her spirits were high, her opinions positive, her manners courtly. When I\n once said to her that I hoped her son, Major D. R. W. Mclver, would one\n day preach the gospel, she responded, \u201cWhat? Will Mclver preach the\n gospel? never; no; never/\u2019 I had seen the interest which he took in\n reading to the black people on Sunday mornings. I knew that his solici-\n tude for their spiritual welfare was deepening from this very exercise, and\n felt a strong persuasion that, an entrance on the work of the ministry would\n be the issue. The mother thought of him as her jocund, laughing son,\n generous and full of good impulses, but not the stuff to make a preacher\n out of. And I suppose she died with that impression. But her young\n pastor lived to see her son zealously laboring as a good minister of Jesus\n Christ.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another figure in this group was Mrs. Catharine Fort, the widow of\n</p>\n<p>\n Fort, of Georgetown, and a daughter of Rev. Edmond Botsford, who\n</p>\n<p>\n was for many years pastor of the Baptist Church in Georgetown, having\n once been pastor of the Welsh Neck Church. Mrs. Fort was a deeply\n pious woman, with a natural temper perhaps as lovely as ever adorns\n female character. The gentle expression of her sweet face seemed to be-\n token a soul full of \u201cthe peace of God.\u201d It was beautiful to see the\n affectionate confidence between \u201cAunt Williams\u201d and \u201cCousin Kate.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The third figure in this group was that of an old lady, not always\n present, but honored with marked respect when she was there, Miss\n Charlotte Kirven. This remarkable old lady was herself a study. Born\n in humble life, never above the necessity of her own personal la ' bor for a\n support, always attired in the simplest garb \u2014 a homespun or calico dress\n and a Virginia or an untrimmed cottage bonnet; yet, she was always\n a welcome and honored guest among those accustomed to the indulgences\n of wealth. Dr. Smith, who could not tolerate an idle poor person, al-\n ways treated her with marked deference ; indeed, used to cite her as an\n evidence that poverty was no excuse for indolence and ignorance. But\n what was remarkable in Miss Charlotte\u2019s case was the amount of read-\n ing she had done, and her mastery of what she had read. It was inter-\n esting to observe the twinkle in her deep-set. grey eyes when some point\n in theology became a subject of conversation. She would refer to the opin-\n ions of Wesley and Fletcher, of Bunyan and Fuller, with clear grasp of\n their views, and often with an exact citation of particular passages.

Omissions I must make,\n and I know not how better to do than to give a glimpse of the men who\n filled the deacon ' s office during my pastorate.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of these I shall mention first Daniel Campbell, a Scotch Highlander,\n who said of himself : \u201cI was a Baptist before I ever saw a Baptist.\n The New Testament made me a Baptist.\u201d He was, in fact, one of a col-\n ony of Scotch people who came to this country under rather peculiar\n circumstances. It was the result of a religious awakening which had a\n remarkable origin. It seems that a man in humble life, a cobbler by\n trade, in reading his Bible came upon the doctrine of the new birth, of\n which he had never heard any thing from the pulpit. With this new dis-\n covery he continued to search the Scriptures with intense interest and\n with prayer for Divine illumination. Relieved at last of the burden of\n guilt by a personal faith in our Lord Jesus Christ, and feeling the ineffa-\n ble joy and peace which such a faith induces, he began to read the Scrip-\n tures to his neighbors and to tell them of his own happy experience. Soon\n his little cottage could not contain the companies that gathered in the\n evenings to listen to these readings and exhortations. They assembled\n under the trees, large and interested audiences. Mr. Campbell told me\n that he had seen the daughter of the lord of the manor shedding tears freely\n \u2022as she sat in her carriage on the outside of the crowd, listening to the\n \u25a0earnest words of this good man.\n</p>\n<p>\n Many came to exercise like precious faith. And now, still further\n seeking in the Divine Word for guidance, they came to see that it was the\n duty of believers to be baptized. What this was, comparing Scripture\n with Scripture, they saw to be different from that which they had been\n accustomed to call baptism. For a time they were in a quandary, out of\n which, however, they were relieved by the information of a traveler, who\n gave them to understand that in a distant city was a company of people\n who believed and practiced in accordance with the views which they\n themselves held. Upon this information they sent a deputation of nine\n men to said city. These nine men were baptized and were the nucleus of\n a Baptist Church in the Highlands. One of their number was long known\n in Richmond County, N. C., as Father White, and was at one time pastor\n of the Welsh Neck Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Campbell was not baptized in Scotland, but his convictions of duty\n were formed there.\n</p>\n<p>\n He was a poor man, occupied as an overseer from my first knowing him\n to the day of his death ; and yet, in a community then abounding with\n wealth, he was placed in the office of deacon. The fact is explained by\n the solid w T orth of his character. A man of sound judgment, of an integ-\n rity which commanded the respect of everybody, familiar with the Scrip-\n tures, clear and retentive in his memory of whatever he read, staunch and\n resolute as a countryman of John Knox is wont to be, and withal deeply\n devout, he was a man to fill the office with eminent success. I was often\n struck with the use he made of the weekly religious paper.

Were the world filled\n with such men as ' he, wars would cease and court houses would crumble\n down. Kind, gentle, patient, modest, conscientious, he was greatly loved\n at home and thoroughfy confided in by his brethren and the whole com-\n munity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another occupant of the deacon\u2019s office for a part of the time of my\n pastorship was the late Hon. Thomas P. Lide, the genial, generous, sym-\n pathizing and devout man, to whom honors came not because they were\n sought, but because they were due. He was a graduate of Union Col-\n lege, Schenectady, N. Y., under the presidency of Dr. Knott. Before his\n settlement at his beautiful home, near Springville, on Black Creek,\n having married Miss Elizabeth Sparks at Society Hill, he made this place\n his residence. This gave me the opportunity of an intimate acquaintance\n which I number among the rich blessings of my life. In the church con-\n ferences, in the Union meetings (held on the 5th Lord\u2019s days), and in the\n annual meetings of the Welsh Neck Association (then embracing churches\n in Chesterfield, Darlington, Marlboro and Marion districts), he often spoke\n with telling effect; for he never spoke for the sake of making a speech,\n but from earnest conviction and the movement of spiritual desires. Be-\n longing to a family known for their intelligence, but inclined to be too re-\n ticent, this readiness to communicate was the more remarkable in him.\n His expression was always terse, and his manner grave and deliberate.\n Few had a more appreciative sense of the humorous, but it was equally\n free from the bitterness of satire, on the one hand, and the levity of buf-\n foonery on the other. It was the fine play of what Andrew Fuller has\n called sanctified facetiousness. It did not disqualify him for going into\n the prayer-meeting and leading in the songs of praise or in the utterances\n of prayer and supplication. It did not hinder him from listening with\n undivided attention to the ministrations of the pulpit. How often have\n we seen him exhibit his tender sensibility to the truth by his eyes suffused\n with tears and then turned to find an answering sentiment in some other\n lover of the truth. He was one of those hearers that make preachers\n preach. Nor was his pen suffered to be idle. The readers of the reli-\n gious press in South Carolina of years ago will remomber his initials, T.\n P. L. In the circulation of religious literature he took great interest.\n The Welsh Neck Association, long before the war, had a system of colpor-\n tage, and the house of this dear brother was the depository of the books,\n which he furnished to the missionaries, procuring fresh supplies as older\n ones were exhausted. This was a labor of love, in which he greatly de-\n lighted. The visits of these self-denying men to his well-appointed and\n most hospitable home were made cheery by his own large-heartedness and\n the cordial, gentle spirit of his most amiable wife. In the promotion of\n the interests of agriculture he took an active part, as he did in every\n measure looking to the public welfare. The willing suffrages of his fel-\n low-citizens invested him with the office of State Senator.

One antedated the war; the other was subsequent to\n it :\n</p>\n<p>\n At a meeting of the Convention at Society Hill, his former pastor\n was, for special reason, purposing to go to Charleston, but, by violent\n cold, recently taken, was almost incapacitated for traveling. There were\n two modes of going, one by stage, running to Georgetown, and thence to the\n city ; the other by railway from Camden, but Camden more than fifty\n miles off. But I was given to understand that the question of ways and\n means must not worry me for a moment. Without detailing his plans, tbe\n thoughtful benevolence of my good brother removed the pressure of any\n care. I was to go that evening to his house, where, if matters grew worse,\n I was sure of medical attention and good nursing. In the morning, with\n little change, and the anxiety to reach the city still continuing, my friend\u2019s\n commodious family carriage was at the door ; and when I had entered it\n and taken my place upon its cushioned seat, behold he himself mounted\n the steps, and taking his seat, assured me that he would hear to nothing\n else than being tlTe companion of my journey. That night in Camden he\n waited upon me with all a brother\u2019s tenderness, and in the morning\n saw me safe on board the train. Is it strange that I should think of him\n as John did of Gaius, his dearly beloved, whom he loved in the truth.\n Were a justification needed for such a recital as this, I would find it in\n 3 John 5-8.\n</p>\n<p>\n The other incident belongs to the post-bellum period. The vandalism\n of General Sherman\u2019s army had swept over parts of South Carolina like\n the breath of the sirocco. Houses rifled or burnt, cribs and meat-\n houses emptied, furniture mutilated with bayonets, silver carried off, and\n crockery smashed into bits ; cattle, mules and horses driven off ; wagons,\n carts, carriages, buggies, plows and hoes consumed in bonfires ; these were\n some of the means of impoverishment employed to break the spirit of\n our people. And in many instances it had the effect of shaking con-\n fidence in God as the hearer of prayer. Beligiously believing that they\n were right, and having made an appeal to God for vindication, men\n could -not understand the fatal issue of the war, excepting on the suppo-\n sition that God does not hear prayer. They forgot that outside of the\n Jewish economy God has nowhere promised immunity from physical\n evils to the workers of righteousness ; that the Chaldeans were not bet-\n ter men than Job because they marauded successfully upon his herds\n and left him stripped of everything ; that Alexander Hamilton was not\n a worse man than Aaron Burr.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was in the dark days after the war, when it was necessary to pro-\n vide temporary means to keep our educational efforts from being sub-\n merged by the stygian tide which was flowing over the State, that it\n became my duty to visit the Welsh Neck Association. The body met at\n Mt. Elon, and here it was my privilege, in going to a friend\u2019s house for\n the night, to take a seat alongside of dear Tom Lide in his own convey-\n ance.

The same man who in affluence had been cheerful, thankful,\n studious of duty, exhibited the same qualities, only more strongly, as the\n stars shine brighter in the sky not suffused by sunlight or moonlight.\n</p>\n<p>\n The deacons who were in office all the time of my stay at Society Hill\n were John K. Mclver and John F. Wilson.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Mclver had not long been in office when I assumed the pastorate.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the popular mind of Darlington District (now county) he held a\n place for sense and worth with such men as Judge Evans, Hugh Lide\n and Timothy Dargan. His personal bearing was self-possessed and dig-\n nified ; his habits systematic and regular ; his utterances simple, direct\n and never extravagant. By those who knew him, anything that he said\n was understood to mean all that the words conveyed. He used no as-\n severations; no emphatic repetitions ; his yea always yea and his nay\n nay. With no pretension, no apparent consciousness of superiority, he\n was easily accessible to others, giving sympathy to the suffering and the\n benefit of his advice and help to those who felt the neeff of his judicious\n counsel. We occasionally meet with men of a certain type with whom\n jokers never take liberties, not because the jest might evoke irascible feel-\n ing or tart reply, but from a sort of instinctive sense of the unfitness of\n the thing. Dr. Mclver commanded this kind of respect.\n</p>\n<p>\n But it is time to stop this imperfect analysis, and give some facts. He\n kept the records of the church, and was never behind hand in writing\n them up. He conducted the singing, having a great love for music, a\n voice of fine volume and very melodious, and a deep spiritual relish for\n this form of devotional exercise. He was always at prayer meeting, and\n was almost invariably called upon to take part. In doing this it was ob-\n servable how appropriately he expressed himself in the language of the\n Scriptures. He was superintendent of the Sunday school, and doubtless\n his own exceptional punctuality contributed to the formation of that\n character which the school has since borne.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this connection let me mention an incident that may be of use to\n others. About the time of the formation of the school, a meeting of the\n teachers was held, and Dr. Mclver was called on to lead in prayer. He\n begged to be excused, backing up the refusal with the remark, \u201c You do\n not know my weakness.\u2019\u2019 But he was assured that in that feeling every\n person present deeply sympathized, and was given to understand that we\n should expect him to go forward. This he did, and put up a prayer pro-\n foundly reverent and humble, and admirably couched in the diction of\n the Bible. Several years afterward he alluded to this occurrence, and\n thanked his pastor for not allowing him to forego his duty, alleging his\n conviction that had he been excused then, other refusals would have fol-\n lowed, and thus have formed a habit of neglect which could only have\n operated injuriously on his religious enjoyment. He pitied most sincerely\n those professors of religion who stay away from prayer meetings for fear\n that they may be called on to lead in prayer, or who, if they go, dread\n the liability to be asked to lead in the devotional exercises.

At\n a conference meeting when some point of special interest was under dis-\n cussion, Cap. Edwards (R. G.), a truly godly and zealous man, but liable\n in the heat of debate occasionally to use too strong an expression, had\n made some remark that was offensive, (probably implying inefficiency in\n the deacons). In replying to what he had said, Ur. Mclver alluded to\n this remark as impertinent. This was on Saturday. The next day be-\n fore public worship began, Ur. Mclver requested me to call the church\n together for special conference. When they convened he referred to the\n meeting of the day before and of his having characterized a brother\u2019s re-\n mark as impertinent. \u201c I have nothing to say of the justice or propriety\n of that brother\u2019s conduct ; I am concerned with my own, and I wish to\n retract the language used by myself in pronouncing what he said as im-\n pertinent. Bifference of years and difference of relations will not jus-\n tify the use of such language, and I beg to recall it.\u201d The words were\n scarcely uttered, when the Captain sprang to his feet. \u201c No, Brother\n Moderator, it was all my fault. I should not have used the language\n which I did,\u201d & c. Thus what looked like a painful case of variance be-\n tween brethren was instantly brought to a close, with the added pleasant\n consequence that Captain Edwards\u2019 esteem for Ur. Mclver seemed to\n have been deepened by the occurrence. \u201c The work of righteousness is\n peace, and the effect of righteousness quietness and assurance forever.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Ur. Mclver was an active and generous supporter of denominational\n education in South Carolina, giving both his time and money. His sec-\n ond son (who bore his name and who fell in the Confederate service as the\n captain of a company), was a member of the first graduating class in\n Furman University. His fellow graduates were Ur. J. B. Hartwell,\n missionary to the Chinese ; U. C. Brian, M. B., of Texas, and Colonel R.\n B. Watson. Ur. Mclver\u2019s oldest son had just completed his course in the\n South Carolina College, when he died, in the full hope of a glorious im-\n mortality. Four daughters still live \u2014 one the widow of Rev. R. Fur-\n man, U. B., of Fort Worth, Texas ; one the widow of Ur. S. H. Press-\n ley, of Society Hill ; the third, the wife of Colonel Zimmerman Davis, of\n Charleston, and the fourth the wife of Robert B. Watson, of Ridge\n Spring, South Carolina.\n</p>\n<p>\n I have left little space for a pen picture of him who was longest in the\n deacon\u2019s office, and who, with a humble sense of his own worth, was long\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0056/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 272}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0056/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 544}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0056/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1088}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0056/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2176}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0056/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4352}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0056/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/ic/al/sk/et/ch/00/so/ci/_0/historicalsketch00soci_0/historicalsketch00soci_0_0056.jp2", "height": 4352, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 778700}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"56\">\n<p>\n 54\n</p>\n<p>\n regarded both here and in the regions around as a standard of Christian\n consistency.\n</p>\n<p>\n I have already alluded to the impression made upon me in my boy\n days by the pious bearing of Mr. John F. Wilson. Ten years\u2019 intimate\n intercourse with him in my manhood only deepened this impression.\n Naturally sedate, he was religiously reverent. He was eminently a man\n of prayer; quiet, cautious in a high degree, and conscientiously abstaining\n from everything like a mere show of feeling, those who knelt near him\n could perceive his participation in a prayer by an irrepressible, deep\n breathing which, all unconsciously to himself, betokened his sympathy.\n He was very tender of the feelings of others. A friend once said to me,\n \u201c If Mr. Wilson saw one of his sons standing in the way of the descend-\n ing sweep of a cotton press, he never would say to him, \u2018 Get out of the\n way there !\u2019 but, \u2018 My son, hadn\u2019t you better get out of the way of the\n sweep?\u2019 \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n He was greatly grieved by the appearance of ill temper or ill conduct\n in others. In view of the prevalence of intemperance, he practiced total\n abstinence. Indeed, I am inclined to believe that the honor belongs to\n him of bringing about the effort to reduce the evil by means of a social\n organization. At the house of Mr. Robert Weston, somewhere between\n 1825 and 1828, a number of delegates to the Charleston Association were\n entertained. Among some of them, at least, the conversation turned\n upon the subject of drunkenness and the possibility of abating the evil\n by an agreement among good men to give up the indulgence of liquor\n drinking. Mr. Wilson ' s earnest talk had a decided effect on the mind of\n one of the ministers, Rev. Jesse Hartwell, who agreed (whether with\n others or not I do not know) to join Mr. Wilson in a pledge of absti-\n nence. The next morning when the decanters were placed on the\n sideboard for the customary ante-breakfast potation, Rev. Mr. Mallary,\n having prepared his glass, summoned the attention of his brother Hart-\n well, to remind him of how great a pleasure he was denying himself by '\n his new pledge. At the next year\u2019s meeting of the Association, Mr.\n Mallary preached the introductory sermon, when his text was, \u201c Wine is\n a mocker ; strong drink is raging ; and he that is deceived thereby is not\n wise.\u201d He had thought over the facts connected with the drinking cus-\n toms of society, and was thoroughly aroused. He gave to the press arti-\n cle after article under the general name, The Marvelous Doings of Prince\n Alcohol. Public attention was thus called to the enormous evil, and a\n simple but efficient means of arresting it was set on foot. Thus \u201c two\n are better than one.\u201d The unassuming Welsh Neck deacon would never\n have appeared in the role of a reformer, but his w r ords stimulated his\n bolder and more energetic brother to action. It reminds us of the dif-\n fident Melancthon counseling, and the courageous Luther precipitating\n action.\n</p>\n<p>\n He was scrupulously honest. For many years he was treasurer of the\n Association, or of its Executive Board, and he was careful not only to\n have his paper- exhibits clear and clean, but he used a separate bag for\n each separate fund. The contents of each one of these little receptacles\n would show the exact condition of the fund on hand.

On Sunday\n mornings, while Sunday School was in progress, quite a number list-\n ened to the reading of the Scriptures and other religious books (as\n Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, The Holy War, Sambo and Tony, & c.) This ser-\n vice was conducted by Major D. B. W. Mclver. They attended the\n 11 o\u2019clock preaching in common with the whites, and at the close of this\n service the pastor preached to them separately. Some of the whites would\n stay in to this service and some of them were known to have said that\n they liked the sermon to the black ' people best. In the afternoon it\n was understood that the pastor would be in his study for conversation\n with any desiring any special instruction and particularly with those de-\n siring to join the church. The profession of religion among them was\n guarded with much care. There were seven colored deacons, who were\n charged with inquiring into the connubial relations of parties applying for\n baptism. That loose views of personal purity and of marriage obligations\n should have prevailed among the descendants of long generations of poly-\n gamists is not to be wondered at. Some have supposed that these evils\n are to be ascribed to their servitude, but this is a mistake. There\n were instances of unrighteous and cruel masters, who criminally disre-\n garded the conjugal relations among their slaves, but these were the ex-\n ception, not the rule ; just as tyrannical husbands and cruel mothers and\n brutal fathers are not the rule, but the exceptions.

At any rate there was, in the\n large membership at Society Hill, a decided tone of good morals, and of\n unquestionable piety \u2014 slaves then, as in Apostolic times, \u201c adorning the\n doctrine of God, their Saviour.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The images of a number rise distinctly to my view, along with the\n mutual confidence between them and their owners, but out of them I beg\n to recall a single specimen from each of the sexes. The first I mention\n was known as Maum Dinah , the property of Alexander McIntosh, who\n had nursed her master in his childhood and performed the same office for\n his children. So thoroughly trustworthy and sensible and sympathizing\n and handy was this good woman, that her presence in the sick chamber\n was greatly valued. She put on no airs, was really glad to have an op-\n portunity to serve others, and though not forward to speak, yet when she\n did so, it was edifying to see the strength of her faith and the spiritual\n wisdom of a deeply experienced Christian. She maintained family wor-\n ship in her own cabin, and one evening in the week all her children, who\n had families, with others who would join them, were made welcome. This\n she did without sympathy from her husband, but after many years she had\n the satisfaction of seeing her children and her husband baptized in obedi-\n ence lo the Saviour, whom she loved and served. In her quiet way, she\n would place in my hand her two dollar contribution to the cause of Mis-\n sions.\n</p>\n<p>\n The other name which I take pleasure here to record, believing fully\n that it is written in the Lamb\u2019s Book of Life, is the name of Daddy Billy ,\n one of the deacons. He was the superintendent of one of Dr. Mclver\u2019s\n plantations. He was a venerable person considerably more than six feet\n in height, and while Maum Dinah had the pure African physiognomy in\n the shape of features and in color, his face showed more of the Moorish\n style. He was piously reflective and the objects within the range of his\n observation became associated with religious truth. In telling of the\n trouble of soul which he had when under conviction, he said that he came\n upon a tree ; the sawyer was at work ; he thought of the foolish thing, re-\n joicing in killing the tree without knowing that that very thing would carry\n it into the fire. He saw in it an emblem of himself in his sinful follies,\n destroying his own soul. He once illustrated the good of preparation of\n heart for the profitable use of the means of grace by this homely, but tell-\n ing simile : \u201c When the griddle-iron is hot, a little bit of grease will run\n all over it.\u201d Caught out once by a violent wind, a large oak near him\n was broken off, but the saplings and the broom sedge lay down before the\n blast, and when the storm was over, rose up again unhurt. The old man\n saw in this the danger of pride and the safety of a humble spirit. It was\n a fine instance of the genuineness \u2014 the natura In ess \u2014 of his religious spirit\n that in the language which he used in prayer, an appellation for God\n which he frequently used was drawn from his personal experience.

If we would discover the genesis and trace the growth of\n Baptist principles, if we would comprehend our present position and\n religious significance, and grasp the promise of our beliefs and peculiari-\n ties for the future, we must turn to the people. We must study their\n social, moral and religious necessities and possibilities. You are aware,\n my intelligent hearers, that, as Baptists, we are permitted to look back\n to no throned monarch boasting the title, \u201c Defender of the Faith,\u201d as\n our patron ; to no ecclesiastical autocrat as our pilot in a stormy, revolu-\n tionary period ; to no electoral college of temporal princes counseling as\n our protectors ; to no solemn assembly of divines as the source of our\n doctrinal unity and the unchanging standard of authority ; but that all\n that we are and all that we have been, must be attributed, under the\n blessing of God, to the common sense and discerning religious instincts of\n the masses of our fellow men. With these our principles have ever svm-\n bolized. From this seat of power our cause has been upheld, and it is\n from this central residence of sovereignty that our views are to go forth\n to the ends of the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n The philosophical student of history, if we suppose him entirely ignor-\n ant of our past, could readily detect on our beliefs and practices the\n stamp of the people, and could shrewdly guess our starting point, and\n might reconstruct, in general outline, our past history. He would per-\n ceive upon the most casual examination an absence of oligarchic and\n autocratic ideas and tendencies, and a manifest presence of democratic\n sentiments and views in our conception and application of Christianity.\n The whole genius and trend of our faith and church polity would tell\n whence we came. Often an idea, an institution tells its own story in\n language which the thoughtful man need not misinterpret. For exam-\n ple, blot out the past of Episcopacy, and yet the philosophic historian\n would find no difficulty in telling its probable origin. Here is a set of\n ideas, a system of principles that could not have been born of the popu-\n lar mind, though it may have been imposed upon and finally accepted\n by the people. The standpoint is hierarchical aristocratic, and suggests\n the dominance of the few, and not the legislative concurrence of the\n many. We here perceive no evidence of the people\u2019s way of looking at\n power and prerogative.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was a memorable event in ancient history when, at Athens, Kleis-\n thenes, worsted by his political rival, Isagaros, \u201ctook into partnership the\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0061/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 272}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0061/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 544}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0061/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1088}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0061/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2176}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0061/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4352}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0061/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/ic/al/sk/et/ch/00/so/ci/_0/historicalsketch00soci_0/historicalsketch00soci_0_0061.jp2", "height": 4352, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 734030}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"61\">\n<p>\n 59\n</p>\n<p>\n people, who, under the Solonian constitution, had been before excluded\n from everything.\u201d This was the birthday of Athenian democracy, the\n dawn of the most illustrious age of classic history, the beginning of the\n century during which learning, art, eloquence and philosophy reached the\n highest point attained in ancient times. The high-born Alcmseonid\n \u201cbuilded wiser than he knew.\u201d He laid the foundation of Athens\u2019 great-\n ness. The citizen, henceforth privileged and dignified, became the potent\n and controlling factor of society and politics. He regarded the aggran-\n dizement and the glory of his city as his own honor and elevation. He\n naturally felt a personal interest in the State. His zeal for its welfare\n was stimulated to noble exertion, and his patriotism became the intensest\n passion. The obscurest citizen could rise to importance, and was in-\n spired with a sentiment of worth and dignity. He might have his place\n in the popular assembly, and take part in national deliberations. When\n Ephialtes brought down the laws of Solon from the Acropolis to the\n neighborhood of the market place, thus stripping the Areopagus of its\n time-honored authority, and when the popular dicasteries were estab-\n lished by Pericles, the plain citizen could sit clothed with the judicial\n power of the State, representing the honor and majesty of Athens. This\n was just the state of things adapted to bring out all that was noble in a\n people, to produce statesmen, orators, artists, poets, generals, philoso-\n phers. The way to distinction lay open to all. Any might aspire to be\n be a Phormio, a Pheideas, a Pericles. It was Athenian democracy that\n inaugurated the epoch of Athenian glory. It was free speech and equal\n laws that paved the way for the maritime supremacy and hegemony of\n Athens. It was the popular dicastery that gave birth to Greek oratory ;\n that in a measure produced Greek political and speculative philosophy ;\n that helped to give the world rhetoric and grammar ; that coutributed\n much towards making an age to which the eyes of all succeeding genera-\n tions have been turned with wonder and admiration.

And since he came to uplift the race, it is instructive to\n study hisjmethod of approaching men, and to observe where he lays hold on\n them. In this way we may discover some clue to the chosen method of\n infinite wisdom. When we turn to the gospel history we find that Jesus\n of Nazareth is a man of the people.

He does not seek to engraft his truth upon the with-\n ering top and decaying branches of society. He passes by the doctors of\n the law, prepossessed by their own wisdom, the priestly class sunk into a\n petrified traditionalism, and the Pharisees standing encased, as it were, in\n a steel armor of pride, intolerance and blinding narrowness.

Though he spake as never\n man spake, yet he spoke as inspired men have ever spoken, in the clear,\n vigorous, concrete and suggestive words of everyday life, the mother\n tongue of his hearers. His words were life and spirit.

This peculiarity appears in noth-\n ing, perhaps, [more decided than in his choice of the people as the depository\n of his doctrine. He selected as the basis upon which to operate in a great\n religious movement, the eternal element of society, that element that is as\n persistent and universal as the race itself. Suppose, on the other hand,\n he had sought an alliance with the hierarchical party, the spiritual aristo-\n cracy of Jerusalem, or confined his instruction to members of the Sanhe-\n drim, how can we avoid thinking that the result, humanly speaking, would\n have been different from what it was ? Would the spirit of his teaching\n have been characterized by the breadth and depth and power that render\n it to-day so pre-eminently a religion for humanity, a religion affording\n room for freedom of thought, unfettered human development, a develop-\n ment of all the moral and spiritual elements and energies of the ever-\n living multitudes. Yes ; the multitudes never die. They survive the\n revolutions of governments, and the overthrow of empires. Hierarchs,\n knights, nobility, feudal lords, despots rise for a moment, above the heav-\n ing masses of mankind, then sink forever in the all-engulfing abyss of\n time ; the people live on. And the idea that is adapted to the people and\n enthroned in their esteem and favor, is received into an everlasting habi-\n tation. The Founder of Christianity, as a wise master-builder, dealt with\n the permanent forces of the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n Again, the great Teacher laid hold upon that which is universal. His\n ideas are constructed on a large scale, as if there were anticipated for\n them an indefinitely prolonged career under the most diverse conditions.\n Humanly speaking, it may be said that the grand outlines he traces in-\n dicate the prophetic insight of genius. Expansion, enlargement, growth '\n seems to be an ever-present idea in the teaching of the Lord, and comes\n into prominence in more than one parable. He appears to be looking far\n beyond the hills of Judea, and the mountains of the North ; and as the\n sighing of the Mediterranean breaks upon his ear, it may be he glances\n beyond the waters of the great sea to the mighty, uprising nations of the\n West, now growing on the banks of the Danube, the Rhine and the\n Thames, and already defying the Roman rule and arms. And he real-\n izes that if his kingdom is to grow and become universal, he must lay\n hold upon the great masses, the social element that is everywhere pres-\n ent.

The idea, as you see,\n is optimistic, and readily allies itself to the famous evolutionistic theory.\n In some respects this view stands in bold contrast with the Christian idea\n of humanity. According to the latter, the individual is to be raised\n through an ethico-religious life into a renewed, transformed state, in\n which the divine in human nature becomes ever more and more active\n and manifest. The goal of development is not the realization of self,\n but the realization of God in the fulness of His communication to finite\n existence. Nor is it sought to drown the sense of misery born of in-\n dwelling sin, but to heal the moral bruise by the remedial balm of grace.\n Moreover, man is not primarily to fortify himself behind the breastwork\n of his own accumulations of moral wealth ; but to receive a life ab extra\n fraught with boundless promise and potentiality. This idea naturally\n links itself to endless trains of inspiring thought, awakens the mind of\n man to new effort, gives birth to the hope of ultimate success in dealing\n with the stubborn problems of evil and imperfection. Now it appears, I\n think, upon the slightest reflection that this is the idea of humanity best\n adapted to the conditions and wants of the people, as the idea most im-\n mediately realizable and approximately attainable, as the idea from the\n content of which there is an elimination of tribal and local elements, in\n which there is an expansion to the universal, all-comprehending, result-\n ing in a conception of the dignity of the race as a whole , and of the indi-\n vidual as the worthy and all-important unit. And while this idea may\n have no definite shape in the minds of the people, still it lies imbedded in\n the popular consciousness, and there is a natural striving toward its ex-\n pression, and ever has been, and the idea itself is becoming more and\n more powerful. It is one of the ruling ideas of modern thought. As you\n perceive, it is fundamentally democratic, and appears in this character as\n soon as men endeavor to actualize it, or give it practical expression. And\n in proportion as Baptists are true fo the democratic ideas and practices\n of Biblical Christianity, they will prove the best and most effective ex-\n ponents of the grand idea of humanity, the idea that sides with the people\n and is their firm friend and ally.\n</p>\n<p>\n At no period, perhaps, of the world\u2019s history, does the power of the\n people appear to greater advantage than during the Reformation of the\n Sixteenth Century. When Christianity started on its career, it struggled\n first for existence, for simple toleration. Finally, through the influence of\n popular sympathy and adherence, after the bloody annals of martyrology\n had been written, an edict [from the throne of the Caesars said to the\n new faith, Live. But the people had already decreed its perpetual exis-\n tence. As soon, however, as the struggle for existence reached a victor-\n ious issue, there arose a contest for ecclesiastical dominion. The hier-\n archical idea waxed ever more and more mighty, and when it became\n dominant, there was strife for temporal dominion.

At\n the same great birth-period, spiritual power began to gravitate towards\n its natural home and centre, the masses of the people. In the assertion\n of their rights the people threw off the shackles of spiritual tyranny.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Reformation emphasized three great ideas, that may here be men-\n tioned. First, Salvation by grace, or, as it sounded from the trumpet of\n Luther, the people\u2019s man, justification by faith ; a doctrine admirably\n adapted to the wants of the people, setting forth the possibility of salva-\n tion without priestly intervention, proclaiming divine absolution apart\n from sacerdotal channels and interference. This is one of the elements\n of Christianity that suits it to the people, in that it places all on a com-\n mon platform, whence, without ecclesiastics or churchly functionaries and\n rites, the soul, burning with fervid aspirations, or oppressed by a sense of\n misery, may be lifted up to God. The second idea insisted on by the Re-\n formation, is the supreme authority of the Scriptures. Not the church,\n whatever this may mean, not the fathers whoever they may be, not\n councils under whatever auspices assembled, not traditions however\n specious and imposing, but the word of God must be final arbiter of\n every dispute. Because this idea has become familiar to us, we must\n not forget that it was novel and startling at this time. The people\n claimed the right of access to the fountain of religious truth, and\n brought forth the word from the gloomy crypts and cloisters of the\n Middle Ages, and read it in the light of the sun, and in defiance of\n Rome. For the people now abolished a power they had formerly crea-\n ted. Who, or what made the Roman Pontiff ? Not simply the sepa-\n ration of the East and West in the great schism, and removal of the\n seafcof empire from the banks of the Tiber to the shores of the Bosporus ;\n not the accidental prominence from early times of the patriarchate of the\n West ; not the downfall of the exarchate of Ravenna and the temporal en-\n thronement of the pope ; not the prestige and memories of the Eternal\n City, long accustomed to rule the world ; not the False Decretals of the\n Ninth Century ; not the succession of eminent statesmen that occupied the\n papal chair, such as Leo the Great, Gregory VII. and Innocent III. ; not\n the edicts of Theodosius II. and Valentinian III. ; not the fortunate cir-\n cumstance that the Roman bishop usually espoused that side of every great\n controversy that won the day. These things and others helped to swell\n the tide that swept on toward the tiara and the claim of universal\n primacy. But it is proper to remember that, after all, the people made\n the pope, those men that lowered their swords before the intellectual cul-\n ture of the fallen empire, the Vandals, Ostrogoths, Burgundians, Alans,\n Lombards and Anglo-Saxons. The people, in their ignorance, made the\n pope, and now in their enlightenment they have resolved to unmake him.\n The power of the people becomes irresistible. And the weapon they\n wield for the overthrow of the hierarch is the word of God. To the law\n and to the testimony is their watchword. He trembles before a people\n armed with the Scriptures, and acknowledging no higher authority.

J. A. W. THOMAS.\n</p>\n<p>\n As we gather upon this sacred ground on this joyous occasion, it is fit\n that we review the past and offer praise to God that \u201c hitherto He has\n helped us.\u201d The brethren who have preceded me have told us of what\n the Lord hath wrought, and before the occasion closes yet more will be\n told of the struggles and triumphs of the fathers. For centuries past as\n a denomination of Christians we have had a history ; and for a century\n and a half this Welsh Neck Church has held, and made an honorable\n record, and to-day we are to \u201c thank God and take courage.\u201d But now,\n as you set out upon this second half of the second century of your church\n life, may it not be well to inquire, What of the time to come ? Have the\n people whose name you bear accomplished their mission ? Or have they\n yet history to make? What promise have they of progress, perpetuity,\n success? What hope for coming years? Is there any? If so, what is\n its basis ?\n</p>\n<p>\n It is granted that there are discouragements and hindrances. In our\n own lack of zeal and consecration in our Master\u2019s cause we have reason\n for shame and apprehension. The powers of sin and Satan are arrayed\n against us. The principles we hold are opposed by the depraved pro-\n pensities of fallen humanity. At every step in our progress we are at\n war with error and wrong, and to yield or compromise is disloyalty and\n defeat, for there can be no agreement between Christ and Belial, and we\n must \u201c fight the good fight of faith, and lay hold on eternal life.\u201d And\n then, the beliefs and policies of many Christian people do not accord\n with our own. In some things essential to our denominational existence\n we stand alone, and it is doubtful if these principles so dear to us are\n any more palatable to others than in the days when more openly opposed.\n Our views of church order and government is by almost everybody else\n regarded as an element of weakness in our system, tending to disinte-\n gration and destruction, tolerative in us, but not at all accepted by others.\n Other systems are held and taught, the success of which means defeat to\n our cherished faith and practice. Amid these conflicting opinions and\n observances what hope have Baptists? Is it that our numbers are in-\n creasing? May we never fail to thank God for every converted soul he\n adds to our churches. It is matter of encouragement that in this coun-\n try our growth keeps pace with the rapid increase of population, and that\n our missions in other lands are behind none in success. But we are to\n bear in mind that \u201c the race is not \u201d always \u201c to the swift nor the battle\n to the strong.\u201d The multitude is against Christianity. Not a third of\n the world\u2019s population is nominally Christian. And among the grand\n divisions who bear the name of Christ there are several of immense pro-\n portions and rapidly multiplying ; some whose methods are more popular\n and better adapted to catch the breezes that waft to success.

But other denominations keep\n pace with us in this respect, and the masses from which our recruits are\n to be drawn are being lifted to the same plane of intelligence that Chris-\n tians occupy. And after all, while we appreciate the potent influence of\n learning in building up and extending the cause of truth and righteous-\n ness in the earth, let us not forget its powerful evil. A mighty weapon\n it is in the hand of the Holy Spirit in the promotion of human weal and\n the divine glory ; but scarcely less potent in the hand of Satan in oppos-\n ing right and truth. Directed and controlled by the adversary, what a\n power it is \u201cto make the worse appear the better cause,\u201d to polish the\n libertine, hide the assassin, cloak the hypocrite, paint the harlot, deceive\n the elect, so that we need a surer basis than human learning affords as a\n ground of hope not to be disappointed.\n</p>\n<p>\n What then ?

Money is power for good when used so as\n not to be abused \u2014 a power in the advancement of truth and righteous-\n ness, and our people may have more of this power at command to-day\n than ever before in their history, imposing weightier responsibilities, which\n it is hoped they are more and more ready to discharge, and thus wisely\n use for God\u2019s glory. But is not Satan and his agents wielding this same\n giant influence as effectively for the promotion of evil and wrong? The\n children of the wicked one have more of the world\u2019s wealth than the #\n friends of Christ, and are hardly less wise or lavish in using it for irre-\n ligion. Their costly, glittering expenditures meet the eye at every cor-\n ner in one and another temptation, making sin easy, vice attractive, the\n gold-paved road to ruin as enchanting as music, art, painting, beauty can\n render it. We may not build our hope on earthly, perishing treasure.\n The poor in this world\u2019s goods, but rich in faith, have been in all\n the ages the grand heroes for God and truth. In what, then, do you\n see the promise of future success for the cause you love, the name you\n bear ? Is it in the force of concentrated, united effort? God be praised\n that, living and toiling as we do in thousands of little, feeble commu-\n nities, each called a church, each independent of all others in belief\n and action, we are nevertheless substantially one in faith and practice,\n loving, honoring each other, and co-operating together in a common\n cause ; and yet, not one allowing the authority of any power on earth\n to regulate our movements or direct our energies. We know there is\n strength and elements of success in the ability to mass forces and hurl\n a solid column against the strategic points of our adversary ; we know,\n too, that there are other religious communions which may be moved at\n the instance of a single mind, or of a grand central authority, to a field\n of action long before the scattered Baptist hosts can be aligned.

Indeed, so far as human power for marshalling and\n concentrating our forces is concerned, w r e are a feeble band, at the mercy\n of our opponents, and our own power of resistance in ages past has been\n in large measure the grace of endurance.

According to human judgment, fne sentence may be fail-\n ure, defeat, ruin. But not in His esteem who \u201c weigh eth actions \u201d and\n judgeth righteously. The world thought the Gospel dead, when its great\n Author cried, \u201c \u2018It is finished,\u2019 and gave up the ghost.\u201d The apostles\n may have felt, \u201cAll hope is buried in Joseph\u2019s new tomb.\u201d But was it\n so ? The Sun of Righteousness sank into the grave\u2019s darkness only to rise\n again to the light and glory of eternal day, to thrill the hearts of his\n disciples with hope and joy, take the throne in heaven, \u201c Lord of lords\n and King of kings,\u201d to reign till all enemies be put under his feet. He,\n the glorious Lord of all ; He is our hope. And were every ear attentive,\n every heart open to receive, every haird ' ready to do His bidding, we\n should have that concentration of forces that God approves, and which\n would be absolutely invincible.\n</p>\n<p>\n It would be amazing to contemplate the power that has attended the\n simple presentation of Gospel truth, exemplified by a strict conformity to\n its precepts, were it not that the gospel is \u201c the power of God and the\n wisdom of God.\u201d I will not say our fathers in the ministry had better\n knowledge of Scripture interpretation than the ministers of to-day, or\n that their exegesis and homiletics was at all equal to it. Many of them\n knew nothing of the rules that govern the modern sermonizer in the con-\n struction of sermons. But there was one thing they did know, what the\n Word of God said, and that they told to the people, and it took hold\n upon them as a living reality \u2014 made the preacher and alike the people\n honest, truthful, prayerful, loving, joyful, spiritual servants of Christ.\n The truth, spoken and lived, told upon the hearts and lives of men\n around, \u201c and much people wereadded unto the Lord.\u201d \u201c Giants in those\n days?\u201d Yes ; and there has to be giants in our own day, and in coming\n time, men \u201c strong in the Lord and in the power of His might,\u201d or else\n the giant influences of worldliness and sin will cripple the energies and\n discourage the hearts of the people of God.

One\n year before, that is in 1755, was instituted in Charleston the \u201cReligious\n Society,\u201d whose main, if not only object was to aid young ministers in pur-\n suing their studies. Among the first and most prominent of those aided\n by this society were Samuel Stillman and Edmund Botsford. The re-\n mains of one lie in the neglected graveyard in Georgetown, in this State,\n while those of the other repose in Boston cemetery. Both were useful\n and eminent in their day. Another of their early beneficiaries was\n Samuel Eccles.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Charleston Association w T as organized in 1751 with four churches, of\n which Welsh Neck was one. In 1757 it consisted of eight churches, of which\n one was admitted at that session, at which time it was resolved to raise a\n fund to furnish \u201c suitable candidates for the ministry with a competent\n share of learning,\u201d and it was recommended to the churches to collect\n money for this purpose. The delegates present subscribed, in behalf of\n their churches, 133 pounds sterling to begin the fund. It seems that\n thereafter the work of ministerial education was in charge of the Associa-\n tion, which decided who should be accepted as beneficiaries, but the Re-\n ligious Society continued for some years to aid with its contributions. The\n first beneficiary whose education was undertaken by the Association\n was Evan Pugh. There was no attempt by the Association to establish a\n school. It confined its effortslfor 69 years to giving necessary aid to young\n preachers in prosecuting their studies in such schools as already existed.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Charleston Association, at that time including all the Baptist church-\n es in the State, except that of the General Baptists at Stono, which did not\n affiliate with the others, was engaged in the work of ministerial educa-\n tion some seven years before Morgan Edwards startled the Philadelphia\n Association in 1762 by the proposition that the Baptists of America should\n establish a college. This proposal resulted in the establishment of Rhode\n Island College, now Brown University, which was chartered in 1764. It\n began with a school, opened in 1766 by Dr. Manning, in Warren, Rhode\n Island, and was removed in 1770 to \" Providence. This enterprise found\n cordial and practical sympathy among the South Carolina Baptists.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1774 the Association appointed a committee of three to address the\n Baptist associations throughout America, in favor of a plan of contribution\n for augmenting the funds of Rhode Island College. Messrs. Hart and\n Williams were nominated a committee to receive contributions in the State\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0078/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 272}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0078/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 544}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0078/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1088}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0078/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2176}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0078/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4352}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0078/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/ic/al/sk/et/ch/00/so/ci/_0/historicalsketch00soci_0/historicalsketch00soci_0_0078.jp2", "height": 4352, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 804326}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"78\">\n<p>\n 76\n</p>\n<p>\n for that institution and to transmit the same to Col.

From the record\n it seems that the Association did not meet in the years 1776, \u201980, \u201981 and\n \u201984.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the circular addressed to the churches in 1786 occur the following :\n \u201cIt is our ardent desire that the members of our churches be well estab-\n lished in the evidences as well as the necessity and importance of Chris-\n tianity, and that the reasonableness and consistency of its doctrines be\n well understood. * * * Pay particular attention to the education of\n</p>\n<p>\n your children with this view, and when it has pleased God to call any of\n His young servants to the work of the ministry, let the churches be care-\n ful to introduce them in the line of study and improvement and make\n suitable exertions to furnish them with the necessary means for this end.\u201d\n Here we have the key-note, which thus early sounded out the injunction\n to Christian parents to see to the religious element in the education of their\n children. They had reason to sound the alarm. It has been stated that\n during the latter part of the century French infidelity made quite an in-\n road in this country.\n</p>\n<p>\n From a feeling of gratitude for their help in the Revolution and an ad-\n miration for their chivalrous character, Frenchmen found ready access\n to the homes and confidence of the American people. The Baptists in the\n State at that time were few, but there were giants among them \u2014 men in\n advance of their day. These foresaw the danger and gave the alarm.\n They called to their brethren to rally to the rescue and pointed out the\n means of success. Pioneers, they carefully threaded their way through\n the mazes of obstacles and left immortal way marks for the guidance of\n those who might come after them.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1789 a step forward was taken. The plan of having a respectable\n and permanent fund established for the education of pious young men \u2014\n candidates for the ministry \u2014 was resolved upon and recommended to the\n churches. \u201c The General Committee of the Charleston Baptist Associa-\n tion Fund\u201d was determined upon in 1791, from which year it is dated.\n The organization was not effected till 1792, when the rules were ratified\n and signed. The officers of the General Committee were Dr. Richard\n Furman, president ; Dr. Henry Holcombe, secretary, and Col. Thomas\n Screven, treasurer. Bravely set they to work and wonderful were the\n achievements of that General Committee during its eventful history.\n The circular letter of the Association in 1797 was on \u201c The duty of\n churches to provide for the instruction and improvement of persons call-\n ed by them to the ministry previous to their entering upon the work.\u201d I\n have read no more forceful or conclusive argument on Ministerial Edu-\n cation. Any extract that did not contain the entire letter would do it\n injustice. It is as applicable to the circumstances of the present day as\n if it had been written the present year.\n</p>\n<p>\n I do not know how long the General Committee existed, but. till some\n years after the formation of the State Convention, in 1821.\n</p>\n<p>\n The state of the fund in 1810 was as follows :\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0079/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 272}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0079/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 544}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0079/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1088}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0079/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2176}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0079/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4352}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0079/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/ic/al/sk/et/ch/00/so/ci/_0/historicalsketch00soci_0/historicalsketch00soci_0_0079.jp2", "height": 4352, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 721692}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"79\">\n<p>\n 77\n</p>\n<p>\n Contributions from the churches $6,831 63\n</p>\n<p>\n Donations from \u201cReligious Society\u201d 169 61\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c \u201c individuals 21 00\n</p>\n<p>\n Legacy from Mrs. Frances Legare 428 57\n</p>\n<p>\n Interest on fund 1,029 21\n</p>\n<p>\n Total, $8,480 02\n</p>\n<p>\n Paid for library and for board and education of students $3,397 70\n</p>\n<p>\n Amount in bonds, notes and money $5,082 32\n</p>\n<p>\n 2000 acres of land from Jeremiah Brown, valued at 900 00\n</p>\n<p>\n Total, $5,982 02\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1800 John M.

This\n could not be done by them except in an institution of higher learning\n under their own control. The seed sown by the circular address of the\n Charleston Association in 1786 was bearing fruit. Slowly had the leaven\n been at work throughout the State. By this time the beneficiaries had\n carried to nearly every nook and corner of the State the benefits of their\n education. The leading minds in the denomination were ready for the\n undertaking, while the greatly increased number of Baptists in the State\n not only rendered it a necessity, but gave promise of success.*\n</p>\n<p>\n The Furman Institute continued in Fairfield thirteen years. Experi-\n ence during that period demonstrated the necessity of increasing the\n facilities and elevating the standard of the institution in order to meet\n the educational wants of the youth of the State. The State Convention,\n voicing the sentiments and wishes of the denomination, resolved to estab-\n lish a college into which should be merged the institute then in Fairfield.\n The result was the opening of Furman University in Greenville in 1851,\n under most hopeful and promising prospects. The history of the Univer-\n sity is perhaps too recent to justify from me its recital. There are, how-\n ever, garnered in that history instances beyond count of self-sacrifice, of\n toil, of hopes and disappointments on the part of those to whom was com-\n mitted its conduct, that will never be known to the public, but\n which, if made known, would touch the heart and would raise still\n higher in public estimation \u2014 if that were possible \u2014 the character of those\n who, in darkness as well as in day, in storm as well as in calm, in adver-\n sity as well as in prosperity, with unshaken faith and with unswerving\n fidelity toiled on in the great trust committed to them. Some of these\n have, one by one, finished their labors and gone to their reward. A few\n remain with us. The \u201c noblest Roman \u2019\u2019 of them all is with us to-day,\n living over again the hopes and plans of fifty years agone. It is to the\n glory of Welsh Neck that she gave Furman and Edwards to this grand\n work. The labors and lives of such men cannot be lost. Furman Uni-\n versity will live, and, with increased facilities and a broader field, will in\n the future be a still larger blessing to humanity than it has been in the\n past.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of the men aided in pursuing their studies up to the time of the open-\n ing of the institute in Fairfield, we have the names of over ninety. Who\n can estimate the results effected upon these men and through them upon\n others by means of the aid given them. To some it opened a new world\n of knowledge and developed in them capabilities that otherwise would\n have lain dormant. We must take into consideration the work and in-\n fluence of these cultivated men in the generations in which they lived,\n not only the work of building up and training churches, but their influ-\n ence in cultivating the public mind.

Of those beneficiaries\n many pursued their high calling in humble retirement, and their graves\n are unmarked, but their work is known and recorded on high. Some of\n them occupied larger spheres, and their names and deeds are better\n known to posterity. Samuel Stillman labored for forty years in Boston,\n and his life was crowned with pleasing success. The labors of Edmund\n Botsford were bestowed in this State and in Georgia, and were greatly\n blessed. Evan Pugh left the impress of his character and ministry in\n the section now occupied by the Welsh Neck and the Pee Dee Associ-\n ations. John M. Roberts, quickened into a new intellectual life, gave\n fresh impetus and increased facilities to ministerial education by means\n of his school near Statesburg, where he gave tuition to a number of\n young preachers. Jesse Mercer, who did so much for education among\n the Georgia Baptists, giving some $40,000 to that object, was encouraged\n and aided in the pursuit of learning in his early ministry by the South\n Carolina Baptists, with money and books. W. T. Brantley, whose labors\n extended over so wide a field, from Georgia to Philadelphia, was a bene-\n ficiary of the General Committee, both at Roberts\u2019 Academy and at South\n Carolina College, were he graduhted in 1808.

Among them were many whose names have become his-\n torical in the upper portions of the State by means of their labors in the\n ministry.

They not only gave of their means, but addressed\n the Associations throughout America in favor of a plan of contributing to\n its endowment. At much inconvenience and necessary expense they sent\n their beneficiaries to that institution, though located so far off.\n</p>\n<p>\n At the first assemblage of delegates from all parts of America at Phila-\n delphia in 1814, when the Baptist Triennial Convention was organized,\n Dr. Richard Furman, who, for over twenty years, had been the head and\n front of the educational work of South Carolina Baptists, laid before that\n assembly the importance and necessity of the Baptists having a college\n more centrally located. General Washington had twenty years before\n called the attention of Congress to the importance of having an institution\n of higher learning at the seat of government, a view which was after-\n wards presented by Jefferson and Monroe. It was left for a South Caro-\n lina Baptist to originate and to develop among his brethren the idea which\n eventuated in what is now the Columbian University in Washington City.\n The wisdom of Catholicism, which is the accumulated wisdom of more than\n a thousand years\u2019 experience, has given its highest endorsement to the\n foresight of our Baptist fathers, led by Furman, in the fact that it is\n now engaged in establishing in Washington a university upon a foundation\n of millions of dollars.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the early and promising beginning of Columbian College the Bap-\n tists of South Carolina were among the most liberal contributors to its\n funds. In after years, when clouds of adversity and a debt of $30,000\n threatened its utter extinction, and when many of its early friends forsook\n it either in displeasure or in despair of its success, there were found among\n South Carolina Baptists friends who not only believed in its ultimate\n triumph, but gave liberally and repeatedly to secure that triumph. Who\n to-day would not do honor to the names and memory of those clear-headed\n and large-hearted Baptists in South Carolina, who came to the rescue and\n made possible and certain what Columbian University is to-day and the\n still more that it is to be in the future.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is stated that Wake Forest, the college of our North Carolina\n brethren, and which has an endowment of nearly two hundred thousand\n dollars, was a direct outgrowth of Columbian University.\n</p>\n<p>\n When it is remembered that South Carolina Baptists encouraged and\n aided Jesse Mercer to pursue a course of study, it will not be regarded as\n wholly chimerical to assume that they had some influence in effecting\n the interest and part which he subsequently bore in establishing Mercer\n University.\n</p>\n<p>\n The first effort of the fathers was to introduce their young preachers\n into a course of polite learning.

It\n stirred up his pure mind by way of remembrance, and having assembled\n the whole congregation of the children of Israel together at Shiloh, he\n said unto them, \u201c How long are ye slack to possess the land which the\n God of your fathers hath given to you ?\u201d They should have marched\n forward, advancing their arms to the extremities of the promised possess-\n ion. It was all their own by divine grant, and they had only to seize it.\n When they entered Canaan they burned with zeal ; every day was dis-\n tinguished by some fresh triumph. They went forth conquering and to\n conquer. But their fervor soon cooled ; their courage soon failed ; and\n satisfied with an imperfect acquisition they laid down their arms and\n assumed them only when they became necessary for defence.\n</p>\n<p>\n My brethren, a like reproach attaches itself to the Christian world.\n When our Saviour had received all power in heaven and on earth for the\n purpose of spiritual empire, he said to his disciples, \u201c Go ye into all the\n world and preacb the Gospel to every creature.\u201d Thus clear and exten-\n sive was their commission. They were to subdue a rebellious globe to\n the obedience of the faith. This alone was to circumscribe and to termi-\n nate their exertions. The company of the publishers flew like angels,\n having the everlasting Gospel to preach to the inhabitants of earth.\n From Jerusalem they proceeded in all directions, like the lines of a circle\n from the center. Commencing in Judea, they soon spread over all Pal-\n estine, entered Asia proper, and soon reached Europe, and successively\n the banner of the cross was displayed in province beyond province, and\n in clime beyond clime. But alas ! instead of continuing their glorious\n career they halted, satisfied with their progress, and although the heathen\n were promised to Christ for an inheritance, and the uttermost parts of\n the earth for a possession, yet for fifteen centuries this vast domain was\n largely allowed to remain uncultivated under the reign of the prince of\n darkness. Till the close of the last century but little was done to illu-\n minate the benighted parts of our world.

Ten years after this they had their heralds of the cross not only\n among the icebergs of the Artie circle and under the scorching sun of\n the torrid zone, but also among the red men and black of America and\n the tawny sons of Asiatic heathendom. But what were these few devoted\n laborers amongst the perishing millions of earth ? At last, however,\n God\u2019s people were aroused from their slumbers, and on October 2, 1792,\n the Baptist Missionary Society in England, like the highest Alpine peak,\n caught the first rays of the rising sun, and was founded for the propaga-\n tion of the Gospel among the heathen. William Carey\u2019s memorable ser-\n mon, in which he elucidated the two points, \u201cAttempt great things for\n God,\u201d and \u201c Expect great things from Him,\u201d and which James Montgom-\n ery, the Moravian poet, characterized as \u201c a spark from the eternal\n throne, and destined to set the Christian world in a blaze,\u201d was largely\n instrumental in bringing this about. My brethren, it is an honor to our\n denomination of which we may well be proud that of the larger Chris-\n tian denominations we were the first in the missionary field. William\n Carey, the moving spirit under God in the formation of the society, went\n forth as its first missionary, and landed on the shores of India in June,\n 1793. In the closing years of the past century and opening years of the\n present, societies were formed in Europe and in our own land in connec-\n tion with almost every Christian denomination, whose missionaries have\n gone forth, and have been instrumental in reclaiming much territory from\n the prince of darkness, and pointing thousands upon thousands to the\n Lamb of God, & c. In July, 1813, Dr. and Mrs. Judson landed in Ban-\n goon, Burmah, and in June, 1819, Dr. Judson baptized the first convert.\n This was the beginning of the work of American Baptists in Asia. \u201cThe\n Baptist Missionary Union \u201d was organized in 1814. Ninety-four years\n have passed away since the first English, and seventy-four since the first\n American Baptist missionary entered India, and now what has been ac-\n complished ? From the census of British India, taken in 1881, we learn\n that 1,862,634 were classed as Christians. Within the seven years since\n this census was taken the Christian adherents have increased greatly. A\n learned native of India said a few years ago, \u201cChrist, and not the British\n Government rules India. England has sent us a tremendous moral force\n in the life and character of Jesus Christ to conquer and hold this vast\n empire. None but Jesus ever deserved this bright, this precious diadem,\n India, and Christ shall have it. If then, India is encompassed on all\n sides by Christian literature, Christian civilization and a Christian gov-\n ernment, she must naturally endeavor to satisfy herself as to the nature\n of this great power in the realm which is doing such wonders in our midst.\n She is unconsciously imbibing the spirit of this new civilization, and suc-\n cumbing to its irresistible influence. It is not the British army that de-\n serves any honor for holding India.

When will godly parents consecrate their Christian sons and\n daughters to missionary work as they search for rare openings of worldly\n influence and honor ? When will Christians give for Missions as they\n give for luxury and amusement ? When will they learn to deny them-\n selves for the Master\u2019s cause, as they deny themselves for such earthly\n objects as are dear to their hearts ? This world furnishes no other such\n important field for missionary operations as China. It is the largest\n heathen country in the world \u2014 larger than the whole of Enrope. How\n earnestly our fathers and mothers prayed for open doors to preach the\n Gospel. Their prayers have been heard on high, and now all China is\n open, inviting God\u2019s people to enter in and take possession of it for Christ.\n The minds of this numerous people are open to Christian effort. Multi-\n tudes are reading and hearing Christian truth and the annual accession\n of converts is rapidly increasing. Brethren can\u2019t we do more to give the\n bread of life to these famishing millions ? Shall we, by the grace of God,\n rise to the measure of duty, or shall we continue to be apathetic, dumb\n and inactive? Forbid it, O our zeal for the glory of God, and our love\n for the souls of men. While the city of New York has one Protestant\n minister for every 3,300 of its people, and Philadelphia one for every 1,800,\n China has one for every 858,834 of its people. What if there were but\n one minister for Philadelphia or New York ; and that is the condition of\n China relatively. Thirty-three thousand Chinese die every day with no\n hope in Christ. This is equal to burying all the people of Philadelphia\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0088/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 272}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0088/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 544}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0088/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1088}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0088/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2176}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0088/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4352}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0088/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/ic/al/sk/et/ch/00/so/ci/_0/historicalsketch00soci_0/historicalsketch00soci_0_0088.jp2", "height": 4352, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 794568}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"88\">\n<p>\n 86\n</p>\n<p>\n in less than one month.

The\n first Christian church was organized in 1872. The latest reports from all\n missionary societies working within the empire give 193 churches, with\n 324 male and female missionaries and 14,815 members.\n</p>\n<p>\n Southern Baptists have no missionary in that empire. In 1860 Breth-\n ren Rohrer and Bond, with their wives, were appointed by our Foreign\n Board to Japan. In August of that year they sailed from New York in\n the \u201c Edwin Forest,\u201d which to this day has never been heard of. Our\n northern brethren have 20 missionaries, 22 native preachers, 13 churches\n with 519 members. Last year 142 were baptized. The brilliant career\n of Japan since it was opened to intercourse with civilized nations has call-\n ed the attention of the world to it. Its progress during the past year has\n been even more rapid than before. The government of the leaders among\n the people seem in great haste to adopt the customs of the western na-\n tions. Many of the foremost men in the councils of the nation have been\n educated in Europe or America, and hundreds of the best young men of\n Japan are now being educated in these lands. The converts to Christi-\n anity every year are numbered by thousands, and the native churches are\n singularly self-reliant and self-helpful. It is emphatically the time of\n harvest, and the reaping is in proportion to the labors put forth. How\n truly marvelous is the work accomplished during the last 20 years, and\n yet Japan has only one Protestant missionary to every 116,879 of her\n population, which would be little over one to the entire population of our\n own State. If the people of God understand the signs of the times and\n enter with vigor into this broad harvest field there is hope that the new\n civilization of Japan will be a Christian civilization, and that they will be\n a people consecrated to Christ, directing their new-born energies to the\n salvation of the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Islands of the sea, too, are being moved. One group, the Sand-\n wich, to which the first heralds of the cross went in 1819f the people\n from cannibals have become a Christian people, with self-sustaining\n churches, which contribute of their means to send the gospel to others.\n A minister who had been a missionary in the New Hebrides for thirteen\n years, said a few years ago in reference to the murder, by cannibals, of\n Jno. Williams, the first missionary to Erromango, that he lately sat at the\n communion table with a brave Christian, who, when a boy, joined the\n cannibal feast on the body of Williams, and that the son of the very man\n by whose hands Williams was murdered, is now a gospel missionary.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the Fiji, one of the most wonderful transformations of the present\n century has taken place. Fifty years ago there was not in all Fiji a soli-\n tary Christian ; now there are over 104,000 converts ; 490 organized\n churches, and 49,240 scholars gathered into the Sunday schools. The\n Polynesian Islands are almost wholly Christianized. There are in these\n Islands 350,000 native Christians, who have their own organized churches,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0089/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 272}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0089/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 544}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0089/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1088}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0089/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2176}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0089/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4352}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0089/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/ic/al/sk/et/ch/00/so/ci/_0/historicalsketch00soci_0/historicalsketch00soci_0_0089.jp2", "height": 4352, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 866969}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"89\">\n<p>\n 8 ?\n</p>\n<p>\n support their own pastors and teachers, and are sending missionaries of\n their own to other heathen countries.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Society Islands have few European missionaries amopg them, but\n they have sixteen ordained native ministers, and more than two hundred\n unordained native preachers and teachers.

What increased\n hopefulness in the present indications of Providence for its evangeliza-\n tion. Daring explorers have entered its thick darkness and brought\n back intelligence with regard to its climate, soil, lakes, rivers, and its\n tribes with their habits of life and thought. The most powerful and enter-\n prising nations of Europe have enlisted in the work of making the country\n known to the world. Just as the Roman Caesars built the roads for the\n evangelists of Christ, so God has opened up by various agencies the heart\n of Africa to his people. The success of Stanley in crossing Central\n Africa, exploring the Congo and finding his way to the western coast\n through all opposing hindrances from hostile natives, and the perils of\n starvation, is an event which has stirred the hearts of all interested in\n the evangelization of that dark continent. How encouraging that amid\n sickness, suffering and death, God has blessed the labors of heroic men\n and women in that land. Thirty-two Missionary Societies are engaged in\n African mission work. There are reported over 200,000 Christians as\n the result of their labors. The Northern Baptists had 32 missionaries,\n 2 churches, 90 members ; 90 baptized in 1886. Southern Baptists are\n represented by four missionaries and their wives, with three native evan-\n gelists. There is a church membership of 138, with 284 pupils in the\n schools. Twenty-six were baptized last year. Bro. David remarks,\n \u201cThe results are not as great as in other fields, but the obstacles have\n been great; but blessed be God, many of them have been overcome, and\n the work has been pressed manifestly forward.\u201d Oh, how much territory\n in Africa yet to be wrested from the prince of darkness. How loudly\n the Macedonian cry of \u201cCome over and help us\u201d comes to us. Africa,\n poor, benighted Africa is not shut out from God\u2019s tender mercies. That\n tender heart to which is given \u201cAll power in heaven and in earth,\u201d has\n not shut even Africa out of its regards. Messiah\u2019s throne shall yet be\n established over all the earth. Africa with 200,000,000 of people, shall\n yet own Christ\u2019s sway.\n</p>\n<p>\n Madagascar a generation ago was a heathen land ; now it has 1,142\n evangelical churches, with 70,000 members, and 300,000 others under\n Christian influence. There are 890 schools, containing 50,000 pupils\n with Christian teachers.

Take Brazil in South America, a country 68,294\n square miles larger than our own. The Brazilians as a people are with-\n out the gospel. In the towns, though nominally Roman Catholic, the\n people for the most part are really infidels. In the country, Roman\n Catholicism and heathenism contend for predominance. Here is a coun-\n try almost at our very doors, to which the expense of transporting would\n be small ; a language which, to one acquainted with Latin, would be\n easily acquired, and as healthy as any country. Ought we not to take\n possession ot it for Christ. In all this vast empire we have only 11 mis-\n sionaries, and a church membership of 115. Seventeen were baptized\n last year. The reports from all our missionaries in Brazil speak very en-\n couragingly of the Lord\u2019s work, though they have been stoned and bit-\n terly persecuted by the Romanists. Other denominations are pressing\n into this interesting and inviting field, let us see to it that Baptists are\n not left behind.\n</p>\n<p>\n The religious revolution in Mexico during the last fifteen years is\n something wonderful. The connection between church and State has\n been abrogated ; $200,000,000 of church property has been confiscated ;\n monastic orders have been abolished, and the people, so ignorant that\n seven-eighths of them are said to be unable to read, have generally most\n gladly welcomed Protestant missionaries. The work accomplished in a\n few years by our untiring Powell and his consecrated band of faithful co-\n laborers is wonderful. \u201cIt is the Lord\u2019s doings, and is marvelous in our\n eyes.\u201d We have in Mexico 17 native and foreign missionaries; 21\n churches and stations ; baptisms last year, 100 ; church members, 350 ;\n pupils, over 100. Bro. Powell thinks ten new churches should be organ-\n ized. What a grand field for missionary operations, and at our very\n doors.\n</p>\n<p>\n Did time permit I would like to say something of the triumphs of the\n gospel in Cuba, in Italy, among the aborigines of Australia, the Tamboo-\n kies, Caff res and Hottentots of South Africa, and even among the Cal-\n mucks of Chinese Tartary. But I must desist. The whole world is open\n to the gospel. As a general statement in reference to what Protestants\n are doing to give the gospel to the heathen world, the following may be\n regarded as a fair approximation to the truth : Ordained missionaries, 3,-\n 500; female missionaries, 1,800; native helpers, 30,000 ; communicants,\n 620,000 ; annual receipts for Foreign Missions, $11,000,000. Not far\n from two and one-half millions of souls in heathen lands are receiving\n Christian instruction. From the extensive but very partial survey we\n have taken of the field, while we find much to cause our poor hearts to\n swell with gratitude to God, who hath done such wondrous things for\n perishing humanity, much to cause us to thank God and take courage, is\n it not true that \u201cthere remaineth yet much land to be possessed?\u201d Such\n was the fact with regard to the conquest of Canaan by Israel in the days\n of Joshua, and snch we have tried to show is the fact in respect to the\n triumphs of the gospel in this latter day of the world.\n</p>\n<p>\n Upwards of eighteen centuries have elapsed since it could be said,\n \u201cBehold a white horse, and he that sat on him had a bow ; and a crown\n was given unto him, and he went forth conquering and to conquer ;\u201d and\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0091/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 158, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 272}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0091/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 317, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 544}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0091/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 634, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1088}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0091/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1269, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2176}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0091/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2538, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4352}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:hi:st:or:ic:al:sk:et:ch:00:so:ci:_0:historicalsketch00soci_0:historicalsketch00soci_0_0091/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/hi/st/or/ic/al/sk/et/ch/00/so/ci/_0/historicalsketch00soci_0/historicalsketch00soci_0_0091.jp2", "height": 4352, "width": 2538, "levels": 6, "size": 810753}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"91\">\n<p>\n 89\n</p>\n<p>\n still \u201cThere reraaineth yet much land to be possessed.\u201d Not yet the\n voice is heard, \u201cThe kingdoms of the world,\u201d & c.

Oh, that all our\n people influenced by Christ\u2019s love would make a new departure in the\n cause of missions, and pray and give as becomes such a numerous and\n noble people. In the language of the venerable Dr. Duff, \u201cWe have been\n playing at missions.\u201d We profess to have consecrated our all to Christ\n and his cause, and yet we largely disobey the last command of our Lord,\n \u201cGo ye,\u201d & c. How often, as we look over a Christian congregation, do\n we see a single Christian lady wearing diamonds that would support a\n school or a missionary for a year. How many a Christian is spending on\n sheer luxury an amount that would confer countless blessings on the\n heathen world. Surely we are playing at missions. The women of Car-\n thage were not playing at warfare when they cut off their hair to make\n bowstrings for the defenders of the city.

Is it not high time that we ceased playing and began to be\n in earnest ?

The necessities of perishing\n souls call upon us to arouse ourselves and gird us anew for the battle.\n The triumphs already achieved should thrill our hearts, and cause us to\n press forward. Could I bring before you to-day representatives of every\n mission field, what a spectacle you would behold ! People of every na-\n tion under heaven, of every clime, of every color, of every rank and con-\n dition, would be present Ask them, what is it that causes their faces to\n beam with joy, and what unites them into one happy band, and they will\n tell you the name of Jesus. See how they greet one another, as if they\n were members of one family. Ask them, how is this? They all will re-\n ply, \u201cOne is our Master, even Christ, and all we are brethren.\u201d Listen ! for\n they are singing, and though the language of each differs, yet their voices\n blend in perfect harmony while they cry, \u201cSalvation to our God who sit-\n teth on the throne, and unto the Lamb.\u201d Such a sight would impel to\n greater fidelity, and would give us some idea of the last scene in the his-\n tory of man\u2019s redemption, when the curtain of time shall fall and the\n drama of this world be brought to its close. \u201cI beheld, and lo, a great\n multitude which no man can number, of all nations and kindreds and\n peoples, sood before the throne and the Lamb singing with a loud voice,\u201d\n \u201cWorthy is the Lamb that was slain, to receive power and riches, and\n strength, and honor, and glory, and blessing.\u201d \u201cHallelujah! hallelujah !\n for the Lord God Omnipotent reigneth.\u201d \u201cThe kingdoms of this world\n have become the kingdoms of
