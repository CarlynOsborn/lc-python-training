We\n were in Los Angeles and the day was very happily\n spent at the home of my niece and her father,\n Miss Grace Louise and William Mansfield.

Today, September 4, 1908,\n on his eighty-first birthday, we are in the home\n of devoted friends in Pasadena, Mr. and Mrs.\n Ceo. H. Curtis, and her father, Stillman S.\n Hitchcock. The kindness of this family can\n never be forgotten. Mrs. Curtis is one of the love\u00ac\n liest of characters, a faithful worker in our\n church and father and husband have gone hand\n in hand with her in all her good works. While\n so many of our contemporaries have passed over\n the silent sea, the few remaining ones are a great\n source of comfort to Dr. Deere, who lives so\n much in the past. One of the greatest enjoy\u00ac\n ments of his retrospective thoughts is the fact\n that all of the parishes he has fostered and been\n a faithful pastor of are in a flourishing condi\u00ac\n tion. Our cousins, Mr. and Mrs. Woodcock were\n with us in Pasadena, and helped to keep the\n light burning in the doctor\u2019s heart by their\n sweet sympathy. One of the pleasant features\n of our stay in Pasadena, 1908, was the uniting\n by the doctor in marriage on the 29th of August\n of two dear friends, Winfield C. Stone and Hattie\n Clark.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:au:to:bi:og:ra:ph:y0:0d:ee:r:autobiography00deer:autobiography00deer_0346/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 285, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 461}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:au:to:bi:og:ra:ph:y0:0d:ee:r:autobiography00deer:autobiography00deer_0346/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 570, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 923}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:au:to:bi:og:ra:ph:y0:0d:ee:r:autobiography00deer:autobiography00deer_0346/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1140, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1846}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:au:to:bi:og:ra:ph:y0:0d:ee:r:autobiography00deer:autobiography00deer_0346/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2280, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 3692}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:au:to:bi:og:ra:ph:y0:0d:ee:r:autobiography00deer:autobiography00deer_0346/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/au/to/bi/og/ra/ph/y0/0d/ee/r/autobiography00deer/autobiography00deer_0346.jp2", "height": 3692, "width": 2280, "levels": 6, "size": 356692}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"346\">\n<p>\n 316\n</p>\n<p>\n GEORGE H DEERE\n</p>\n<p>\n One thing I wish to mention, viz., his interest\n in the Greek, which increased instead of falter\u00ac\n ing, and I sometimes fear he may have sacrificed\n something to his continual absorption in it.

She is his slave. This degra\u00ac\n dation of woman is one of the most deplorable\n features in the social life of China. It is, how\u00ac\n ever, much less matter of despair when we know\n that a wife, who becomes a mother, rises to a\n position of honor and authority. She is then a\n queen, and her tenure of crown and scepter does\n not depend on her youth and beauty; but, on the\n contrary, the more faded and wrinkled with years\n the more secure is her sway, the more absolute\n her rule. Hence I have not only said that John\n should go home and marry, but that he should\n immigrate to our country, if he so choose, after his\n first child is born. Coming to this country with\n the mother of his child, he brings with him the\n strongest influence of the best womanhood known\n in his old home. And the Christian religion, with\n its grand ideal of the sanctity of pure woman,\n ought to be able to take him in hand and educate\n him, certainly in a few generations, to respect\n woman as his equal. This is the key which is to\n unlock his soul to the higher religion.\n</p>\n<p>\n G. H.
