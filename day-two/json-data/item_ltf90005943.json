In leaving, the ministers immediately inter\u00ac\n ested surrendered their pulpits and their manses\u2014and\n so far as the country parishes were concerned, their\n Itotnes. It was tlitn that the Free Church was estab\u00ac\n lished. But it does not seem to have been free enough to\n insure permanency. It held fast to the assertion that the\n State should support, but not dominate the Church. The\n Voluntary Church agitation exacted absolute and con\u00ac\n sistent separation of Church and State, a position com\u00ac\n batted by the Rev. L > rs. Chalmers. Candlish, and others.\n In the year 1847 two other bodies of the Presby\u00ac\n terian family, the United Secession, and the Relief,\n formed a union, and became known as the United Pres\u00ac\n byterian Church. Of course, the State support did not\n reach the Free Church, and it never abrogated the prin\u00ac\n ciple which favored what was known as non-intrusion\n on the part of the State. To its susteutation and its mis\u00ac\n sionary funds benefactions were made by the faithful, it\n !s presumed, or* the basis of the doctrines and policy de\u00ac\n clared by Dr. Chalmers, and other leaders at the time of\n the great Disruption. The agitation of Christian Union\n on evangelical lines which has for years filled the relig\n ious atmosphere all the world over, had its influence\n upon the Free Church and the United Presbyterian\n Church, both bodies developing gradually that mutual\n sympathy which was necessary to the proposition of\n unity in organization. So far as the record goes the\n Free Church never changed its attitude in regard to the\n duty of the State to support the Church, relying, doubt\u00ac\n less. upon the traditional practice of \" going on to perfec\u00ac\n tion,\u201d and old laws becoming obsolete. For once, this\n English practice in the matter of law appears, in this\n case, to have miscarried.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 190C* the Free Church and the United Presbyterian\n Church united their fortunes, and became one body,\n ecclesiastically known as the United Free Church. The\n spirit of Christian Union did not, however, enter into the\n hearts of a remnant of the clergy and elders of the Free\n Church. They were not content with the minority rule\n appertaining to church assemblies, and they, protested\n</p>\n<p>\n against the union and appealed to the Court of Session,\n</p>\n<p>\n . ... \u2022 \u2022 \u25a0\n</p>\n<p>\n claimiiig that they were the only genuine and rightful\n Free Church of Scotland, and were entitled to all that\n belonged to that uuseceded body. The Court of Session\n decided against the appellants. Thereupon the Free\n Church remnant carried their appeal to the House of\n Lords.. . The result is furnished in the full report of the\n \u2022 case herewith presented. .\n</p>\n<p>\n When the Free Church was organized in 1813 a depu\u00ac\n tation headed by the Rev. Dr. Willis, of Glasgow, visited\n the United States, and appealed to the churches here for\n assistance, an nppcgl which was generously responded\n to, and was greatly appreciated by the Scottish people\n generally beyond me limits of the Free Church. If the\n triumphant party in the present case push their claim to\n the dire extremity, it is riot at all improbable that the\n churches of this country will he presented with another\n opportunity of rendering, aid to tlie great sister Church\n which has been worsted by the decision of the British\n law Lords. To that end. the publication of the report of\n the case in this form is deemed of importance as a\n means of thoroughly enlightening the people of this\n country upon its details and its merits. Already inquiry\n as to the real meaning of the contest which has. so far,\n ended disastrously to the interests of the United Free\n Church, is earnest and persistent.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is sympathy with the United Free Church ex\u00ac\n pressed by many leading Church of Scotland men, and\n there is in the conduct of Christians of all denomina\u00ac\n tions in England and Scotland the tendency to enjoy the\n blessings of Christian Union in common.

In that year the minority raised an action to determine their\n legal position in respect of the funds and property of the Free Church, which had been claimed by the majority. The\n Second Division of the Court of Session (consisting of Lords Kingsburgh, Young and Travner) in effect affirmed Lord\n Low\u2019s decision, which had been reclaimed against, and pronounced a judgment adverse to the contentions of .the minor\u00ac\n ity, who then carried an appeal to the House of Lords.\n</p>\n<p>\n They submitted that the decision of the Court of Session should be reversed\u2014(1), because the union.with the\n United Presbyterians was one which could not lawfully be entered into to any civil effect against the dissent of any por\u00ac\n tion of the members of the Free Church or its General Assembly desiring to continue the organized, existence of the\n Free Church as a distinct religious association; (2), because the proceedings of the majority which terminated in the\n union involved a departure upon essential points from the principles and-doctrines of the Free Church as constituted\n in 1S43; (3), because the United Free Church was associated under a constitution which did not recognize, accept and\n provide for maintaining principles which were fundamental to the Free Church; (4), because the Constitution of the\n United Free Church contained in gremio provisions for alteration upon the distinctive principles ' and doctrines of the\n Church to an extent not contemplated by anything in the Constitution of the Free Church, and (5), because the appel\u00ac\n lants remaining associated under the forms of Presbyterianism maintained unimpaired and inviolate the whole principles\n and doctrines of the Free Church, and were lawfully entitled to participate in the property and funds devoted to that\n</p>\n<p>\n Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n The respondents, the United Free Church, met these contentions with the plea that as a body which maintained\n spiritual independence the Free Church, through a majority, had an inherent power to take the steps that culminated in\n the union, and that, therefore, the funds and property held in 1900 must belong to them.\n</p>\n<p>\n These were the questions in the main appeal, which appeared in the list of causes as the General Assembly jif the\n Free Church of Scotland v.

Toward the close of last year the two appeals were argued before the Lord Chancellor,\n ' \u2022 > .u Macnaghten, Lord Davey, Lord Shand, Lord Robertson and Lord Lindley.

Lord James of Hereford took the place of Lord Shand, and the\n Lord Chief Justice (Lord Alverstone) came in as an additional judge.\n</p>\n<p>\n By five to two, their lordships reversed the judgment of the Court of Session in both appeals. 1 he majority con\u00ac\n sisted of the Lord Chancellor, Lord Davey, Lord James, Lord Robertson and Lord Alverstone, and the minority favor\u00ac\n able to the views of the United Free Church consisted, of Lotf Macnaghten and Lord Lindley.\n</p>\n<p>\n ^\n</p>\n<p>\n The Case Stated by the Glasgow Herald.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is only because the finding of the House\n of Lords had leaked out that its decision in\n the Free Church case will nor cause almost\n universal surprise in Scotland If any one of\n the four Court of Session judges who have\n pronounced upon this ease had differed front\n h > s brethren, a reversal of their judgment\n might have been anticipated But the four\n were absolutely unanimous; one, indeed (Lord\n Young), asserted that the Free Church en\u00ac\n joyed a larger liberty than that conditional\n right of altering its constitution which the\n law lords have denied to the church. They\n were all as one in regard to the merits of\n the case. That, in these circumstances, the\n law lords should reverse the decision of the\n lord ordinary, which was confirmed by the\n Inner House, is not unprecedented, but it is\n so amazing that a very close examination of\n their decision is imperatively demanded. Tt\n Is none the less imperative when it appears\n ;bat, heads h.- ' ng counted, the majority ol\n 5 to 2 in the House of Lords in favor of the\n \" Remnar.r \" is more than counterbal\u00ac\n anced by the fact that four Senators\n of the College of Justice, including these\n two great intellects. Lords Young and\n Low, plus two law lords, make 4P\n a net majority of six in favor of the United\n Free Church To come to the point. It\n must strike every one, whatever his prepos\u00ac\n session may be, (hat the essential difference\n between the majority of the House of Lords\n and both houses of the Court of Session con\u00ac\n sists in the circumstance that the latter\n treated the property in dispute as the prop\u00ac\n erty of the Free Church at the moment of\n the union, whereas the five law lords re\u00ac\n garded it\u2014and based their judgment on the\n supposition-that the property was held in\n trust for certain specific \u2022.imposes, or rather\n under certain specific conditions Were\n not the five law lords with the possible ex\u00ac\n ception of Lord Davey. laboring under a de\u00ac\n lusion? There was no trust; there are no\n trust deeds of the kind assumed in the\n House of Lords to exist, As Lord Young\n put it, no such documents were placed be\u00ac\n fore the Court of Session, or alleged to be in\n existence. There was a trust, as there is\n at this moment, but it was constituted by\n the Free Church itself for the purpose of\n holding, legally, the property which it, as an\n unincorporated body, was incapable of hold-\n</p>\n<p>\n TUESDAY, AUGUST 2, 1904.\n</p>\n<p>\n ing. If the law lords are right, then, they\n must have founded upon a number of forms\n of bequest governing the expenditure of\n every penny of the church funds. No such\n form of bequest was produced in process,\n for the very good reason that there is noth\u00ac\n ing of the kind on which to build the fal\u00ac\n lacy which underlies their lordships\u2019 find\u00ac\n ings.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have no choice but to pass by the Lord\n Chancellor\u2019s elaborate argument oh the doc\u00ac\n trine of predestination and the tussle be\u00ac\n tween Calvinism and Arminianism. In fact,\n it was just as relevant as a disquisition on\n Bourignianism would have been. It had\n nothing to do with the ease, and it is safe to\n \u2022say that if profession of the \u201cbald, awful\u201d\n form of Necessitarianism which Lord Hals-\n bury reads into the Confession is a condi\u00ac\n tion essential to the holding of Free Church\n property, then a \u201cbald\u201d Necessitarian will\n have a very plausible ground for disputing\n ownership with the select body which has\n now been awarded the titles. It was a mere\n whim of the Lord Chancellor\u2019s to introduce\n this superfluous matter. What, then, shall\n be said about the handling of the true\n ground of action by the majority of the\n House of Lards? In a word, they differ from\n the Court of Session as to the \u201cessential-\n ness\u201d of the establishment principle. The\n Lord Chancellor, indeed, seems to say that\n every tenet of the Free Church of 1843 is\n essential, in the sense that, in order to hold\n the property in dispute, the members of the\n Free Church in 1900 must have agreed in\n regard to every point of doctrine and church\n government with the post-disruption church.\n But, like his brethren who supported his\n judgment, he treated the establishment prin\u00ac\n ciple in fact as essential By abandoning\n this principle, they contend, the Free Church\n lost its identity with the Church of the Dis\u00ac\n ruption. Well, on this head is it really nec\u00ac\n essary to do more than point out that\u2019these\n four Englishmen and one Scotsman differed\n from the four Scotsmen who heard the case\n iu the Court of Session? That is a rude,\n perhaps an impertinent opposition. But con\u00ac\n sider the facts. The four Court of Session\n judges, familiar with the working of the\n Scottish ecclesiastical mind and the develop\u00ac\n ment of Scottish ecclesiastical institutions\n</p>\n<p>\n from their youth up, and well aware of the\n long political logomachy which turned upon\n th? repeated disestablishment resolutions\n passed by the Free Assembly, were unani\u00ac\n mously of opinion that the establishment\n principle was never so fundamental or essen J\n tial a tenet of the Free Church that, once\n it was made an open question, a breaen\n in the continuity of the church\u2019s existence\n occurred. Their arguments are on record,\n and convinced the great majority of Scots\u00ac\n men, including most of those who. in the\n said political logomachy, had protested\n agginst the depar ture of the church from the\n first disruption position. Over against these\n arguments are now ranged, in the House of\n Lords\u2019 judgments, a number of inferences\n from documents like Dr. Chalmer\u2019s address,\n which were held to prove that the Free\n Church got its property on condition that\n it strove to all eternity, if need be, to have\n itself recognized as the true Church of\n Scotland Established.. Which of these two\n legal deductions from not very obscure facts\n is right? Our own opinion remains un\u00ac\n changed by the vast display of historical re\u00ac\n search made in the House of Lords yester\u00ac\n day.

We have no hesita\u00ac\n tion in saying that this is a positively mon\u00ac\n strous situation. The union is presumably\n indissoluble; dissolution is inconceivable.\n Even if the link were broken, it is evident\n that every man who came back to the Free\n Church would, as an essential condition of\n enjoying the use of any part of the property,\n have to forswear openmindedness about the\n Establishment principle, profess true-blue\n Calvinism, and one knows not what else.\n The question, then, resolves itself into one\n of compromise on very peculiar lines. It\n is unnecessary to say anything here about\n the spirit in which the subject of compro\u00ac\n mise should be approached, for we are well\n assured that the leaders on both sides are\n</p>\n<p>\n so alive to the gravity of the situation that\n they will absolutely ban recrimination.\n But given a disposition on either side to be\n amicable and divide the subjects in\n medico in a common-sense manner\u2014we\n refuse to believe that the Free Church\n could dream of sticking to the whole\u2014it is\n necessary to face the fact that legally the\n United Free Church cannot hold any of the\n property which the Free Church might con\u00ac\n ceivably be willing to hand over. Even if\n terms of the Union were altered so that only\n original Free Churchmen could enjoy the use\n of the funds brought in by the Free Church\n members, would not the same disability lie\n upon these original Free Churchmen so long\n as they did not abjure their Disestablishment\n heresy and their advanced views on Freewill\n and Necessity? Is the Free Church, again,\n legally capable of divesting itself of any part\n of the funds now vested in it by the House\n</p>\n<p>\n of Lords judgment? As at present advlseu\n we can see no legal exit from the impasse.\n If a division is made\u2014on terms, say. some\u00ac\n what more favorable to t ' > \u201cRemnant\u201d than\n those of the Rainy proposition\u2014then it will\n probably have to be on the understanding\n that no further legal action will be taken in\n dispute of the right of the United Free\n Church to hold the gift of their estranged\n brethren. It is impossible, however, to go\n further into this issue at the moment. What\n we are concerned about is the spirit in which\n the House of \u2019 \" ~ds judgment is to be ac\u00ac\n cepted, and we found a confident hope upon\n the Christian character and calling of the\n parties to the presumed compromise, further\n upon Lord James\u2019 earnest adjuration, and\n finally upon the declaration of last Free As\u00ac\n sembly that the \u201cspoils\u201d would be devoted\n somehow ' or other to the Christian purposes\n for which they w ' ere intended.\n</p>\n<p>\n .\n</p>\n<p>\n i v \\ ... \u2019 ' * x\n</p>\n<p>\n \u00ab \u2022 V *r I * f 4 * \u25a0- Jt t *\n</p>\n<p>\n The Case in the House of Lords.\n</p>\n<p>\n THE LORD CHANCELLOR ON BREACH OF TRUST.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Lord Chancellor said: My Lords, in\n this case the pursuers complain of a breach\n of trust, the trust being for the behoof of\n the Free Church of Scotland, and the breach\n of trust alleged being the use of certain\n property being, as alleged, no longer used\n for the behoof of the Free Church of Scot\u00ac\n land, but for the maintenance and support of\n another and a different body\u2014namely, the\n United Free Church. That body was formed\n in 1900 and consisted of a certain number of\n those who professed to belong to the Free\n Church of Scotland and others w ' ho, up to the\n time of the union, had belonged to the United\n Presbyterian body. They purported to unite\n and to exclude from their communion, or at\n all events from all participation in tbeir or\u00ac\n ganization, those who refused to unite in the\n new body, and have, of course, used the\n funds, of which they claim to be the bene\u00ac\n ficial owners, for the use of the new ' united\n body. This is the breach of trust complained\n of and the question is whether that com\u00ac\n plaint is well founded. Now, in one sense\n there can be no doubt what was the original\n purpose of the trust. It was for the mainte\u00ac\n nance and support of the Free Church of\n Scotland. What w ' as the Free Church of\n Scotland in 1843 can hardly admit of doubt.\n The reasons of those who then separated\n themselves from the Established Church of\n Scotland, which they then gave for their\n separation, are recorded with distinctness\n and precision and I do not think there can\n be any doubt of the principles and faith of\n those who came out from the Church of Scot\u00ac\n land and described themselves as the Free\n Church of Scotland. Their name was signifi\u00ac\n cant. They claimed to be still the Church of\n Scotland, but freed from the interference by\n the state in matters spiritual. It was by\n the persons thus describing themselves that\n funds in dispute were given and until the\n union in 1900 with the other body w ' e do not\n hear of any difficulty having arisen in the\n administration of the trust. Now, howeve\u2019, I\n the new body lias established a new organi- I\n zation. It is alleged to profess new doc\u00ac\n trines and its identity with the Free\n</p>\n<p>\n Church, for whose behoof the property w T as\n settled, is disputed, and it accordingly be\u00ac\n comes necessary to consider in w ' hat con\u00ac\n sists the identity of the body designated by\n the donors of the fund as the Free Church\n of Scotland. Speaking generally, one w ' ould\n say that the identity of a religious com\u00ac\n munity, described as a church, must consist\n in the unity of its doctrines. Its creeds, con\u00ac\n fessions, formularies, and so forth are ap\u00ac\n parently intended to ensure the unity of the\n faith which its adherents profess, and cer\u00ac\n tainly among all Christian churches the es\u00ac\n sential idea of a creed, confession of faith,\n appears to be the public acknowledgment of\n such and such religious view ' s as the bond\n of union which binds them together as one\n Christian community. If this be so, there\n is no lack of material from which to deduce\n the identity of the Free Church of Scot\u00ac\n land. Its founders left their claim, declara\u00ac\n tion and protest to stand for all time as a\n clear exposition both of their reasons for\n leaving the Church of Scotland, when they\n did leave it, and as a profession of their faith\n as the true Church of Scotland, though sep\u00ac\n arated from the Establishment, which, in\n their view, was itself heretical from its\n submission to the temporal power in what\n tney regarded as exclusively spiritual. Now,\n in the controversy which has arisen it is to\n be remembered that a court of law has noth\u00ac\n ing to do with the soundness or unsoundness\n of a particular doctrine, assuming there is\n nothing unlawful in the views held\u2014a ques\u00ac\n tion which, of course, does not arise here.\n A court has simply to ascertain what was\n the original purpose of the trust. My lords,\n I do not think w ' e have any right to speculate\n as to w ' hat is, or is not, important in the\n views held. The question is what w ' ere, in\n fact, the view ' s held, and what the founders\n of the trust thought important. Fortunate\u00ac\n ly, your lordships have the authority of most\n learned judges\u2014their decisions now reach\u00ac\n ing back for something like a century\u2014\n w ' hich I shall quote somewhat copiously as\n principles upon which such questions as are\n now in debate should be determined.

The\n first point in dispute Is very plainly set forth\n by the pursuers in the thirteenth conde\u00ac\n scendence. After pointing out in the tenth\n condescendence that the Free Church of\n Scotland was a voluntary association, or body\n of Christians associated together under a\n definite contract, involving the maintenance\n of definite principles, the condescendence\n proceeds thus:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cCondescendence 13. As already stated,\n one of the essential principles recognized\n by those who associated themselves to form\n the Free Church of Scotland, emphasized\n by their leaders in their utterances at the\n time of the disruption and embodied in the\n</p>\n<p>\n contract of association or constitution of\n said church as hereinbefore defined, is ' hat\n it is the duty of the civil magistrate to\n maintain and support an establishment of\n religion in accordance with God\u2019s Holy Word\n and the said church as originally associated\n recognized and maintained the propriety\n and advantage of the endowment of pastoral\n charges and and the promotion of religious\n education by the state. The principle of the\n duty of the recognition of religion by the\n State, by means of the establishment,\n and, where possible, endowment of a\n national church was, moreover, implicit\u00ac\n ly involved in the position claimed by\n the Free Church as being the Church of\n Scotland freed merely from the control of\n the civil courts in matters spiritual The\n said principle formed an essential principle\n of the Free Church of Scotland, and- its\n maintenance was\u2018one of the main reasons\n for the formation of that church as a sep\u00ac\n arate association or body of Christ ' ans, dis\u00ac\n tinct and apart from those who professed\n themselves to be \u201cVoluntaries. \" There were\n several such associations of seceders from\n the Established Church of Scotland iD ex\u00ac\n istence at the tir e of the Disruption of\n 1843, holding views practically identical with\n those of the founders of the Free Church in\n matters of doctrine and as to the encroach\u00ac\n ments of the civil courts, but differing from\n them as regarded the duty abovd referred\n to. In regard, to this, these bodies were\n \u201cVoluntaries \" in the sense of holding such\n action of the state to be unlawful. The\n foundation of the Free Church was a pro\u00ac\n test against the position of such churches\n on the one hand, just as it was against the\n encroachments of the civil power on the\n other. In reply to this, the defenders say\n the Confession of Faith does not contain,\n or set forth, the said alleged principle in\n respect to the rights and duty of the civil\n magistrate in regard ' o establishments ot\n religion as an article of faith, or doc.rine,\n or belief. T t teaches that nations and their\n rulers are bound to own the authority of\n Christian truth, but the Free Church has\n always held that the teach\u2019-; of the Con\u00ac\n fession in this matter is to he read and un\u00ac\n derstood In harmony with the principle\n (which the Confession also teaches) tba ' the\n Christian Church has an independent gov\u00ac\n ernment and jurisdiction in matters spir\u00ac\n itual distinct from the civil magistrate, and\n also in harmony with the view that the\n Confession is not to be accepted as favoring\n intolerance or persecution or interfering\n with liberty of conscience. The alleged\n principle as to the right and duty of the\n civil magistrate to maintain and support an\n establishment of religion has always been\n in the Free Church an open question, in re\u00ac\n gard to which liberty of opinion lias been\n permitted and exercised, and as to which\n wide differences of opinion have all along\n prevailed.\n</p>\n<p>\n In Favor of Pursuer*.\n</p>\n<p>\n These are the two contentions upon which\n the first part of the controversy depends, my\n lords.

Beware of compromising\n another of your doctrines or articles of faith,\n and in the defense of which the Church of\n Scotland did lately signalize herself over\n the authority of Christ over the Command\u00ac\n ments that they shall be called least in the\n Kingdom of Heaven. The men who stand\n opposed to us on this second, or as many\n choose to term it. this secondary, question,\n might with all the hay and stubble and wood\n of this, and it may be of other, errors be re\u00ac\n posing on the like precious foundation with\n ourselves.

We acknowledge the authority, and\n will submit to the influence of no other\n guide than His eternal and unalterable truth,\n as seen in the light of our own consciences.\n To be more plain, let me be more particular.\n The voluntaries we hold by the duty of gov\u00ac\n ernment to give of their resources and their\n means for the maintenance of a gospel min\u00ac\n istry in the land, and. we pray that their\n eyes may be opened so as that they may\n learn how to acquit themselves as the pro\u00ac\n tectors of the church, and not as its cor\u00ac\n rupters or its tyrants.

My lords, I am\n reluctant to render longer what 1 have to\n say by literal quotations from authoritative\n declarations of the Free Church, but though\n I summarize I am actually using the language\n which originally, and for a long period af\u00ac\n terward, those who spoke on behalf of the\n Free Church have said and written. The\n Free Church have said and written:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe Free Church has ever highly valued |\n her connection with the state.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cFirmly asserts the right and duty of the\n civil magistrate to maintain and support an\n establishment of religion in accordance with\n God\u2019s word.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThey reserve to themselves and their suc\u00ac\n cessors to strive by all lawful means to se\u00ac\n cure the performance of this duty.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe state was bound to establish and en\u00ac\n dow the church.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" The Free Church has not in the least de\u00ac\n gree altered its views respecting the lawful\u00ac\n ness and the desirableness of a right connec\u00ac\n tion between church and state.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHistory and experience have convinced us\n (the Free Church) that there is a form of\n alliance which is at once practicable and\n agreeable to Scripture and highly beneficial.\u2019 '\n</p>\n<p>\n My lords, I cannot doubt that each of the\n utterances I have quoted are important and,\n to my mind, conclusive evidence that origin\u00ac\n ally at all events the views of the founders\n of the trust were in favor of the establish\u00ac\n ment principle. The question whether they\n were fundamental or susceptible of beiug\n changed, demands a separate treatment,\n which, as it is applicable to both questions\n in debate, must be reserved for ' the present.\n Now the views of the United Presbyterian\n Church cannot bo more definitely or more\n shortly stated than ill their own language,\n authoritatively stated by themselves, and be\u00ac\n fore their union with the Free Church:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt is not competent,\u201d they say, \u201cto the\n civil magistrate to give legislative sanction\n to any creed in the way of setting up a civil\n establishment of religion, nor is it either his\n province to provide for the expense of the\n ministration of religion out of the national\n resources. It is Jesus Christ, as sole King\n and Head of His Church, who has enjoined\n upon His people to provide for maintaining\n and extending it by free-will offerings, that\n this being the ordinance of Christ it ex\u00ac\n cludes state aid for these purposes, and that\n adherence to it is the true safeguard of the\n church\u2019s independence.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In my view, what follows does not at all\n qualify this passage, but in fairness it ought\n to be added:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cMoreover, though uniformity of opinion\n with respect to civil establishments of re\u00ac\n ligion is not a term of communion in the\n United Presbyterian Church, yet the views\n on this subject held and universally acted\n</p>\n<p>\n upon are supposed to establish identity of\n religious belief, the one asserting the right\n and duty to maintain and support an estab\u00ac\n lishment of religion, the other asserting that\n Christ\u2019s ordinance excludes stale aid.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Each of them, therefore, treats the ques\u00ac\n tion as one of religious belief and obligation,\n and not one from which religious duties may\n be excluded.\n</p>\n<p>\n Tlie Calviiilstic r, t:il J rninian Doc-\n</p>\n<p>\n tri nes.\n</p>\n<p>\n The second question in debate is the differ\u00ac\n ence between the two bodies as to the two\n doctrines known as the Calviiiistlc and the\n Arminian doctrine of predestination. 1 use\n th-se two phrases subject to more ample\n exposition hereafter, in order to summarize\n what I have to say as preliminary to the\n discussion of the subject itself. I regret\n very much that wc have not any opinion\n from the learned judges whose judgment\n we are called upon to review. I am afraid,\n speaking for myself, I do not think it i3\n competent to me to avoid dealing with it.\n It is included in the allegation of a depart\u00ac\n ure lrom the doctrines which is complained\n of in the summons, and it has been argued\n before your lordships with great learning\n and ability. One observation made by the\n learned counsel I entirely agree to\u2014name\u00ac\n ly, that in discussing this subject one can\u00ac\n not ignore the contemporaneous theological\n discussion at the time of the Confession of\n Faith was compiled. Now, the doctrine in\n dispute was the subject of a copious amount\n of literature all through the seventeenth\n century. Looking, then, at the history of\n the particular dispute which is brought into\n debate, it cannot be said that the language\n of the Confession of Faith was lightly drawn\n or arrived at without long debate and delib\u00ac\n eration. Indeed, it may be said of the West\u00ac\n minster Confession as a w ' hole it was com\u00ac\n posed with a deliberate and careful scrutiny,\n which may be regarded as hardly equaled in\n any theological discussion, and though coun\u00ac\n cils of the church have lasted longer, if one\n regards the composition of the assembly\n itself, the original parties to the dis\u00ac\n cussion, the presentation of its diffi\u00ac\n cult portions to Parliament, the adop\u00ac\n tion of it by Parliament, and after\u00ac\n ward by the Church of Scotland, give these\n things an overwhelming sanction to it,\n and, at all events, to its original meaning\n by those w r ho were content to accept it. as\n a test of the unity of their religious belief.\n If this observation is true and applicable to\n the confession of faith as a whole (the mi\u00ac\n nute report of its deliberations has been de\u00ac\n ciphered by the distinguished director and\n principal librarian of the British Museum),\n the particular doctrine debated, as part of\n the code of belief which the Free Church\n adopted in 1843, and which it is alleged the\n United Free Church has abandoned, can\n hardly be said to be one which any Christ\u00ac\n ian church could regard as a matter of in\u00ac\n difference. It divided the Dutch Reformed\n Church at the beginning of the seventeenth\n century. It proved the subject of debate\n at The Hague in 1511, and at Delft in 1613.\n An edict of the States of Holland sought to\n put an end to the controversy, but in vain;\n and. finally, in 1619, ten years after the death\n of Arminius, or Kermanson, as was his real\n name, the Arminian heresy, as it was de\u00ac\n scribed, was publicly condemned. Its pro\u00ac\n fessors were denounced as liars and de\u00ac\n ceivers. and those who participated in it\n were deprived of their civil rights unless\n they retracted.

By the decree of God for the manm\n festation of His glory, some men and angels\n are predestinated iiHp everlasting life and\n others foreordained tc everlasting death,\n IV. These angels and men thus predesti\u00ac\n nated and foreordained are particularly and\n unchangeably designed, and their numocr is\n so ccriain and definite that it cannot be\n either increased or diminished. \"\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, then, for the act declaratory audit\n the Confession of Faith, made 26ih May,\n itsu.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThat this church also holds that till who\n</p>\n<p>\n hear the gospel are warranted and require!\n to believe in the saving of their souls, and\n that iu the ease of such as do not believe\n but perish in their sins the issue is due\n to their own rejection of the gospei call.\n That this church does not teach, and does\n not regard the confession as teaching, the\n foreordination of men to death irrespective\n of their own sin.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It has been argued with great ingenuity that,\n inasmuch as the doctrine of predestination,\n as treated of in the Scriptures, is a mys\u00ac\n tery, and that various opinions have been\n held iu respect of it, it cannot be made a test\n doctrine, since another doctrine may be held\n with it, not to human intelligence recon\u00ac\n cilable with it, but equally derived from, and\n established by. Scriptural authority. If the\n Scottish Church, or the Westminster Con\u00ac\n fession as. one of its declarations of doctrine,\n had simply declared that predestination was\n one of its doctrines there might he something\n in the argument, but the argument ignores\n the fact that the Westminster Confession\n purports to explain, and does explain, in lan \u00ac\n guage which does not admit ' of ' doubt what\n is meant. Each party well knew what they\n meant, ft is not a guestiou of metaphysical\n subtleties or ambiguous language. Each\n meant to exclude and denounce the doctrine\n of the other. I am therefore led to the\n conclusion that upon this second question the\n appellants are entitled to succeed.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Itighi to l hn < \u00bb\u00ab\u00ab > Pm lrini ' *.\n</p>\n<p>\n But, ray lords, another question is raised,\n which in one sense as affecting the law of\n trusts and their administration, is more im\u00ac\n portant than the abstract importance of either.\n The Dean of Faculty boldly argued for the\n inherent power of every Christian church to\n change its doctrines, and Lord Young has\n based his judgment upon this proposition.\n M > lords, apart from some mysterious and\n subtle meaning to be attached to the word\n \u201cchurch,\u201d and understanding it to mean an\n associated body of Christian believers, J do\n not suppose that anybody will dispute the\n right of any man, or any collection of men.\n to change their religious beliefs according\n to their own conscience. But when men sub\u00ac\n scribe money for a. particular object, and\n leave it behind them for the promotion of\n that object, their successors have no right\n to change the object endowed. In this case\n il is suggested that terms of what is called\n the Barrier Act suggest such license to\n change. 1 am not able to concur iu such\n an inference, It is obvious that, dealing\n with such a subject as fprmularies, . books\n of religious instruction, and the like, many\n things might he dope, written and taught\n which might touch doctrine, and for the pur\u00ac\n pose of preventing any alteration in doctrine\n the precautions insisted upon by the Barrier\n Act were thought necessary to prevent and\n render impossible any departure from tire\n orthodox standards. It provides that \u201cbe\u00ac\n fore any CJonera] Assembly of the church\n shall pass any acts, which are to be binding\n rules and constitutions to the church, the\n same acts be lirst proposed as overtures to\n the Assembly.\u201d Many things might be pro\u00ac\n posed which, as \u201cbinding rules and constitu\u00ac\n tions, might touch doctrine, or worship, of\n discipline, or government: but that the Church\n of Scotland in 1607 might change its faith,\n or permit it to be changed, is a suggestion\n whch to one acquainted with its history\n cither then or even a very long time after,\n is not very plapsihle. It is only just to\n Lord Young to say that he adds:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cI desire to say that there is, in my\n opinion, no rule of law to prevent a dissent\u00ac\n ing church from abandoning a religious doer\n</p>\n<p>\n trine of principle, however essential and\n fundamental, or from returning to it again\n with or without qualification or modification.\n Whether or not a property title is such that\n a forfeiture of property will follow such\n abandonment or return is another matter- \"\n</p>\n<p>\n Bui that is the whole question now befor ;\n your lordships, and as it appears to me\n there is nothing in calling an associated\n body a church that exempts it from the\n legal obligations of insisting that money\n given for one purpose shall not be devoted\n to another. Any other view, ir appears to\n me. would be fatal to the existence of every\n non-conformist body throughout the country\n Bui there is another and a further group-.!\n upon which I think the appellants are enti\u00ac\n tled to succeed, and that is that the so-called\n union is not really a union of religious be\u00ac\n lief at all. The united body has united in\n its organizations. It has established various\n administrative arrangements, has declared\n its authority as the United Free Church, and\n in that name was absorbed in the various\n bodies of the United Presbyterians and the\n Free Church as originally constituted. But\n has il agreed with the doctrines of either of\n them, and if so. what is it that has given\n way? My lords 1 am bound to say that after\n the most careful examinations of the various\n documents submitted to us I cannot trace the\n least evidence of either of them having aban\u00ac\n doned ' heir original views. It is not the\n case of two associated bodies of Christians\n in complete harmony as to their doctrine or\n to share their funds, but two bodies each\n agreeing to keep their separate religious\n views where they differed, agreeing to make\n their formularies so elastic as to permit those\n who accept them according as their respec\u00ac\n tive consciences will permit. Assuming, as\n 1 do, that there are differences of belief\n between them, differences are not got rid of\n by their agreeing to say nothing, about them\n nor are these essentially diverse views\n avoided by selecting so elastic a formulary\n as can be accepted by people who differ,\n and say that they claim their liberty to re\u00ac\n tain their differences while purporting to join\n in one Christian church. It becomes but a\n colorable union, and no trust fund devotol\n to one form of faith can be shared by an\u00ac\n other communion simply because they say in\n effect there are some parts of this or\n that confession which we will agree not |o\n discuss, and we will make our formularies\n such that either of us can accept it. Such an\n agreement would not, in my view, constitute\n a church at all, or. to use Sir William\n Smith\u2019s phrase, a church without a religion.\n Its formularies would be designed not to b?\n a confession of faith, but a concealment of\n such part of the faith as constituted au im\u00ac\n pediment to the union.

Speaking of the freedom\n of the church as to confessions of faith, he\n says;\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe art- not at liberty to hold forth a con\u00ac\n fession in which we do not believe, for, in\n such a case the church is absolutely without\n a confession, it. ceases to be either a bond\n of union or a public testimony. It is lawful\n for the church to revise her c-oufession and\n adjust it to her present attainments and\n exigencies.

This\n would certainly not be done by making for\u00ac\n malities ambiguous or elastic, or authoriz\u00ac\n ing Its votaries to put different meanings\n upon a set of words, the function of which\n is intended to be a test of the unity of their\n faith. That this is the principle upon which\n the so-called union has been arrived at is\n</p>\n<p>\n proved by the declaration of the united\n churches, in which they claim, in effect, to\n retain their own separate views, either in\n the United Presbyterian or in the Free\n Church, or in either of the bodies which\n originally composed the united body which\n afterward became the United Free Church-\n They say this:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c1. The Various matters of agreement be\u00ac\n tween the churches with a view to union are\n accepted and enacted without prejudice to\n the inherent liberty of the United Church as\n a church of Christ to determine and regu\u00ac\n late its own constitution and laws as duty\n may require in dependence on the grace of\n God and under the guidance of Hjs Word.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c3. As this union takes place on the foot\u00ac\n ing of maintaining the liberty of judgment\n apd action heretofore recognized in either of\n the churches uniting, so in particular it is\n j hereby declared that members of both\n j churches and also of all churches which in\n time past have united with either of them,\n j shall have full right, as soon as they see\n cause, to assert and maintain the views of\n truth and duty which they had liberty to\n maintain in the said churches.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n For these reasons I think the judgment\n ought to be reversed, and I so move, your\n J lordships; but I cannot conclude without ex\u00ac\n pressing how much we are indebted to learned\n counsel of both sides for their most able and\n learned argument.\n</p>\n<p>\n of the Case.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lord Macnaghten\u2019s View\n</p>\n<p>\n Lord Macnaglnen said My Lords, 1 am\n unable to agree in the conclusion at which\n jour lordships have arrived I do not diffep\n from any of your lordships as to the law,\n at least, 1 think not I accept the princi\u00ac\n ples laid down in this house in Craigdailie\n vs. Aikman. and the other cases referred to\n during the argument. I accept those prin\u00ac\n ciples loyally and entirely, however much\n 1 may err in their application. Every one,\n J thinkr must feel that the consequences of\n your lordships ' decision to-day for good or\n evil will be far reaching, and of momen\u00ac\n tous importance\u2014graver. I think, and more\n serious than the consequences of any de\u00ac\n cision in which it has been my lot to take\n part. And the argument addressed to your\n lordships has been worthy of the occasion.\n Let, after all, the question at issue is one\n of a very ordinary description. It is alleged\n on the one hand and denied on the other\n that there has been a breach of trust in the\n disposition of property The complaint is\n that funds contributed and set apart for one\n purpose bad been diverted to another and a\n different purpose. Such questions are of\n every-day occurrence, and the problem in\n each case must be solved by the. ordinary\n commonplace inquiry\u2014What was the pur\u00ac\n pose for whjch the funds in dispute were\n collected? What was the original trust?\n Tie funds now in question in the present\n case represent moneys contributed for the\n support of the Free Church of Scotland.\n They represent property dedicated to the\n use of the church body or voluntary asso\u00ac\n ciation of professing Christians founded by\n those ministers of the Established Church of\n Scotland, who. in 1*43. on the memorable oc-\n cpsiepn known as the Disruption, withdrew\n from the establishment, or. according to\n their owr. view of the \u2019.transaction, separ\u00ac\n ated from the State, carrying with them the\n greater part of the office-bearers of the Es\u00ac\n tablished Church, and at least ope-half of\n her members in. full communion, asserting\n a|l the while for themselves and their fol\u00ac\n lowers in time to ,-ome the character of the\n ancient and true Church of Scotland. Set\u00ac\n ting forte, with these lofty pretensions, they\n declared their adherence ' to the principles\n and practice of the Church of Scotland as\n regards doctrine, worship, discipline and\n government, untrammeled and unfettered by\n connection with the State, and purged of\n e\\cry taint ui Erastiauism.\n</p>\n<p>\n Tlie Heal ami Only Question.\n</p>\n<p>\n The question therefore seems to me to be\n this, Was the Church thus purified\u2014the Free\n Church\u2014so bound and tied by the tenets of\n the Church of Scotland prevailing at the\n time of the Disruption that departure from\n those, tenets in any matter of substance\n would be a violation of that profession or\n testimony which may be called the un\u00ac\n written charter of her foundation, and so\n necessarily involve a breach of trust in the\n administration of funds contributed for no\n other purpose but the support of the Free\n Church\u2014the Church of the Disruption\u2014was\n the Free Church, by the very condition of\n her existence, forced to cling to her\n subordinat e standards with so desperate a\n grip that she has lost hold and touch of the\n supreme standard of her faith? Was she\n from birth incapable of all growth and de\u00ac\n velopment? Was she (in a word) a dead\n branch and not a living church? This. I\n think, is the real and only question. But,\n i? I may venture to say so without offeuse,\n it has been rather pushed aside and ob\u00ac\n scured by a very interesting preliminary\n search after a principle, if it be a principle,\n called, for the sake of convenience, and not,\n 1 think, for the sake of clearness, \u201cthe Es\u00ac\n tablishment principle.\u201d which, in my hum\u00ac\n ble judgment, partakes rather of the elusive\n attraction of an ignis fatuus. which means\n much or little, just as you may choose to in\u00ac\n terpret. one of the most obscure passages in\n in Westminster Confession, which in one\n aspect no Christian man. 1 think, or very\n few, would hesitate to accept, but, which, in\n fire mouth of an adherent of the church\n that has abandoned Establishment and\n separated from the State, can only mean a\n counsel of perfection, unattainable in this\n world, at least until the advent of the\n millennium. Your Lordships have been\n furnished with a print of many Scottish\n statutes and a bulky volume containing the\n Acts of the General Assembly of the Church\n of Scotland. I have read these documents\n and many others. to which the attention of\n the House was directed, with much interest\n and ' soihe care. I can only say that they\n have confirmed me in the opinion I enter\u00ac\n tained at the conclusion of the first, argu\u00ac\n ment\u2014no doubt erroneously\u2014that the judg\u00ac\n ment under appeal was right and ought, to\n i be affirmed. 1 do not propose to trouble\n</p>\n<p>\n your Lordships by tracing the history of\n the Church of Scotland in its connection\n with the State from the date of the first\n Rcformaiion to the time of the Disruption.\n That was done very ably and fully by the\n learned counsel at the bar. It is enough\n for me to say that during the whole period\n of the existence of the Church of Scotland\n there was a constant assertion of spiritual\n independence of the right, as it was termed,\n of the Lord Jesus to reign in bis own house,\n r will only give one instance\u2014I might give\n many\u2014and I will give an instance that oc\u00ac\n curred almost on the eve of the Disruption.\n On the 23d of May. 1838. the General Assem\u00ac\n bly of the Church of Scotland passed this\n resolution, which is called \u201cResolution\n auent the Independent Jurisdiction of the\n Church of Scotland\u201d:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe General Assembly, having heard and\n considered the overtures on the independent\n jurisdiction of the Church of Scotland, agreed\n by a majority to the following resolution;\n \u2018That the General Assembly of the Church\n of Scotland, while they unqualifiedly acknowl\u00ac\n edge the exclusive jurisdiction of the civil\n courts in regard to the civil rights and emol\u00ac\n uments secured by law to the church and\n ministers thereof, and will ever give and in\u00ac\n culcate implicit, obedience to their decisions\n there anent, do resolve that, as is declared in\n the Confession of Faith of this National Es\u00ac\n tablished Church, the Lord Jesus, as King\n and Head of His church, hath therein ap\u00ac\n pointed a government in the band of church\n officers distinct front the civil magistrate,\n and that in all matters touching the doctrine,\n government, and discipline of this church her\n judicatories possess an exclusive jurisdic\u00ac\n tion. founded on the Word of God, which\n power ecclesiastical (in the words of the\n second Book of Discipline) flows immediately\n from God and ifio Mediator, Jesus Christ,\n and is spiritual, not having a temporal head\n on earth but only Christ, the only spiritual\n King and Governor of His kirk, and they do\n further resolve that this spiritual jurisdic\u00ac\n tion, and the supremacy and sole Headship\n of; the Lqyd Jesus Christ, on whjfch it de\u00ac\n pends, they w}ll assert, and at a|l hazards\n defend, by the help and blessing of that great\n God, who in the days of old enabled their\n fathers, amid manifold persecutions, to\n maintain a testimony even to the death for\n Christ ' s Kingdom and Crown; and finally that\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0014/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 193, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 281}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0014/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 387, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 562}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0014/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 775, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1125}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0014/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2250}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0014/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3103, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4500}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0014/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ot/ti/sh/ch/ur/ch/ap/00/gr/ea/scottishchurchap00grea/scottishchurchap00grea_0014.jp2", "height": 4500, "width": 3103, "levels": 6, "size": 1169925}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"14\">\n<p>\n 12\n</p>\n<p>\n THE SCOTTISH FREE CHURCH CASE\n</p>\n<p>\n they will firmly enforce submission to the\n same upon the office-bearers and members\n of this church by the execution of her laws\n in the exercise of the power ecclesiastical.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n An Exclusive Jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus, while the church was in connection\n with the state, she tool* upon herself to de\u00ac\n clare emphatically that what she claimed\n was nothing less than an exclusive jurisdic\u00ac\n tion. founded on the Word of God, in all\n matters touching the doc.trine as well as. the\n government and discipline of the church.\n The fact that this resolution was passed by\n a majority shows that it was carried by the\n vote of the party which five years later went\n out as the Free Church. During the period\n when the church which had passed through\n the furnace of two- reformations was ap\u00ac\n proaching her last and greatest trial, there\n grew up in the church two parties\u2014the Mod\u00ac\n erates and the Evangelicals. It was to the\n Evangelicals in later days that the Free\n Church of Scotland owed her separate ex*\n istence. For a long time the Evangelical\n party was in a minority, and matters then\n went on tolerably smoothly between church\n and state. Ultimately the Evangelicals\n gained the ascendency. They were the party\n of progress, reform and church extension.\n They planted religion in remote and half-\n civilized districts in Scotland. They founded\n missions in all parts of the world. Their\n zeal and fervor were, as their adherents\n boasted, in striking contrast to the apathy\n and lukewarmness of the Moderates. When\n they bpcanie the dominant party they carried\n matters with a high hand. They passed acts\n in the Assembly\u2014the veto act and the chapel\n act\u2014which were altogether beyond the com\u00ac\n petence of the church as established by law.\n They censured and deposed ministers who\n obeyed the decrees of the Court of Session.\n They held those decrees to be encroachments\n on the true liberties of the church, and ac\u00ac\n tually pronounced them illegal. The state\n refused to admit - their claims. The strong\n arm of the law restrained these extrava\u00ac\n gances. They maintained that their pro-\n , ceedings were justified and required by\n the doctrine of the headship of Christ,\n which was common to all the Reformed\n churches, but to which they attached\n peculiar- and extraordinary significance.\n Then.came the Protest of 1842\u2014\u201cThe Un\u00ac\n answered and Unanswerable Protest,\u201d as\n they called it. It w ' as followed by a cold and\n chilling reply from the government in\n power, and then it became evident to all\n thinking men that, as the state would not\n give way, the leaders of the Assembly and\n those W\u2019ho adhered to them would have to\n retract their pretensions and own defeat, or\n quit the Establishment altogether. ' No one\n who knew the courage and temper of the\n leaders of the Assembly, no ' one w r ho had\n caught the note of defiance or triumph\n sounded by Dr. Chalmers at the close of the\n Edinburgh Convocation, could doubt what\n the issue would be.\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr, Chalmers\u2019 Sermon.\n</p>\n<p>\n And now, in passing, I would call your\n lordships ' attention to one fact., which\n seems to me. not unworthy of notice, when\n Dr. Chalmers\u2019 sermon, preached before the\n first Free Church Assembly, is relied upon\n as a sort of prospectus on. the faith of\n which the funds of the Fr < \u00bbe Church were\n collected, as, if the Free Church were a l\n joint stock concern and that sermon an in\u00ac\n vitation to the public to put their, money\n in it. Months before the disruption actually\n took place, when all Scotland was looking\n</p>\n<p>\n forward with feverish anxiety to the last\n act of the drama, the Evangelical party,\n with Dr. Chalmers at their head\u2014a great\n divine and an eloquent preacher, who had a\n w ' onderful faculty for organization and some\u00ac\n thing of the genius of a statesman\u2014set\n about collecting funds for the needs of the\n church.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBefore the meeting of the General As\u00ac\n sembly\u201d\u2014I am now quoting a book which,\n I believe, is of recognized authority\u2014\u2018\u2018the\n members of the popular party had arranged\n their course of proceeding. Associations\n were formed throughout the whole of Scot\u00ac\n land, and subscriptions w\u2019ere collected for\n the purpose of building churches and pro\u00ac\n viding a maintenance for the ministers who\n were soon to lose the benefits of the Na\u00ac\n tional endowment. Dr. Chalmers presided\n over the General Finance Committee, and\n acted with an energy and success w ' hich\n amazed even those who had best known his\n labors for a similar purpose in the cause of\n the Establishment. The thousands of cir\u00ac\n culars w\u2019hich he dispersed bore the follow\u00ac\n ing mottoes:\u2014\u2018Surely I will not come into\n the tabernacle of my house. nor go up into\n my bed, I v.-ill not give sleep to my eyes\n nor slumber to mine eyelids, until I find a\n place for the Lord, an habitation for the\n mighty God of Jacob, the God of Heaven.\n He will prosper us; therefore we His serv\u00ac\n ants will arise and build.\u2019 That w\u2019as the\n origin of the fund, those were the winged\n messengers by w ' hich the ground was pre\u00ac\n pared and the good seed sown. And when\n the disruption took place, and when appeals\n w\u2019ere made in every parish, in every nook\n and corner of Scotland, calling upon the\n people to stand by the church of their fore\u00ac\n fathers. denouncing the tyranny of the state,\n describing in harrowing terms the sufferings\n of ministers, old and young, driven from\n their homes with their wives and children,\n and forced to seek shelter in sheds and hov\u00ac\n els, while they faithfully ministered to their\n flocks, some of them actually dying of want\n and exposure, money came in abundantly\n in answer to the call.\u2019.\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Chalmers\u2019 sermon to the first Free\n Church Assembly wms but one of a thousand,\n I might say of a million, similar discourses.\n It was eloquent, of course; it was stirring.\n But I rather take leave to doubt whether the\n warning that I find there against voluntary\u00ac\n ism and against anarchy\u2014an evil, as the\n preacher truly says, more to be dreaded\n than voluntaryism\u2014was very stirring, or\n likely of itself to evoke a generous re\u00ac\n sponse. The negation of dangerous princi\u00ac\n ples does not, as a rule, rouse enthusiasm.\n Of what is called the establishment principle\n as a tenet or opinion of the Free Church I\n shall have a word to say presently; all I\n want to impress upon your lordships at this\n moment is that when that sermon was\n preached by Dr. Chalmers, on an occasion\n more eloquent and more stirring than any\n appeal in words could be, the fund was\n already in full swing.\n</p>\n<p>\n Object of the Fnnds.\n</p>\n<p>\n Then, for whom and with w\u2019hat purpose\n was that money collected? Except as re\u00ac\n gards sums devoted to special purposes and\n special objects the fund w-as all one fund.\n It was collected for the needs of the Free\n Church of Scotland; and what was the Free\n Church? Did it go out as a sect, of a per\u00ac\n suasion, or a connection, , with peculiar\n tenets cut and dried and defined in the pre\u00ac\n cise language of a conveyance? Nothing of\n the kind. Those tvho went out went, forth\n declaring that they were not a sect, but the\n</p>\n<p>\n national church, and that they were still thq\n Church of Scotland.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe arc,\u201d they said (to quote the words of\n Dr. Candlish, one who was only second\u2014\n if he was second\u2014to Dr. Chalmers himself)\n \u201cWe are still the Church of Scotland, the\n only church that deserves the name, the\n only\u2019 church that can be known and recog\u00ac\n nized by the maintaining of those princi\u00ac\n ples to which the Church of our fathers was\n true w\u2019hen she was on the mountain and on\n the field, when she was under persecution,\n when she was an outcast from the world.\n And believing that we are not seceders from\n the church, but are the church separated from\n the state, believing that we are not a sect\n separated from the Established Church, but\n that we are the Church of Scotland separat\u00ac\n ed from the state, we hold ourselves en\u00ac\n titled, without any disparagement to other\n religious bodies, to assume and act upon\n the principle that we are to maintain the\n character of the national church of Scot\u00ac\n land.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n An impossible position, it may be said, in\n point of law; they went out not as a church,\n but as individuals separating from the church,\n and they united again in a voluntary body ol\n professing Christians. That may be so. But\n to themselves and to their adherents, and. I\n may add, to other religious bodies which\n were not of their communion, they supported\n the character of the National Church of Scot\u00ac\n land, and supporting that character which\n they assumed, rightly or wrongly, they must\n be taken, 1 think, in regard to their own\n body to have all the powers of a national\n church. Speaking for myself, I cannot form\n a conception of a national church untram\u00ac\n meled and unfettered by connection with the\n state which does not at least possess tne\n power of revising and amending the formulae\n of subscription required of its own office\n bearers and the power of pronouncing au\u00ac\n thoritatively that some latitude of opinion i\u00a3\n permissible to its members in regard to mat\u00ac\n ters, which, according to the common appre\u00ac\n hension of mankind, are not matters of faith.\n</p>\n<p>\n I agree that a sect may erect any point or\n any punctilio, however trifling and absurd it\n may be, into an article of faith.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Establishment Principle.\n</p>\n<p>\n My point is that the Free Church were not\n a sect and that they never made the Estab\u00ac\n lishment Principle an article of faith. But,\n my lords, I go farther. This Establishment\n Principle, whatever it is, can have no higher\n authority than the article of the Westmin\u00ac\n ster Confession, in which it is supposed to\n be embedded. If the church has power to\n amend her confession she can. of cour-se,\n take occasion to declare that the Establish\u00ac\n ment Principle is to be regarded as an open\n question in reference to which every man is\n at liberty to exercise his private judgment.\n Now\u2019, it seems to me clear that the Free\n Church, when it came into existence, claimed\n the power of altering and amending her con\u00ac\n fession of faith.

Mr. Taylor\n Innes, in his valuable work on the Law of\n Creeds in Scotland, quotes from it as a book\n of authority, but speaks of it as an intense\u00ac\n ly polemical volume. So it is. From be\u00ac\n ginning to end It attacks and flouts and be\u00ac\n littles the Established Church, but the very\n bitterness of its tone shows that it \\yas\n composed in the earliest days of disruption,\n and 1 will not weary your lordships by\n quoting from it at any length, but I may\n remind your lordships that it points out\n that the Church of Scotland as a Church in\n its own authority adopted the Westminster\n Confession, and that at the very time when\n Knox ' s Confession had the sanction of the\n state. The catechism deals at some length\n with Church power. It explains that this\n power is the power of the Keys. It de\u00ac\n clares that it is divided into four parts, and\n that the first part is the dogmatic power in\n virtue of which the doctrine of the Word is\n declared and religious controversies are\n determined. It asks, \u2018When is the dogmatic\n power abused?\u201d The answer is, \" When it is\n made the pretext for a claim of infallibility\n and employed to subvert the right of pri\u00ac\n vate judgment, and w ' hen the implicit sub\u00ac\n mission which is due only to the Word is\n demanded for Church formularies and de\u00ac\n vices. \" In an earlier passage in a note\n quoted by Mr. Taylor Innes there is a sly\n hit at the Established Church and a sharp\n contrast drawn between the Evangelistic\n party and the view r of the Moderate party\n as to the position of the Church, not alto\u00ac\n gether, I need hardly say. to the advantage\n of the latter. \" It is one thing,\u201d say the\n authors of the Catechism, \u2018\u2018for the civil\n privileges and endowments of a church to\n be tied to a Confession by civil enactments\u201d\n (that was the contention of the Evangelists),\n \u201cand quite another thing for a church itself\n to be so\u201d (that according to their catechism\n w : as the servile bondage of the established\n church). \u201cIn the former case the church,\n when she finds that any articles of her con\u00ac\n fession are unscriptural, is at liberty to re\u00ac\n nounce them, being only bound if she do not\n resign her temporalities. In the latter case\n the law allows no relief whatever for the\n church in her corporate capacity when she\n discovers errors in her confession, which, of\n course, is as much as to say that the church\n is bound always to go absolutely upon the\n supposition of its soundness and to interpret\n the word of God agreeably to its declarations.\n Under these circumstances the supreme and\n ultimate standard of doctrine is not the\n Bible, but the confession of faith.\u201d My\n lords, I greatly fear that is the position into\n which the Free Church will be driven if Mr.\n Johnstone\u2019s argument prevails. I could\n easily multiply quotations from this Free\n Church catechism, but I think I have quoted\n enough to prove that to followers of the\n Free Church movement the notion of alter\u00ac\n ing the Westminster confession of faith was\n not so very shocking. If the view which\n I have roughly indicated is correct, I think\n it is enough to dispose of this case in both\n its branches. But there are two points on\n which a great deal of argument was be\u00ac\n stowed, and on which I should like to say a\n few words. There is the establishment prin\u00ac\n ciple, as it is called, and there are those\n higher mysteries which were dealt with\n boldly but reverently by the learned counsel\n who spoke second for the Free Church. As\n regards the establishment principle I know\n that that very distinguished man to whom\n</p>\n<p>\n I I have already referred, and who, a.ter Dr.\n j Chalmers, was the leader of the Free Church,\n</p>\n<p>\n ! doubted to the last whether the prin\u00ac\n ciple of a national establishment of religion\n was a principle at all. He maintained that\n throughout the whole of the church\u2019s history\n there was no event that proclaimed formally\n and directly that the principle of a national\n establishment of religion was a vital prin\u00ac\n ciple which the church was bound to main\u00ac\n tain. Speaking for myself, I do not alto\u00ac\n gether take that view. I think it must be\n j admitted that the establishment principle, as\n it may be gathered from the somewhat ob\u00ac\n scure language of the Westminster confes\u00ac\n sion, was the generally received opinion in\n the church. It was necessarily the received,\n though unexpressed, opinion of the church\n before the disruption. When the disruption\n took place circumstances were altered, and\n then, I think, there was a diversity of opinion\n 1 on the subject,\n j Dr. ( aml 1 ish\u2019x Opinion.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lord Trayner says that it appears to him\n ! \u201cdifficult to hold that a mere opinion as to\n ! what \u2018some third person was bound to do,\n i which he might neglect or refuse to do, and\n | wTtich the church would not compel him to\n | do, could in any way be an essential part of\n I the constitution of the church which held\n I that opinion.\u201d Well, that was exactly Dr.\n</p>\n<p>\n | Candlish\u2019s opinion at the very time of the\n</p>\n<p>\n I disruption. I refer to his opinion not as\n to the opinion of a person authorized to\n</p>\n<p>\n \u25a0 speak on behalf of the church, but as the\n opinion of a very leading man, whose opin\u00ac\n ion a great many others would probably fol-\n j low. At the General Assembly held in Glas-\n I gow in the autumn of the year of the dis\u00ac\n ruption, Dr. Candlish, speaking about the\n establishment principle, and pointing out\n that the refusal of the state to establish the\n church on the only terms to which the\n</p>\n<p>\n church would consent, left them a great de\u00ac\n gree of liberty as to the terms on which\n they should stand with other churches, put\n the case thus:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIs the division and schism of the Chris\u00ac\n tian church to be kept up by a question as\n to the duty of another party over whom we\n have no control? Let it be that we main\u00ac\n tain our different opinions as to the duty\n of the state to support the church, and the\n duty of the church to receive support from\n the state when it is given consistently with\n j spiritual freedom; still shall that question\n which has become a mere theoretical ques\u00ac\n tion in the church of Christ, and which, so\n far as we can judge, seems destined to be a\n mere theoretical question till the time when\n the kingdoms of this world shall become the\n kingdoms of our Lord and of His Christ,\n shall that question prevent cordial co-opera\u00ac\n tion and harmony among ourselves and our\n united action in defense of one common\n Protestantism against one common foe?\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n I have no doubt that the opinions which\n Dr. Candlish expressed so eloquently at the\n time of the disruption must have been held\n by many adherents of the Free Church, and\n as time went on, and the splendid voluntary\u00ac\n ism of the Free Church, on a basis and a\n scale never\u2019before understood or attempted,\n placed the Free Church on a level with the\n Established Church at home, and in a posi\u00ac\n tion certainly not inferior as regards mis\u00ac\n sionary labors abroad, the natural tendency,\n I think, even among those who were dis\u00ac\n posed to regard the establishment principle\n as a sacred principle (if any such there\n were) must have been in the direction of the\n conclusion that the Church of Scotland,\n</p>\n<p>\n whether established or free, could exist not\n only without an establishment, but even\n without, the profession of the establishment\n principle.\n</p>\n<p>\n Establishment a .Small Question.\n</p>\n<p>\n Speaking for myself, and with the utmost\n deference to the great majority from whom I\n have the misfortune to differ, I think this\n question about the establishment principle\n is a very small question, indeed, and that It\n occupied a great deal too much of the argu\u00ac\n ment, to the exclusion of far weightier mat\u00ac\n ters. I cannot call the matters that were\n discussed by Mr. Haldane small or insignifi\u00ac\n cant. They are mysteries into which I do\n not think it is our province to intrude, and,\n speaking for myself, I am not quite sure\n that at the conclusion of Mr. Haldane\u2019s ar\u00ac\n gument I had gained a clearer insight into\n these matters than I had before. At any\n rate, 1 am happy to think that it is not nec\u00ac\n essary to enter into these questions at all.\n</p>\n<p>\n Power of Church to Relax Formulae.\n</p>\n<p>\n If the church has power to relax the\n \u2022stringency of the formulae required from the\n i ministers and office bearers so as to avoid\n j offense to the consciences of the ' most eon-\n I scientious, and to keep within her fold the\n i most able and enlightened of her probation-\n | ers, that is all that is required. That she\n j ha.s that power I cannot doubt. These form-\n ! ulae were imposed by act of Parliament. If\n they owe their force and efficiency to the\n Established Church, to acts of Parliament,\n the Free Church has rejected the ordinances\n of men and the authority of Parliament, and\n is free to regulate her own formulae. If in\n the Established Church they owe their force,\n wholly or in part, to the antecedent recogni\u00ac\n tion of the church, the Free Church, as it\n seer*\u00ab to sie, claiming to act, and recognized\n by her adherents as acting, in the character\n of a national church, and proceeding regu\u00ac\n larly in accordance with the constitution of\n the church, may do now what the church did\n in the seventeenth century.\n</p>\n<p>\n United Free Church Has Preserved\n | Identity.\n</p>\n<p>\n Owing to the vast importance of the case,\n end the. very .able and learned arguments,of\n the learned counsel at the bar, I have\n thought it right to state, in my own lan\u00ac\n guage the reasons which have led me to the\n opinion I hold. Under ordinary circum\u00ac\n stances, I should have been content to ex\u00ac\n press my concurrence in the opinions deliv\u00ac\n ered by the learned judges in Scotland, ana\n specially with the opinions of the Lord Or\u00ac\n dinary and Lord Trayner. It is impossible,\n ir. my opinion, to overrate the importance of\n the issue awaiting decision. I do not agree\n with the learned counsel for the appellants\n that the United Free Church is a change\u00ac\n ling, a creation of a composite nature with\n a double face and two voices. Though the\n name is slightly altered, I think the Free\n Church has preserved her identity. I think\n she is entitled to as much respect, I had al\u00ac\n most said as much veneration, as when she\n went forth, casting off for conscience sake\n the fetters and advantages of state\u2019 con\u00ac\n nection. I do not think she has forfeited\n any of her rights by receiving into her bos\u00ac\n om a Reformed and Presbyterian church,\n one with her in faith, in baptism and all es-\n sential points of doctrine; and, for my part,\n I should hesitate long before I w r ould give\n my voice for a decision which will help, or\n at any rate direct, her to subordinate the\n Scriptures to the Westminster Confession of\n Faith.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0016/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 193, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 281}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0016/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 387, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 562}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0016/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 775, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1125}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0016/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2250}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0016/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3103, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4500}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0016/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ot/ti/sh/ch/ur/ch/ap/00/gr/ea/scottishchurchap00grea/scottishchurchap00grea_0016.jp2", "height": 4500, "width": 3103, "levels": 6, "size": 1140851}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"16\">\n<p>\n 14\n</p>\n<p>\n THE SCOTTISH FREE CHURCH CASE.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lord Davey on the Church Trust.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lord Davey said: My lords, the subject\n matter ot the action out of which this ap\u00ac\n peal has arisen is certain heritable and\n movable property of great value, which is\n held by trustees, who are the first respond\u00ac\n ents, in trust for the Free Church of Scot\u00ac\n land. That church is a Voluntary and un\u00ac\n incorporated association of Christians,\n united on the basis of agreement in cer\u00ac\n tain religious tenets and principles of wor\u00ac\n ship, discipline and church government. The\n pursuers and present appellants were in\n the year 1900, and claim to be still, members\n of the Free Church, and their complaint, so\n far as if is cognizable )ty a civil court, is\n that their trustees, at the bidding of other\n members of the Free Church, but in breach\n of their trust, have applied, and threaten\n and intend to apply, the trust property to\n purposes which are alien to the purposes\n of the trust, and for the benefit of persons\n who have no title to call themselves mem\u00ac\n bers of the chui ' eh. In fact, the appellants\n say that they alone hold in their integrity\n the tenets and principles of the association\n for whose benefit the trust was founded.\n</p>\n<p>\n Srttlril l.nw\n</p>\n<p>\n The law on this subject is free from doubt.\n It has been settled by numerous decisions of\n the courts both in Scotland and in England,\n and has been affirmed by judgments of this\n House. The case of Craigdallie vs Aikman\n came twice before this House. In the second\n appeal heard in 1820, and reported in Q.\n Bills, 529, Lord Eldon thus stated the princi\u00ac\n ple on which the House proceeded when this\n matter was formally before the House:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWe acted upon this principle, that if we\n could find out what were the religious prin\u00ac\n ciples of those who originally attended the\n chapel we should hold the building appro\u00ac\n priated to the use of persons who adhere to\n the same religious principles '\n</p>\n<p>\n And after stating the result of the in\u00ac\n quiries directed by the former judgment\n Lord Eldon said:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cSupposing that there is a division of reli\u00ac\n gious opinions in the persons at present\n wishing to thjoy this building, the question\n then would be ' which of them adhered to the\n opinions of those who built the place of wor\u00ac\n ship and which of them differed from those\n opinions, those who still adhered to their re\u00ac\n ligious opinions being more properly to be\n considered as the cestui que trusts of\n those who held this place of worship in trust\n than those who have departed altogether\n irom the religious principles of those who\n founded this place, if I may so express it.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In an English case (Attorney General vs.\n Pearson, 3 mer. 353) decided in 1817. and\n therefore between thp two appeals in the\n Craigdallie case, Lord Eldon, referring to\n that case, expounded the principle acted on\n by the House morp at large:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBut if.\u201d he said, \u201con the other hand, it\n turns out (and I think that this point was\n etetried in the case which lately came before\n the House ot Lords ' by way of appeal out of\n Scotland) that the institution was established\n for the express purpose of such form of re\u00ac\n ligious worship or the teaching of such par\u00ac\n ticular doctrines ns the founder has thought\n most - conformable to the principles of the\n Christian religion, I do not apprehend that\n</p>\n<p>\n it i*s in the power of individuals having the\n management of that institution at any time\n to alter the purpose for which it was found\u00ac\n ed, or to say to the remaining members, we\n have changed our opinions, and you who as\u00ac\n semble in this place for the purpose of hear\u00ac\n ing the doctrines and joining in the worship\n prescribed by the founder shall no longer\n enjoy the benefit he intended for you unless\n you conform to the alteration which has\n taken place in our opinions. In sifcli a case,\n therefore, I apprehend\u2014considering it as\n Settled by the authority that 1 have already\n referred to\u2014that when a congregation be\u00ac\n comes dissentient among themselves the na\u00ac\n ture of the original institution must alonp\n he looked to as the guide for the decision\n of the court, and that to refer to any other\n criterion as to the sense of the existing\n majority would be to make a new institution,\n which is altogether beyond the reach and\n inconsistent with the duties and character\n of thia Court.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Function of a Civil Court,\n</p>\n<p>\n My Lords, I disclaim altogether any right,\n in this or any other civil court of this realm,\n to discuss the truth or falseness of any of\n the doctrines of this or any other religious\n association, or to say whether any of them\n are based on a just interpretation of the\n language of Scripture, or whether the con\u00ac\n tradictions or antinomies between different\n statements of doctrine are or are not real\n or apparent only, or whether such contradic-\n tiQns do or do not proceed only from an im\u00ac\n perfect and finite conception of a perfect and\n infinite being or any similar question. The\n more humble but not Useless function of the\n civil court is to determine whether the\n trusts imposed upon property by the found\u00ac\n ers of the trust are being duly observed. I\n appreciate and, if I may properly say so, I\n sympathize with the effort made by men of\n great intelligence and sound learning to es\u00ac\n cape from the letters forged by an earlier\n generation. But, sitting on appeal from a\n court of law, I am not at liberty to take any\n such matter into consideration. The ques\u00ac\n tion In each case is, what were the religious\n tenets and principles which formed the bond\n of union of the association for whose benefit\n the trust was created? I do not think that\n the eottrt has any test or touchstone by\n which it can pronounce that any tenet form\u00ac\n ing part of the body of doctrine professed by\n the association is not vital, essential or fun\u00ac\n damental. unless the parties have themselves\n declared it not to be so. 1 he bond of union,\n however, may contain within itself a power\n in some recognized body to control, alter\n or modify the tenets and principles at one\n time professed by the association: but the\n existence of such a power would have to be\n proved, like any other tenet or principle of\n the association. My lords. I do not propose\n to travel through the numerous documents\n which state the grounds of the great dis\u00ac\n ruption in 1813 and the principles held and\n professed by the founders of the Free\n Church. The result, in my opinion, is that\n the Free Church took with it the doctrine,\n government and discipline of the Established\n Church, freed from the fetters and conditions\n imposed on that church by the connection\n with the state. The Free Church adopted\n</p>\n<p>\n 1 as its standards the Westminster Confes\u00ac\n sion and the other subordinate standards of\n the Established Church. It also adopted the\n provisions of the barrier act and any other\n provisions affecting the constitution of the\n Church or the powers of its General Assem\u00ac\n bly. In fact, the founders of the Free Church\n claimed that:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIn doctrine and discipline they truly rep\u00ac\n resented the church of their fathers,\u201d and\n that \u201cIt is her being free, and not her be\u00ac\n ing established, that constitutes the real\n historical and hereditary identity of the Ke-\n formed National Church of Scotland,\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Tlie Chartei- of the Free Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is, however, one document which\n should be more particularly referred to\u2014viz.,\n the protest put forth as their first act by\n the members of the General Assembly of the\n Established Church who withdrew from that\n assembly on the historical 18th May, 1843.\n This protest was ordered to be recorded\n by the several presbyteries of the Free\n Church at the beginning of their presbytery\n books as the ground and warrant of their\n proceedings, and it may fitly be called the\n charter of the Free Church. It is at once\n an apology and an affirmance of the position\n taken up by the founders of the church in\n vindicating in vigorous terms their right and\n duty to separate from the Establishment.\n Maintaining the Confession of Faith and\n other standards of the Church of Scotland r.s\n heretofore understood, they are careful to\n firmly assert the right and duty of the civil\n magistrate to maintain and support an es\u00ac\n tablishment of religion in accordance with\n God\u2019s Word. It is a matter of dispute\n whether it was a tenet of the Established\n Church that it is the duty of the state to\n establish and endow a national church. It\n has been said by learned judges in the Court\n of Sessions that it was not required that the\n principle of a religious establishment in con\u00ac\n nection with and endowed by the state should\n be professed as an article of faith.

My lords, 1 cannot bring myself\n 1o doubt that a doctrine thus firmly asserted\n and maintained, and officially put forward\n was a distinctive tenet of the Free Church\n of Scotland, and formed a link in the bond\n of union between the members of that as\u00ac\n sociation. The Lord Ordinary and the learned\n judges in the Inner House treated it as\n neither fundamental nor essential, and they\n seem to have regarded it as a piotis opinion\n held indeed by the founders of the Church,\n but destitute in the circumstances of any\n practical importance. I have already said\n that I have no means of testing the funda\u00ac\n mental or essential character of the doc\u00ac\n trine apart from the utterances of the par\u00ac\n ties themselves. They certainly were as far\n as possible from treating it as an open\n question; and that attitude was maintained\n for man) years after the foundation of the\n church. The doctrine of the independence\n of the Church under the headship of Christ\n alone was the very foundation of their posi\u00ac\n tion, and was necessarily put forward by\n them as fundamental. But that is no proof\n that they did not regard other tenets also\n as essential or distinctive articles of belief.\n</p>\n<p>\n Cower of Assembly to Alter Iloetriiie.\n</p>\n<p>\n The questions therefore, in my opinion,\n come to be whether it was a term in the\n compact or bond of union that the General\n Assembly should have power to ..alter or\n vary the doctrines of the Church, and what\n are the limits (if any) of such a power. I\n was impressed (as I believed all your Lord-\n ships were) by the powerful argument of\n the Dean of Faculty. If I understand the\n learned Dean correctly, he maintained that\n the General Assembly of the Church of Scot\u00ac\n land had by its constitution an inherent\n power of plenary legislation over all mat\u00ac\n ters ecclesiastical, including doctrine, sub\u00ac\n ject only to the conditions imposed by the\n Act of Assembly called the Barrier Act. And\n he carried his argument so far as to main\u00ac\n tain that the General Assembly of the Free\n Church exercised the inherent powers of the\n Established Church, hut freed from the fet\u00ac\n ters imposed by Acts of Parliament, might\n derogate from, or even reject, the Confes\u00ac\n sion of Faith itself. My Lords, the freedom\n of the Church from the control of the civil\n power in spiritualities which is asserted by\n the Free Church does not appear to me to\n warrant any a priori inference of the exist\u00ac\n ence of such a plenary power of legislation\n in the General Assembly. It is, indeed, al\u00ac\n most a truism that an unestablished reli\u00ac\n gious association is free from State control\n as regards doctrine, government, and dis\u00ac\n cipline. But that freedom, which differenti\u00ac\n ates a voluntary association from an estab\u00ac\n lished church, is not inconsistent with the\n adoption by the association of certain tenets\n which distinguish it from other similar\n bodies. The right of the Assembly to im\u00ac\n pose any innovation from established doc\u00ac\n trine on a dissentient minority and the lim\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n its of such right, if any, must be found in\n the constitutional powers of that body, and\n must be approved by evidence. The historical\n argument of the learned Dean appears to\n me on examination to afford but little as-\n oistance on this crucial point.\n</p>\n<p>\n The ConfeMnionn.\n</p>\n<p>\n Knox ' s Confession of Faith was not adopt\u00ac\n ed by the General Assembly of the Church,\n for at that time the Presbyterian form of\n Church government was not established, and\n there was no such body. It was presented by\n the barons and others to Parliament, and\n then passed into law. The statutes of 1638\n and the subsequent years were passed during\n the period which is called in Scotch eccle\u00ac\n siastical history the Second Reformation,\n and appear to be in the nature of protests\n against the action of the King\u2019s Government,\n and in some instances the King\u2019s Commis\u00ac\n sioner is supplicated to obtain ratification\n by Parliament of the Acts of the Assembly.\n The Westminster Confession was adopted as\n an Act of the General Assembly in 1648. and\n did not. it is true, receive Parliamentary\n sanction until 1692, after the period of dis\u00ac\n turbance between the Restoration and the\n Revolution of 1688 had passed. It is to be\n observed, however, that in the Act of 1647,\n approving the Westminster Confession, it is\n expressly stated that the said Confession\n was found by the Assembly to be\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIn nothing contrary to the received doc\u00ac\n trine, worship, discipline and government of\n this v- ' ek.* '\n</p>\n<p>\n The Assembly, therefore, did not consider\n itself to be introducing into the Church any\n innovation in doctrine. The Westminster\n Confession was intended to be an eirenicon or\n basis of union between the Churches in the\n two kingdoms, and the adoption of it by the\n Scottish Assembly was ara much a political\n as an ecclesiastical act. The \u201cChapels Act\u201d\n and the \" Veto Act,\u201d which were the fore\u00ac\n runners, and indirectly the cause of the\n great Disruption, can hardly be cited as\n evidence of the power of legislation which\n is claimed. These Acts were said by their,\n authors to be declaratory only of existing\n rights, and although they involved the as\u00ac\n sertion of the larger principle for which the\n majority in the General Assembly were\n then contending, the particular subjects\n dealt with would seem to come within the\n scope of the internal management of an un-\n estubllshed Church. They were held in the\n Court of Se.ssion and in the House, in the\n course of the litigation which ensued, to he\n of no effect, because their provisions (it was\n held) were at variance with those of Acts of\n Parliament. It was not. necessary, there\u00ac\n fore, for the learned Judges to give any de\u00ac\n cision as to the abstract power in the Gen\u00ac\n eral Assembly to pass them. But the dicta\n of the learned Judges were not favorable to\n the respondents\u2019 contention. (See the opin\u00ac\n ions in the first Auehterarder case, 2 Rob\u00ac\n ertsons\u2019 report, pp. 25, et seq.) Counsel re\u00ac\n ferred to chapter VII. of the Second Book of\n Discipline. The sections numbered from 6\n to 7 describe the powers of all Assemblies\n from kirk-session to an Ecumenical Council,\n and do not relate specially to the General\n Assembly. It does not appear to me that\n any of these sections either confer or recog\u00ac\n nize the existence of a power in the General\n Assembly to impose new doctrine on the\n Church, for that is what it claimed. They\n seem to be directed to the preservation and\n maintenance of established doctrine and the\n reform of abuses. Sections 21 to 26 describe\n the powers of what is there called the Na-\n tipual Assembly, correeponding to- what is\n</p>\n<p>\n Row designated the General Assembly.\n There are large powers for the protection\n or the spiritual jurisdiction, the patrimony\n of the King, and, generally, concerning \u201cail\n weighty affairs that\u201d concern the well being\n and good order of \u201cthe whole Kirks of the\n Realm.\u201d But nothing is raid as to doctrine.\n Counsel did not, in fact, bring to your Lord-\n ships\u2019 attention any work of recognized au\u00ac\n thority in the Presbyterian Churches in\n which it is clearly laid down that the Gen\u00ac\n eral Assembly possesses this plenary power\n of legislation over doctrine; and l cannot,\n say that it has been proved to my satisfac\u00ac\n tion that either by inherent right or by\n usage, or by contract, the General Assembly\n of the Free Church has any such power.\n But, my Lords, I think that the learned\n Judges of the Court, of Session relied princi\u00ac\n pally on the provisions of the Barrier Act,\n 1597. The first observation is that that Act.\n is a Procedure Act. and not an Enabling Act.\n It does not purport to confer any now powero\n whatever, but it regulates the exercise of\n such powers as the General Assembly may\n possess.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Harrier Act.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is said, however, that the provisions of\n the Barrier Act contemplate and imply the\n existence ot r power in the General Assem\u00ac\n bly to make some innovations or alterations\n in, among other things, doctrine. I think\n this would be true if. after the word \u201cexist\u00ac\n ence \" you added the words \u201cor the possible\n exercise by the Assembly.\u201d The Act may\n have been passed for the purpose of pre\u00ac\n venting a majority from inaKing sudden in\u00ac\n novations and alterations which it was ex\u00ac\n pected or feared might be attempted without\n very carefully weighing what the strict con\u00ac\n stitutional powers of the Assembly were.\n But, my Lords, let it be assumed that the\n language of the Act does imply the existence\n of some power; certainly it is not necessarily\n an unlimited or general power, and the ques\u00ac\n tion then is. What is the extent or what are\n the limits of the power? It has boon said\n that it is a power to legislate in any manner\n not inconsistent, with the continued exist\u00ac\n ence of the Church. Bin applying that to\n the case now before us, what. It may be\n asked, is the Church but an organized asso\u00ac\n ciation of Christians holding certain doc\u00ac\n trines and principles in common? t was at\n one time disposed to think that a soupd\n limitation might be found if the power were\n confined to the interpretation of formularies,\n but. further reflection has satisfied me that\n if your Lordships were so to hold you wo.uld\n only be making ' a more or less plausible, but\n wholly unverified assumption. I also think\n that not only an accepted Interpretation of\n Scripture, but an aceepte ' d interpretation of\n or influence from a subordinate standard\n may just as well be an article of faith as\n any other opinion, and there is no solid dis\u00ac\n tinction. for this purpose, between one re\u00ac\n ligious principle or opinion and another.\n</p>\n<p>\n I do not think, for example, that you ad\u00ac\n vance the argument by calling the establish\u00ac\n ment principle a question of policy; only I\n have come to the conclusion that it would\n be contrary to all principle to infer front the\n provisions of the Barrier Act, unsupported\n by any evidence of usage or other evidence,\n a power in the General Assembly or the\n majority to vary Ihe trusts upon which this\n property is held to the prejudice of a dis\u00ac\n sentient minority. I think the Dean of\n Faculty was logically right in contending\n for an unrestricted power of legislation. But\n if the property was intended to be hold in\u00ac\n trust for a body of Christians holding suoii\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0018/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 193, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 281}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0018/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 387, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 562}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0018/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 775, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1125}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0018/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2250}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0018/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3103, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4500}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0018/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ot/ti/sh/ch/ur/ch/ap/00/gr/ea/scottishchurchap00grea/scottishchurchap00grea_0018.jp2", "height": 4500, "width": 3103, "levels": 6, "size": 834707}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"18\">\n<p>\n 16\n</p>\n<p>\n THE SCOTTISH FREE CHURCH CASE.\n</p>\n<p>\n doctrines a:. the majority acting through the |\n</p>\n<p>\n General Assembly might, from time to time j\n</p>\n<p>\n approve, such an intention should lie made\n</p>\n<p>\n clear beyond the possibility of cues,ion.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n V/hat tlie Assembly Dill.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now. what is it that the General Assembly\n has done? I shall content myself by refer\u00ac\n ring to three documents. In 1867 there was\n a movement in the Free Church for union\n with the United Presbyterian Church. In\n a report of the committee of the Free Church\n cf that year on union with ether Churches\n there is contained a statement of the United\n Presbyterian Church Committee under the\n heading of \u201cDistinctive Articles.\u201d It is as\n fellows:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThat it is net competent to the civil mag\u00ac\n istrate to give legislative sanction to any\n creed in the way of setting up a civil estab\u00ac\n lishment of religion, nor is it within province\n to provide for the expense of the administra\u00ac\n tions of religion out of the national re\u00ac\n sources.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThat Jesus Christ, as cole King and Head\n of His Church, has enjoined upon His people\n to provide for maintaining and extending it\n by freewill offerings.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018That this being the ordinance of Christ, it\n excludes State aid for these purposes, and\n that adherence is the true safeguard of the\n Church\u2019s independence. Moreover, though\n uniformity of opinion with respect to civil\n establishments of religion is not a term of\n communion in the United Presbyterian\n Church, yet the views on this subject held\n and universally acted on are opposed to these\n Institutions.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n I will only ask your Lordships to contrast\n this language with the views on this subject\n expressed by Dr. Chalmers, and put forward\n by the founders of the Free Church in their\n manifesto entitled \u201cThe affectionate repre\u00ac\n sentation of the Free Church of Scotland,\n 1843,\u201d to which I have already referred. In\n fact the voluntary principle, the unlawfulness\n of accepting aid in any form from the Stats,\n was put forward as one of the most distinc\u00ac\n tive principles of the United Presbyterian\n Church in a tract published by authority on\n the jubilee cf that Church in the year 1S97.\n Ey an Act of the General Assembly of the\n Free Church, dated 30th October. 1900. after\n a recital that a union of the Free Church of !\n Scotland and the United Presbyterian Church :\n of Scotland was in contemplation, and was i\n about to bp consummated, it was enacted and\n ordered (amongst other things) that all prop\u00ac\n erty held by Trustees for behoof of the Free\n</p>\n<p>\n Church of Scotland should belong to and be\n held for behoof of the United Free Church\n of^Scotland. On the following day the Act\n o; Union was passed, and certain declarations\n were adopted by the United Assembly de\u00ac\n fining the basis of union, the third of which\n is as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAs this union takes place on the foot\u00ac\n ing of maintaining the liberty of judgment\n and action heretofore recognized in either\n of the Churches uniting, so, in particular,\n is it hereby declared that members of both\n Churches and also of all Churches which\n in time past have united with either of\n them, shall have full right, as they sec\n cause to assert and maintain the view ' s of\n truth and duty which they have liberty to\n maintain in the said Churches.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In other w ' ords, the Establishment prin\u00ac\n ciple and the doctrine as to the duty of\n the civil Magistrate toward the Church as\n maintained and firmly held by the founders\n of the Free Church are henceforth to be\n open questions for members, ministers, and\n office-bearers, and the property w ' hich was\n placed in trust for the Free Church is hence\u00ac\n forth to be held in trust for the mainte\u00ac\n nance of a Church in the pulpits of w ' hich\n the distinctive tenets of the Free Church\n may, or may not be held, and, indeed, doc\u00ac\n trines at variance with them and directly\n contradictory of the Establishment principle\n may lawfully be maintained and taught.\n</p>\n<p>\n Free Church and the Confession.\n</p>\n<p>\n The appellants also say that in the consti\u00ac\n tution of the United Free Church another\n distinctive principle of the Free Church as\n declared by the founders of that Church has\n been abrogated, viz., the unqualified ac\u00ac\n ceptance of the Westminster Confession.\n They point to the change in the language\n of the question relating to the Confession\n which candidates are required to answer in\n the United Free Church. They say that\n this change, accompanied and explained by\n the Declaration contained in the preamble\n to the Act prescribing these questions, has\n the effect of substituting for a belief in\n the whole doctrine of the Confession of\n Faith belief in such portions thereof only\n as the General Assembly may from time to\n time determine to be of the substance of\n the reformed faith, or, in other words, such\n portions as the Assembly may from time to\n time approve. This is not a mere question\n of interpretation of formularies, and I am\n disposed to think that on this point also\n</p>\n<p>\n the argument cf the appellants is well\n founded. The learned Dean of Faculty\n rightly said that the substantial question\n was whether the United Free Church ba3\n preserved its identity with and is the le\u00ac\n gitimate successor of the Free Church. My\n Lords, I find myself quite unable to answer\n that question in the affirmative.\n</p>\n<p>\n Terms of Trust Deeds.\n</p>\n<p>\n The other two eases relate to the trusts cJ\n buildings held for particular Free Church\n congregations on trust deeds which are in\n the form of that Model Trust Deed ap\u00ac\n proved by the General Assembly of the\n Free Church. The terms of this trust deed\n were much relied on by the counsel for the\n respondents, not only with reference to\n these congregational trusts, but also on the\n general question. The trust is that the\n building shall be enjoyed as a place of re\u00ac\n ligious worship by a congregation of the\n said body of Christians called the Free\n Church of Scotland or of any united body\n I of Christians composed of them and of such\n body or bodies of Christians as the Free\n Church may at any time hereafter associate\n with themselves under the aforesaid name\n of the Free Church of Scotland, or under\n whatever name or designation they may as\u00ac\n sume. The operative part of the deed is\n preceded by a long historical narrative,\n which is interesting, and appears to me\n rightly to define the position and constitu\u00ac\n tion of the Free Church, but it does not\n appear to me to carry the case further than\n the facts themselves do. Nor do the terms\n of the trust seem to affect the general ques\u00ac\n tion beyond showing that it was in the\n contemplation of the parties that the Free\n Church might unite with some bodies of\n Christians. With regard to the congregation\u00ac\n al property I feel more difficulty. I think\n the soundest view, how ' ever, is to hold that\n there is a general over-riding trust for the\n purposes of the Free Church, and it was not\n intended that the majority controlling the\n Free Church might, by subverting the basis\n of the Church, divert the trust of the con\u00ac\n gregational property. I think, therefore,\n that the Union here contemplated, must be\n taken to be one with other Churches which\n might properly be made without detriment\n to the distinctive tenets of the Free Church.\n More than one union of that character has\n in fact been made without objection. For\n the reasons I have given. I am of opinion\n ; that all the appeals should be allowed.\n</p>\n<p>\n ^ *25 ^5\n</p>\n<p>\n Lord James Reviews\n</p>\n<p>\n Case c\n</p>\n<p>\n T --d James of Hereford said: My Lords,\n In cases before your Lordships for decision\n the secular Courts have been appealed to\n for the purpose of determining differences\n that have arisen between two sections of\n the Church until lately known as the Free\n Church of Scotland. The jurisdiction of the\n Courts, and therefore of your Lordships, to\n determine such differences proceeds from the\n fact that property held by trustees upon\n certain trusts has lately been dealt with,\n or sought to be dealt with, for the purpose\n of carrying out a uniou between the Free\n Church of Scotland and another body known\n as the United Presbyterian Church, and the\n</p>\n<p>\n pursuers in the Court below\u2014the appellants\n before your Lordships\u2014allege that the ap\u00ac\n plication of the properties in question to\n the purposes of the Churches thus united\n constitutes a breach of the trusts under\n which the properties are held. It is ob\u00ac\n vious that the first step tow ' ard the elucida\u00ac\n tion of the question before your Lordships\u2019\n House is to determine the nature of the\n trusts controlling the properties in question.\n In order to do so a brief reference to facts,\n some , of which have become historical, is\n necessary.

As far as 1\n know the seceding body adhered to all the\n tenets and views of the Establishment, ex\u00ac\n cepting upon the above question of secular\n interference with the spiritual affairs of the\n Church. Upon the Free Church thus consti\u00ac\n tuted as a whole, and upon certain congre\u00ac\n gations of it, considerable property has been\n conferred by different settlers and donors.\n The case set up by the pursuers is that these\n properties are held under certain trusts, that\n those who conferred the properties upon the\n Free Church intended that they should be\n applied for the purposes of that Church as it\n existed at the time when the transfers of\n property were made. It is also alleged that\n the Free Church, having united with another\n body known as the United Presbyterian\n Church, has so varied its conditions as to\n cease to retain its original identity. In the\n Courts below reliance in support of this con\u00ac\n tention was almost entirely placed upon the\n argument that a fundamental difference ex\u00ac\n isted between the. two Churches in this\u2014\n that the Free Church acknowledged and as\u00ac\n serted the principle of an Established Church\n while the United Presbyterian Church con\u00ac\n demned that principle and was to the fullest\n extent a Voluntary Church, accepting Volun\u00ac\n taryism as a necessary and fundamental prin\u00ac\n ciple of its faith.\n</p>\n<p>\n Foundations of tlie Cburcli.\n</p>\n<p>\n Such being the case presented in the\n Courts below and at the bar of your Lord-\n ships ' House by the pursuers, it is necessary\n first to determine to what extent the Free\n Church was based upon the principles of Es\u00ac\n tablishment. But before entering upon suen\n inquiry it is, 1 think, worthy of remark that\n the Church is not a positive defined entity,\n as would be the case if it were a corpora\u00ac\n tion created by law. It is a body of men\n united only by the possession of common\n opinions, and if this community of opinion\n ceases to exist the foundations of the Church\n give way. But difference of opinion to pro\u00ac\n duce this result must be in respect of funda\u00ac\n mental principles, and not of minor matters\n of administration or of faith. The basis of\n the Established Presbyterian Church was\n the Westminster Confession of Faith. At\n the time of the Disruption in 1843 full ad\u00ac\n hesion to the principles of this important\n document was declared by the seceders. Ar\u00ac\n ticle HI of Chapter XXIII of ihe Westmin\u00ac\n ster Confession is as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" The civil magistrate may not assume to\n himself the administration of the Word and\n Sacra~ents or of the Power of the Keys of\n the Kingdom of Heaven, yet he hath author\u00ac\n ity, and it is his duty to take order that\n unity and peace be preserved in the Church,\n that the truth of God be kept pure and en\u00ac\n tire, that ail blasphemies and heresies be\n suppressed, all corruptions and abuses in\n worship and discipline prevented, or reform\u00ac\n ed, and all the ordinances of God duly set\u00ac\n tled. administered and observed; for the bet\u00ac\n ter effecting whereof he hath power to call\n synods, to be present at them and to provide\n that whatsoever is transacted in them be\n according to the mind of God. \u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n It seems that this article clearly enun\u00ac\n ciates the principle of an Establishment, and\n that this principle, as distinguished from its\n application, htrs never been repudiated by\n these who formed the Free Church. But the\n</p>\n<p>\n opinion of any one on that point at the pres\u00ac\n ent day is of but little importance com\u00ac\n pared with the views expressed by those who\n founded that Church. Clear and distinct ex\u00ac\n pression of those views can be found, in the\n first place, in the Claim Declaration, and\n Protest issued on May 30, 1842. tl is stated.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWhereas it is an essential doctrine of\n this Church, and a fundamental principle in\n its constitution, as set forth in the Confes\u00ac\n sion of Faith thereof in accordance with the\n Word and Law r of the Most Holy God that\n there is no other Head of the. Church but\n the Lord Jesus Christ (Chapter xxv., section\n 6), and that while God the Supreme Lord\n and King of all the world has ordained civil\n magistrates to be under Him over the peo\u00ac\n ple for His own glory and the public good,\n and to this end hath armed them with the\n power of the Sword (Chapter xxiii., section\n 1), and while it is the duty of people to pray\n for magistrates, to honor their persons, to\n pay them tribute and other dues, to obey\n their lawful commands and to be subject to\n their authority for conscience sake, from\n which ecclesiastical persons are not exempt\u00ac\n ed (Chapter xxiii., section 4), and while the\n magistrate hath authority, and it is his duty\n in the exercise of that power which alone is\n committed to him\u2014namely, the power of the\n Sword of Civil Rule, as distinct from the\n Power of the Keys, or spiritual authority,\n expressly denied to him, to take order for\n the preservation of purity, peace, and unity\n in the Church, yet the Lord Jesus as King\n and Head of His Church hath therein ap\u00ac\n pointed a government in the hand of church\n officers distinct from the civil magistrate,\n which government is ministerial, not lordly,\n and to be exercised in consonance with the\n laws of Christ and with the liberties of His\n peoplp. \"\n</p>\n<p>\n And again in the same document, at page\n 3!) of the appendix, there appears as lot-\n lows:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAnd whereas this Church highly valu\u00ac\n ing. as she has ever done, her connection,\n on the terms contained in the statutes here\u00ac\n inbefore recited, with the state, and her\n possession of the temporal benefits thereby\n scured to her for the advantage of the peo\u00ac\n ple, must nevertheless, even at the risk and\n hazard of the loss of that connection and of\n these public benefits\u2014deeply as she would\n deplore and deprecate such a result for her\u00ac\n self and the nation\u2014persevere in maintain\u00ac\n ing her liberties as a Church of Christ.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Then in the Protest of May 18. 1843, we\n .read:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAnd finally, while firmly asserting the\n right and duty of the civil magistrate to\n maintain and support an Establishment of\n religion in acc.oruance witu Lod s word and\n reserving to ourselves and successors to\n striv* by all lawful means, as opportunity\n shall, in God\u2019s good providence, be offered,\n to secure the performance of mis but ac\u00ac\n cording to the Scriptures.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Yet the document proceeds to announce\n separation. Again, in the pastoral address is\u00ac\n sued by the General Assembly of the Free\n Church on that same day. May 18, 1843, it\n is stated:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cLong w-as it the peculiar distinction and\n irgh glory of the Established Church of\n Scotland to maintain the Sole Headship of\n the Lord Jesus Christ, His exclusive Head\u00ac\n ship in the Church which is His kingdom\n and bouse. It was ever held by her, in\u00ac\n deed, that the Church and the State, being\n equally ordinances of God and having cer\u00ac\n tain objects connected with His glory and\n the social welfare, might and ought to unite\n in a joint acknowledgment of Christ and\n</p>\n<p>\n on the employment of the means and rea\u00ac\n sons belonging to them respectively for\n the advancement of His cause. But, while\n the Church in this manner might lend her\n services to the State, and the State give its\n support to the Church, it was ever held as a\n fundamental principle that each still re\u00ac\n mained and ought, under all circumstances\n to remain, supreme in its own sphere and\n independent of the other. On the one hand\n the Church, having received her powers of\n internal spiritual government directly from\n her Divine Head, it was held that she must\n herself at all times exercise the whole of\n it under a sacred and inviolable respoir\n bility to Him alone, so as to have \u00bbo power\n to fetter herself by a connection with the\n State or otherwise in the exercise of her\n spiritual functions. And in like manner as\n regards the State the same was to be held to\n be true on the same grounds and to the very\n same extent in reference to its secular sov\u00ac\n ereignty. It was maintained that as the\n spiritual liberties of the Church bequeathed\n to her by the Divine Head were entirely be\u00ac\n yond the control of the State, so. upon the\n other hand, the State held directly and ex\u00ac\n clusively from God, and was entitled and\n bound to exercise under its responsibility to\n Him alone, its entire secular sovereignty,\n including therein whatever it was competent\n for or binding upon the State to do about\n sacred things or in relation to the Church,\n as for example, endowing and establishing\n the Church and fixing the terms and condi\u00ac\n tions of that establishment.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Dr. Clialmer* and Establishment.\n</p>\n<p>\n But perhaps the most explicit declaration\n on the subject of the principle of Establish\u00ac\n ment is to be found in the words of Dr.\n Chalmers, rendered authoritative by their\n circulation by the orders of the General As\u00ac\n sembly of May, 1843. My Lords, those are\n the words which were read by the noble\n and learned Lord on the Woolsack, where\n Dr. Chalmers says \u201cthe Voluntaries mistake\n us if they conceive us to be Voluntaries,\u201d\n and, therefore, I do not read them again.\n To these declarations of Lord Chalmers I\n feel great importance should be attached.\n Apart from the fact that they were issued\n under the authority of the General Assembly,\n Dr. Chalmers was specially appealing Tor\n material support for the Free Church as a\n seceding body\u2014and I know nothing more\n likely to influence the generosity of donors\n than the eloquent appeal of such a man as\n Dr. Chalmers. From him those who gave\n would seek both guidan.ee and information\n as to the body upon which their gifts would\n be conferred. Then, in December 1843. tlie\n Assembly of the Free Church, replying to the\n address from the Congregational Churches\n of North Wales, said:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBut you misapprehend the nature of the\n movement we have made in supposing that\n we have in the last degree altered our views\n respecting the lawfulness and desirableno;;*\n of a right connection between Church and\n State. \"\n</p>\n<p>\n That the Established principle was adhered\n to by the Free Church seems to have been\n accepted in the Court below. Lord Trayr.er\n in Ills judgment says:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt is not open to doubt that the Free\n Church from its constitution, in 1843, down\n at least to its union with the United Pres\u00ac\n byterian Church professed the Establish\u00ac\n ment principle.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Even the separation from the Estab\u00ac\n lished Church was apparently intended to\n be of a temporary character only, becauaa\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0020/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 193, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 281}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0020/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 387, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 562}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0020/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 775, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1125}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0020/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2250}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0020/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3103, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4500}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0020/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ot/ti/sh/ch/ur/ch/ap/00/gr/ea/scottishchurchap00grea/scottishchurchap00grea_0020.jp2", "height": 4500, "width": 3103, "levels": 6, "size": 1060184}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"20\">\n<p>\n 18\n</p>\n<p>\n THE SCOTTISH FREE CHURCH CASE.\n</p>\n<p>\n we find in the claim and protest of May SO,\n 1S42, the following:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBut that it shall be free to the mem\u00ac\n bers of this Church, or their successors, at\n any time hereafter when there shall be a\n chance of obtaining justice, to claim the\n restitution of all such civil rights and priv\u00ac\n ileges, and temporal benefits, and endow\u00ac\n ments, as for the present they may be com\u00ac\n pelled to yield up in order to procure to\n their office-bearers the best exercise of\n their spiritual government and discipline,\n and to their people the liberties of which\n respectively it lias been attempted so con\u00ac\n trary to law and justice to deprive them.\u2019\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n Such being the declaration of the seceders\n at the time of the Disruption, I can find no\n departure from such views at any time be\u00ac\n fore the union with the United Presbyter\u00ac\n ian Church. On the contrary, between the\n years 1842 and 1900 repeated declarations\n or adhesion to the principle of Establish\u00ac\n ment were made on behalf of the Free\n OJiurch. I have thus dealt at length with\n the position accepted by the Free Church in\n reflation ' to Establishment, and the result\n seems to be that the seceders of 1843, hav\u00ac\n ing belonged to the Established Church, se\u00ac\n ceded from it, not because it was an Es\u00ac\n tablished Church, but because the principle\n of the Establishment within it had become\n vitiated. To the principles of Establish\u00ac\n ment the seceders still fully adhered, and\n to the Established Church itself they would\n gladly have returned as scon as\n there was afiy discontinuance of the inter\u00ac\n ference with spiritual government, which\n they regarded as vitiating the true princi\u00ac\n ples of Establishment. It still has to be\n considered whether the principle was essen\u00ac\n tial and fundamental or a mere matter of\n policy. It is difficult to define any positive\n standard between an essential and a non-\n essential principle, but surely there is a great\n gulf between the principle of Establishment\n and that of Voluntaryism. It seems to me that,\n having read the declaration of the General\n Assembly, and the distinct utterances of Dr.\n Chalmers, scant justice would be done to\n the eloquent leaders of the secession move\u00ac\n ment of 1843 if we construed them as treat\u00ac\n ing the Establishment principle as being\n non-essential or unimportant. Still more\n important is it to consider what was the\n view of the importance of the principle en\u00ac\n tertained by those donors who may have\n listened to the appeal of Dr. , Chalmers.\n Would they have regarled it as non-essen\u00ac\n tial? Would they have endowed a Church\n pledged to Voluntaryism? I think not. It is\n a much easier task to gather the views of\n the United Presbytciian Church on the sub\u00ac\n ject of Establishment. That Church came\n into existence in the year 1847 by virtue of\n the union of two Churches which had pre\u00ac\n viously seceded from the Established Church.\n It is not denied that from the first to last\n the United Presbyterian Church has existed\n without connection with the State, and as a\n Voluntary Church, accepting as a fundamen\u00ac\n tal principle that of Voluntaryism. A most\n emphatic declaration in favor of that prin\u00ac\n ciple was made as late as 1897, in the tract\n No. XXV, issued by the United Presbyterian\n Church. Again I quote Lord Trayner\u2019s au\u00ac\n thority in the Court below. He says that it\n is not open to doubt.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThat the United Presbyterian Church\n throughout the whole period of its existence\n has repudiated the principle of Establish\u00ac\n ment, and, professed instead the principle of\n .Voluntaryism.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Entertaining these different views, the\n Free Church and the United Presbyterians\n</p>\n<p>\n have taken steps, seemingly correct in form,\n to become united under the name of the\n United Free Church, and this union is sought\n by the majority, who support it, to be im\u00ac\n posed on the minority, who, o.bject to be\u00ac\n come members of the new United Church,\n and to take effect upon property held by the\n Free Church, so as to transfer it to the new\n body, the United Church. .\n</p>\n<p>\n Freedom to Differ.\n</p>\n<p>\n Apparently it was sought to make the\n union subject to a reservation, so as to\n leave an independent and different judg\u00ac\n ment to members of the two Churches.\n Clause 3 of the Declaration of the United\n Assembly is as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAs this union takes place on the footing\n of maintaining the liberty of judgment and\n action heretofore recognized in either of\n the Churches uniting, so in particular it is\n hereby declared that members of both\n Churches, and also of all Churches which in\n time past have united with either of them,\n shall have full right as they see cause to\n assert and maintain the views of truth and\n duty which they had liberty to maintain in\n the said Churches.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n But this freedom to differ, whilst admitting\n the differences, does not lessen or remove\n them. The United Free Church, as a whole,\n holds within it neither the principle of Es\u00ac\n tablishment nor of Voluntaryism. Such\n questions were to be open questions, but the\n man who as a member of the Free Church\n had accepted the views of a Church which\n claimed Establishment as one of its funda\u00ac\n mental principles, may well object when he\n is told that he shall no longer belong to a\n Church holding that principle, but that he\n must under compulsion join a Church wherein\n members of it may think as they will on this\n broad subject, and must, whether be wishes it\n or not, be in communicn with the supporters\n of the Voluntary system to the same extent\n as if they had adherents to the principle of\n Establishment in accordance with the tenets\n of the Free Church. My Lords, we must\n recollect that we are dealing with property\n applied to the use of men in return foi serv\u00ac\n ice rendered as ministers of the Free Church,\n to the use of men who have , adhered to the\n tenets of that Church, who have changed\n nothing, who have varied nothing. From an\n answer I received from counsel at the bar,\n I learnt that the refusal of these ministers\n to become members of this mixed body was\n treated as a matter of discipline, and so the\n sentence for thus adhering to an old unaltered\n faith apparently amounts to deprivation.\n That this is so seems to proceed from the\n effect of the Act of October 30, 1900, whereby\n it was resolved that the whole property of\n the Free Church should be transferred to.\n and belong to, the United Free Church. The\n assertion that the dissenting minority, by so\n dissenting, ceased to be members of the Free\n Church, and lost, and forfeited all their rights\n and privileges as members thereof, is to be\n found at statement 15 of the defenders\u2019 case.\n The sentence thus imposed upon the ministers\n who adhered to their old opinions is some\u00ac\n what draconic. .\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThey separated and cut themselves off\n from the said Church.\u201d says the statement of\n the defenders, \u201cand by so doing lost and for\u00ac\n feited all their rights and privileges as mem\u00ac\n bers thereof. They do not constitute or rep\u00ac\n resent the Free Church Scotland. They\n have no right or title to any property which\n belonged to the said. Free Church of Scot\u00ac\n land. They are hot members of the United\n Free Church of Scotland. They have no\n right or title to any property belonging to\n it.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n My Lords, there are one or two subjects\n</p>\n<p>\n that must be dealt with. Lord Trayner in\n his judgment says:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBut as to that, the Establishment prin\u00ac\n ciple had been explicitly declared in 1843 to\n be an essential principle of the Free Church.\n I think the Church had the power to abandon\n that principle, and to that extent alter that\n principle.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n From this view I differ, because, regarding\n essential as meaning fundamental, I do not\n think that a Church can change such funda\u00ac\n mental principles and yet at the same time\n preserve its identity. The retention of the\n name does not preserve identity, and yet the\n change of principles might be so great as\n to leave nothing but the name of the Church.\n I think, toof it was admitted by way of ex\u00ac\n ample that if change had introduced the doc\u00ac\n trines of the Church of Rome the identity* of\n the Free Church would be lost. And surely\n this view brings us back to the question\n whether there has be n any change of a fun\u00ac\n damental or vital principle of the Church,\n and to this an answer has been given .\n</p>\n<p>\n Tl\u00bbe Model Trust Deed.\n</p>\n<p>\n An important document\u2014the Model Trust\n Deed of November, 1844\u2014has also to be dealt\n with. The respondents naturally rely upon\n it as showing that at the very time of the\n secession it was contemplated that the Free\n Church might unite with other Churches. I\n agree that this is so. for the deed sets out a\n trust in favor of the congregations.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cOf the said body of Christians called the\n Free Church of Scotland, or of any united\n body of Christians composed of them, and\n of such other body or bodies of Christians\n as the said Free Church may at any time\n hereafter associate with themselves.\n</p>\n<p>\n Even if the Model Deed contained no such\n reference to union with other Churches, I\n should regard the power as existing, for I\n agree with Lord Young when he says in his\n judgment that\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAny two or more Churches may law-\n full w unite so as to form one Church, and\n that nothing more is necessary to the union\n than their own consent, which they are re\u00ac\n spectively free to give or withhold.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Doubtless that is so in respect of the mere\n legality of the act of uniting, but different\n considerations are raised in these suits. We\n have to deal with the rights of property,\n with the execution of trusts, and we have to\n see that the objects the donors had in view\n are carried out. Such being the case, I do\n not think that the Model Trust Deed gives\n greater power of union than the Free Church\n possessed without it. The Church may unite\n and so says the Model Deed; but if prop\u00ac\n erty is sought to be transferred to the new\n body, the identity of the new body\u2014that is,\n the Free Church after the union\u2014must be\n maintained, and nothing in the deed gives\n a power to unite so as to bring into exist\u00ac\n ence a Church incapable of identity with the\n Free Church. And if this be so, we are re\u00ac\n called to the consideration of the main ques\u00ac\n tion -argued in this case. My Lords, great\n stress was laid at the bar upon the effect\n of an Act passed in the year 1C97 called\n the Barrier Act. It was argued that this\n Act conferred legislative powers upon the\n General Assembly in respect of matters of\n doctrine or worship, discipline or govern\u00ac\n ment, within the Church. I cannot agree\n in this view. The Act is entitled, \u201cAn Act\n anent the method of passing Acts of Assem\u00ac\n bly of concern to the Church and for pre\u00ac\n venting of innovation.\u201d It is a procedure\n Act regulating the exercise of the exist\u00ac\n ing power of the Assembly, but conferring no\n new jurisdiction and increasing no powers.\n</p>\n<p>\n i\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0021/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 193, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 281}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0021/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 387, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 562}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0021/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 775, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1125}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0021/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2250}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0021/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3103, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4500}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0021/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ot/ti/sh/ch/ur/ch/ap/00/gr/ea/scottishchurchap00grea/scottishchurchap00grea_0021.jp2", "height": 4500, "width": 3103, "levels": 6, "size": 1069522}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"21\">\n<p>\n 19\n</p>\n<p>\n THE SCOTTISH FREE CHURCH CASE.\n</p>\n<p>\n Doubtless the Assembly had before the pass\u00ac\n ing of the Act certain powers in respect of\n matters referred to, and it was thought de\u00ac\n sirable tc enact that such powers should\n only he exercised after full notice given.\n That is all the Barrier Act did.

I have, as in duty bound, care\u00ac\n fully considered those various aspects of the\n controversy, and I have come to the conclu\u00ac\n sion that the case admits of decision and\n ought to be decided on grounds much more\n palpable and certain. The question is to\n whom does certain property now belong\n which was given to the denomination of\n Christians calling itself the Free Church of\n Scotland? That body was founded in 1843.\n It consisted of ministers and laity who se\u00ac\n ceded from the Established Church of Scot\u00ac\n land on certain questions of Church polity,\n but who professed to carry with them all\n the doctrine and system of the Established\n Church, only freeing themselves by seces\u00ac\n sion from what they regarded as intolerable\n encroachments by the law courts upon the\n Church\u2019s spiritual functions. Rightly or\n wrongly the theory of the Free Church was\n that they, and not the Established Church\n were the Church of Scotland. The Church thus\n set up was endowed by the liberality of its\n members with the property now in dispute.\n Two competitors now claim it. Of the re\u00ac\n spondents the first remark to be made goes\n to the very root of their claim. They are not\n either in name or composition the Free\n Church of Scotland. They are not even the\n majority of the Free Church, . but the\n assignees of the majority of the Free\n Church. They are a body formed in 1900 by\n the fusion of the majority of the Free Church\n with another body of Presbyterian dissenters,\n the United Presbyterian Church. The prop\u00ac\n erty of the Free Church is claimed by this\n composite body, who, to the extent of a third\n or some large proportion (for the particulars\n are not before us, and are unimportant), is\n composed of United Presbyterians of this\n new body. It may be affirmed nearly as\n truly that it is United Presbyterian as that\n it is Free Church, and its name, \u201cThe United\n Free Church,\u201d suggests the fact. Now, 1\n do not attach conclusive importance to the\n name, but it is important, and still more\n significant. In any view the change of name\n and the fact of fu-eioh put it on the respon\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n dents to prove their identity with the original\n Lenefieiaries. They have to do this, too, not\n in a question with the heirs at law of the\n founders, but in competition with an exist\u00ac\n ing body of ministers and members of the\n original Free Church, who have simply stayed\n where they were, and about whose pedigree\n there is no dubiety. For reasons to be after\u00ac\n ward stated, it is not too lightly to be as\u00ac\n sumed that such unions are within the com\u00ac\n petency of any majority, however large, even\n if there existed no essential differences be\u00ac\n tween the uniting bodies. The present, how\u00ac\n ever, is not a case in which (as in some in\u00ac\n stances which will presently be examined in\n detail) the Free Church has absorbed smaller\n Presbyterian bodies, holding all her own\n pristine principles, and has done so without\n any change in her name or formularies. The\n United Presbyterian Church treated with,\n and joined, the Free Church not only for\u00ac\n mally, but in fact on at least equal terms.\n The two bodies w ' hich met to consummate\n the union enacted and declared that the Free\n Church\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cDo and shall henceforth constitute one\n united Church, that the name of the united\n Church shall be the United Free Church of\n Scotland, and that its supreme Court shall\n be designated the General Assembly of the\n United Free Church of Scotland.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n From these proceedings it resulted that so\n far as the respondents were concerned the\n Free Church judicatories ceased to exist,\n their places being taken by Kirk Sessions,\n Presbyteries, Synods, General Assemblies of\n the new Church, composed in part of gentle\u00ac\n men who formerly were United Presbyte\u00ac\n rians, and in part of gentlemen who formerly\n were Free Churchmen. On the 30th October,\n 1900, the General Assembly of the Free\n Church made over the whole property of the\n Free Church to the United Free Church. On\n the following day, 31st October, 1900, the\n General Assembly of the new Church pro\u00ac\n ceeded to set up a new formularly for the\n admission of their preachers, which had been\n preconcerted and matter of treaty. Whereas\n a probationer of the Free Church used to be\n required to affirm his belief that \u201cThe whole\n doctrine of the Confession of Faith is the\n truths of God,\u201d the United Free Church pro\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n bationer requires to affirm his belief in \u201cthe\n doctrine of this Church, i. e., the United\n Free Church\u201d (set forth in the Confession of\n Faith). The elasticity of \u201cthe doctrine of\n the Unted Free Church\u201d is thus made the\n object of belief, is ascertained by the fact\n that the various matters of agreement be\u00ac\n tween the Churches with a view to union\n were declared by the United Assembly to be\n \u201cAccepted and enacted without prejudice to\n the inherent liberty of the United Church as\n a Church of Christ, to determine and regulate\n its own constitution and laws as duty may\n require, in dependence on the grace of God\n and under the guidance of His holy word.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The United Free Church probationer has\n also to affirm the general principles of the\n (United Presbyterian) \u2022 \u201cBasis of Union,\n 1847,\u201d as well as those of the (Free Church)\n \u201cClaim of Right of 1842,\u201d to be principles\n sanctioned by the Word of God and the sub\u00ac\n ordinate standards of the Church. I do not\n</p>\n<p>\n at present comment on the importance of\n such changes, but note them as showing that\n the constitution of the new Church is a new\n constitution, enacted not by the Freo\n Church, but by the new and composite body,\n and adapted to the exigencies of the Pres\u00ac\n byterians. Another matter of salient im\u00ac\n portance demands attention.

Nothing before the\n House shows or suggests that the United\n Presbyterians departed by an iota from\n their own doctrine. On the other hand,\n there is no avowal by the Free Church that\n she departed from the .position formulated\n in the parallel columns. What was done\n was simply to drop the subject and unite.\n While such is the name, such the composi\u00ac\n tion of the respondents ' body, the position\n of the other competitor, the appellants, is\n very much simpler. They are those minis\u00ac\n ters and laity of the Free Church who did\n not concur in the union of 1900, but pro\u00ac\n tested against it. They have done nothing\n hut remain where they were, holding to the\n letter all the doctrines of the Free Church,\n adhering to it as an institute, and continu\u00ac\n ing its existence according to the measure\n of tfieir powers. They say that in the event\n which has happened they are the Free\n Church\u2014their brethren having left them\n for this new Church, just as those brethren\n might have left them for the Establish\u00ac\n ment or for the Eniseopalians. They have,\n however, been declared by the respondents\n no longer to be of their communion, and\n their manses and churches have been form\u00ac\n ally claimed by the respondents for their\n own exclusive use. The adherents of the ap j\n pellants are numerically few\u2014some few\n thousands\u2014but it has not been suggested\n that this introduces any legal difference\n from the situation as it would have been\n had they been more numerous. Since the\n days of Cyrus it has been held that justice\n is done by giving people not what fits them\n but what belongs to them. Such being in\n sketch the relative positions of the two\n claimants to this property, it is plain that\n the respondents can only succeed by mak\u00ac\n ing out that it wag an inherent quality of\n that Free Church to which this property\n was given, that it could transform itself in\n the way that I have described, and oust\n from the property those who desire to re\u00ac\n main where they were in principle, doctrine\n and organization. For let it not be forgot\u00ac\n ten that the contention of the respondents\n necessarily involves that the majority is\n entitled, not merely themselves, to retain\n the property, but also (1) to introduce the\n United Presbyterians as beneficiaries, and\n (2) to oust the dissentient minority from\n the benefits of the foundation. This is why\n I protested at. the outset against the too\n ready acceptance of the doctrine that\n \u201cunion\u2019 ' is competent to a majority. In\n considering this contention I steady myself\n by. dwelling on an observation very fre\u00ac\n quently repeated by the Dean of Faculty in\n his able speech for the respondents.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThis case,\u201d said the Dean, \u201cdiffers from\n all previous cases in the same region of law\n in this\u2014this is a gift to a Church, not to\n a congregation, for the promotion of certain\n doctrines, but to a Church named and desig\u00ac\n nated.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n I think there is great force in this, but In\n another way from that intended. This prop\u00ac\n erty was given to the Free Church, an exist\u00ac\n ing Church, complete within itself as an\n ecclesiastical organization, and separate\n from other Churches. This becomes extreme\u00ac\n ly clear when it is remembered that there\n were already existing at the moment of the\n Disruption the two dissenting Presbyterian\n bodies which now form the United Presbyte\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n rian Church, and that the incorporation of\n those two into the United Presbyterian\n Church took place in 1847, during those early\n \u2022years of (he Free Church when this property\n was being accumulated. Those dissenting\n bodies were st > far as worship, doctrine, dis\u00ac\n cipline and government were disclosed in\n i their standards, exactly the same as the\n Free Church which was set up side by side\n with them. Accordingly, if we knew nothing\n to corroborate the infererice which this gives\n rise to, the broad fact that the Free Church\n was set up as an independent Church, sep\u00ac\n arate fronj those with whom the recent union\n has now been effected. Therefore, with the\n Dean of the Faculty, I say this property was\n given to a particular Church, and it is very\n difficult to see that it will do to end that\n Church, and then, picking up most of her\n doctrines, come forward to claim that United\n Presbyterian and Free Church alike shall\n share as members of a body which is not\n even called Free Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n Foundation of tlie Free Cliuroli.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the history of the foundation of the\n Free Church is more closely examined we\n see that it was not fortuitously, or ' from\n mere lcve of separation, that the Free\n Church was founded and endowed as a\n Church separate from the two confluents\n of the United Presbyterian Church. Those\n existing dissenting bodies held opinions\n about Church government and Church and\n State which were inherited and carried for\u00ac\n ward by the United Presbyterian Church,\n and in 1843 they, as after 1847 their suc\u00ac\n cessor the United Presbyterian Church,\n were the exponents in Scotland of Voluntary\n principles. By this, as it ought io be un\u00ac\n necessary to say, I mean not merely that in\n fact they were not endowed by the State,\n but that they were opposed on principle to\n the endowment of religion by the State. It\n is honorable to the United Presbyterian\n Church that, in good times and in bad, it\n has never used ambiguous language or\n nicely balanced phrases about this matter,\n and has never sailed under false colors. All\n through the negotiations with the Free\n Church, as before them, it was strenuous\n and busy in \u201cdiffusing a knowledge of the\n Voluntary principles of the Church.\u201d It\n year by year upheld \u201cthe Church\u2019s tes\u00ac\n timony on the proper relations of Church\n and State, and in favor of religious equality\n by disestablishment and disendowment,\u201d\n and \u201crenewed the testimony of 1847, con\u00ac\n stantly maintaining that it is not within\n the province af civil government to provide\n for the religious instruction of the subject.\u201d\n In order, once for all, to ascertain precisely\n the true position of the United Presbyterian\n Church upon these subjects, it is convenient\n to read the statement of their distinctive\n principles made by their committee when\n negotiating for union with the Free Church\n in 1867, and the passage has a special value,\n because in the circumstances it was not\n likely to contain overstatements on contro\u00ac\n versial points. It stands out, also as a\n landmark, because it has never to this day\n been abandoned by the United Presbyterian\n Church, either before, in, or after their\n union with the Free Church. Here is what\n is said:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThat it is not competent to the civil\n magistrate to give legislative sanction to\n any creed in the way of setting up a civil\n establishment of religion, nor is it within\n his province to provide for the expense of\n administrations of religion out of the na\u00ac\n tional resources; that Jesu.s Christ as sole\n King and Head of His Church has enjoined\n</p>\n<p>\n upon His people to provide for maintaining\n and extending it by freewill offerings,\u201d and\n so on.\n</p>\n<p>\n All of this declaration is very clear, but\n the closing sentence has a special signifi\u00ac\n cance in regard to the whole of the present\n cai?e. On paper the United Presbyterian\n Church held just the same general doctrines\n as the other Presbyterian Churches. Like\n them, she held the Scriptures to be the only\n rule of faith. As with them so with her, the\n Westminster Confession and Catechism were\n her confession and catechism. None of her\n formularies made mention of Voluntaryism,\n or exacted the profession of that principle\n from her office-bearers of members. The\n learned judges whose decision is now under\n review, would, I suppose, have thought that\n this fact removed all ground of division be\u00ac\n tween the Voluntary bodies and the Free\n Church bodies in 1843. But the founders of\n the Free Church were not content w r ith these\n criteria of the distinctive notes or testi\u00ac\n monies of a Church, ai d though declined to\n coalesce with Voluntaries, although Volun\u00ac\n taryism was not then any more than now a\n term of communion in those bodies. \u201cThe\n affectionate representation of the Free\n Church of Scotland, 1843,\u201d is conclusive on\n this point, and it has a peculiarly direct au\u00ac\n thority and relevance in the present contro\u00ac\n versy. It has been called, and I think accu\u00ac\n rately, \u201cthe prospectus\u201d of the new Church,\n and it states the grounds and principles on\n which support was asked for it. Now, this\n manifesto, or prospectus, discusses this very\n question of the proper relations of the Free\n Church to the Dissenters who now form the\n United Presbyterian Church. The manifesto\n seems to anticipate the not unnatural objec\u00ac\n tion to the formation of a new Church that\n here were existing orthodox Presbyterian\n Churches\u2014Why not join them? The answer\n is conclusive\u2014That would be againat our\n principles. And in two very eloquent pages\n \u2014for the writer was Dr. Chalmers\u2014the Es\u00ac\n tablishment principle is urged upon those ad\u00ac\n dressed in the most peremptory terms as\n being < still binding on them as \u201ca doctrine\n or article of faith.\u201d The Voluntaries are\n warned that they mistook the Free Church\n if they conceived them to be Voluntaries;\n and it is emphatically asserted for the Free\n Church that\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThough we quit the Establishment, we go\n out on the Establishment principle. We\n quit a vitiated Establishment, but would re\u00ac\n joice in returning to a pure one.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The same attitude is politely but firmly\n expressed in the General Assembly\u2019s replies\n to the various bodies of Voluntaries who ad\u00ac\n dressed the Free Church with congratula\u00ac\n tions at the time of the Disruption. They\n are all asked not to mistake the Free Church\n for Voluntaries. The conclusion which I\n draw from all this is that it was of the es\u00ac\n sence of the foundation to which this proper\u00ac\n ty belongs that it should be a Church sepa\u00ac\n rate from Voluntary Dissenters.

Now, in dealing with\n the question before your Lordships\u2019 House,\n it is necessary from the outset to bear firm\u00ac\n ly in mind that the Establishment principle\n can be held by Churches that in fact are un\u00ac\n connected with the State, and are in fact\n supported by voluntary contributions alone.\n I should have thought this the necessary hy\u00ac\n pothesis of the whole question, as we have to\n do with a Dissenting Church; but in two\n passages of the learned Judge\u2019s opinions, af\u00ac\n terward to be adverted to. this seems to be\n forgotten. Again, the Intrinsic importance\n of any particular doctrine in relation to the\n general body of Christian teaching is no cri\u00ac\n terion of whether it is or is not an essential\n or fundamental doctrine in a particular\n Church and least of all in Scotland. It is\n not its own importance, but the place as\u00ac\n signed to it in the foundation of the new\n Church, that has go* to be ascertained. I\n dwell on this for a moment, and illustrate it\n from the case in hand. Whether the Es\u00ac\n tablishment principle is, or is not, a funda\u00ac\n mental doctHne of the Free Church is the\n dispute in this case; but there is no doubt\n at all that the claim of the Free Church as\n against the Law Courts (I put it shortly) is\n of the essence of her foundation. This ques\u00ac\n tion is settled not because the judges of\n your Lordships so appraise that doctrine in\n colnparison with all the various doctrines\n of faith and morals set out in the Confes\u00ac\n sion of Faith, but because that was the un\u00ac\n doubted ground on which the new Church\n was set up. Now, I observe in Lord Low ' s\n very able judgment that he makes much of\n the fact that here were two Churches identi\u00ac\n cal in doctrine, worship, and form of gov\u00ac\n ernment, and they were working together\n In the same field, so that their agencies\n overlapped and their efforts were to some\n extent wasted; and his Lordship goes on to\n speak of the duty of unity among Chris\u00ac\n tians. This is all very true, but then\n these considerations were full in view of\n the founder of the Free Church. This is\n not a case where the new Church was set\n up in Scotland to preach the gospel to peo\u00ac\n ple who were npt within reach of the com\u00ac\n mon doctrines of Christianity, or even of\n Calvinistic Christianity. Tn the theory of\n the founders of the Free Church, it was in\u00ac\n tolerable that these adherents, although\n agreeing in all other matters, should con\u00ac\n tinue to worship along with those who were\n content that the Court of Sessions should\n force the Presbytery to ordain the patron\u2019s\n presentee, and do all the various things\n which led to the Disruption., In fact, again\n they set up their Churches side by side\n with those of the other Presbyterian todies\n who also held exactly the same doctrinal\n standards, and the evil consequences of\n having two separate Churches, instead of\n one, which Lord Low adverts to, being pal\u00ac\n pable and flagrant, then, as now, the just\n inference seems to be that the founders of\n the Free Church deemed the difference be\u00ac\n tween themselves and the Voluntaries so\n vital that the duty of Christian unity must\n give way to the more imperious duty of\n Christian fidelity to truth. In the same\n fashion the older secessions had taken\n place on questions not about any of the doc\u00ac\n trines of personal religion, or theology, but\n about Church polity questions.\n</p>\n<p>\n Polity and Separation.\n</p>\n<p>\n Polity had, in short, been in Scotland often\n made the causes of separation between\n</p>\n<p>\n Churches, and in 1834 this unquestionably\n was again the case. The only question was,\n Was the doctrine of polity on which the Free\n Church was founded solely what was called\n spiritual independence, or did it not also\n comprehend the Establishment principle \" I\n am, of course, not to be understood as speak\u00ac\n ing in praise of separation (or for any doc\u00ac\n trine on one side or another of this dispute),\n but no one will understand the present case\n unless he receives inlo his mind the possi\u00ac\n bility of people valuing separation as a safe\u00ac\n guard for doctrines which they hold intense\u00ac\n ly. and as to which they know that the sur\u00ac\n rounding w\u2019orld is indifferent or hostile. And\n the error of the respondents seems to me to\n be that:, shutting their eyes to the extremely\n special and limited raison d ' etre of the Free\n Church, and contemplating themselves as a\n Christian Church, they measure the impor\u00ac\n tance of any doctrine in relation to Chris\u00ac\n tianity as a whole, and not with reference\n to their own distinctive origin.\n</p>\n<p>\n Spiritual Independence and E*tnl)li!ili-\n</p>\n<p>\n nien t.\n</p>\n<p>\n Another fallacy must be guarded against.\n To prove that spiritual independence is more\n important than the Establishment principle\n is only to prove that the latter is in impor\u00ac\n tance subordinate to the former, but it does\n not entitle us to call the Establishment prin\u00ac\n ciple a principle of subordinate importance.\n The true question, as I view the matter, is\n where the two doctrines (spiritual inde\u00ac\n pendence and Establishment) have not been\n made by the founders of the Free Church\n complementary parts of one doctrine. The\n instrument of the highest and most direct\n authority, as evidencing the position of the\n Free Church, is the protest of 1843. It was\n by the Act of Assembly enjoined on the\n Presbyteries to record this protest, together\n with the Act of Separation and Deed of\n Demission at the beginning of their Presby\u00ac\n tery books as the ground warrant of their\n proceedings. The protest seems to me on\n the face of it amply to support the affection\u00ac\n ate remonstrance (already referred to) in\n the assertion that \" we come out on the\n Establishment principle.\u201d The protest is\n that it shall be lawful to them, in the cir\u00ac\n cumstances in which they are placed, to\n withdraw from th e existing Establishment\n (as if this Act required defense). But they\n make this protest:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2019\u2019While firmiy asserting the right and duty\n of the civil magistrate to maintain and sup\u00ac\n port an Establishment of religion in accord\u00ac\n ance with God\u2019s Word, and reserving to our\u00ac\n selves and our successors to strive by all\n lawful means as opportunity shall, in God\u2019s\n providence, be offered to secure the per\u00ac\n formance of this duty agreeably to the Scrip\u00ac\n tures\u201d; and so on.\n</p>\n<p>\n Your Lorships have doubtless read the\n document as a whole, and there is nothing\n in the context which detracts from the sig\u00ac\n nificant and solemn emphasis of what I have\n quoted. They had come to the conclusion\n that, in the circumstances in which they\n found themselves, \u201ca Free Assembly of the\n Church of Scotland as by law established\n cannot at this time be holden,\u201d and there\u00ac\n fore only they came out. A claim, declara\u00ac\n tion, and protest of 1842 is referred to in\n the protest of 1843 as setting forth the true\n constitution of the Church. Now, Lord Low\n admitted that in this document also the\n Establishment principle is affirmed, remarks\n that it is in \u201ca parenthetical way.\u201d The\n simple explanation of the form of the sen\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n tence and of the lesser salieney of the posi\u00ac\n tion assigned to that principle, in this paper,\n is that it is a manifesto from, and by. an\n established Church. The motive of the\n paper is to protest against interference with\n adjudicatories of that Church. Accordingly\n the hypothesis is that Establishment, as a\n principle, requires no vindication or asser\u00ac\n tion, and it, in fact, only enters the argu\u00ac\n ment when the loss of Establishment is re\u00ac\n ferred to as one of the national dangers im\u00ac\n pending. But the references in this connec\u00ac\n tion are of unmistakable import. The un\u00ac\n qualified language of the protest of 1843\u2014\n the document which, as we have seen, each\n Presbytery was to take as the warrant for\n its proceedings\u2014stands witness, therefore,\n of the distinctive principles of the Free\n Church. I have already spoken of the af\u00ac\n fectionate representation of 1843 as the man\u00ac\n ifesto on which endowment was invited, and\n these two historical papers are those which\n bear most directly on the question, what\n are the trusts of this foundation? There are\n a number of authoritative documents of the\n General Assembly in following years, and\n having examined them all, I find them all\n to bear out the statements made to the\n public in the affectionate representation.\n The degree of prominence attached to the\n one or to the other of the Church\u2019s doc\u00ac\n trines, of course, depends on the occasion\n of the pronouncement, and it would be un\u00ac\n fair to isolate any statement from its mo\u00ac\n tive and context. I shall mention three ut\u00ac\n terances as instructive in more ways than\n one, especially as the first of these is found\u00ac\n ed on by the respondents. In 1851 (the\n matter in hand rendering this appropriate)\n it is spiritual independence that is put in\u00ac\n to the \u201cparenthesis,\u201d and the Establishment\n principle that is substantively asserted.\n</p>\n<p>\n \" While this Church has ever held that\n she possesses an independent and exclusive\n jurisdiction or power in all ecclesiastical\n matters,\u201d and so on, \u201cshe has at the same\n time always strenuously advocated the doc\u00ac\n trine taught in Holy Scripture, that nations\n and their rulers are bound to own the truth\n of God, and to advance the Kingdom of His\n Son, the Assembly goes on in a historical\n review of Scottish history to illustrate how\n this had been done, and how it had not been\n done, the first instances approved being the\n statutes establishing iho Church in 1567 and\n 1592.\n</p>\n<p>\n Now in this paper there occurs a passage\n which has beeu founded on by by the re\u00ac\n spondents, in which the Assembly says that\n</p>\n<p>\n \" It is her being free, and not her being\n established that constitutes the real his\u00ac\n torical and hereditary identity of the Re\u00ac\n formed National Church of Scotland.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Of course it is not the fact of her being\n established that constitutes the identity, or\n the Free Church claim would be impossible;\n but I entirely fail to \u00a9ee what this has to\n say to the principle of establishment. This\n argument of the respondents is merely an\u00ac\n other instance of the recurring fallacy which\n confuses the fact of a Church being estab\u00ac\n lished with the holding by a Church of the\n Establishment principle. The \u201cAct 7, 1853,\u201d\n is \u201canent the principle\u00a9 of the r -urch.\u201d it\n is short and unequivocal, and it conb-ins an\n authoritative exposition or glos6 of the\n claim, declaration, and protest of 1842, and\n the protest of 1842. It\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cDeclares that this Church maintains un\u00ac\n altered and uncompromised the principles\n \u00a9et forth in the claim, declaration, and pro\u00ac\n test of 1842, and the protest of 1842, relative\n to the lawfulness and obligation of a Scrip-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0024/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 193, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 281}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0024/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 387, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 562}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0024/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 775, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1125}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0024/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2250}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0024/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3103, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4500}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0024/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ot/ti/sh/ch/ur/ch/ap/00/gr/ea/scottishchurchap00grea/scottishchurchap00grea_0024.jp2", "height": 4500, "width": 3103, "levels": 6, "size": 1002850}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"24\">\n<p>\n THE SCOTTISH FREE CHURCH CASE.\n</p>\n<p>\n tural alliance between the Church of Christ\n and the State.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It will be remembered that in the protest\n the protestors reserved to themselves, their\n successor.;!\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cTo strive by all lawful means to secure\n the performance of the duty of the State to\n support an establishment of religion in ac\u00ac\n cordance with God\u2019s work.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n So now the General Assembly goes to ex\u00ac\n plain that there is not in 1853 any \u201cpresent\n call\u201d to take steps in that direction.

What has\n now been said relates to authoritative dec\u00ac\n larations of the Free Church herself, and\n now a word must be said of her inherited\n standards. I shall put the argument very\n low, indeed, when I say that the Confession\n of Faith, on the face of it, is consistent with\n the high place given by the Disruption lead\u00ac\n ers to the Establishment principle. It is\n quite certain that the Confession of Faith is\n inexorably opposed to the theory of re\u00ac\n ligious equality, which is, as we have seen,\n to this day avowed by the United Presbytery\n who now form part of the respondents\u2019\n Church. The notion that the state is to\n stand neutral between religions\u2014which is\n what is meant by religious equality\u2014is dia\u00ac\n metrically opposed to the whole teaching of\n John Knox upon this subject, and on this\n occasion I cannot do better than quote from\n one of the Disruption leaders themselves,\n the historian of \u201cThe Ten Years\u2019 Conflict\u201d\n 187G edition, pp. 3i\u00bb and 41 of vol. i.).\n \u201cKnox,\u201d says Dr. Robert Buchanan, \u201cand\n Us enlightened and able associates were\n lear and decided about these two things\u2014\n rst, that no state can, without grievous sin,\n lend its countenance to the Roman Anti\u00ac\n christ, or to any false religion whatever; and,\n second, that every state is bound to em\u00ac\n brace, acknowledge and encourage the true\n religion.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n In Scotland, as everywhere else, at the pe\u00ac\n riod of the Reformation, the duty of the\n state to own and uphold the true religion\n was looked upon as a first principle, which\n fid not require and hardly admitted of dis\u00ac\n cussion. To those who realize the high theo\u00ac\n cratic views of the sixteenth and seven\u00ac\n teenth centuries in Scotland it is ea\u00bby to\n</p>\n<p>\n understand that the autonomy of God\u2019s\n Church and the duty of the State to support\n it were but two essential parts of the one\n great conception of the Christian nation, and\n this is in truth the clew to the Disruption\n documents. On the specific question about\n the twenty-third chapter of the Confession\n of Faith I own that I read with some sur-\n prise that doubts had been entertained by\n learned Judges as to effect cf the w r ords that\n it is the duty of the civil magistrate to\n \u201ctake order that the ordinances of God be\n duly settled, administered and observed.\u201d I\n must still take leave to think that those\n words do describe what we call Establish\u00ac\n ment, and I observe that in the Campbel\u00ac\n town case, where these observations were\n made, the question before the Court was\n State endowment, which is a different thing.\n On all the grounds which I have stated I\n come to the conclusion that the doctrine of\n Establishment was one of the distinctive and\n fundamental doctrines of the Free Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n I shall now mention one or two points in\n the judgments in the Court of Session; so far\n as relating to that question, which demand\n attention.\n</p>\n<p>\n A Very Curious Objection.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lord Trayner, whose judgment is most\n clear, has stated a very curious objection to\n the likelihood of the Establishment princi\u00ac\n ple being a fundamental doctrine of a\n Church. His Lordship finds it\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cDifficult to hold that a mere opinion as\n to what some third person was bound to\n do, which he might neglect or refuse to do,\n and which the Church could not compel him\n to do, could in any way be an essential part\n of the constitution of the Church which held\n that opinion.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This difficulty really arises out of the\n time-honored personification of the State as\n the civil magistrate. It would certainly not\n have been admitted by John Knox, even\n when Queen Mary represented the civil mag\u00ac\n istrate, and in these latter days of popular\n power the civil magistrate sits in every\n pew, and his religious duty may be preached\n from every pulpit. Again, Lord Trayner\n thinks that\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe history of the Free Church shows\n that, as a Church, apart from the opinions\n of individual members, it did not regard the\n Establishment principle as one of its fund\u00ac\n amental principles.\u201d.\n</p>\n<p>\n I pause to observe that I have founded, in\n no instance, on the opinion of individual\n members, but on the collective and official\n declarations of the Church. Now, his Lord\u00ac\n ship\u2019s first point is:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt was from the commencement, and down\n to the date of its union, a Church con\u00ac\n ducted and maintained, in point of fact,\n according to the Voluntary principle. If\n in theory it was something else, the theory\n did not square with the fact.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This comes to no more than that the Free\n Church had not, in fact, State endowment,\n which is the hypothesis without which no\n question could arise. His Lordship\u2019s next\n point is that the Free Church not only did\n nothing to give effect to the Establishment\n principle, but on the contrary, devoted much\n of its tiiqe and energy to bring about if it\n could the disestablishment of the Church\n of Scotland. Now this agitation took place\n only in the latter, and a s the appellants\n would say, the backsliding days, when union\n with the Voluntaries also came in view.\n The important correction to be made is that\n nothing of this kind took place in times\n which, in any possible view, can be looked\n to as evidencing the principles of the Church\n</p>\n<p>\n set up in 1843, and therefore as fixing the\n scope of this foundation. I find in Lord\n Trayner\u2019s judgment an antithesis set up be\u00ac\n tween matter of faith (and sometimes the\n Latin equivalent is used) and matter of\n polity. This can only be important if what\n is matter of polity as distinguised from mat\u00ac\n ter of faith cannot be made by a Church\n one of its distinctive and fundamental doc\u00ac\n trines in the sense of this controversy. I\n have already given my reasons for thinking\n this untenable, and the distinction there\u00ac\n fore inconclusive. The Lord Justice-Clerk\n attaches very great, and Lord Trayner great\n importance to the decision in the Campbel\u00ac\n town case, to which I have already alluded.\n Now, that decision was that the principle of\n State endowment was not an essential or\n fundamental doctrine of a particular congre\u00ac\n gation in Campbeltown. It was not Free\n Church congregation at all, and the question\n arose before 1843. The judge thought that\n as mere adherence to the Confession of\n Faith did not pledge that congregation to\n the doctrine of State endowment, but what\n in my judgment ties the Free Church to the\n doctrine now in question are acts with which\n the Campbeltown congregation had nothing\n to do, the doctrine is State Establishment.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Doctrine of \u201cThe Early Days.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n I must add that the grounds upon which\n the Lord Justice-Clerk comes to the con\u00ac\n clusion that the principle of Establishment\n was in the early days of the Free Church\n treated as \u201csubordinate\u201d do not seem \\ ,y\n cogent. In the first place, he quotes as\n proving the doctrine of \u201cthe early days\u201d\n two documents which belong to the later\n days, 1871 and 1873, and must be read in\n the light of their dates. Bur, further, to\n say that in 1844 the \u201cprinciple of Estab\u00ac\n lishment was repudiated\u201d is to ignore the\n whole theory of the appellants\u2019 case, and the\n argument it gives rise to. Lord Low de\u00ac\n cided the case on the ground that the Es\u00ac\n tablishment principle was not so essential\n that the General Assembly could not de\u00ac\n part from it. He expresses a cautious and\n guarded view as to its power to deal with\n what he deems more essenti:.l doctrines.\n The Lord Justice-Clerk seems to take much\n the same view, but he rates very high the\n \u201clegislative\u201d power of the Church. Lord\n Trayner, however, takes a much bolder po\u00ac\n sition\u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThat the Establishment principle had\n been explicablv explained in 1843 to be an\n essential principle of the Free Church. I\n think the Church had the power to abandon\n that principle, and to that extent alter the\n original constitution.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Lord Trayner\u2019s view tvas argued at your\n Lordship\u2019s bar with great vigor and confi\u00ac\n dence. Before proceeding to consider this\n argument, I ought to point out that the\n judgment of Lord Young is wholly rested\n upon the ground, stated in very sweeping\n terms, that there is nothing to prevent a\n dissenting Church from abandoning a reli\u00ac\n gious doctrine, however essential and funda\u00ac\n mental, and that an ex-facie absolute prop\u00ac\n erty title cannot be limited by reference\n note expressed to \u201cthe essential doctrines\n and fundamental principles in the consti\u00ac\n tution of the Church.\u201d It is unnecessary to\n sa y more of this ground of judgment than\n that it is a flat contradiction of the deci\u00ac\n sion of your Lordships in the ease of Craig-\n dallie.\n</p>\n<p>\n Elastic Powers of Altering Constitn-\n t ion.\n</p>\n<p>\n The more plausible theory of the respon\u00ac\n dents is that there are to be fovand inherent\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0025/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 193, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 281}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0025/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 387, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 562}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0025/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 775, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1125}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0025/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2250}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0025/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3103, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4500}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0025/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ot/ti/sh/ch/ur/ch/ap/00/gr/ea/scottishchurchap00grea/scottishchurchap00grea_0025.jp2", "height": 4500, "width": 3103, "levels": 6, "size": 1145449}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"25\">\n<p>\n THE SCOTTISH TREE CHURCH CASE.\n</p>\n<p>\n 23\n</p>\n<p>\n in the Free Church some extremely elast ; c\n powers of altering her constitution. Those\n powers, it is said, were as much a quality\n of the Free Church when it received the\n endowments now in dispute as the doctrine\n of Establishment, and any one giving to the\n Church gave on that footing. This must\n mean, if it has any effect on the present\n controversy, that such alterations may be\n made by a majority of the General Assembly\n with the consent of a majority of Presby\u00ac\n teries. The extent of the powers so claimed\n is shown by the respondents\u2019 counsel having\n avowed that they held that the Free Church\n could do away with the Confession of Faith\n as one of her standards, and Lord Trayner\n is not prepared to say that the doctrine of\n the divinity of Christ does not stand in the\n same precarious position. I shall state in\n advance the answers to this view and then\n examine the opinions of the Court in a little\n more detail. First, the learned Judges have\n greatly overrated the \u201clegislative\u201d power of\n the Church, misled by what I think an er\u00ac\n roneous construction of the Barrier Act.\n Second, putting this legislative power as\n high as you choose, it is a power affecting\n the internal affairs of the Church, and has no\n relation at all and for historical reasons can\n not have, to such operations as this Union\n of 19C0. Third, the Lord Justice-Clerk has\n been completely misinformed as to the tenets\n of the three dissenting bodies, whose unions\n with the Free Church in 1853 and 1876 his\n Lordship regards as precedents and this error\n brings the argument from actual practice to\n the ground. The main ground of the re\u00ac\n spondents\u2019 argument is the Barrier Act of\n 107. It is an Act of the General Assem\u00ac\n bly, and Lord Trayner says that it \u201ccon\u00ac\n fers\u201d on the Assembly a certain legislative\n power. Now, if the Barrier Act be exam\u00ac\n ined it will be seen that it does not \u201ccon\u00ac\n fer\u201d or purport to \u201cconfer\u201d any legislative\n power. What it does, it imposes certain\n checks on sudden alterations or innovations\n in doctrine ' worship, discipline, or govern\u00ac\n ment. The respondents\u2019 argument is that\n this implies that the General Assembly has\n unlimited power of legislation in the mat\u00ac\n ters named. I do not think this a legiti\u00ac\n mate deduction. The Act, on the contrary,\n rather hints that some recent Acts had\n been of questionable legality, or at least\n had not commanded \u201cexact obedience.\u201d It\n named doctrine, worship, discipline and\n government, not as being the ambition of the\n Assembly\u2019s power, but as the regions of ap\u00ac\n prehended attack. When all this is read in\n the light of contemporary history, the mo\u00ac\n tive of the Barrier Act is obvious as a desire\n to ward off incursions of the Episcopalians.\n And I do not think that at the very most\n it comes to more than furnishing some ev\u00ac\n idence that the General Assembly either had\n been dealing, or might be induced to deal,\n with those high matters. The respondents\u2019\n argument incidentally calling attention to\n a prior Act of Assembly about innovations\n is instructive in the same direction, for this\n Act (August 6, 1641) forbids novation in doc\u00ac\n trine to be brought in pr practiced in the\n Kirk, unless it be first propounded, exam\u00ac\n ined, and allowed in the General Assembly.\n The inference from this, if the respondents\u2019\n argument were applied to it, must be that,\n according to use, novations in doctrine had\n formerly been brought in by the inferior\n Courts or officers of the Church, and that\n this was the law.\n</p>\n<p>\n Historical Fact.\n</p>\n<p>\n But on the question of hL.oi uJ fact there\n</p>\n<p>\n is no need to rely on the implications (for\n</p>\n<p>\n they are no more) of one Act of Assembly.\n Where is the Act, where are the Acts which\n evidence the actual exercise of those powers?\n The respondents\u2019 appeal to the Act of 1560,\n adopting Knox\u2019s Confession of Faith, entire-\n j ly fails them. It was adopted by the Es-\n | tates, as Mr. Taylor Innes very justly ob\u00ac\n serves in a passage which appears in the\n first though not in the second edition of his\n admirable work on creeds.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cNothing,\u201d he says, \u201ccan be clearer than\n that the doctrine\u2014not adopted in any way\n upon the authority of the new-born or Re\u00ac\n formed Church\u2014all the forms of free and de\u00ac\n liberate voting of the doctrine as truth as\n the creed of the Estates, not of the Church,\n were gone through.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Of the other most extreme instances of in-\n ; dependent action which were cited, it may be\n observed that the Book of Discipline was not\n an alteration of an existing creed, ex\u00ac\n cept to the indirect extent to which an added\n standard usually affects the authority of the\n old, even if (as here) both old and new were\n consentaneous, that the adoption of the cove\u00ac\n nant was a revolutionary act in a revolu\u00ac\n tionary time, that the Westminster Confes\u00ac\n sion of Faith, while it was adopted by the\n Gener. 1 Assembly (with certain qualifica-\n tLns) was the offspring of Parliamentary ac\u00ac\n tion, initiated before the General Assembly\n i took it up. Of the two modern instances, the\n Chapel Act and the Veto Act, the Chapel Act\n was held by its authors to be so clearly de\u00ac\n claratory that it was not sent down to Pres\u00ac\n byteries under the Barrier Act. and the\n whole theory of the Free Church party was\n that neither Act was an alteration of the\n constitution of the Church, - so much so that\n the Assembly hesitated before sending the\n Veto Act to the Presbyteries. The case of\n the respondents, therefore, on the Barrier\n Act does not stand the test of examination,\n and does not support their theory that, in\n giving to the Free Church, the pious found\u00ac\n ers of the Free Church were knowingly giving\n to a Church one of whose inherent qualities\n was that she could alter her essential prin\u00ac\n ciples. Neither history nor law make this\n out. The House is in a much better condi\u00ac\n tion to deal with this question after the re\u00ac\n hearing than before it, because of the com\u00ac\n plete presentation in print of the historical\n documents relied on. In my own case a very\n careful study of those papers has largely in\u00ac\n creased my confidence in rejecting the re\u00ac\n spondents\u2019 argument. I find nothing from be\u00ac\n ginning to end which supports the theory\n that the Church of Scotland exercised or\n claimed the right to alter doctrines which\n she had asserted to be Scriptural. (I am not\n now, of course, speaking of the doctrine of\n Establishment, which is in dispute, but of\n doctrine generally, and more especially of the\n Confession of Faith.)\n</p>\n<p>\n The Second Book o\u00a3 Discipline.\n</p>\n<p>\n Amid the mass of documents the Second\n Book of Discipline has been confidently re\u00ac\n lied on by the respondents. Conceding, as\n I think is their right, that this book was an\n adopted standard of the Free Church, I fail\n to discover in it any help in their present\n trouble. That it stood them in good stead\n about non-intrusion is certain, but this not\n hujus loci. What strikes any one who reads\n the book through is that it is not, and does\n not purport to be, a picture of an existing\n institution, and even as an ideal it is vague.\n As matter of fact, it was promulgated before\n the system of Presbyterian government had\n been systematized and set up in Scotland. It\n is not surprising, therefore, that beyond\n negativing the theory of Episcopacy, it con\u00ac\n tains no recognizable description of the\n</p>\n<p>\n Scotch Presbyterian Kirk as an ecclesiastical\n organism, and more particularly it never\n confronts the question with which your\n Lordships have to deal, viz., what control has\n that ecclesiastical organism even when\n taken as a whole\u2014and still less when exam\u00ac\n ined in its parts\u2014over her doctrine? The\n truth is that here, as throughout the case,\n the respondents mistake the emphatic de\u00ac\n nial of the right of the State to meddle with\n those matters, for an assertion of the right\n of the Church to absolute power over her\n own declared doctrine. The passage mainly\n relied on\u2014chapter 7, head 8\u2014proves too\n much, for it applies to all the four kinds\n of Assemblies, but, on the face of it, it deal3\n with ordinances depending for their utility\n on circumstances of time and place, and this\n cannot possibly include doctrine. The only\n hint or reference to the subject of doctrine\n in relation to a judicatory (in seven, 25)\n would rather imply that ecumenical councils\n are the bodies to declare doctrine; but this\n is not clear, and it is enough to say that the\n subject now before us is not dealt with in re\u00ac\n lation to the Scotch Kirk.\n</p>\n<p>\n Consuetudinary I.avr\u00ab \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n One admitted fact, indeed, in what may be\n called the consuetudinary law, or common\n law of the Established Church, and the Free\n Church directly negatives this theory of the\n unrestricted command of the Church over\n her creeds. The General Assembly itself is\n made up of commissioners, and each commis\u00ac\n sion is in writing. By immemorial custom\n this commission bears that the commission\u00ac\n ers are to repair to the Assembly.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAnd there to consult, vote and determine\n in all matters that come before them, to the\n glory of God and the good of the Church\n according to the Word of God, the Confession\n of Faith, and agreeably to the constitution\n of the Church, as they shall be answer-\n able.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, I must own my inability to see how\n it would fall within this mandate to do away\n with, or help to do away with, the Con\u00ac\n fession of Faith as standards of the Free\n Church, and I mention this as testing ilie\n argument for the unlimited power of the\n General Assembly under the Barrier Act. It\n has, indeed, been attempted to use one re\u00ac\n mark of Lord Cranworth, in Forbes v. Eden,\n as implying that in all Churches there is a\n legislative power. The case was that of a\n specific change on one of the canons of the\n Scotch Episcopal Church, made by Synod of\n that body, and I do not think it was laid\n down as law that powers of legislation are\n necessarily inherent in every dissenting\n body, this being in each case really a ques\u00ac\n tion of fact. But Lord Cranworth\u2019s remarks\n make perfectly clear that what he is speak\u00ac\n ing of is entirely internal regulation, and\n it is here that the whole argument of the\n respondents about legislation falls short of\n the required conclusion. To revert to the\n Presbyterian Church of Scotland it may be\n a merit or a demerit, but the original and\n historical theory of the Reformed Church\n of Scotland was that within, and not outside\n her pale, was truth to be found. Without\n were Prelatists and Papists. When later on\n some Presbyterians had held aloof from the\n revolution settlement, and still later others\n had made the several secessions of the eigh\u00ac\n teenth century, their attitude, and the at\u00ac\n titude of their parent Church never raised\n the question of comprehension, the seceders\n in more than one instance having .been de\u00ac\n posed.

Tho second case of \u201cunion\u201d\n is that of the Original United Seceders, an\u00ac\n other of the bodies who held by the Coven\u00ac\n anting traditions. They in 1852 had come to\n be satisfied that\n</p>\n<p>\n \" We may with honor and consistency drop\n our position of secession and maintain our\n principle in communion with the Church of\n Scotland. Accordingly they were received\n and admitted by the Free Church as pastors,\n congregations, and kirk sessions of the Free\n Church of Scotland.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The other case of union took place in 1876,\n also in the days of the Free Church. It is\n founded upon by the Lord Justice-Clerk in\n his judgment under misapprehension, which,\n unfortunately, enters pretty deeply into his\n Lordship\u2019s judgment. The Lord Justice-\n Clerk says of the Reformed Presbyterian\n Church that it \u201ccertainly did not hold the\n Establishment principle,\u201d and for this sur\u00ac\n prising statement he gives as his reason\n that since 1689 they declined to become mem\u00ac\n bers of the Church of Scotland as estab\u00ac\n lished, abode by their objections to the Rev\u00ac\n olution settlement, and did not\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cCommit themselves to an approval of an\n alliance of the Church with the British State\n as at present constituted, having in view\n</p>\n<p>\n especially the unscriptural character of its\n ecclesiastical relations.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Now, so far from the Reformed Presby\u00ac\n terians not holding the Establishment prin\u00ac\n ciple, they were the ecclesiastical heirs of\n theCovenanters, who held it passionately, and\n they represented the extreme right in Pres\u00ac\n byterian orthodoxy; but they washed their\n hands of the Revolution settlement because\n the same State which established the Presby\u00ac\n terian Church in Scotland ignored the \u201csec\u00ac\n ond Reformation, \" and established in Eng\u00ac\n land the Prelatical Church, against w ' hich\n we had never ceased to be denounced by the\n Church of the second Reformation. Accord\u00ac\n ingly, the attitude of the Reformed Presby\u00ac\n terians on the Establishment question was\n exactly analogous to that of the Free Church.\n Holding the Establishment principle, they\n held aloof from the existing Establishment,\n because, as they held, constituted on w ' rong\n terms. The statement of the Lord Justice-\n Clerk, therefore, can only be supported if\n his Lordship means that men do not hold the\n Establishment principle if they decline to\n join the Establishment as constituted at the\n time, and if this be sound it furnishes (as\n already pointed out) a very simple end of the\n present case. The net result, then, of the\n history of these unions is this, and nothing\n more, that where the General Assembly have\n been satisfied about Presbyterian bodies,\n that they held the same standards as them\u00ac\n selves, and were sound on the Establishment\n principle, those bodies have been admitted\n w ' ith full honors. 1 have hitherto discussed\n the case as relating to the general propriety\n of the Free Church, and I have come to the\n conclusion that the appellants are entitled\n to prevail. The other action only differs\n because of the Model Trust Deed. Of it I\n have only to say that it is, and was, treated\n in its inception as a conveyancer\u2019s instru\u00ac\n ment, that its clauses about union seem to\n me to apply necessarily only to such unions\n as were competent to the Free Church, and\n that they are entirely satisfied, and were\n probably suggested by such cases as had\n occurred. It is not in such a deed that you\n can look for constitutional changes or for\n new r powers not hitherto possessed. \u2022\n</p>\n<p>\n The Clinreli Property.\n</p>\n<p>\n Regarding the whole of the property now '\n in dispute, I cannot see bow in law or in\n fairness a majority of the men who ac\u00ac\n quired it on the representations made for\n the effective representation could have been\n allowed, say, in 1850, to carry off the proper\u00ac\n ty to the Voluntaries, and come forward\n arm in arm with the Voluntaries and claim\n it for the fused body; and, after all the ar\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n gument we have heard, I have discovered no\n reason which makes that fair and lawful\n in 1900 which would not have been so fifty\n years earlier. A serious and weighty argu\u00ac\n ment was addressed to your Lordships on\n both sides of the bar relating to the Con\u00ac\n fession of Faith. That argument treated of\n two separate matters, which in my judg\u00ac\n ment must be separately considered. The\n first is whether the respondents have not\n deposed the Confession of Faith from its\n place of authority as a standard of the\n Church, and whether tins of itself does not\n take them outside tho trusts under which\n the property is held. The second, and quite\n separate question is whether on one specific\n doctrine\u2014viz., predestination\u2014the new for\u00ac\n mulary is not contradictory of the Confes\u00ac\n sion of Faith. On the former of these ques\u00ac\n tions my judgment is iu favor of the appel\u00ac\n lants. First of all, 1 put aside any confu\u00ac\n sion which may arise from the substitution\n of the Westminster Confession for John\n Knox\u2019s Confession. It is with the ' West\u00ac\n minster Confession that we have to do, and\n it seems to me that if anything .8\n certain it is that the Free Church was\n pledged to the doctrine of the NVcst-\n minster Confession as her doctrine and the\n doctrine of her office-bearers. Through all\n her history, and at every crisis or her his\u00ac\n tory assuming her identity with the his\u00ac\n torical Church of Scotland, she proclaimed\n this on the housetops, and in the most solemn\n and deliberate of her testimonies. Freed\n from State interference in 1843, she proceed\u00ac\n ed to fasten on herself the old obligations\n of her rights in judicial cases to construe\n the Confession of Faith. There is no need\n to speak, but that the Confession of Faith i\u00bb\n \u201cthe truths of God\u201d was solemnly attested :\u2022\n by the personal belief of all w r ho signed it.\n That this was found to be a hard yoke is\n credible, and has been asserted. Of the\n means at the command of the Free Church\n to alleviate this pressure I do not know. Bui\n what she has now done is to. substitute a\n belief in \u201cthe doctrine of the Church as ex\u00ac\n pressed in the Confession of Faith\u201d and the\n general words in the first of the declarations\n adopted by the United Assembly on 31st Oc\u00ac\n tober, 1900, make it plain that the doctrine\n of the Church, as part of her constitution, t3\n intended to be mutable. This places the\n Confession of Faith in a precarious instead\n of a stable position, and, in my opinion,\n this is an abandonment of an essential char\u00ac\n acteristic of the Free Church. Such being\n my opinion, on the more general question\n as to the Confession of Faith, I deem myself\n absolved from the necessity of entering on\n that one of its articles which has been separ\u00ac\n ately discussed\u2014viz., predestination.

Property previously held by trustees\n In trust for the Free Church was trans\u00ac\n ferred to trustees in trust for \u00bbthe united\n body\u2014i. e., the United Free Church\u2014and\n the question raised by the first appeal is\n whether this transfer of property was or\n was not a breach of trust and invalid, al\u00ac\n though sanctioned by the General Assem\u00ac\n bly of the Free Church and by the great\n majority of the members thereof. The\n Court of Sessions decided this question\n against the pursuers, and they have appealed\n to your Lordships\u2019 House against this de\u00ac\n cision. The second appeal-relates to prop\u00ac\n erty conveyed lo trustees for particular\n congregations of the Free Church, the\n trusts of which are fully set out in the\n Model Trust Deed of 1844, which is one of\n the most important documents in the case.\n The question raised by the second appeal\n is whether the trusts declared by that deed\n are confined to members of the Free Church\n represented by the appellants or whether the\n trusts are wide enough to include all the\n members of the United Free Church formed\n in 1900. The Court of Sessions decided this\n question also against the appellants. Both\n appeals are really based up on the ground\n that the union of the two churches could\n not be legally effected consistently with the\n constitution and standard of the Free\n Church, and that consequently the transfer\n of the property of that Church to the United\n Free Church was a breach of trust and in\u00ac\n valid, and that as regards the congregation\u00ac\n al property the benefits of the trusts of the\n Model Trust Deed can only be enjoyed by\n persons professing the doctrines which the\n appellants contend w-ere unalterable doc\u00ac\n trines of the Free Church. My Lords, the\n controversy as to the Church property in\u00ac\n volves the necessity of ascertaining, first,\n the trusts on which that property was held\n before the transfer; and. secondly, the trusts\n on which it was to be held \u2022 afterward.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Crucial OneHtioa.\n</p>\n<p>\n My Lords, the whole controversy turns on\n the powers of the General Assemblies of the\n Free Church. If they have no power to re\u00ac\n lax the fetter which the appellants .ontend\n bound the Free Church hard and fast from\n its birth, then these appellants ought (o suc\u00ac\n ceed, but if, as the Courts in Scotland have\n held, the General Assemblies of the Free\n Church have power to do what they have\n done, then these appeals must fail. I pro\u00ac\n pose therefore to confine my observations\n entirely to this one crucial question. The\n circumstances which led to the secession of\n the founders of the Free Church from the\n Established Church, and the views of the\n seceders are fully set out in the Claim, Dec\u00ac\n laration, and Protest of the 30th May, 1842,\n and in the Protest of the 18th May, 1843.\n These documents and the Model Trust Deed\n framed on the basis of these documents in\n 1844 show that while the seceders renounced\n all the benefits derived by the Established\n Church from its connection with the State,\n and shook off so far as they could, all inter\u00ac\n ference and control by the state, yet they\n</p>\n<p>\n clung tenaciously to the Holy Scriptures, the\n Westminster Confession, the two Catechisms\n and the Second Book of Discipline, and re\u00ac\n garded them as determining and regulating\n their doctrine, worship and government. The\n government of the Church is declared to be\n in the hands of the Church officers, which\n means, in the last resort, the General As\u00ac\n sembly. The powers of this body, as orig\u00ac\n inally established, are to be found in the\n Westminster Confession and in the Second\n Book of Discipline; but the Free Church\n greatly enlarged these powers in 1842 and\n 1851, as will be seen presently. The Claim,\n Declaration and Protest above referred to\n treat the immunity of the General Asoemblv\n from all State control as a fundamental prin\u00ac\n ciple of the Church of Scotland, and the\n Free Church was formed in order to secure\n this immunity more completely than the\n Civil Courts had declared to be possible\n for members of the existing Established\n Church. Freedom from State control in\n spiritual matters, as understood by Free\n Churchmen, is the raison d\u2019etre of the\n Free Church. The address to Her late Maj\u00ac\n esty (30th May, 1842), the Act of Separation,\n and Deed of Demission by Minister (23d May,\n 1843), and the Deed of Demission by Elders\n (30th May, 1843) which followed it, all put\n this ars the great object of the whole move\u00ac\n ment. At the same time, the claims of the\n seceders are declared to be based on the\n constitution and standards of the Church of\n Scotland has heretofore understood, and in\n particular they considered it the duty of the\n State to promote religion as inculcated in\n the Westminster Confession and the other\n \u2022standards of the Established Church. By the\n expression \u201cheretofore understood \" I think\n is meant understood by the Church of\n Scotland, unfettered by legislation and by\n j legal decisions based upon it. I must now\n invite your Lordships\u2019 attention to the pow\u00ac\n ers of a General Assembly of the Church of\n Scotland as declared in the Second Book of\n Discipline (1578), the Westminster Confession\n (1643), ratified by statute 7th June, 1690, and\n the Barrier Act (1697). The Second Book of\n Discipline is referred to in the Claim, Dec\u00ac\n laration and Protest of 1S42 as ope of the\n Church\u2019s authorized standards, and in the\n Act and Declaration of 1851 (which will be\n hereafter mentioned) as one of her earliest\n standards. It is a w ' ofk of great authority.\n Speaking of Assemblies, it is laid down\n (Chapters VII, section 8): '\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThey have power also to abrogate and\n abolish all statutes and ordinances concern\u00ac\n ing ecclesiastical matters that are found\n noisome and unprofitable, and agree not with\n the time or are abused by the people.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This is a very large legislative power ex\u00ac\n ercisable by Gerteral Assemblies r*f the\n whole Church, but not. I should think, by\n email Assemblies, whose functions are more\n circumscribed. ___\n</p>\n<p>\n that Confession. (See Chapter 31, Article 4.)\n But although infallibility is denied them,\n great power is conferred upon them, for\n Synods and Councils are to determine con\u00ac\n troversies of faith and to make rules for\n public worship and the government of the\n Church. (See Chapter 31, Article 3.) Their\n power is limited to ecclesiastical as distin\u00ac\n guished from civil affairs. (See Article 5.)\n It is also declared in the Confession itself\n that the Holy Scriptures are the foundation\n of the doctrine contained in the Confession\n and are to be the foundation of the doc\u00ac\n trines of the Church which adopts it. (See\n Chapter 1.) In all controversies of religion\n the Church is finally to appeal unto the\n Holy Scriptures. (Chapter 1, Article 8.)\n Chapters l and 31. when read together, ap\u00ac\n pear to me to confer upon Synods or Coun\u00ac\n cils the power of interpreting the Holy\n Scriptures and the various articles of the\n Confession when controversies arise as to\n their meaning, and as infallibility is dis\u00ac\n claimed it follows that an interpretation put\n by a Synod or Council on Scripture or the\n Confession is not binding for all time, but\n may be modified or even rejected, and be\n replaced by another interpretation adopted\n by a lat^r Synod or Council, and declared\n by it to be in its judgment the true mean\u00ac\n ing of the Scriptures or Confession. I take\n it to be clear that there is a condition im\u00ac\n plied in this, as well as in other instruments,\n which create powers\u2014viz., that the powers\n shall be used bona fide for the purposes for\n which they are conferred. If, therefore, a\n Synod or Council, under color of exercis\u00ac\n ing ihelr authority, were to destroy the\n Church which they were appointed to pre\u00ac\n serve, or were to abrogate the doctrines\n which they were - appointed to maintain,\n their acts would be ultra vires and invalid\n in point of law, and it would be the duty of\n every Court in the United Kingdom so to\n hold if the question ever involved a contro\u00ac\n versy as to civil rights, and so arose for\n judicial decision. For all persons who are\n members of the Church of Scotland its Gen\u00ac\n eral Assembly is the highest Council of the\n Church, and it. is difficult to limit the\n powers conferred upon it by the foregoing\n documents, except by an appeal to the im\u00ac\n plied condition to which I f referred.\n</p>\n<p>\n i-- Difficult Definition.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n ( Ininis of tiie Confession.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Westminster Confession is, next to\n the Hr.ly Scriptures, the most authoritative\n document of all for members of the Scotch\n Church.. It is plain from the language of\n this Confession that its framers laid no\n claim to infallibility for themselves, and\n disclaimed infallibility for the Synods and\n Councils of the Church) that should adopt\n</p>\n<p>\n I cannot agree with those who contend that\n the powers of the General Assembly as de\u00ac\n clared in these documents ' are unlimited; but\n I am not able myself to define the limits of\n its authority mo -- e accurately than above\n stated. It is probably impossible to draw\n a sharp line clearly dividing all Acts of a\n General Assembly which are within its power\n from all Acts which are beyond it; but it\n does not follow that it is impossible, or in\u00ac\n deed difficult to decide in the great majority\n of cases whether a particular act is within\n its power or beyond it. Great as the powers\n are, they are limited by what can be found\n in the Scriptures. The Church must be a\n Christian Church and a reformed Protestant\n Church. So far all is plain. I should my\u00ac\n self think that it must be a Presbyterian\n Church, but this question is disputable and\n happily does not arise.

Extensive\n hut undefined power is there unmistakably\n assumed and recognized. No limit is set to\n it, but very important machinery is provided\n f or its future exercise to prevent hasty de\u00ac\n crees in that respect. The Act is a restrict\u00ac\n ive Act, for unless the prescribed machinery\n ' s adopted an Act of Assembly cannot be\u00ac\n come a \u201cbinding rule and constitution \" of\n the Church, but the restriction only affects\n procedure. The wide powers of the Gen\u00ac\n eral Assembly are not curtailed. This Act\n is, in my opinion, clearly applicable to the\n General Assemblies of the Free Church. It\n was included in what was adopted when that\n Church was created. My Lords, if the case\n row before this House had to be decided\n on the documents to which T have already\n alluded, and without reference to any\n Acts of Parliament or other Ads of\n Assembly, I should hesitate long before I\n came to the conclusion that what the ap\u00ac\n pellants mainly complain of was beyond the\n power of the General Assembly of the Free\n Church. Any interpretation of Scripture or\n of the subordinate standards bona-fide adop\u00ac\n ted by a General Assembly and held by them\n better to express the doctrine intended to be\n expressed by the language used in the Con\u00ac\n fession itself, cannot, in my opinion, be\n treated as beyond their power, but is well\n within it. But there are other documents\n which have to be considered, and especially\n the Model Trust Deed, prepared in 1814,\n under the instructions of the General As\u00ac\n sembly of the Free Church and formally\n approved and adopted by it in 1851. It is\n therein recited that it was at all times an\n essential doctrine of the Church of Scotland\n that it should have a government, in the\n hands of church officers, distinct from the\n civil magistrate or supreme power of the\n State, and that the government comprehends\n \u201cthe whole power of the Keys, \" which ex\u00ac\n pression, I understand, includes those wide\n powers to which I have already referred in\n all matters touching the doctrine, worship,\n discipline and government of the Church.\n Then It. recites the secccion from the Estab\u00ac\n lished Church and the formation of \u201cThe\n General Assembly of the Free Church, with\n all the powers and privileges and the same\n internal government, jurisdiction, and dis\u00ac\n cipline, according to the true and original\n principles of the Church of Scotland before\n the separation. \"\n</p>\n<p>\n The model deed, a sort of conveyance of\n property to trustees at great length, but\n which may be shortly summarized as trus\u00ac\n tees for a place for religious worship by\n members of the Free Church. These Trusts\n clearly contemplate the union of the Free\n Church with \u201cother bodies of Christians as\n the said Free Church of Scotland may at any\n time hereafter associate with themselves.\u201d\n and provision is made for worship by such\n united bodies. The fourth Trust is very\n important. It is to the effect that the\n Trustees shall at all times be subject, in\n the management and control of the Trust\n property, and in all matters and things con\u00ac\n nected therewith, to the regulation and di\u00ac\n rection of the General Assembly for the\n time being of the said body or united body\n of Christians. Provision is made for the\n event of a seccession from the Church\u2014see\n the ninth Trust. These Trusts are con\u00ac\n fined to the congregational property, which\n is the subject of the second appeal, but no\n one suggests that, as regards the constitu\u00ac\n tion of the Free Church and the powers of\n the General Assembly, there is any difference\n between one set of members; and, in my\n</p>\n<p>\n opinion, the Model Trust Deed emphasizes\n and makes plain much that is obscure when\n the subordinate standards alone are looked\n at, especially when the legislation affecting\n them is borne in mind. In the year 1844 1\n trustees were appointed to bold any prop\u00ac\n erty which might be bequeathed or con\u00ac\n veyed to them for the Free Church and also\n such places of worship as might be erected\n on sites granted to trustees nominated by\n the General Assembly, also such other\n places of worship as persons might wish to\n convey to them on the terras of the Model\n Trust Deed. A fresh appointment was\n made in 1871. I pass on to consider what\n was done as regards the union of the Free\n Church with the United Presbyterian\n Church. Union with other Presbyterian\n Churches was apparently desired some fifty\n years ago, but in order to effect union with\n the United Presbyterians several arrange\u00ac\n ments of importance had to be made, par\u00ac\n ticularly with reference to the mutual\n eligibility of the ministers and other officers\n of the two bodies to Church offices and to\n the adjustment of the different views held\n by the two churches respecting predestina\u00ac\n tion and respecting their relation to the\n state and their duties to the state as re\u00ac\n gards religion. It took many years to settle\n these prelminary matters.\n</p>\n<p>\n Legality of Declaratory Act.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1892 the General Assembly of the Free\n Church passed \u201cThe Declaratory Act anent\n the Confession of Faith,\u201d and although a\n small minority of members protested\n against it, I am quite unable to discover\n any valid ground for holding this Act to be\n one which a General Assembly of.the Free\n Church had no power to pass. It no doubt\n relaxed the excessive stringency of certain\n articles of the Westminster Confession if\n construed literally, but jt imposed no new\n fetters, and in relaxing the old ones, and so\n rendering t hem more acceptable to many\n earnest Presbyterians desirous of remain\u00ac\n ing in the Church or becoming members of\n it, the General Assembly were honestly at\u00ac\n tempting to preserve the Free Church and\n its fundamental doctrines, and in my opin\u00ac\n ion there is no pretence for saying That\n they were false to their trust, and were en\u00ac\n deavoring to destroy any doctrine which it\n was their duty to preserve.\n</p>\n<p>\n My Lords, I can understand that an ordi\u00ac\n nary member of the Free Church, brought\n up from childhood to regard the Confession\n as an inspired document to be construed\n literally and in the same sense for all time,\n may take some of the doctrines set forth\n in this Act as unorthodox, but. that is not\n the question on which this appeal turns. The\n question is whether it is competent for the\n governing body of that Church in General\n Assembly, complying with the conditions of\n the Barrier Act. to declare that the Con\u00ac\n fession, properly understood, does not re\u00ac\n quire absolute uniformity of belief on the\n matters dealt with by the Declaratory Act.\n This is the great question at issue between\n the parties to this appeal, and I have come\n to the clear opinion that on this question\n the apelliants arc wrong. I come to this\n conclusion after a careful examination of\n the powers of the General Assembly as con\u00ac\n tained in the documents before referred to.\n These powers are, in my opinion, as funda\u00ac\n mental in the constitution of the Free\n Church of Scotland and as essential to it 3\n preservation as any of the doctrines in the\n Confession or other subordinate standards.\n The appellants made a great point of the\n alteration made by this Declaratory Act in\n the fundamental doctrine of the Free\n</p>\n<p>\n Church respecting the principle of Estab\u00ac\n lishment. by which I understand is mea^t\n the duty of the State to promote religion\n and especially the Presbyterian religion, as\n set forth in the Westminster Confession\n and sanctioned by Parliament, as already\n mentioned. Chapter 23, Article 3, of\n the Confession, declares what, in the\n view of the Church of Scotland, is ih\u00ae\n duty of the State. Its language is very gen\u00ac\n eral and leaves the State to determine in\n what manner it will perform such diBv\n Some at all events of the founders of\n Free Church attached great importance\n this principle of Establishment, which \u25a0\u201d**\n not held by all Scotch Presbyterian Church\u00ac\n es. But it does not follow that ihis principle\n was to be tenaciously adhered to for \u00bbn\n time, and that no future General Assem\u00ac\n bly should have power to modify or relax\n it if. owing to changes of opinion or other\n circumstances, the General Assembly of\n Free Church deliberately came to the conclu\u00ac\n sion that the preservation and healthy\n growth of the Free Church required the prin\u00ac\n ciple to be reconsidered. I cannot come to the\n conclusion that, the view taken in 1843 of\n the duty of the State was a fundamental\n doctrine admitting of no explanation or\n modification. Dr. Chalmers\u2019 address, adopted\n by the Free Church, shows that he and i*s\n then members would have strenuously op\u00ac\n posed the change made, but it does not follow\n that he or they would have denied the pow\u00ac\n er of a future General Assembly to make\n such change after due deliberation. A\u00ae T\n understand the matter, the Free Church < * > > \u2022\n and does fulfill all her spiritual function*\n without any State aid. and the attempt to\n obtain aid from the State, whilst repudiat\u00ac\n ing all St & te control, has proved a failure.\n This doctrine as to the duty of the State,\n whether best described as a political or re\u00ac\n ligious doctrine, is a doctrine which the Gen\u00ac\n eral Assembly could, in my opinion, re\u00ac\n peal or modify as might he expedient. Tn\n 1900 the Act uniting the two Churches was\n passed by the Free Church of Scotland af\n ter complying with all the conditions of the\n Barrier Act. The Act was dated the 31st\n October, 1900, and the two Churches were\n then formed into one under the name of the\n United Free Church of Scotland, and Us su\u00ac\n preme governing body was designated the\n General Assembly of the United Free Church\n of Scotland. Having regard to the consti\u00ac\n tution of the Free Church.

Both appeals are based on the erro\u00ac\n neous view that the Free Church had no\n freedom, but that it was bound hard and\n fast to certain doctrines expressed in lun-\n guage admitting for all time of only one\n meaning. I am quite unable so to regard it.\n The struggle for liberty was not so abortive\n as that. In the course of the argument the\n many statutes and decisions were referred\n to. These which related to conflicts with the\n Established Church of Scotland are not\n so important for the present pur\u00ac\n pose as those which relate to disputes be\u00ac\n tween members of non-Established Churches.\n The decisions relating to the Established\n Church (viz., the Auchterarder case and\n other Scotch casts referred to in argument)\n would be all-important if your Lordships\n had to consider the validity of acts done by\n the General Assembly of the Established\n Church of Scotland, for that Church is gov\u00ac\n erned not only by the Westminster Confes\u00ac\n sion and Acts of Assembly, but also by stat\u00ac\n utory enactments which make reform in her\n doctrines, worship, discipline and govern\u00ac\n ment difficult, if not impossible, without leg\u00ac\n islation. But the Free Church is emanci\u00ac\n pated from these fetters. As formed in\n 1843, the Free Church was purely a Volun\u00ac\n tary religious association, both Christian\n \u00abnd Protestant, and believed by its founders\n to he Divinely instituted, professing doc\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n trines based on the Scriptures and the old\n subordinate standards, governing itself by\n certain rules and providing a representative\n Assembly of its own for explaining its doc\u00ac\n trines and for preserving the association by\n making such changes in its worship, disci\u00ac\n pline and government as might be found ex\u00ac\n pedient; after consulting the whole body as\n required by the Barrier Act. A Trust for the\n Free Church is in my opinion, a Trust for\n such persons as stall hold the doctrines and\n submit in ecclesiastical matters to the gov\u00ac\n ernment and discipline adopted by the found- |\n ers of the Free Church, with such modifica\u00ac\n tions as may be made from time to time by\n the General Assembly of that Church, pro\u00ac\n vided the conditions required by the Barrier\n Act are observed and provided the Church\n is preserved as a reformed Church with\n Presbyterian government.\n</p>\n<p>\n In CotU ' lnMinn.\n</p>\n<p>\n There is no statutory or other law which\n makes such an association illegal, or which\n compels it to accept the Westminster Con\u00ac\n fession whether with or without modifica\u00ac\n tion. The founders of the Free Church did\n accept it, but only subject to the powers\n which they insisted were invested in the\n General Assembly of that Church. So long,\n therefore, as the General Assembly does not\n exceed those powers, or act contrary to some\n statutory or other law of Scotland, or com\u00ac\n mit any breach of trust, as above explained,\n it is not the function of any civil Court to\n interfere with it. This I regard as settled\n by the decision of your Lordships\u2019 House in\n Craigdallie vs. Aikman (Dow, 1 and 2), Bligh\n (529), Forbes and Eden (L. R. 1 Sc., and div.\n app. 568), and is in entire accordance with the\n general law of trusts applicable to such as\u00ac\n sociations as the Free Church. The distinc\u00ac\n tion between an erroneous decision by a body\n</p>\n<p>\n having jurisdiction to deal with a particular\n subject matter and a decision by a body\n having no jurisdiction over (ho matter de\u00ac\n cided is familiar to all lawyers, and must be\n steadily borne in mind in tills ease. In pas\u00ac\n sing the Declaratory Act of 1892 and the\n Act of Union of 1900, I can discover nothing\n ultra vires or contrary to any law; still less\n can I discover anything ultra vires or con\u00ac\n trary to any law in the interpretation put by\n the General Assembly of the Free Church on\n some of the articles in the Westminster Con\u00ac\n fession or in the alterations made in the\n declarations and forms to be made and signed\n by the ministers ahd officers of the Church.\n It foliows ihat. in my opinion, the transfer\n of property which is complained of (and\n which was simply consequential on the Acts\n of Assembly of 1892 and 1900) was neither\n ultra vires nor contrary to any law, and can\u00ac\n not therefore be successfully impeached.\n The foregoing observations apply to both ap\u00ac\n peals, but the second appeal appears to me\n to present less difficulty than the first. I\n ! regret that any ministers should have been\n excluded from their offices; but the Trusts\n declared by the model Trust Deed are clear\n and explicit, and their validity cannot be\n questioned by those who have no title to the\n property to which it applies, except under\n the provisions of that deed. There has been\n no breach cf the Trusts declared by the\n model Trust Deed. My Lords, I might have\n contented myself with paying that I concur\u00ac\n red in the decision of the Court of Session;\n but the question between the parties is of\n such great importance, and its solution re\u00ac\n quires a careful study of so many documents,\n statutes and decisions, that I considered I\n should not be adequately discharging my duty\n to this House if I did not set forth as clearly\n as I could the reasons which have induced\n me to give my voice for the dismissal of both\n appeals, with costs.\n</p>\n<p>\n tJiC\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n Lord Richard Everard Alverstone on the\n Trust Phase of the Case.\n</p>\n<p>\n Lord Alverstone said: My Lords, inas\u00ac\n much as 1 am differing in a Scotch appeal\n from the judgment of the Lord Ordinary, af\u00ac\n firmed tinaniinou-sly by the Second Division\n of the Court of Session. I think it only right\n that ' I should state my reasons for the judg\u00ac\n ment which I am about to give. The ques\u00ac\n tion raised by these appeals is whether\n funds invested in the names of trustees, and\n real property held on trust for the behoof\n of the Free Church of Scotland, have been\n dealt with in a way which constitutes a\n breach of trust. Both classes of property\n are now beiDg applied, or it is proposed to\n apply them, for the purposes of the United\n Free Church, being a body of Christians\n formed by a union, or attempted union, of\n a great majority of the ministers and elders\n of the Free Church of Scotland with the\n ministers and elders of the United Presby\u00ac\n terian Church of Scotland, and the point to\n be decided ia whether, having regard to the\n purposes for which the money and property\n were originally subscribed, given, be\u00ac\n queathed or conveyed, such application con\u00ac\n stitutes a breach of trust. The union, or\n</p>\n<p>\n attempted union, was assented to and ap\u00ac\n proved of by a very large majority of the\n ministers and elders and congregations of\n the Free Chvirch\u2014the actual numbers are\n not material, but as I understand all except\n some thirty of the ministers approved of the\n proposed union. But the dissenting minori\u00ac\n ty represent a very considerable body of ad\u00ac\n herents to congregations of the Free Church\n who do not approve of, and some of whom\n have protested against the proposed union.\n Law un to Fund*.\n</p>\n<p>\n The law applicable to funds which have\n been given for the purpose of a voluntary\n association, such as the Free Church, is well\n settled, and it is not necessary for me to do\n more than refer to the decision of your\n Lordships in Craigdallie vs. Aikman to show\n that such funds, in the absence of express\n provision, must be applied for the benefit of\n those who adhere to the original principles\n of the founders. If the term\u2019 of the founda\u00ac\n tion of the trust provide for the case of\n schism, the Courts will give effect to them,\n but if there be no such provision the\n cestuis que trust are those who adhere to\n</p>\n<p>\n the fundamental principles upon which th\u00bb\n association was founded.\n</p>\n<p>\n Origin of the Free Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Free Church of Scotland was formed\n in the year 1843 by what is called the Dis\u00ac\n ruption, or, in other words, the secession\n from the Established Church of Scotland of\n a large body of the ministers of the Estab\u00ac\n lished Church, who, renounced entirely the\n pecuniary benefits of their connection with\n the Establishment in maintenance of a pro\u00ac\n test which they had made against the inter\u00ac\n ference by the civil Courts with rights which\n they considered to be the rights of the\n Church. It is not necessary to trace the his\u00ac\n tory of the Established Church down to 1843\n or the history of the various secessions\n which had taken place before that date, but\n it is sufficient to say that those who founded\n the Free Church separated from the Estab\u00ac\n lished Church not upon any question of doc\u00ac\n trine. but solely upon the ground which I\n have just mentioned, and which ground is\n in no way inconsistent with the principle of\n Establishment.

It is necessary to\n consider carefully what was the constitution\n of the Free Church in so far as it throws\n light upon the question raised for your\n Lordships, viz.: What were the trusts upon\n which the property in dispute in this action\n was held. The first and in fact the most im\u00ac\n portant question which arises in this part of\n \u2019he case may be stated as follows: It is\n maintained by the appellant and denied by\n the respondents that the principle of Church\n Establishment was adopted as a fundamental\n or essential principle of the Free Church of\n Scotland, and that its founders made that\n principle one of the main grounds for refus\u00ac\n ing to join other existing Voluntary\n Churches. It cannot, I think, be doubted\n that this principle was regarded as being\n fundamental by the founders of the Free\n Church, and w ' as put forward as one of the\n main ' inducements in the appeals for pe\u00ac\n cuniary aid, in response to w ' hich a very\n large proportion of the funds and property\n now held in trust for behoof of the Free\n Church was given. Upon this part of the\n case I might content myself with adopting\n the view which is expressed by the Lord\n Ordinary, and by more than one of the\n Judges of the Court of Session. Lord Low,\n in his judgment, at page 58, expressed him\u00ac\n self as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThere is no doubt that the founders of\n the Free Church, when they left the Estab\u00ac\n lished in 1843; did so declaring ' that they ad\u00ac\n hered to the principle of an Established\n Church, and that they seceded only because,\n as the law then stood, the Church did not\n possess that independence in what they re\u00ac\n garded as matters spiritual, which, in their\n view\u2019, were essential in order to give effect\n to the cardiual doctrine of the Headship of\n Christ.\u201d __,\n</p>\n<p>\n And later on, at page 59:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe Establishment principle (to me a con\u00ac\n venient short phrase) was one w ' hich was re\u00ac\n garded as of great importance by the Free\n Church, at the commencement of its history,\n and naturally so, because, in the first place,\n it justified the action of those who had se\u00ac\n ceded by proclaiming that they w ' ere not\n schismatics, and in the second place the\n founders of the Church hoped mat a change\n in the law might be effected which would\n enable them to return to the Establish\u00ac\n ment.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n And Lord Trayner says, in even more em\u00ac\n phatic language, at page 89:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe Free Church, from its constitution,\n in 1843, down (at least) to its union with the\n United Presbyterian Church, professed the\n Establishment principle\u201d; and at page 90:\n \u201cIt was the feature of the Free Church\n (prior to the union), which distinguished it\n from all other Presbyterian Churches in\n Scotland, that it was the only Presbyterian\n Church not connected with the State which\n professed to hold the Establishment prin\u00ac\n ciple.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n I am aware their Lordships in other parts\n of their judgments expressed the view that\n the principle either cannot be regarded as\n fundamental or was one from which the\n General Assembly of the Free Church had\n power to depart. But I refer to these pas\u00ac\n sages at present only for the purpose of\n showing that, having regard to the views\n held by the founders of the Free Church\n</p>\n<p>\n with reference to the Establishment, their\n union with the two then existing Churches,\n which subsequently united to form the\n United Presbyterian Church, would not at\n that date. 1843. have been possible.\n</p>\n<p>\n An Essential Principle. .\n</p>\n<p>\n In view, however, of the great importance\n of the question, and inasmuch as opinions\n have been expressed that the principle of\n Establishment cannot be regarded as funda\u00ac\n mental, I think it right, as briefly as possi\u00ac\n ble, to examine the question for myself, and\n to state the reasons which have led me to\n the conclusion that it was regarded as a\n fundamental and essential principle of the\n Free Church at its foundation, for very many\n years afterward, and as I think down to the\n time of the union with the United Presbyte\u00ac\n rian Church in 1900. Reliance was placed\n by the appellants upon the language of arti\u00ac\n cle 3 of chapter 23 of the Westminster Con\u00ac\n fession, which is as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe Civil Magistrate may not assume to\n himself the administration of the govern\u00ac\n ment and sacraments or of the power of the\n keys of the Kingdom of Heaven, yet he hath\n authority, and it is his duty to take order\n that unity and peace be preserved in the\n Church, that the truth of God b e kept pure\n and entire, and that all blasphemies and\n heresies be suppressed, all corruptions and\n abuses in worship and discipline prevented\n or reformed, and all the ordinances of God\n duly settled, administered and observed, for\n the better effecting whereof he hath power\n to call Synods, to be present at them and to\n provide that whatever is transacted in them\n be according to the mind of God.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It was strongly urged by the respondents\n that that article does not enunciate the prin\u00ac\n ciple of Establishment or endowment. As !\n regards endowment the observation is prob\u00ac\n ably well founded; but even taking the arti\u00ac\n cle by itself in my opinion it distinctly em\u00ac\n bodies the principle of Establishment.\n Whether this be so or not is not very mate\u00ac\n rial upon the point of view which I am at\n present considering. The more important\n question is how was it regarded by the\n founders of the Free Church? The first im\u00ac\n portant document is that of the 30th of May,\n 1842. This was a claim, declaration, and\n protest made by then ministers of th e Estab\u00ac\n lished Church before their secession. It is\n therefore not to be expected that the refer\u00ac\n ences to the Establishment would be very\n distinct, but a passage in the document con\u00ac\n tains the following words:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAnd whereas this Church, highly valuing\n as she has ever done, her connection, on the\n terms obtained in the statutes hereinbefore\n recited, with the State, and her possession\n of the temporal benefits thereby secured to\n her for the advantage of the people, must\n nevertheless, even at the risk and hazard of\n the loss of that connection and of these pub\u00ac\n lic benefits\u2014deeply as she would deplore and\n deprecate such a result for herself and the\n nation\u2014-persevere.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n This passage of the declaration which fol\u00ac\n lows and the concluding words of the pro\u00ac\n test show that, even in a document in which\n a claim was being made by members of an j\n Established Church to spiritual independ- j\n ence, they thought it right to point out the\n importance which the signatories attached !\n to the principle of Establishment. The prin- !\n cipal is, moreover, emphatically enunciated j\n in the document entitled \u201cThe Protest of the\n Commissioners to the General Assembly on\n the 18th of May, 1843.\u201d The words are of\n</p>\n<p>\n such importance that I think it right to\n quote them: ,\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAnd finally, while firmly asserting the\n right and duty of the civil magistrate to\n maintain and support an establishment of\n religion in accordance with God ' s Word, and\n reserving to ourselves and our successors to\n strive by all lawful meads, as opportunity\n shall in God\u2019s good providence be offered, to\n secure the performance of this duty agree\u00ac\n ably to the Scriptures and in implement of\n the statutes of the kingdom of Scotland, and\n the obligations of the Treaty of Union as\n understood by us and our ancestors, but ac\u00ac\n knowledging that we do not hold ourselves\n at liberty to retain the benefits of the Es\u00ac\n tablishment while we cannot comply with the\n conditions now ' to be deemed thereto at\u00ac\n tached.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It is in my opinion significant, and to be\n borne in mind, that this protest w r as one of\n the first official acts of the Free Church. As\n far as I know there is no document or evi\u00ac\n dence w ' hich suggests that there was at. the\n time of which I am speaking\u2014viz., the year\n 1843\u2014any doubt or difference of opinion as\n to that which was understood by the ex\u00ac\n pression, the Establishment principle, but it\n is sufficient for my purpose to quote two\n passages from the pastoral address of the\n 30th May, 1843, which was embodied in an\n Act of the Assembly of the Free Church, and\n to which the ministers were directed to call\n the attention of their people on the 15th\n June, 1843. These passages from twt ad\u00ac\n dress state the principle as follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cIt was ever held by the Established\n Church, indeed, that the Church and the State,\n being equally ordinances of God, and having\n certain common objects connected with His\n glory and the social welfare, might and\n ought to uni-te in a joint acknowledgment of\n Christ and in the employment of the means\n and resources belonging to them respective\u00ac\n ly for the advancement of His cause\u2014and\n later\u2014so upon the other hand the State held\n directly and exclusively from God, and was\n entitled and bound to exercise under, its re\u00ac\n sponsibility to Him alone, its entire secular\n sovereignty, including therein whatever it\n was competent for or binding upon the\n State to do about sacred things or in re\u00ac\n lation to the Church, as, for example, en\u00ac\n dowing and establishing the Church and\n fixing the terms and conditions of that Es\u00ac\n tablishment.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n These passages show clearly what was\n understood by the founders of the Free\n Church as the Establishment principle. I\n will not quote again the passage from Dr.\n Chalmers\u2019 speech in 1843, to which such fre\u00ac\n quent reference was made, but it is impos\u00ac\n sible to read it without being satisfied that\n he at least made the principle of Estab\u00ac\n lishment one of the fundamental princi\u00ac\n ples of the Free Church, and that view Was\n adopted unanimously by the Assembly on\n the 26th May, who directed that an account\n of the proceedings of the previous meeting\n should be sent to the ministers and friends,\n w\u2019hich account should contain Dr. Chal\u00ac\n mers ' address as Moderator.

I need scarcely\n point out that in replying to such addresses\n the leaders of the Free Church would have\n no object in criticising, still less of trav\u00ac\n ersing, any opinions which had been ex\u00ac\n pressed in addresses of a friendly character\n transmitted to them. And this gives greater\n force to the language used in reply to such\n addresses, of which I would cite the two pas\u00ac\n sages set out in the document before us:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" But you misapprehend the nature of the\n movement which we have made in suppos\u00ac\n ing that we have in the least degree al\u00ac\n tered our views respecting the lawfulness\n and the desirableness of a right connection\n between Church and State. History and\n experience have convinced us that there is\n a form of alliance which is at once practi\u00ac\n cable and agreeable to Scripture, and highly\n beneficial. We have renounced the tem\u00ac\n poral advantages of the Scottish Ecclesias\u00ac\n tical Establishment, not in consequence of\n any alteration in our views on this subject,\n but because the Civil Courts had violated\n our constitution and Parliament under the\n guidance of an infatuated Government\n which had sanctioned that violation.\u2019\u2019\n</p>\n<p>\n I pause here to notice an argument strong\u00ac\n ly urged before us on behalf of the respond-\n ents. and which appears to have had weight\n with the Lord Ordinary and the Judges of\n the Second Division, viz., that the passages\n in the documents leading up to the founda\u00ac\n tion of the Free Church, and in the preamble\n to the Act of 1846\u2014to which I shall refer\n \u2014were parenthetical, and related to the ac\u00ac\n tion of third persons, viz., civil magistrates,\n and not of the Church itself. So far from\n weakening the force of the declaration\n couched in the terms in which it is, the\n fact, in my opinion, gives it additional\n weight. The separation was in no way pro\u00ac\n moted because the dissenting ministers ob\u00ac\n jected to the principle of Establishment;\n that principle was not attacked by the claims\n of the Courts against which they had pro\u00ac\n tested, and yet its recognition is considered\n of such great importance as to receive the\n prominent notice which I have quoted.\n Then, with reference to the argument that it\n relates to the action of third parties, also\n strongly pressed upon us, I am unable to\n see how such an argument assists the re\u00ac\n spondents. It seems to me also to give ad\u00ac\n ditional weight to the firm assertion of the\n light and duty of Churches to support the\n State in the performance of its duty toward\n religion by the medium and through the\n agency of an Established Church, which as\u00ac\n sertion the firotesting ministers were mak\u00ac\n ing. It seems to me, moreover, that a brief\n consideration of the Establishment princi\u00ac\n ple as contrasted with Disestablishment is\n sufficient to show its fundamental or essen\u00ac\n tial character. The one seeks to enforce\n the paramount duty of the State in its of\u00ac\n ficial capacity to recognize religion, to main\u00ac\n tain and support the Church. The other de\u00ac\n sires to see all connection between the State\n and the Church broken down and destroyed,\n and to prevent the State from exercising any\n pontrol whatever over the Church in any ca\u00ac\n pacity, and, of course, from endowing or\n</p>\n<p>\n ' listing to maintain a Church; and if, as I\n</p>\n<p>\n shall point out later, the United Presbyterian\n Church certainly considered any civil Estab\u00ac\n lishment of religion unscriptural and unjust,\n it is difficult to understand how such a dis\u00ac\n tinction between the views held by two\n Churches can be regarded as otherwise than\n fundamental and essential. Nor does it\n seem ' to me that the suggestion made by\n Lord Trayner that the different view taken\n on this question by the Free Church and the\n United Presbyterian is a matter of policy\n and not a matter of faith makes any sub\u00ac\n stantial difference.\n</p>\n<p>\n Free Church and Establishment.\n</p>\n<p>\n In one sense the questions on which the\n Free Church separated from the Establish\u00ac\n ment were not matters of faith. But, in my\n opinion, the difference between the Free\n Church and the United Presbyterian was a\n difference not on the mere matter of detail,\n but upon a fundamental principle. For\n these reasons I have arrived at the conclu\u00ac\n sion that the founders of the Free Church\n regarded the Establishment principle not\n only as one of the very greatest importance,\n but as fundamental and essential, that at\n that date union between the Free Church\n and either of the Churches subsequently\n forming the United Presbyterian Church\n would have been out of the question. If I\n am right in this view its bearing on the\n question raised before us is of the greatest\n importance. It cannot, in my opinion, be\n questioned that the documents to which I\n have referred, and the principles which they\n embody were the documents upon the basis\n of which the donors of a very large propor\u00ac\n tion of the trust funds, the application of\n which is in question in this case, made their\n gifts and donations, and upon the faith of\n which also the real property in question was\n conveyed. This conclusion leads one to con\u00ac\n sider whether the history of the Free\n Church since 1843 and events since that date\n support the view that property held for its\n behoof may without breach of trust be ap\u00ac\n plied for the purposes of a Church which\n supports the principle of disestablishment.\n I pass, therefore, to consider briefly the\n history of the Free Church upon this point\n from 1843 -to 1900. In the year 1846 we find\n the Church thinking it right to declare that\n she firmly maintains the same Scriptural\n principles as to the duties of nations and\n their rulers in reference to true religion\n and the Church of Christ for which she\n has hitherto contended. I regard this as\n a distinct recognition of the Established\n principle, and as in no way weakened by the\n words following, which disclaim intolerant\n or persecuting principles. Five years af\u00ac\n ter. in the year 1861, in a formal Act and\n Declaration of the Assembly, the principle\n of Establishment is again recognized of the\n highest importance. The words used are:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" Holding firmly to the last, as she holds\n still, and, through God\u2019s grace, will ever\n hold, that it is the duty of civil rulers to\n recognize the truth of Gcd according to His\n word, and to promote and support the King\u00ac\n dom of Christ without assuming any juris\u00ac\n diction in it or any power over it, and deep\u00ac\n ly sensible, moreover, of the advantages re\u00ac\n sulting to the community at large, and es\u00ac\n pecially to its most destitute portions, from\n the public endowment of pastoral charges\n among them.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Again, in the year 1S53, the Church in\n emphatic language reaffirms the principle,\n calling especial attention to that of Estab\u00ac\n lishment:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" That this Church maintains unaltered and\n ur.ccmpromised the principles set forth in\n the Claim, Declaration and Protest of 1842,\n</p>\n<p>\n and the Protest of 1843, relative to the law\u00ac\n fulness and obligation of a Scriptural alli\u00ac\n ance between the Church of Christ and the\n State, and the condition upon which such an\n alliance ought to be regulated.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The Union Negotiations.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the year 1864, when the question cf\n union between the Free Church and the\n United Presbyterian Church w r as actually\n under discussion, the Committee of the Free\n Church stated as one of its distinctive prin\u00ac\n ciples that, as an act of homage to Christ,\n it is the duty of the Civil Magistrate when\n necessary or expedient to employ the na\u00ac\n tional resources in aid of the Church, and\n again in the year 1867 the principle is enun\u00ac\n ciated in even stronger language.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAs an act of national homage to Christ,\n the Civil Magistrate ought, when necessary\n and expedient, to afford aid from the national\n resources to the cause of Christ, provided\n always that in doing so, while reserving full\n control over his own gift, ne abstain from all\n authoritative interference in the internal\n government of the Church.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Later, in the year 1873, when dealing with\n the question of eligibility of ministers, the\n Assembly declared that it adhered to the\n great fundamental principle of the Church,\n under two heads, the second of which was as\n follows:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cSecondly, the prerogative of the Lord\n Jesus Christ as head over all things to His\n Church and supreme over nations and their\n rulers, who are consequently bound collec\u00ac\n tively and officially, as well as individually\n and personally, to own and honor His au\u00ac\n thority to further the interests of His Holy\n religion.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n These passages from the proceedings of the\n Free Church satisfy me that for a period of\n thirty years after the Free Church was\n founded, the Establishment principle was re\u00ac\n garded as fundamental, and I doubt not that\n during that period and in reliance on that\n principle a considerable part of the property\n was given and conveyed to trustees for be\u00ac\n hoof of the Free Church. It was suggested\n by the respondents that the union of the\n Free Church with the Church knovm as the\n United Original Seceders in the year 1852\n and with the Reformed Presbyterian Church\n in 1876 afforded arguments in support of the\n union with the United Presbyterian in the\n year 1900. I am wholly unable to follow that\n argument. I do not propose to trace the\n history of the two Churches with which the\n Free Church united beyond saying that, as\n far as I can gather from the papers, the\n Free Church uniting with them in no way\n abandoned or altered any one of the princi\u00ac\n ples which it had professed in the year 1843,\n but on the contrary, both the united Churches\n represented that they were in complete sym\u00ac\n pathy with the Free Church. As regards the\n United Original Seceders, it is only neces\u00ac\n sary to examine the representation and ap\u00ac\n peal made by the Synod of that. Church in\n the year 1852, to see that their union with\n the Free Church was based upon and only\n consistent with the view that the Free\n Church still maintained the Establishment\n principle. In the case of the Reformed Pres\u00ac\n byterian Church the statement in the Act of\n Union that the united Churches accept the\n preamble to article 12 of the Free Church\n Assembly, 1846, which I have already cited,\n proves, in my opinion, that the maintenance\n of the Establishment principle was the basis\n of union between the Free Church and the\n Reformed Presbyterians.

In the first\n place thesj Acts were objected to, aud I\n would point out that, although the Act of j\n 1892, which is undoubtedly of great impor- j\n tance in connection with the second branch\n of the ease, has no direct bearing upon (lie j\n question of Establishment. One of the main ;\n grounds on objection and protest was that j\n stated in the following terms:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cBecause, under the head which refers to\n Intolerant and persecuting principles, which j\n is to take the place of the present preamble !\n to the formula, all reference to the duties\n of nations and their rulers to true religion\n and the Church of Christ as therein set forth\n is wholly omitted.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n It now becomes necessary to consider the j\n position of the United Presbyterian Church\n in reference to the Establishment principle.\n The possibility of a union of the Free Church\n with other bodies of Christians was undoubt\u00ac\n edly contemplated by its founders. Two such\n unions have, in tact, taken place. It be\u00ac\n comes therefore of importance to consider\n whether or not the United Presbyterian\n Church was a Church with which Ihe Free\n Church could properiy unite, and whether it\n would be a breach of trust to apply funds held\n in trust for behoof of the Free Church as !\n originally constituted to the purposes of ihe\n united body, now the United Free Church\n In my opinion this matter does not admit of\n serious doubt. 1 am aware it was argued by\n the rosponderits that the United Presbyterian I\n Church between the years 1817 and 1900 might\n without breach of trust have united with the\n Establishment or applied its funds in aid of\n Establishment, and it was contended by Mr.\n Haldane that the United Free Church could\n do so without impropriety, Without refer\u00ac\n ring to all the documents which. ! think,\n contradict this view, 1 would call attention\n to the view held by the United Presbyterian j\n Church as stated in the report of 1864, which\n seems to me to be wholly contrary to this\n view:\n</p>\n<p>\n \" That inasmuch as the Civil Magistrate has\n no authority in spiritual things, and as the\n employment of force in such matters is op\u00ac\n posed to the spirit aud precepts of Christi\u00ac\n anity, it is not within his province to legis\u00ac\n late as to what is true in religion, to prescribe\n a creed or form of worship to his subjects, or\n to endow the Church from national resources;\n that Jesus Christ, as sole King and Hoad of\n His Church, has enjoined upon His people to\n provide lor maintaining and extending it by\n freewill offerings; and this being Christ\u2019s or\u00ac\n dinance, it excludes State aid for these pur\u00ac\n poses, and that adherence to it is the true\n safeguard of the Church ' s independence. \"\n</p>\n<p>\n And again in 1867. \u201cThat li is uot compe\u00ac\n tent to the Civil Magistrate tq give legisla\u00ac\n tive, sanction to any creed in the \\yay of set\u00ac\n ting up a civil establishment of religion, nor\n ta it within his province to provide for the\n expep$e of the ministrations of religion out\n of the national resources That Jesus Christ,\n as sole King and Head of His Church, has\n enjoined upon His people to provide for\n maintaining and extending it by free will\n offerings; that this being the ordinance of\n Christ, it excludes State aid for these pur\u00ac\n poses, and that adherence to it is the true\n safeguard of tlm Church\u2019s Independence.\u201d j\n</p>\n<p>\n Moreover, though uniformity of opinion j\n with respect to civil establishments of yelig- |\n ion is not a ter-m of Communion ip the Uni\u00ac\n ted Presbyterian Church, yet the views on\n this subject held and universally acted upon\n are opposed to these institutions.\n</p>\n<p>\n Court of Session \u25a0fpilgmenlt.\n</p>\n<p>\n Further. I am wholly unable to reconcile\n this argument with the statement proved in\n evidence and made on behalf of the United\n Presbyterian Church. In 1897 a tract. No.\n 25, prepared by tlic committee of the United\n Presbyterian Church on the disestablishment\n and disendowmenl of the Established\n Churches of England and Scotland, was is\u00ac\n sued by the United Presbyterian Church,\n and sent to all the ministers of the Free\n and Established Churches, fn that tract not\n only is it stated that the United Presbyte\u00ac\n rian Church maintains as one of its most\n distinctive principles, that it is not the prov\u00ac\n ince of the Stale to establish and endow the\n Christian Church, but that civil establish\u00ac\n ments of religion are un3criptural aud un\u00ac\n just. In the face of these documents, it seems\n impossible to adopt the contention of the\n respondents But here, again, I should be\n justified in relying upon the opinion of their\n Lordships in the Scotch Court, in the course\n of his judgment Lord Low said:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cOn the other hand, it seems to rae to he\n equally certain that the United Presbyter\u00ac\n ian Church never read the Confession of\n Faith as laying down that it is the right and\n duty of the Civil Magistrate to maintain and\n support an Established Church. There does\n not appear to be any material difference be\u00ac\n tween the two Churches upon the point, so\n far as their standards are concerned; but\n the view of ihe United Presbyterian Church\n as a whole has always been that it is not\n within the province of the Civil Magistrate\n to endow the Church out of public funds,\n aud that the Church ought to be maintained\n by the free will offerings of its members.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Lord Trayner, moreover, states in em-\n pnauc terms that the United Presbyte\u00ac\n rian Church had throughout the w r bole\n period of its existence repudiated the Es\u00ac\n tablishment principle. With reference to\n the attitude of the United Free Church and\n the possibility of its adopting a different\n view, the statements in the resolution of\n the Assembly of the United Free Church\n passed in the years 1901 and 1902, to the ef\u00ac\n fect that the Establishment was objection\u00ac\n able on principle, and recording its testi\u00ac\n mony in favor of Disestablishment of the\n Established Church of Scotland, which state\u00ac\n ments were not attempted to be qualified by\n the counsel for the respondents, are, in my\n opinion, conclusive against any such eepten-\n t ion.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Union Documents.\n</p>\n<p>\n ihe only argument on this point remaining\n to he noticed is that which was founded upon\n (he documents agreed to by the Assembly of\n the Free Church and the Synod of the United\n Presbyterian Church at the time of union.\n These dpeuments transfer and convey all .he\n property and funds of the Free Church of\n Scotland to the united body, but it was said\n that the modified forms of question formu\u00ac\n lated by the General Assembly of the United\n Free Church in the year I960, were not in\u00ac\n consistent with the principle of Establish\u00ac\n ment in so far as that was a fundamental\n principle of the Free Church, and that office\n bearers were left free to hold their own in\u00ac\n dividual views on this question, if I am\n right in the view which I have endeavored\n (p express, that the principle of Establish\u00ac\n ment wps regarded by the founders of the\n Free Church as a fundamental principle of\n the Church, and was so maintained for a\n period of mole than thirty yeaVs after its\n foundation, the fact that the Free Church of\n Scotland in uniting with a Church pledged\n</p>\n<p>\n to Disestablishment principles, and regard\u00ac\n ing cjvil Establishments of religion as tin-\n scriptural and unjust, had agreed to treat the\n matter as an open question seems to me\n entirely beside the mark- For the purposes\n of the present discussion the respondent?\n ! must justify, not only a nominal union, but\n j the claim to apply the trust funds rb the pur-\n j pose Of the united body, and so dispossess\n as they have attempted to do, the Free\n Church ministers who have declined to Join\n the United Free Church from the possession\n I of the manses and churches. Unless the\n respondents can make good their point that\n the application of the moneys for the purpose\n of the united body does not amount to a\n breach of tru3t, the fact that they agreed for\n the purpose of the union not to raise auy\n question cannot afford a justification.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Model Trust Deed.\n</p>\n<p>\n The only remaining point which requires\n notice upon this part of ihe case is the ar\u00ac\n gument that the terras of the Model Trust\n Deed, wdiich was settled by a committee of\n the Free Church and approved by the As\u00ac\n sembly in 1844. justifies transfer of the prop\u00ac\n erty to the united body. This argument is\n based mainly upon the first and fourth\n Trusts, and incidentally upon the ninth\n Trust. The object of this Trust Deed was\n undoubtedly to insure that ihe property\n should be held for the purposes of the Free\n Church as originally constituted, it pro\u00ac\n ceeds upon a general outline of the History\n of the Established Church, the Disruption\n and the subsequent formation of the Free\n Church. The first Trust was, in my opin\u00ac\n ion, a provision not unnatural from a con\u00ac\n veyancing point of view that the Trust\n should not, cease in tHe event ot ihe Free\n Church of Scotland uniting wiih themselves\n other bodies of Christians. It would, in my\n judgment, bo contrary to every rule of law\n applicable tq such a case lo hold that it gave\n the Free Church Assembly power, by mere\n union, to divert the fuuds to a body which\n did not conform to the fundamental princi\u00ac\n ples of the Free Church. Still jess can the\n respondents rely upon the fourth Trust,\n which was the natural sequence of the re\u00ac\n cital as to the continuation of the form of\n Church government by kirk-sessiqns Pres\u00ac\n byterians, provincial Synods, and General\n Assemblies, and bestowed upon the General\n Assembly of the Free Church the same pow\u00ac\n ers as- those which had been enjqyed and\n claimed by the Assembly of the Established\n Church.

For reasons which I will briefly\n state, had this been the only ground upon\n which exception could be taken to the action\n of the Assembly of the Free Church, I am\n not at present satisfied that it has acted\n in excess of its powers. I do not wish to\n express a final opinion, as I do not consider\n it necessary for the purpose of determining\n the legal rights of the parties in these ap\u00ac\n peals, and further consideration might satis\u00ac\n fy me that the objection by the appellants\n that the Assemblies of the Free Church and\n the United Free Church have released their\n ministers and office-bearers from adherence\n to the Westminster Confession, as such lias\n more weight than 1 am at present disposed\n to attach to it. Oh the other hand, the ar\u00ac\n gument of the Dean of Faculty and Mr.\n Haldane satisfied me that there are passages\n in the Westminster Confession and in other\n standards of the Church which might re\u00ac\n quire explanation and exposition which\n would fairly come within the words used in\n the Barrier Act, ' alteration in doctrine. \" 1\n</p>\n<p>\n do not feel myself competent, at any rate\n upon the information at present before me,\n to express any final opinion upon such a\n point, and I do not therefore propose to base\n my judgment upon iho second ground which\n was urged before us on behalf of the appel\u00ac\n lants.\n</p>\n<p>\n ItiK ' htM of \\i > i < e 1 Innt\n</p>\n<p>\n It only remains to consider the position\n of the appellants and their rights as a\n minority of the ministers and elders of the\n Free Church, representing congregations or\n portions of congregations who are not pre\u00ac\n pared to join the United Free Church. It\n is mt contended that they have changed\n their principles. It is not urged that they\n have departed from any fundamental or es\u00ac\n sential principle of the Free Church. It is\n not alleged that they are not faithfully car\u00ac\n rying out the objects of the Protest of the\n 18th May. 1843. The respondents are\n theatening to attempt to eject them from\n their churches and manses, and to deprive\n them of any right to participate in any\n funds of the Church, simply on the ground\n that they decline to become members of the\n United Free Church The decision of the\n Court of Session in Craigie v Marshall and\n Couper v. Burns, unless overruled by your\n Lordships\u2019 House, are wholly inconsistent\n in my opinion, with any such right on the\n part of the respondents, and I am unable\n to support a judgment which would deprive\n the persons forming a minority of their\n rights simply upon the grounds that they\n are unwilling to become members of a body\n which has nut only abandoned a fundamental\n 1 principle of the Church to which they be\u00ac\n long. but supports a principle essentially\n different from that on which that Church\n was founded. For these reasons I am of\n opinion that the appeal should be allowed.\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n Formal Decision.\n</p>\n<p>\n Assembly has power to legislate in such\n matters and to abandon the Establishment\n principle, even though and notwithstanding\n that it may have been one of the funda\u00ac\n mental principles of the Free Church. This\n question has a bearing upon the second\n crouud relied upon by the appellants, viz.,\n that the Assembly of the Free Church had\n departed from the Westminster Confession\n and the standard of the fhurch. and had\n made changes iu doctrine inconsistent with\n the fundamental principles of the Free\n Church. The powers of the Assembly of\n the Free Church were in my opinion no\n greater in relation to the fundamental prin\u00ac\n ciples upon which the Church was founded\n than were the powers of the Assembly of\n the Established Church. If 1 am right in\n the \\ iew which I have ventured to express,\n that paragraph 3 of article 23 of the West\u00ac\n minster Confession, and the documents to\n which I have referred as showing the funda\u00ac\n mental principles upon ..which the Free\n Church was founded, did make to adopt once\n more the language of the Act of 1873 the\n Establishment principle oue of the great\n fundamental principles of the Church. I am\n wholly at a loss to understand upon what\n ground it can be said that the Assembly\n either of the Established Church or of the\n Free Church had the right to permit its\n ministers and elders to depart from that\n principle. I agree that the Barrier Act up-\n op which so much reliance was nlaeerj by\n the respondents, (hough it confers no new\n powers, recognizes that the General As\u00ac\n sembly possesses some powers of altera\u00ac\n tion with reference to doctrine, worship,\n discipline, and government, but they do not\n In my opinion include a power to subvert\n</p>\n<p>\n The\n</p>\n<p>\n The Lord Chancellor then moved:\n</p>\n<p>\n That the order appealed from be reversed,\n and that the respondents pay to the appel\u00ac\n lants the costs both here and below.

The British Weekly of August 11 published a number of reports of such deliverances,\n which are here given. These will help the reader to a clearer comprehension of the interests involved in the case.\n</p>\n<p>\n Rev. Professor Orr at Erskine Church,\n Burntisland.\n</p>\n<p>\n One thing that may be said, which lies on\n the surface, is that the matter cannot end\n where it now stands. A decision of an Eng\u00ac\n lish House of Lords reversing the unani\u00ac\n mous judgment of our highest Scottish\n Court in a matter so peculiarly our own as\n the rights and powers of our Churches\u2014a\n decision not even there unanimous, and\n which, but for the unexpected death of\n Lord Shand after the first hearing a few\n months ago, would, as everyone knows, have\n been the opposite of what it is\u2014a decision\n which overrides the view taken, and as it\n still believes rightly taken, of its own con\u00ac\n stitution by the great majority in the Free\n Church since the days of the Disruption, and\n which hands over to some twenty or thirty\n Highland ministers and their adherents the\n entire property, amounting to millions, of a\n vast Church of 1,100 congregations and 300,-\n 000 communicants\u2014is one that can never, in\n either law ' or equity, stand, and could never,\n even if it w ' ere attempted, be made operative.\n The remnant Church could not, if it would,\n administer so vast and complex a trust either\n at home or abroad. What steps may have to\n be taken to rectify this glaring injustice, at\n what point precisely the sword can enter\n which is to cut the knot, I cannot tell, but\n it is self-evident that some way out of the\n impasse must be found. If a precedent does\n not exist\u2014and I suppose the case is one ab\u00ac\n solutely unprecedented\u2014one will have to be\n created. There is another thing, and only\n one other, I will venture to say. This is a\n decision which affects all Churches and\n is bound, and speedily, to develop results\n of a magnitude which no one can yet\n fully foresee. Our own former United\n Presbyterian congregations, though in\n point of form not touched by this judg\u00ac\n ment, are in reality deeply concerned in it.\n It means that in 1SS0, when we passed our\n own Declaratory Act, wnlch happily we\n did unanimously, if any dozen or score of\n ministers had chosen to protest and to con\u00ac\n stitute and call themselves the Synod of\n the United Presbyterian Church, they would\n in law ' have been entitled to have the whole\n property of that Church, so far as it was\n not independently secured, handed over to\n them\u2014Synod buildings, college endowments,\n church funds and possessions of every kind,\n while the main body of tne Church, the.\n whole, except that fraction, was absolutely\n dispossessed. Such a judgment would justly\n be pronounced monstrous: yet it is precisely\n such a fate which has overtaken the Free !\n Church it the present moment. Our inter\u00ac\n ests as members of the United Church are\n therefore bound up in the closest way with\n those of our brethren on whom the blow\n more immediately falls, and I have no doubt\n that we will be found standing shoulder to\n shoulder with them > n this common cause\n of the essential liberties of a Church of\n Christ. One thing wc may be assured of is\n this: that this fire of adversity will not de\u00ac\n stroy. but will purify, and in the end will\n weld and immensely strengthen the United\n Church. It. will shake the Church out of the\n lethargy of self-ease and feeble grasp of first\n principles, and will throw ' it back, as it has\n not been thrown back for generations, on\n faith in God, on the meaning of its own doc\u00ac\n trines and principles, on the great ends for\n which the Church of Christ exists. It will be\n</p>\n<p>\n found, if I mistake not, that the spirit which\n animated the great men of the Secession and\n the Disruption is not dead, and that those\n things which seem for the present to be\n against us are in reality, in God\u2019s wonderful\n providence, in the truest sense for us.\n</p>\n<p>\n J* J* ^\n</p>\n<p>\n Rev. R. Bruce Taylor, FerryhilJ Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n Aberdeen.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Rev. R. Bruce Taylor. Ferryhill\n United Free Church, said there was one\n great difference between the situation in\n 1843 and the situation of to-day. For ten\n years before the Disruption the conflict haa\n been going on, and the spiritual issues had\n been kept constantly before the eyes of the\n Church. The result w ' as that those years\n of conflict were at the same time years of\n intense spiritual fervor, and while the ques\u00ac\n tion w ' as being fought in the Law Courts\n the home and foreign mission work was be\u00ac\n ing prosecuted with a zeal altogether new ' .\n But this decision had come upon them like\n a thunder-clap, and it had been pronounced\n not directly upon the question of property.\n Their danger was that the material side\n of the matter should be so kept before their\n eyes that the real issue, spiritual freedom,\n should be obscured.\n</p>\n<p>\n j* it\n</p>\n<p>\n Rev. John M. Sloan, Grange, Edinburgh\n</p>\n<p>\n The Free Church of 1843 would have re\u00ac\n pudiated the idea of being a mere wooden\n joint stock company, bound for ever to every\n detail and expression of its own Confession\n of Faith\u2014much less bound for ever by the\n fervid utterances of the Disruption time,\n it regarded itself, from the first, as a living,\n growing, spiritual organization\u2014to be main\u00ac\n tained and extended, year by year, by mem\u00ac\n bers in sympathy with its life, aims and ad\u00ac\n vancing outlooks. The Disruption memory,\n indeed, was ever prized; but a larger, strong\u00ac\n er life had entered, and the Free Church re\u00ac\n joiced in its great mission, and in the won\u00ac\n derful way in which its branches were reach\u00ac\n ing out into all the earth. Its dimensions\n grew, its aims grew ' , its spirit enlarged, and\n its creed must also feel the power of the\n new ' life. In bygone yearsj the Church felt\n constrained to qualify its Confession\u2014e. g.,\n chapter xxiii\u2014and to repudiate \u201cpersecuting\n principles,\u201d w ' hich it seemed to some to\n countenance. In later years (1892) it felt\n constrained, for the relief of some con\u00ac\n sciences, by the Declaratory Act, to insist\n cn the Love of God as warranting the proc\u00ac\n lamation of a free gospel to every creature.\n Few ministries in Scotland had done more\n to widen the scope of the proclamation of a\n free gospel in our land than that of the\n honored founder of ln : s very congregation\u2014\n the late Dr. Horatius Bonar. What would\n the reverend writer of the \u201cKelso Tracts\u201d\n have said to the Lord Chancellor\u2019s dictum\u2014\n that to proclaim an unfettered gospel w ' as to\n violate the Calvinism of the Confession of\n Faith, and to be guilty of Arminianism? He\n asked himself, Could Dr. Bonar have belonged\n to that new ' Church bound hand and foot, by\n the recent deliverance, to a Confession so\n interpreted by the highest legal authority\n in the land?\n</p>\n<p>\n The Rev. Dr. Ross Taylor, Kclvinsido,\n Glasgow.\n</p>\n<p>\n It seemed somehow to be assumed that\n the Church in 1843 started with the posses\u00ac\n sion of immense revenues amassed through\n the eloquence of Dr. Chalmers, and that\n these had been the mainstay of the FTee\n Church until now. Most of the churches\n then erected had crumbled into ruins, ami\n the accumulated funds of the Free Church\n during the first ten years of its existence\n amounted to the petty sum of \u00a318,000. The\n great proportion of the Church\u2019s funds now\n in hand were contributed since 1872, the\n year when the Church solemnly declared\n that there was no bar in principle to union\n with the United Presbyterian Church. It\n was in full view of the declaration that\n denors in the last thirty years intrusted their\n money to the Church. Little did they expect\n that, the realizing of their and the Church\u2019s\n hopes regarding the union would involve the\n forfeiture of their gifts. * * * The trend\n of public opinion pointed to the conclusion\n that the judgment as it stood could not be\n worked out. The case was one in\n which Parliament, while not questioning\n the decision in point of law, was bound\n tc see that the best and highest in\u00ac\n terests of the country were not to\n receive gross injury. Nor need they anti\u00ac\n cipate any fighting about this, for their\n brethren who had come off victorious must\n be as sensible as they w ' ere that an impos\u00ac\n sible situation had been created, out of\n which extrication must be found for their\n own sake as well as for theirs. There were\n other considerations suggested by the pres\u00ac\n ent crisis. Reflecting men could not fail\n to ask themselves what w r as to be the bear\u00ac\n ing of this judgment on the future Church\n life of Scotland. Ihe stringent law as to\n the Confession bore on other Churches as\n well as theirs, and not least on the Es\u00ac\n tablished Church. For some years past not\n a few of their brethren in that Church had\n been agitating for some relaxation of the\n bonds in the matter of creed which the\n alliance to the State imposed on them; hut\n now it appeared that behind these there\n were other bonds making it impossible for\n them to modify or alter anything in the Con\u00ac\n fession without incurring the penalty im\u00ac\n posed in the case of the Free Church. Ho\n could not refrain from uttering the fervent\n hope that Presbyterians, alike established\n and unestablished, might stand shoulder to\n shoulder in this crisis, and that from every\n parish and Church Court in Scotland there\n might ring out the cry that, the Church of\n Christ must be free to express its living\n faith. If they joined hands and voices to\n gain this boon for their Scottish Church life,\n might they not hone matters might not rest\n there?*\n</p>\n<p>\n ^\n</p>\n<p>\n Rev.

P. A. Gordon Clark, West Church,\n Perth.\n</p>\n<p>\n The true significance of the judgment was\n well expressed by the Rev. P. Gordon Clark,\n who said: \u201cWe are met for the first time in\n a building not our own, which we only oc\u00ac\n cupy by the courtesy of our opponents. 1\n l.ve in a manse which does not belong to us,\n but to another ecclesiastical establishment.\n The olfice bearers have acked me to say that,\n as far as they seq their way, their course is\n clear. They intend to stand shoulder to\n shoulder together for the right of Christ to\n rule in His own Church. There were two\n courses open to the congregation, and one of\n them was compromise. He would not dis\u00ac\n guise from them that compromise might fail.\n Then they and he would have to decide two\n things. They must go back not to the Free\n Church of 1843, but to the little Free Church,\n as its constitution had been defined, or they\n must stand where they were and be prepared\n to suffer, If the constitution of the Church,\n was that the Westminster Confession of\n Faith never could be altered, that the Es\u00ac\n tablishment principle must be maintained,\n and if ' he must hold that God had so or\u00ac\n dained some boys\u2014possibly his own boy\u2014to\n eternal damnation, so that he could not\n plead with him to give himself to Christ, it\n was quite clear he could not preach those\n e.octrines, and he could not be a member, he\n could not be a minister in that Church. \"\n</p>\n<p>\n O* &\n</p>\n<p>\n Rev. Dr. Ross, Westbourne, Glasgow.\n</p>\n<p>\n The House of Lords had decreed that the\n Free Church by passing the Declaratory Act\n was guilty of a breach of trust. That was,\n it was guilty of a breach of trust in allow\u00ac\n ing freedom of opinion about the creation of\n the world in six literal days, in qualifying\n the rigorous doctrine of the divine decrees\n by emphasizing the love of God, in magnify\u00ac\n ing the freedom of the Gospel and human re\u00ac\n sponsibility, in recognizing diversity of\n opinion on points in the Confession which\n did not enter into the substance of the faith\n According to the decision the Free Church,\n if she were honestly to carry out the trust,\n was bound for all time neck and heel to the\n Confession of Faith, and to the Confession\n oi Faith as its \u00a7tatements were interpreted\n by the generation in which it was drawn up.\n Let them thank God for their deliverance\n from such a position. It was but a poor ser\u00ac\n vice which could be rendered to the twen\u00ac\n tieth century, with its new ' problems and new\n outlooks, by a Church which thus permitted\n itself \" to be bound by the seventeenth cen\u00ac\n tury. Even if we have to pay a heavy price\n for the Declaratory Act. it was a price worth\n paying. The interests of Christ\u2019s kingdom\n with the new generation which was rising up\n among us were bound up with a juster inter\u00ac\n pretation of the mind of Christ than is rep\u00ac\n resented by the seventeenth century. They\n might go forward, they w ' ould not go back\n upon the Declaratory Act.\n</p>\n<p>\n Remarkable Sermon by the Free\n Church Moderator.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Rev. Murdo M\u2019Queen, Kiltearn, Mod\u00ac\n erator of the Free Church, preach** J i- hj s\n own pulpit at Kiltearn.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cHe said it had been declared that they\n were the Free Church of Scotland. It was a\n matter of thanksgiving and gratitude to all\n Free Churchmen throughout the land. In\n his college days he had heard Dr. Begg say:\n</p>\n<p>\n Thank God for the House of Lords.\u2019 From\n the bottom of his heart he echoed the say\u00ac\n ing. After referring at length to the various\n points raised in the decision he went on\n to say that he now saw that the professors\n of the United Free Church were already be\u00ac\n ginning to roar and shriek and yell; and\n why? Was it because the doctrines of the\n Confession of Faith w ' ere undermined, or be\u00ac\n cause the word of God had been mutilated?\n</p>\n<p>\n No, but because they had lost every penny\n of their salaries. It was neither just nor\n right to divert these funds to the propaga\u00ac\n tion of error and falsehood, and all that\n was in opposition to the Word of God and\n Confession of Faith.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cWhen the union was accomplished in 1!)00,\n on the eve of winter, thus hoping that they\n might starve them out of their manses and\n frighten the ministers into compliance with\n their trickery and low, mean practices\u2014\n (laughter) there was a warning sent down\n to him warning him out of his manse and\n our of the church, and also the chapel. He\n did not know if he should send it back as a\n present or frame it and hang it up in his\n study as a memento of the kindly feelings\n entertained towards him and all that sym\u00ac\n pathized with him. (Laughter.) It is wast\u00ac\n ing pity to extend it to these men, who, if\n they had the, power, would crush us under\n</p>\n<p>\n The Rev. Murdo Macqueen, of Kiltearn.\n</p>\n<p>\n their heel. The millions have been restored\n to the Free Church, and the verdict of the\n House of Lords couldn\u2019t be reversed, not\u00ac\n withstanding all the bellowing and rohring\n and shrieking of the U. F. body. \u2018Are you\n willing to give us a share?\u2019 they asked.\n Were the U. F. Church, willing to give them\n a share? Had they not shut the Free\n Church out? I say \u2018No. We cannot give\n them a share. The Free Church could not\n part with one shilling of its funds, or a\n stick or stone of its property, because it\n had been given to ;he Free Church, and it\n is to be expended and used for Free Church\n purposes, and it would be stealing to give\n away these funds to the body that has left\n the Free Church.\u2019 ' He did not call the ma\u00ac\n jority a church. It was a politico-ecclesias\u00ac\n tical caucus. He had said so in the begin\u00ac\n ning. He said so yet. He had also called it\n a Noah\u2019s ark, full of clean and unclean ani\u00ac\n mals. with the unclean element predomin*\n ating, with the low ' er animals sinking low\n in the water, and about to disappear under\n th^ waves. He stood by that also. What\n would they call them now ' ? For the present\n he called them\u2014let them be pleased or not,\n it did not matter\u2014a feather\u2019s weight. The\n Moderator of the United Free Church, speak\u00ac\n ing at Forres, had referred to the decision as\n a calamity. He did not deny that it might\n be a calamity. But he said this, that they\n had brought upon themselves the righteous\n retribution of the Most High for their un\u00ac\n faithfulness to God. He had held for years\n that it would be well to get rid of these\n Principals and Professors, and they had got\n rid of them, and a good riddance they were\n for the Free Church cause and the Free |\n Church of Scotland. It would be wasted |\n sympathy to waste it upon them. The Free i\n Church had to bless the Lord for his great j\n</p>\n<p>\n deliverance \u2666hat da.v- 1\n</p>\n<p>\n Rev.

We\n have dropped nothing. I do not believe that\n the judgment of the House of Lords will\n produce what has been called \u201ca cataclysm\n of disintegration.\u201d Are we to cease sup\u00ac\n porting the Gospel ministry throughout the\n country? Are we to abandon our students\n and professors? Are we to drop our home\n mission? Are we to retire from the foreign\n field? It is unthinkable. * 0 * We must\n</p>\n<p>\n not be diverted from practical, present, press\u00ac\n ing duty by entering upon a discussion of the\n reconstruction and reunion of Scottish T re3 \u2018\n byterianism on a large scale. * * * The\n members and ministers of the United Free\n Church of Scotland are unexpectedly called\n to preserve their very existence as a living\n organization, and to do this, under the hard\n conditions imposed by the recent judgment,\n will tax all our energy and test all our loy\u00ac\n alty. Sacrifices will have to be made. And\n they will be made.\n</p>\n<p>\n Rev. Dr. W. M. Macgregcr at St.\n</p>\n<p>\n George\u2019s, Edinburgh.\n</p>\n<p>\n A judgment of the character that had been\n delivered made it certain that emancipation\n would come through their suffering to the\n other Churches in Scotland speedily. They\n wished to look upon it somehow as contain\u00ac\n ing a gracious meaning. It Opened questions\n of readjustment and reunion, and in these\n questions they of the United Free Church\n must be willing to play their part, to show\n generosity and fairness,.to others. He did.\n not think any greater calamity could come\n to Scitland than that out of this decision\n there should arise nt least two great\n Churches connected respectively with the\n two political parties, one of them aggress\u00ac\n ively voluntary, and one of them committed\n absolutely to Establishment at any cost\u2014\n one of them Radical, and the other more or\n less Conservative. He thought it was neces\u00ac\n sary that those of them who were not volun\u00ac\n taries of the aggressive type, those of them\n who represented in the Free Church the\n more conservative and the more cautious\n elements, should be very careful to abide\n where they were to strengthen that side of\n the Church\u2019s life, in order that when, in the\n providence of God. real movements of recon\u00ac\n ciliation were begun, their united Church\n might be able to bring a contribution worthy\n of the history of the united Church, not a\n stunted and partisan contribution, but some\u00ac\n thing as large and varied and generous as\n the Church of Jesus Christ ought to be.\n</p>\n<p>\n Rev, i). M. Macalister, Buccleuch-\n , Greyfriars (F. C.), Edinburgh.\n</p>\n<p>\n He was very glad to know that the ReY-\n Robert Gordon had been spared to know\n that the building had been restored to its\n former position, and he had to congratulate\n the office bearers, who were \u201cinterdicted\n and prohibited\u201d\u2014in so far as the United Free\n Church could interdict and prohibit them\u2014\n who had been spared, with one exception, to\n see the end of this conflict. Perhaps it was\n a pity that it took a revolution to do this;\n but it had been so in God\u2019s providence, and\n it was for them to rejoice and be glad in\n Him who had wrought this great deliverance\n for them. Let them see that they made good\n use of that house of God, which was now\n their very own. They were not in it by the\n will of any man, but with the will of the\n Supreme Court of this realm at their back,\n declaring that this was their own house of\n God. Let them ask for guidance in that\n solemn position which they now occupied;\n and let them be glad that the principle which\n their Church held was declared by the high\u00ac\n est. Court in the land to be true. _!-\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0036/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 193, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 281}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0036/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 387, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 562}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0036/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 775, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1125}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0036/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1551, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2250}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0036/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 3103, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4500}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:sc:ot:ti:sh:ch:ur:ch:ap:00:gr:ea:scottishchurchap00grea:scottishchurchap00grea_0036/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/sc/ot/ti/sh/ch/ur/ch/ap/00/gr/ea/scottishchurchap00grea/scottishchurchap00grea_0036.jp2", "height": 4500, "width": 3103, "levels": 6, "size": 1006492}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"36\">\n<p>\n 3- > THE SCOTTISH FREE CHURCH CASE.\n</p>\n<p>\n Rev.

In fact,\n there were, he believed, at least 300\n churches in the Free Church that were not\n touched by this decision\u2014not being under\n the Model Trust Deed. There were about\n 750 churches under the Model Trust Deed,\n and these would have some cause for anx\u00ac\n iety.

In their new minister they\n had a man of independent spirit, of keen and\n strong mind and of loyalty to evangelical\n views.\n</p>\n<p>\n ^ ^\n</p>\n<p>\n Rev. Dr. Robson at Alyth.\n</p>\n<p>\n It. was for the Free Church to initiate\n action, and they of the United Free Church\n would readily concur and aid in fitting pro\u00ac\n cedure toward the end in view. They had\n done a great and right thing when they\n formed the United Free Church. It w ' ould\n be unbelief and treason to the very idea of\n the Church of Christ to entertain the mis\u00ac\n erable idea of going back upon that true and\n splendid deed. The present crisis seemed\n designed for the annealing of the United\n Free Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n tJzJm\n</p>\n<p>\n The Rev. P. Carnegie Simpson in Ren-\n field Church, Glasgow.\n</p>\n<p>\n Amid all the confusion, the main thing is\n plain. We hold, or shall hold, to the liberty\n of Christ\u2019s Church, and that at any cost. Our\n fathers in 1813 declared by their heroism that\n they valued it more than all the pay and\n privilege of the Establishment. We must\n say to-day\u2014it is not yet clear how much it\n will demand of us\u2014that we value it more\n than all our property. And w ' hat this practi\u00ac\n cally means is this\u2014that we stand by the\n Declaratory Act and by the Union as never\n before. Hitherto the former was a mere the\u00ac\n ological statement, and the latter a step ob\u00ac\n taining consent rather than arousing enthu\u00ac\n siasm. But now these things are the rally\u00ac\n ing points w ' hen we have asserted and shall\n continue to assert the great historic princi-\n and be responsible not to any human being,\n but only to Christ in the articulation of His\n Gospel and the service of His cause. Of the\n Union in particular, I will say that hitherto\n I have merely approved of it. but henceforth\n I glory in it; the great principle of Scottish\n Church history is now bound up with it. Let\n us be faithful to our historic trust; let us be\n loyal and united toward one another, and let\n us seek the presence and guidance of the\n Church ' s Head with earnestness and confi-\n ple of the Scottish Churqh to be free to live,\n dencc, for is this not a situation in which\n one might say, without irreverence, tbat w ' e\n have a right to God\u2019s direction? We came\n out of the House of Lords last Monday on\n the wrong side (according to five judges out\n of a total of eleven, or, perhaps, twelve, who\n have heard the ease) of the law, and have\n thereby lost our property; but we came out\n assuredly on the right side of our conscience,\n and have not lost our historic principles, and\n I think also on the right side even of public\n opinion. The immediate situation is embar\u00ac\n rassing and full of difficulty, but I, for one,\n have a humble but a deep and an increasing\n conviction that, if only we prove worthy in\n it, out of the confusion will emerge, in God\u2019s\n ow\u2019n time and way, great things, and from\n this year of loss may date the real unitedness\n and the long-claimed and dearly-paid-for\n freedom of our Church, as w ' ell as for many\n of us personally, the deepening of great\n Christian convictions and the stirring of\n great Christian enthusiasms.\n</p>\n<p>\n Advice from the Established Church\n</p>\n<p>\n of Scotland.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Rev. Wiliam A. Liston, minister of\n Cardonald Parish, in a sermon preached to\n his own people, on August 14, said:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe present crisis arising out of the\n startling judgment of the House of Lords in\n the Free Church case seems to open the way\n for a much wider and more national union\n of the churches than that which has just\n been dissolved was able to achieve. The\n Church of Scotland has already shown her at\u00ac\n titude in that direction. About twenty years\n ago she made overtures to the Free Church\n to find out what was really the true reason\n that prevented the latter from sharing in her\n patrimony and uniting together in the bonds\n of peace. It was felt that this offer could\n be openly and honestly made, for all that\n the Disruption Fathers fought for had been\n won by the Church. Unhappily this generous\n offer was rejected and refused. Had it been\n accepted then the Free Chureli might have\n had a happier and more honorable union,\n more in harmony with its traditions and\n</p>\n<p>\n principles than that into which she ulti\u00ac\n mately entered, and she would not have\n seen now the sad catastrophe and the appall\u00ac\n ing circumstances that are confronting her\n to-day. The Church of Scotland is of the\n same mind now as she was then, and I be\u00ac\n lieve the same offer is open still, and that\n offer is worth thinking about in the present\n crisis.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe present occasion, therefore, seems to\n me (Mr. Liston continues) to be a splendid\n opportunity\u2014an opportunity that may never\n occur again\u2014for all the Churches of Scot\u00ac\n land to reconsider the situation, and to try\n to arrange matters, not for the advantage\n of any sect or party, but for the spiritual\n welfare of the people of Scotland, for the\n peace of all the Churches and the interests\n of true religion throughout the land. And\n if w\u2019ise heads connected with all the sects\n met in council to consider this matter, I be\u00ac\n lieve it can be efficiently and satisfactorily\n carried out. But I must make this one\n proviso as an essential to its success. The\n</p>\n<p>\n matter must be taken out of the hands of\n the clerical leaders, and left in the hands\n of level-headed laymen. The people must\n take the matter up for themselves, and they\n must not allow themselves to be misled\n again.

August 16 ,\n indicates the spirit and temper of the leaders, and the fidelity with which they cling to their cause:\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThe Rev. Alexander Lee. of Edinburgh,\n stated that of 123 ministers in the Synods or\n Moray and Ross, Sutherland and Caithness,\n and Qlenelg, 107 were present; apologies\n had been received from 13, so that ^there\n were only 3 ministers unaccounted for.\n There were also present 261 office bearers\n from the Synods mentioned, besides 43 min\u00ac\n isters and 55 office bearers from other parts\n of the country.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Rev. Dr. Rainy, who on rising was\n received with loud cheers, said he was im\u00ac\n pressed with the historic position in which\n they were standing. This was not the end\u00ac\n ing of the case; this is the beginning. How\n it was to be worked out they did not know.\n The House of Lords judgment was so sweep\u00ac\n ing that it was plain. He had no intention\n of assailing those who brought the action\n against them. That would be out of taste\n and out of keeping. While he had no inten\u00ac\n tion of attempting to undervalue the learn\u00ac\n ing and judicial attainments of those who\n gave judgment, that judgment was so aston\u00ac\n ishing that nobody defended it. The judges,\n no doubt, were constrained to deliver their\n judgment by the legal doctrine which they\n conceived ought to prevail. If so, their law\n sometimes diverged most wonderfully from\n</p>\n<p>\n facts and the great interests involved, and\n from the common sense of the community.\n There would be additional trouble before\n them, and litigation\u2014nobody knew how much\n longer continued\u2014before the funds were\n</p>\n<p>\n taken from the general trustees. The friends\n of the Free Church perhaps might be con- I\n gratulated or sympathized with, because a\n picture o? himself went with the College.\n</p>\n<p>\n There was. however, another of himself in\n the Rainy Hall, which, he supposed, might\n be transferred elsewhere. Dr. Rainy went\n on to say they must stand by the missions\n which God had given them. The judgment\n did not, of course, totich that which came\n i D as l T . P. Missions, but he was de\u00ac\n</p>\n<p>\n ceived if it did not very seriously affect\n the missions which it was a great part\n of the historic pride and thankfulness of\n the Free Church to have built up. He\n had no doubt the purpose 0 < .he judgment\n</p>\n<p>\n enabled those who brought the action at all\n events to assail the churches and manses.\n Those were at the mercy of their opponents.\n One could hardly believe it or realize it.\n One must suppose there would be some effort\n made to avoid it. The scandal would be too\n great. That was the broad aspect of the case\n as it stood, and as it had come back to the\n Court of Session to be worked out. It was\n not good for the law of the country to come\n into su ch violent collision with the sensT; of\n the community. After referring to the Law\n Lords\u2019 likening the Church to a mercantile\n company he 6aid they claimed to be the suc\u00ac\n cessors of those who all along history were\n the spiritual, the Liberal, party in the Church\n of Scotland, which defended the rights of\n the people, and were solicitous to preserve\n their own allegiance to the Church. From\n first to last the one dominant purpose had\n prevailed\u2014that it was the right and duty of\n the Church to hear its Master ' s voice and\n its right to obey that voice. That dominant\n purpose was denied and overlooked in this\n judgment, bub they were not going to deny\n it. They attached importance to spiritual\n independence and would maintain solicit\u00ac\n ously the right of the Assembly to act con\u00ac\n stitutionally under its Barrier Act. As to\n the question of clerical domination, with\n which they were charged, those who\n referred to it did not know what they were\n talking about. They had about 1,100 minis\u00ac\n ters and 10,000 elders who were represented\n equally with the ministers in the superior\n courts. They, had depended on the people\n for support, and for carrying them through\n at every step. It was not in their Church\n or among people like them that the clergy\n could run away with the power. In con\u00ac\n clusion, he would be glad if it turned out\n that some arrangement on this matter that\n could be recognized as just, fair and equita\u00ac\n ble could be attained. Without imputing to\n anybody any particular intention one way\n or another, they ought to appeal to the na\u00ac\n tional sense of justice in all political parties.\n This was a case totally unexampled in their\n history since the date of St. Bartholomew.\n</p>\n<p>\n It, was on a wider scale of havoc than the\n Disruption was, and they were entitled < o\n some remedy, even if it were unexampled,\n in the face of this grievous wrong. It was\n not so much the tremendous pecuniary loss\n and the burden of having to replace it that\n called upon them to make an effort of that\n kind. But they were not bound to submit\n to have the interests and principles they\n were representing trampled upon in the face\n of the nation. They might have had many\n faults, but they had not deserved that.\n</p>\n<p>\n The next speaker was Lord Overtoun. who\n said the Lords in their zeal to prevent what\n they thought to be a wrong had committed\n one vastly greater\u2014a cruel injustice. Some\n had said those in the U. F. Church must go\n back. They would never go back. Could\n they go back to a Church which by the\n judgment of the Lord Chancellor had got\n all the property, but was bound down to be\n a frozen Church which could never move?\n He did not envy that Church in its fossilized\n condition as ordered by the Lord Chancellor.\n</p>\n<p>\n Professor Denney. Glasgow, dealt at length\n with the question of election aDd predestina\u00ac\n tion and went on to speak of the Establish\u00ac\n ment principle. Prof. M\u2019Ewen. Edinburgh,\n said the result of the judgment would be that\n the two branches of the Church would be\n bound together with a closeness which might\n not have been reached for twenty years.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thereafter ministers and elders of the va\u00ac\n rious Presbyteries reported on the situa\u00ac\n tion. Among those who spoke was ex-Bailie\n Wallace, Tain, who is 94 years of age, and\n who gave reminiscences of the Disruption.\n The Rev. Nigel Robertson and Dr. McKay.\n Wick, reported hopefull^ of the prospects\n in Caithness; the Rev. John Mackenzie,\n Golspie, spoke for the Dornoch Presbytery;\n Mr. Morrison.

Its origin was due to the passing by\n the^General Assembly of the Free Church of\n the first Declaratory Act, and it consists,\n according to the latest return in \u2018Oliver\n and Boyd,\u2019 of eighteen congregations and\n thirteen ministers, one- of whom is now re\u00ac\n tired. As in the case of the Free Church, the\n strength of the Free Prc-sbyterians, whose\n present Moderator is the Rev. Alexander\n Stewart, Edinburgh, is in the Highlands and\n islands of Scotland, and they have also a\n considerable following among the Highland\u00ac\n ers scattered throughout Canada. Though\n not numerically strong, the Church has a\n number of students training for the minis\u00ac\n try, their theological teacher being the Rev.\n</p>\n<p>\n J. R. Mackay. of Inverness.

If the judgment\n of their Lordships be law the title of the\n English Church to the immense revenues\n Reformation) can be held to be legally taint\u00ac\n ed. The lawyer and the historical student\n can find in the pages of Lingard and other\n high authorities abundant evidence of the\n parallels between the cases of the Free\n Church of Scotland and the United Presby\u00ac\n terian Church and the Roman Catholic Church\n and the Church of England. In this connection\n the legal proceedings, terminating with the\n trfal and execution of the last Roman Catho\u00ac\n lic Lord-Chancellor of England in the reign\n of King Henry VIII, will be perused with\n interest by the adherents of all the churches\n concerned.
