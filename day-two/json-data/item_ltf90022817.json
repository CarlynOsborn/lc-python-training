We all know that slavery is\n regarded with different sentiments in the free States and\n the slave States. It was so from the beginning; but the\n Constitution has wisely left each State to regulate the sub-\n ject according to its own will and pleasure. If the people\n will bear in mind this fundamental truth, and govern them-\n selves accordingly, sectional controversy and excitement\n must soon disappear. The constant discussion and agita-\n tion of the slavery question in the free States, has become\n an intolerable nuisance. A portion of the Northern press\n seem to consider it the only subject of human interest.\n They will not allow us to lose sight of it for a day. In lit-\n ! eraturc, in politics, in religion, they insist that it is the great\n moral pivot on which everything must turn. A stranger in\n the land, ignorant of our history, would infer that for the\n first time we are about to decide whether slavery shall be\n permitted in this country or not. Of course he would be\n greatly surprised to learn that New York, New England,\n and all the free States, abolished slavery many years ago,\n and that no man has yet proposed to restore it. We deci-\n ded that it is not good for us, and we will not have it, thus\n fulfilling our duty, and exhausting our jurisdiction over the\n subject. That should be the end of the matter, so far at\n least as we are concerned. For what legitimate purpose,\n then, is an anti-slavery excitement to be kept alive in the free\n States? Most of the political agitators of the subject\n admit, that they have no power or disposition to interfere\n with slavery in the States where it exists, and many of\n them even repel the idea that they seek in any way to\n benefit the colored population. But nevertheless they wage\n an interminable war of words, proposing nothing for the\n benefit either of master or slave, but leaving the institution\n in full vigor, as a perpetual target for political adventurers.\n</p>\n<p>\n But it is urged, that their real object is to prevent the ex-\n tension of slavery into free territory.
