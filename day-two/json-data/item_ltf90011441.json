The interest awakened was so profound, and the serv-\n ices were so inspiring and impressive, that there has been a widely ex-\n pressed desire to have the proceedings embodied in permanent form in a\n fitting memorial volume. The sermon by the bishop was one of irresist-\n ible power and pathos. The brilliant outline is here, but no type or\n paper can convey any adequate conception of the impression produced by\n the voice, manner, and action of the sacred orator. Three times the pas-\n tor of this church, no minister could be more tenderly and reverently\n loved by the people \u2014 and no wonder, for he consecrated to the service of\n the church his pre-eminent gifts, and generously bore his share of every\n financial burden. During this very visit \u2014 although we had promised for\n his lecture a handsome donation toward his South American Mission\n work \u2014 he refused to take even a dollar for his expenses. Mrs. Newman\u2019s\n services were also greatly appreciated. The reception given by the Trust-\n ees and Ladies\u2019 Association, on November 6, to the bishop and his wife\n was a beautiful and appropriate tribute of appreciation, and was very\n largely attended.\n</p>\n<p>\n The preparation of this volume has largely fallen upon Mr. James\n H. Spencer, 243 8th street N. E. We are under the greatest obligation\n to him, but it has been a labor of love. He will gladly furnish copies\n to all who desire them.\n</p>\n<p>\n We anticipate for the national church a future no less fruitful than has\n been the past, and trust that this memorial volume will not only revive\n pleasing and sacred memories, but be to multitudes a source of strength\n and hope and of renewed devotion to the church of God.\n</p>\n<p>\n Hugh Johnston.\n</p>\n<p>\n Washington, D. C., December 15, 1894.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":

Hugh Johnston, D. D., the pastor of\n the Metropolitan Church, offered prayer. The Scripture lesson was read\n by Bishop John P. Newman.\n</p>\n<p>\n After these devotional exercises Bishop Newman delivered the follow-\n ing discourse on \u201c Illustrious Lives : \u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThese all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having\n seen them afar off, and were persuaded of them, and embraced them, and\n confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.\n</p>\n<p>\n * * * * * * *\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cAnd these all, having obtained a good report through faith, received\n not the promise :\n</p>\n<p>\n \u2018 \u2018 God having provided some better thing for us, that they without us\n should not be made perfect.\u201d \u2014 Heb. 11:13, 39, 40.\n</p>\n<p>\n Three great thoughts are suggested by this venerable text \u2014 the suprem-\n acy of faith, the continuity of personality, and the immortality of good-\n ness. In this famous chapter the great apostle in more than human\n eloquence celebrates the religious character of those whose illustrious\n lives should be recalled with gratitude and gladness by the good and the\n true in all the coming annals of the church. It is a glorious resume of\n the history of religious heroism through four thousand years. It is a\n eulogy on character superior to age, rank, or mission, and a vindication of\n the ways of God to man. Like a rare gem set with precious stones, each\n one a fortune in itself, faith is the conspicuous virtue glorified by courage,\n hope, and enthusiasm. What more comprehensive virtue can be named?\n Faith receives what it can not comprehend, lays hold on the unseen,\n supplements the limitations of our knowledge, and reveals the future ;\n faith binds us to the past and links us to the future ; faith makes the\n hero independent of public opinion, and is the animation of all other\n Christian virtues. It is a mistake to suppose that faith is exhalted at\n the expense of other heroic virtues. It implies courage to denounce the\n degeneration of a nation, to walk the fiery furnace, to endure the lion\u2019s\n den. It supposes hope that animates the soul and sustains courage, and\n is the invisible angel leading us to victory. It includes enthusiasm that\n</p>\n<p>\n 7\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0016/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 269}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0016/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 539}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0016/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 641, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1079}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0016/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1283, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2159}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0016/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2567, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4318}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0016/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tw/en/ty/fi/ft/ha/nn/iv/00/wa/sh/twentyfifthanniv00wash/twentyfifthanniv00wash_0016.jp2", "height": 4318, "width": 2567, "levels": 6, "size": 649879}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"16\">\n<p>\n 8\n</p>\n<p>\n warms the soul to action and inspires the intellect with noblest thoughts.\n It is not faith in isolation, but faith in divine companionship. There is\n nothing greater than faith to reform society.\n</p>\n<p>\n The apostle\u2019s analysis of character is not close. He leaves the equation\n with the Almighty. The persons he considers had great virtues and\n great faults ; he does not disguise their faults nor record them in history.\n He knew that he was dealing with mixed characters ; that in their lives\n were sunshine and shadow, but draws down the curtain of oblivion over\n their foibles and exalts their virtues.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201cThese all died in the faith.\u201d It was the faith in the coming of a\n promised Messiah. That was all. And each in his turn, as he departed\n this life, exclaimed with his dying accents, \u201cBehold He cometh.\u201d The\n magnificence and magnitude of this faith is best discovered by the isola-\n tion of these illustrious persons and the long intervals of time which\n make up the period of four thousand years. In the very dawn of the\n race Abel\u2019s bleeding lamb is the adumbration of his faith that Christ\n would come. A thousand years roll into eternity, and as \u201cEnoch walks\n with God, and he was not, for God took him,\u201d he shouts back to earth, \u201cHe\n is coming.\u201d And nearly a millennium comes and goes ; as Noah shuts the\n door of the ark, he exclaims, \u201cHe is coming.\u201d A century and a half\n thereafter Abraham stands on the summit of Mount Moriah, and as the\n angel arrests his hand raised to slay Isaac, the heavenly voices sing, \u201c In\n Thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed.\u201d Three hundred\n years later Jacob is dying, and a vision arises before him, \u201cThe sceptre\n shall not depart from Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet,\n until Shiloh come.\u201d Two centuries of silence are added to the calendar\n of the world, and Moses prophesies, \u201cThe Lord thy God will raise up unto\n thee a Prophet from the midst of thee of thy brethren, like unto me ;\n unto Him ye shall harken.\u201d The silence of five hundred years is broken\n when David sings, \u201c Lift up your heads, O ye gates ; and be ye lift up,\n ye everlasting doors ; and the King of glory shall come in.\u201d From David\n to Isaiah three centuries come and go when Isaiah apostrophized the future,\n \u201c Who is this that cometh from Edom, with dyed garments from Bozrah,\n travelling in the greatness of his strength?\u201d A hundred years there-\n after, on the banks of Babylon\u2019s river, Daniel beholds the \u201cform of the\n Son of Man,\u201d and three hundred years thereafter the Messianic vision\n reappears to Malachi. Then follows the silence of four centuries, which\n was broken by the song of the angels on the plains of Bethlehem.\n \u201c These all died in the faith \u201d \u2014 the faith that a Saviour would come to\n bless our world.\n</p>\n<p>\n In this analysis two things are apparent\u2014 conspicuity and obscurity.\n Two classes are recognized \u2014 those who will always be prominent in history\n for certain sublime acts and those whose names are simply recorded. But\n it is enough for us to know that obscurity, as well as conspicuity, has a\n place in the order of Divine Providence, and only God can tell which shall\n have the greater weight in fixing character and in determining the des-\n tiny of the world. It would have been disheartening had the apostle\n mentioned Abraham and failed to name Sarah, or Moses without Miriam,\n or the \u201cspies\u201d of Jericho and not the woman Kahab who sheltered\n them from their foes.\n</p>\n<p>\n This suggests a second great thought \u2014 the continuity of personality,\n \u201c that they without us should not be made perfect. \u2019 Every person lives\n a threefold life \u2014 the life that now is, the life immortal, and the life that\n is posthumous. The life that is physical allies us to the animal creation ;\n the intellectual lifts us to companionship with the angels, and makes man\n capable of appreciating the works of God in nature; and the spiritual\n life raises us to conmanionship with the Father Almighty. Man\u2019s im-\n mortal life is a sublime fact and full of heavenly cheer ; but there is\n solitude in personal immortality. It severs us from the earth we love\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0017/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 269}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0017/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 539}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0017/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 641, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1079}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0017/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1283, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2159}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0017/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2567, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4318}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0017/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tw/en/ty/fi/ft/ha/nn/iv/00/wa/sh/twentyfifthanniv00wash/twentyfifthanniv00wash_0017.jp2", "height": 4318, "width": 2567, "levels": 6, "size": 488722}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"17\">\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n Metropolitan Memorial Methodist Episcopal Church.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0018/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 269}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0018/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 539}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0018/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 641, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1079}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0018/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1283, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2159}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0018/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2567, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4318}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0018/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tw/en/ty/fi/ft/ha/nn/iv/00/wa/sh/twentyfifthanniv00wash/twentyfifthanniv00wash_0018.jp2", "height": 4318, "width": 2567, "levels": 6, "size": 273296}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"18\">\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n * . -

With-\n out this corporate immortality, this perpetual association with the destiny\n of our race, life would be a mystery, our immortality an enigma ; but,\n given continuity of existence, and the mystery of existence is explained.\n With this great truth before me, what care I though \u201cthese all died in\n the faith,\u201d with hopes not realized ; died amid their usefulness ; yielded\n to the limit of human endeavor. Apparently they failed. Were they\n failures? \u201cThey saw the promise afar off.\u201d How far? A thousand\n years ? Yes ; Abel saw them four thousand years. What worry and\n pain and work they must have endured. How powerful are the reasons\n for this belief in our continued existence among the children of men. How\n shall we explain the disproportion between what we feel as possibilities\n within us and the small results that follow? Is your life a failure?\n Without the inspiration of this great, thought, I do not wonder that de-\n spondency seizes the soul like an invisible power. In such a moment you\n are tempted to s licide. The rope, the poisoned cup, the gliding river\n invite you to the banquet of death.\n</p>\n<p>\n There are times when we sing with Faber \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Oh, it is hard to work for God,\n</p>\n<p>\n To rise and take His part\n</p>\n<p>\n Upon this battle field of earth,\n</p>\n<p>\n And not sometimes lose heart.\n</p>\n<p>\n He hides Himself so wondrously,\n</p>\n<p>\n As though there were no God ;\n</p>\n<p>\n He is least seen when all the powers\n Of ill are most abroad.\n</p>\n<p>\n Or He deserts us in the hour\n The fight is all but lost,\n</p>\n<p>\n And seems to leave us to ourselves\n Just when we need Him most.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is not so, but so it looks,\n</p>\n<p>\n And we lose courage then,\n</p>\n<p>\n And doubts will come if God hath kept\n His promises to men.\n</p>\n<p>\n But right is right, since God is God,\n</p>\n<p>\n And right the day mu\u00abt win ;\n</p>\n<p>\n To doubt would be disloyalty,\n</p>\n<p>\n T To falter would be sin.\n</p>\n<p>\n Wait patiently. The future of this world belongs to you. Look at the\n possibilities and~ the incompleteness of your plans for usefulness. Were\n each life rounded, complete progress would be limited to each personality ;\n but now we are all contributors to one great whole. Out of this very in-\n completeness comes our longing after something which links us to the\n past. This gives us an abiding interest in this life. W T e carry that inter-\n est with us. Why are we amoitious to leave behind us a good name?\n There is hope within us that we shall still live among the children of\n men. We do not come and go as generations, but as a race which never\n dies. Pascal has said that \u201cmankind are as one man, ever living and\n evergrowing, but never dying\u201d \u2014 \u201cthat they without us should not be\n made perfect.\u201d The past is handed down and the future is born of the\n present. This is the law of transmission.

Some\n would be great if they stood among their equals, great if they stood\n among the greatest ; but the number of such is small. We ought, there-\n fore, to turn for comfort to this blessed chapter, which declares that genera-\n tions are linked together. I suppose within ten years after we are dead\n all of us here will be forgotten. It is really a melancholy feeling that\n steals over the soul, but then comes the gr.at thought of recognition both\n in the future of our race an t in the iuture of our souls. Would you have\n an illustration of this associate immortality ? Turn to the tablets on yon\n wall in memory of the great soldiers, Grant and Logan. But their achiev-\n ments are attributed to those heroic men who composed the Grand Army\n of the Republic, some of whom surround me to-day ; but the great major-\n ity sleep in heroes\u2019 graves. You may not be great in your endowments,\n but you may be allied to others whose lives will be sublime. You have\n heard of Kitto, a voluminous and attractive Biblical writer, to whom the\n clergy are so largely indebted. But what is the name of that obscure\n English layman, who on a Sunday afternoon went to an English poor-\n house and there saw a deaf pauper, but in whose eye was the glint of\n genius. The child was adopted and educated. That was Kitto. He will\n share his glory with the man who rescued him. When you go to Hong\n Kong, China, enter the Victoria Library, wherein you will see a Bible\n and lexicon in Chinese and English, and near them an autograph letter\n from Queen Victoria thanking Morrison for what he had done for China.\n But what is the name of that Christian woman, that Sunday-school\n teacher, who on a Sunday, in ?n English metropolis, found the neglected\n boy Morrison and took him to the Sunday-school? The glory of the great\n Morrison will be shared by the woman that led him to Christ. It is or-\n dained that the mightiest workers work out of sight. When passing over\n the Indian Ocean, where the polypi build their coral throne, I found an\n illustration of this fact, They work out of sight ; but soon the dome of\n the island appears above the bosom of the briny deep. The wild winds\n scatter dust thereon ; the wild birds drop seed thereon. Soon plants gro w,\n and flowers bloom, and people sit beneath their fragiance. Our mothers\n work out of sight \u2014 these guardians of our childhood, the companions of\n our manhood. They are the mightiest workers. There will be a mothers\u2019\n day when we stand before the judgment seat. There is no velvet so soft\n as a mother\u2019s lap ; no rose so sweet as a mother ' s cheek ; no music so\n charming as a mother\u2019s voice. They will be crowned with glory, and they\n can say to fathers, husbands, brothers, \u201cyou without us can not be made\n perfect.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n And in view of all these facts, I am not surprised with the greater truth\n of the immortality of goodness. \u201c The righteous shall be held in everlast-\n ing remembrance.\u201d Last summer Mrs. Newman and I stood in the Roman\n forum, on the very spot where lay Cmsar\u2019s dead body, and where Mark\n Antony held up the bloody garments of the dead Ceesar and said :\n</p>\n<p>\n The evil that m* > n do lives after them ;\n</p>\n<p>\n The geod is often interred with their bones ;\n</p>\n<p>\n So let it be with Caesar.\n</p>\n<p>\n I could almost hear Antony\u2019s voice echo amid the seven hills. But\n what he said is not true; for the memory of the wicked shall perish, while\n that of the righteous is immortal. You and I have lived long enough to\n see the mighty changes that have taken place in the verdicts of history.\n The martyr of to-day is the prophet of to-morrow ; m n who die under a\n cloud reappear in the full sunshine of God\u2019s glory.

Yonder in his pew was Emery, a tower of strength. Near by\n was Fowler, who is present to-day, the patient and successful treasurer of\n the church. There was Norment, eloquent and energetic ; Lutz, amiable,\n gentle, enthusiastic ; Tullock, whose pen was that of a ready writer, con-\n secrated to Christ ; Burr, intelligent and pious, superintendent of the\n Sunday-school; Howard, the \u201cbel oved physician.\u201d And memory can\n never forget Pursell, that calm and beautiful spirit ; and Ruff, full of holy\n ern tion ; and Lane, and Perry, and Tasker, and Charlton, and C.

Were I an artist, I would paint a picture\n for the. immortality of that blessed group on which coming generations\n might gaze. What scenes I have witnessed around this altar.

The 1,000 children, besides many adults who have\n passed into the Sabbath- school, and from it into the active work of the\n church, have been made better and stronger for the Christian conflict.\n We are to hear from many of those who have been with the Sabbath-school\n from the beginning. They v\\ ill tell you in fitting words some of the inci-\n dents which cluster around memories that are dear to many hearts, and\n without taking your time, I now have the pleasure to ask your attention\n to the program which will follow.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Andrew B. Duvall said :\n</p>\n<p>\n I am one of the antediluvians. Although old age has not overtaken\n me and bent my form or whitened my locks, yet the fact remains that I\n am the earliest surviving superintendent of the school.\n</p>\n<p>\n Twenty-five years ago I was wedded in, and at the same time wedded\n to, the church, and immediately transferred my membership here and\n took a class in the school. David A. Burr, whom I had known well,\n and with whom I had worked at Wesley Chapel, had just removed from\n the city, and Mr. John A. Ruff was superintendent. Brother Burr was\n a truly noble man, the most enthusiastic and progressive Sunday-school\n man 1 ever met ; his organization of the school was complete. Brother\n Ruff was a whole-souled, happy, and cheerful Christian banker, and ren-\n dered good service. I was his assistant for one year, and then succeeded\n him as superintendent for two years.\n</p>\n<p>\n I do not know how it is, but somehow it seems to me the best and most\n lovable people in the city have always been connected with the Metro-\n politan Church. In those earlier days there were Mrs Somers, Gen. and\n Mrs. Cowan with their large Bible class, S. S. Bryant, Mrs. Havenner,\n D. B. Mack, L. C. Tallmadge, and others, among whom, of course (for\n they have always been), were Miss Cornelia Pursell and Brother Burlew ;\n but I do not think it would be fair to judge Brother Burlew\u2019s singing\n qualities and ability by his success in teaching me. And there v as Thos.\n J. S. Perry; who can ever forget \u201cTom\u201d Perry, as he was familiarly\n and lovingly called ?

Why, a few years ago,\n while I was teaching my class over in that corner, I looked over the\n school, and there I had a representative in each of the departments \u2014\n primary, intermediate, and junior. Faithful men and women were doing\n for my children what I had been trying to do for the children of others.\n Who can fail to see that such work pays ? Are not its wages both sweet\n and prompt?\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. A. P. Lacey being prevented from taking part in the exercises by\n reason of serious sickness of several months\u2019 duration, Mr. C. M. Lacey\n Sites was requested to present the facts concerning Mr. Lacey\u2019s connection\n with the school, which he did in the following paper :\n</p>\n<p>\n Capt. A. P. Lacey has been actively connected with the school for more\n than twenty-three years, since July, 1871, successively as teacher, as pres-\n ident of the missionary society, as assistant superintendent, and as superin-\n tendent.\n</p>\n<p>\n When he assumed the duties of superintendent, the crushing debt\n which rested on the church property, with accumulating interest, was\n beginning to weigh most heavily upon the church. This burden ham-\n pered the activities not only of the church, but of the Sunday-school as\n well, both directly and indirectly.\n</p>\n<p>\n Sources of revenue, which had previously supplied the school with\n needed funds for its work, were cut off, and it became necessary that the\n school should unite its efforts with those of the church membership to\n raise funds for current expenses.\n</p>\n<p>\n For seven years the problem of Sunday-school finances demanded a\n large share of the attention of the officers of the school. Never were the\n spiritual interests of the school allowed to flag. Never were the zeal of\n the teachers and the love of the scholars for their school more active than\n during this period. But the burden inevitably hampered the growth and\n extension of the school. The debt having at last been lifted from the\n church, the school was relieved of a large share of the burden which had\n rested upon it, and it was practicable to turn its working force more\n directly to its upbuilding and advancement.\n</p>\n<p>\n During all these years of depression Capt. Lacey enjoyed the co-opera-\n tion of a noble band of devoted Christian teachers. Himself always faith-\n ful, prompt, and cordial, never absent from his post of duty in the school,\n at teachers\u2019 meeting, or in the church service, he inspired his corps of\n teachers with his own earnestness of purpose and active consecration to\n the work of the Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n No outlay of time or of thought on his part was too great if it could\n promote the haopiness or the welfare of the scholars by means of excur-\n sions, entertainments, Children\u2019s Day exercises, or by adding interest to\n the regular work of the school.\n</p>\n<p>\n Always genial and unselfish in his relations to teachers and scholars\n and unfailing in warm Christian courtesy to strangers, always practical,\n forceful, scholarly, and manifesting the love of Christ in his addresses\n from the platform, he won all hearts and built up for himself in this school\n an imperishable monument in the respect and love of its members and of\n all who knew him here.\n</p>\n<p>\n Shortly after the \u201cjubilee\u201d day, when the church debt was extin-\n guished, Capt. Lacey retired from the superintendency. He left to his\n successor a school strong in purpose, active, vigorous in every depart-\n ment, and fully equipped and prepared to move forward to higher achieve-\n ments and broader victories than had been possible under the conditions\n previously existing.\n</p>\n<p>\n We stand, as a school, at the summit of our first quarter-century.

Hall was as follows :\n</p>\n<p>\n I have great pleasure this afternoon in being permitted to join in the\n congratulations to the members of the Metropolitan Church and Sunday-\n school upon this occasion of their silver- wedding anniversary.\n</p>\n<p>\n Twenty-five years ago the Metropolitan Church and Sunday-school\n were joined together in the most holy bonds, and, I am glad to say, have\n lived together in peace and harmony for this quarter of a century.\n</p>\n<p>\n I was present at the dedication, and had the honor of \u201c standing up \u201d\n during the ceremony, for I was too gallant a young man to keep my seat\n when so many ladies and gentlemen were compelled to stand.\n</p>\n<p>\n With the circumstances associated with my earliest connection with\n the Metropolitan Church very few of its present members are familiar,\n for I have seldom spoken of it to anyone. It antedates the day of dedica-\n tion just one year and five months. I came to Washington early in\n November, 1867, to accept a Government position. The first private resi-\n dence I ever entered in this citv was the large house which stands on the\n opposite corner of Four-and-a-half and C streets, just across the way. It\n was then, as now, the residence of Mr. Lutz, and the Rev. Dr. DeHaas,\n who was the agent of the General Conference in superintending the erec-\n tion of the church and the collection of funds, was at that time making\n his home w r ith Mr. Lutz. The first night after my arrival in the city I\n called upon Dr. DeHaas, as I had a letter of introduction to him from my\n brother, who had been a member of his church in Brooklyn and was con-\n verted under his preaching. I also had with me mv church letter, which\n I desired to depo it at once, as I was a stranger in the city. After the\n first greetings were over, I handed my church Ltter to the doctor,\n and said that I desired to become a member of the Metropolitan Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c Why,\u201d said he, \u201cthe church is not finished yet, nor dedicated ; the\n floors are not even laid.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n I replied \u201cWell, doctor, I am sorry for that, but I came here f illy ex-\n pecting to become a member of the Metropolitan Church, of which I have\n heard so much, and I do not desire to join any other.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The doctor smiled a n d seemed pleased with my earnestness, and re-\n plied, \u201c Very well, Brother Hall, you may give me your letter and I will\n deposit it with my church papers, and when the church is finished and\n organized, it will be read with the other letters of those who become\n members on that day. In the meantime you will want to worship regu-\n larly at some church, and I would recommend you to attend Wesley\n Chapel.\u201d I therefore became a regular attendant at Wesley from that\n time until the day of dedication, and was soon appointed a teacher in\n the Sunday-school, although I never was a member of that church.

S. Bryant and many others who\n afterwards became members of the Metropolitan Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the Metropolitan Sunday-school was organized, I went into the\n Bible class. I was unable to be \" present at the organization one month\n after the dedication, being confined in Providence Hospital with a severe\n attack of quinsy just at that time.\n</p>\n<p>\n Shortly after my marriage that year I removed from the city, but re-\n turned in two or three years, and \" then became a teacher in the Sunday-\n school and had a very \" fine class of boys. Among the members of that\n class whom I now recall was Carroll McKenney, the bright and promising\n young lawyer, who only a week ago was so suddenly taken away by\n typhoid fever just as he was entering upon an auspicious career. Other\n members of that class are to-day honored and respected citizens of Wash-\n ington and other cities. Mr. C. M. L. Sites, Mr. Andrew Tallmadge, and\n Mr. William Fullerton, of Chicago, were ^lso members. And right here I\n might pause to suggest what an excellent thing it would be if in our Sun-\n day-schools we should keep such a record of all our scholars that in after\n years, when we have anniversaries like this, we might be able to call the\n roll and point to them wherever they may be, or as they may occupy\n prominent and honored places in the different spheres in life, ns a stimulus\n and an encouragement to go on in the good work. I should like to know\n how many of the men who to-day are filling honorable places in the coun-\n try received their first religious instructions in the Sunday-school of the\n Metropolitan Church.\n</p>\n<p>\n For many years I remained an humble teacher in the Sunday-school,\n seeking no office in the church, for I loved the work of teaching and was\n content with that. In later years I became president of the missionary\n society, and was subsequently elected assistant superintendent, and lor\n two terms was superintendent of the Sunday-school. How successful or\n unsuccessful was my administration of that important office the records\n of the school will show. I only know that I gave my whole strength and\n thought to the work of trying to build up a model Sabbath-school.\n</p>\n<p>\n I had always felt a great interest in the Metropolitan Church from the\n prominent place it held in Methodism, and I therefore had a desire, and\n it was my ambition, that it should have the best, if not the largest,\n Sunday-school in the land, from which should go out through its length\n and breadth an inspiration and example for good, which should be felt\n and followed by all with whom we came in contact through the many\n visitors from the different States and cities who honored us with their\n presence. With this object in view, a number of changes were deemed\n necessary in order to get the school out of the grooves in which it had\n been ru 1 1 ning. What changes were wrought in the school during those two\n years it is hardly necessary, and possibly not becoming in me, to mention\n here, except as a matter of history in reviewing the progress of the school.\n The constitution and rules of the school were revised and amended in\n many important points. The school was graded into primary, interme-\n diate, junior, and senior departments, with a graded lesson help for each\n department, and on each Children\u2019s Day such scholars as were found\n qualified were graduated from the lower to the higher grades, each young\n graduate receiving a neat diploma. Up to that time but one lesson help\n was used in the entire school outside of the infant class. A register was\n placed in the school, in which the names of all visit rs were recorded, and\n an officer of the school was placed at the door to greet all strangers and\n make them feel at home. A new financial system was inaugurated, and\n the Easter offering became a fixed institution, and solved the prat lem\n which had embarrassed us for fifteen years, of how to raise sufficient funds\n for the support of the school without interfering with the missionary or\n educational collections. With the funds thus raised we were able to keep\n out of debt, purchase much needed accessories, and provide ent /rtainments\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0029/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 269}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0029/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 539}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0029/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 641, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1079}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0029/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1283, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2159}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0029/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2567, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4318}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0029/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tw/en/ty/fi/ft/ha/nn/iv/00/wa/sh/twentyfifthanniv00wash/twentyfifthanniv00wash_0029.jp2", "height": 4318, "width": 2567, "levels": 6, "size": 514401}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"29\">\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n mm\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n .\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n I Mil\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n iBillWl*\n</p>\n<p>\n WilEBlIR\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n \u25a0\n</p>\n<p>\n iiiifs\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n MISS CORNELIA A.

Entering the\n school on Four-and-a-half street, my attention was attracted by Charles\n H. Lane, long since deceased, who gave me a hearty welcome. Brother\n D. A.

Burlew, chorister; Miss Cornelia Pursell, primary\n departmen teacher.\n</p>\n<p>\n Brother Burr was a tall, slender man, with a sympathetic face, whose\n piety was so intense that he left its impress upon all.

The\n school is organized with officers necessary to the successful carrying on\n of the work. The teachers are self-denying, earnest, and faithful, and\n endeavor to instill into the minds of these men the truths contained in\n God\u2019s Word. The exercises consist of singing, prayer, reading the\n Scripture in concert, a lesson adapted by the teacher \" to the ability of\n the scholar, a passage of Scripture either read or recited by the\n scholars, and a talk by Mrs. M. L. Collins, who takes a few verses from\n the Bible or a Bible story, translates it into Chinese, and explains it.\n All listen attentively to her, and the truth is given to those who can not\n as yet either speak or understand English, and we trust seed is sown\n which will spring up and bring forth an abundant harvest. AYe are highly\n favored in having Mrs. Collins as assistant superintendent as well as\n teacher. She spent many years in China, and speaks the Cantonese dialect\n fluently. Her soul is in the work, and she spares no effort to benefit these\n men.\n</p>\n<p>\n Eight of the men have been baptized, 4 of whom are in the school at\n the present time.\n</p>\n<p>\n A collection is taken each Sunday by one of the pupils.

I am proud to be put down\n as one of Brother Bryant\u2019s boys, and while so much of my life has been\n wasted that I have made no appreciable mark in the world, yet I am\n proud to see so very many young men in our community successful be-\n cause of Brother Bryant\u2019s kind care and instruction. I know he was even\n more than father to me. I would like to mention the names of a few of\n these boys as they occur to me. I did not know them all, and forget\n some. There were Alex. Belaski and Wm. Van Arsdale, now preachers in\n our conference. Bobert Stead stands high among the architects of Wash-\n ington. W. H. Houghton is at the head of a large mercantile firm.\n Elkana N. Waters, now a pillar in the Episcopal Church, is secretary of\n the Board of Underwriters of the Distr.ct of Columbia. Mr. Bryant\u2019s\n daughter, Nellie, married one of his boys, Charley Stearns. Nearly all the\n young men of our church prior to 1890 at one time or another passed\n through either the church class or Sunday-school class led by Brother\n Bryant. Prof. C. M. L. Sites is with us to-day, and Prof. Percy Hughes\n sends regrets ; both are Brother Bryant\u2019s boys. He had a very large class\n of young men at Wesley Chapel before Metropolitan Church was organ-\n ized. There are many more, but time is not allowed me to even give the\n names.\n</p>\n<p>\n Occasions like this must al ways have a large vein of sadness, unless we\n look to the future as well as at the past. As for the dead, I can not but\n feel their presence here this beautiful afternoon. By their influence and\n precious memory they may always be with us, and should shape largely\n our present activity. From the \u201c Memorabilia\u201d on the printed program\n it will be seen that our church was to be the church of a nation, and,\n placed at this metropolis, it has acquired the name \u201c Metropolitan.\u201d But\n this only faintly indicates its position or mission. It is in reality \u201ccosmo-\n politan,\u201d and its power and example should reach around the world, as\n have the travels of its forme* pas ' , or, Bishop Newman. It is gratifying\n to see this Chinese class and to hear of the methods pursued by the Ep-\n worth League of the church, but they should only faintly adumbrate\n what the future will disclose as to the work accomplished by this church.\n It seems a shame that outside organizations should be permitted to do\n what can be done so much better by a church of this size and scope. Es-\n pecially is this true of every effort made to reach the stranger in our\n midst.\n</p>\n<p>\n I can not resist the impression that Metropolitan Church makes upon me\n as of a great ship \u2014 an ocean liner we will say. While we are gratified to\n witness these memorial i ablets and to know that the great men of this\n nation found here a church home and time to worship God, our hearts go\n out to those humbler ones who have worked below the decks, storing in\n the coal and raising the steam that has propelled her to this present proud\n position on the high seas of salvation. I hope these brave workers, almost\n unseen save of God, may never lose heart, and that the prayers and\n Pentecostal seasons still experienced in the lower sanctuary may never\n grow less. No pastor will succeed without them, and any success apart\n from such influences will be unreal and unsatisfactory.\n</p>\n<p>\n I am glad the wo kers of the church hold out and hold on so well.\n There is a great temptation to compare notes, to talk it all over, but in\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0035/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 269}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0035/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 539}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0035/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 641, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1079}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0035/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1283, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2159}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0035/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2567, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4318}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0035/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tw/en/ty/fi/ft/ha/nn/iv/00/wa/sh/twentyfifthanniv00wash/twentyfifthanniv00wash_0035.jp2", "height": 4318, "width": 2567, "levels": 6, "size": 427490}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"35\">\n<p>\n MR.

Organization\n of the young for the salvation oil the young is the greatest need of the\n church to-day.\u201d The truth of this statement is attested by the compara-\n tively recent organization and unparalleled growth of the several young\n people\u2019s societies connected with the various Protestant denominations.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Ep worth League was so recently born that, from its tender age\n alone, it can scarcely claim attention in these memorial exercises, as Met-\n ropolitan Church had been in existence quite twenty ye irs, covering the\n whole period of the several pastorates of Bishop Newman, before the\n league saw the light of day. Other than briefest remarks in retrospection\n ought not, therefore, to be expected at this time.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Sunday-school has been called the nursery of the church, and ours\n has been doing duty in this direction for a quarter of a century ; but the\n Epworth League is a training school for children of a larger growth,\n and our chapter has been in existence only one-fifth as long. On next\n Monday evening five years will have elapsed since Metropolitan chapter\n sprang into existence quite like Pallas-Athene, clad from head to foot in\n Pauline armor. Rev. Dr. Geo. H. Corey was then our pastor. He, with\n others, saw and felt the need of the aid and support of the younger church\n membership. It was in November, 1889, when Dr. Corey gave notice that\n a meeting would be held for the purpose of organizing a young people\u2019s\n society in the church. It is scarcely necessary to recall with whao unanim-\n ity of thought and purpose the people came together and effected the organ-\n ization of a chapter of the Epworth League, which from that day unto this\n has been a positive, active, and effective Christian force at work in our\n midst, not for personal aggrandizement, but for the sake of Christian\n healthfulness and helpfulness. It was the first society organized under\n the name Epworth League in the District of Columbia, save one. Dum-\n barton Avenue Church, Georgetown, has the honor of having the first\n charter for the District.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is not a league in name only, but a harmonious and united\n body composed of the young people of the church and congregation,\n loyal to the church and its pastor. I say young, for, in paraphrase, men\n and women are only boys and girls grown tall ; hearts don\u2019t change much\n (sometimes) after all. I think I but voice the sentiment of all in saying\n that the league from its inception became a reservoir of vital spiritual\n forces, from which have been constantly flowing streams of inspiring in-\n fluences ennobling all, even the stranger within our gates. AYitness the\n Sunday evening service ! Through summer\u2019s heat and winter\u2019s cold a\n goodly number of Godly workers have met for praise and sacred song, for\n self-help and to help one another.

True greatness was long ago exemplified\n in Jesus Christ, w ho went about doing good. Happy through all eternity\n is that one who leaves in the memory of those who remain behind a glow\n of sunshine full of heavenly pow ' er as he vanishes from the earth. In\n the gr.-at hereafter it will not be cons dered whether that one did some\n great deed, but whether he did some great good. Bravery and heroism\n are, indeed, essential elements of true manhood and womanhood, but it\n is the rugged courage of a hero in that youth\u2019s soul who persistently\n stands by his Epworth motto, \u201cLook up, lift up,\u201d and does not com-\n promise with evil \u201c even though a thousand foes beset him round.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The league\u2019s motto is worthy of our notice. It epitomizes a great dual\n truth, which I wish each one might hold in fond remembrance, espe-\n cially when you feel man\u2019s inhumanity to man. It is your twofold\n relationship and duty to God and to your fellow men, tersely expressed\n in the forceful words, \u201c Fatherhood of God and brotherhood of man.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n As I said in effect at the beginning, it is not retrospect, but prospect,\n which the league has to offer as its share in this afternoon\u2019s. service. The\n movement of onr Epworth League had its origin in the assumption that\n there is work for young Christians, and that there aie some things young\n Christians can do which older Christians can not so easily accomplish. A\n story will illustrate this : On the coast of Normandy a woman, with her\n child in her arms, once became entanglt d in a stretch of quicksand and\n could not get free. A wagon drawn by strong horses was sent to the res-\n cue and sank in the sand. All means tried failed. At last a light-footed\n boy was sent speeding over the sands with a life-line, and mother and\n child were saved. 1 Our Epworth League is that light-footed boy, who can\n go where the heavy ecclesiastical wagon sinks by its own weight. Every\n Christian ought to regard himself as sent out with a life-line to help some-\n body or save somebody. One ought to do this, first, for his own sake ;\n second, your brother needs, perchance, the Christian assistance your\n activity can give. \u201c Old men for counsel, young men for action.\u201d You\n can interest him in manly, invigorating physical exercise. It can be found\n in the gymnasium or cn the campus. Would that every church were in\n possession of these means by which young men could be reached and kept\n away from vice and corruption.

Newman entered\n the church, and were provided with seats about the altar, the bishop\n choosing a seat with the infant class. At the conclusion of one of the\n addresses, Dr. Johnston proposed \u201cthat we bear from the infant class, and\n that w T e call upon Bishop Newman to respond. \u201d The bishop, in a few well-\n chosen words, electrified all present by touching many of the golden\n chords that bind childhood and old age in sweet memories in Metropoli-\n tan Church. Mrs. Newman w T as then introduced, and talked for a few\n minutes to the edification of all present.\n</p>\n<p>\n In closing the service, Dr. Johnston said :\n</p>\n<p>\n I congratulate the school and league upon the success of this service.\n The Sunday-school is the teaching agency of the church. It is not an in-\n stitution apart from the church, but is, in fact, the church itself moving\n in a particular direction, acting upon the young. I also desire to empha-\n size the remark of the bishop on the importance of the Epworth League.\n Others have made the church what it is to-day ; you are to make the\n church of the future. If the record of the coming twenty-five years be as\n glorious as the history of the past, it will be because of yr ur fidelity and\n your consecration to Christ and His church. May God\u2019s richest blessing\n rest upon the Metropolitan Sunday-school and Epworth League.\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url":

It kept pace fairly with the\n increase of population, but it had no churches of any considerable size.\n About the middle of the century the movement began for the erection of\n a national church at the capital, representative in its character, and af-\n fording a home for Methodists from all sections of the country, called here\n by business or pleasure.\n</p>\n<p>\n On March 30, 1852, Clias. W. Boteler, Wm. G. Deale, Chas. LI. Lane,\n Samuel Norment, Dr. Flodoardo Howard, Thomas Pursell, Thomas H.\n Ilavenner, and Z. W. McKnew, members of old Wesley Chapel, pur-\n chased the property at the southwest corner of Four-and-a-half and C\n streets, upon which the church was afterwards erected. This location was\n then in the most desirable residence portion of the city.\n</p>\n<p>\n The history of the Metropolitan Church is unlike that of any other\n erected in the denomination, in that the General Conferences have adopted\n it from its inception and dealt with it in an altogether exceptional man-\n ner. On May 10, 1852, the General Conference passed the following res-\n olution : \u201cThat, regarding the success of the enterprise as of high im-\n portance to the interests of Methodism throughout the country, we will\n give it our individual influence in our respective annual conferences,\n and by all appropriate means aid in its promotion.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n At the session of the Baltimore Conference, March 2, 1853, the Rev.\n Henry Sheer, D. D., one of the ablest men in the conference, was\n appointed agent. He collected considerable money, which was applied to\n the purchase of the land, but the agitated state of the country caused the\n enterprise to lag until the session of the General Conference of 1856.\n There, upon the report of a committee consisting of Rev. Drs. John Mc-\n Clintock, M. Raymond, J. P. Durbin, J. V. Watson, and Edward Thomp-\n son, the conference resolved, \u201cThat we erect in the metropolis of our\n nation a large, attractive denominational church edifice, which should be\n regarded as a connectional monument to our beloved Methodism, as ex-\n pressive of our gratitude to God for the honor he has vouchsafed to con-\n fer on us in making us the instruments of spreading Scriptural holiness\n so extensively through these lands ; that the honor of the church is\n pledged to the accomplishment of this enterprise, and so pledged that its\n failure would subject the church to merited reproach.\u201d Also, resolved,\n \u201cThat, in view of the connectional character of the Metropolitan Church, it\n is the judgment of this General Conference that the bishops in making\n appointments should, by a transfer, supply said church with pastors suc-\n</p>\n<p>\n 25\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0044/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 269}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0044/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 539}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0044/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 641, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1079}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0044/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1283, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2159}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0044/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2567, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4318}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0044/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tw/en/ty/fi/ft/ha/nn/iv/00/wa/sh/twentyfifthanniv00wash/twentyfifthanniv00wash_0044.jp2", "height": 4318, "width": 2567, "levels": 6, "size": 631693}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"44\">\n<p>\n cessively from all parts of our work.\u201d The Baltimore Conference then\n appointed Rev.

Bishop Simpson\n preached in the morning ; text, Ezekiel 47:9. In the afternoon, Rev. W.\n Morley Punshon, A. M., the distinguished Wesleyan ; text, 1 Peter 2:4.\n In the evening, Rev. Thomas M. Eddy, I) D. ; text, 1 Corinthians 4:4.\n The dedicatory services were conducted by Bishop Simpson, assisted by\n Rev. Drs. DeHaas, Plamilton, Kynett, and Cookman.\n</p>\n<p>\n A singular coincidence occurred on dedication day. Dr. Punshon had\n selected for his sermon the same text used by Bishop Simpson for the\n morning discourse, and he was compelled to change both his text and\n subject. It is worthy of comment that, while the Dominion of Canada\n loaned us her Punshon twenty-five years ago, at this anniversary we find\n as our beloved pastor another Canadian, Rev. Hugh Johnston, D.

This was the week of Gen.\n Grant\u2019s first inauguration, and the city was thronged with visitors.\n</p>\n<p>\n On Easter Sunday, March 28, 1869, the church was organized by Rev.\n John P. Newman, D.*D., as pastor. He received 94 persons into mem-\n bership by letter and 3 on probation. An immense congregation was\n present, among whom were the President, the Vice-President, the Chief\n Justice of the United States, and many members of Congress and repre-\n sen ative citizens. Dr. Newman\u2019s text was Matthew 28:6.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Sunday-school was organized at the same time, with David A. Burr,\n esq., as superintendent; Miss Cornelia A.

Grant occupied his pew for\n eight years, Vice-President Colfax his pew for four years, and Chief Jus-\n tice Chase his pew for four years.

He filled the full measure of anticipa-\n tion ; and the pulpit of Metropolitan Church became known throughout\n the land, at once exercising a mighty influence for righteousness and mak-\n ing Methodism conspicuous.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the church was dedicated, there remained a debt of $75,000, the\n structure having cost in the neighborhood of $200,000. Twenty -five\n thousand dollars of this indebtedness was a floating debt, and $50,000 was\n represented by bonds secured upon the church property. The floating\n indebtedness was liquidated during Dr. Newman\u2019s first pastorate, one of\n the instrumentalities being a national committee, of which Mrs. Grant,\n wife of Gen. Grant, was chairman. This committee sent out an appeal in\n the shape of an autograph letter by Mrs. Grant, and secured upwards of\n $ 8 , 000 .\n</p>\n<p>\n Washington Methodism had far exceeded the utmost limits of expecta-\n tion in its contributions for the erection of the church. It was never the\n intention that the payment of this bonded debt should fall upon the con-\n gregation worshiping here. The enterprise was in its inception pro-\n fessedly a connectional enterprise for Methodism at large. Accordingly,\n a memorial was presented to the General Conference of 1872, reciting the\n dedication of the church, its successful operation for three years, and the\n existence of the bonded debt, provisions for the payment of which, it was\n claimed, should be made by the General Conference. This was a unique\n memorial, signed by the President of the United States and the Chief\n Justice of the United States, in connection with the other trustees of the\n church.\n</p>\n<p>\n The General Conference of May, 1872, adopted a report, which states :\n \u201c The action of previous conferences is fully recognized ; the Metropolitan\n Church is a connectional enterprise. It has been erected under the highest\n sanction of the church and for the people of the whole country.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n At a meeting of the bishops following the conference the trustees of the\n church were advised to communicate the facts to the \u201c general committee\n on church extension,\u201d which recommended the \u201cboard of church ex-\n tension\u201d to indorse the bonds of the church for $35,000, with a deed of\n trust on the property as security, provided the trustees of the church\n would guarantee the punctual payment of interest on the bonds, and that\n all other indebtedness of the church be removed. The board of church\n extension, however, declined to indorse the bonds of the church, because\n they were advised they had no legal authority, under their charter, to in-\n dorse any bonds. This was a grave disappointment at the time, and\n seriously imperiled the effort to provide for the debt. The compensation\n came, however, six years afterwards, when Chaplain McCabe, the secre-\n tary of the same board, performed his herculean task.\n</p>\n<p>\n Before their declination had been communicated, and with the hope\n that relief would be thus afforded, Rev. Otis H. Tiffany, D. I)., who was\n then pastor of the church, assisted by the Rev. Dr. Ives, of Auburn, N.\n Y., obtained a very large subscription in the church; and on the\n 1st of January, 1874, the $50,000 deed of trust was released, and a new\n deed of trust, to secure $35,000 in bonds, was executed, and at the same\n time the trustees entered into a personal obligation to pay the interest on\n these bonds.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1876 the matter of the debt was again laid before the General Con-\n ference, and the bishops were authorized to appoint an agent for the\n church. In November, 1876, they appointed Rev. Dr. Newman, who was\n then pastor of the church.

Finan-\n cial affairs had now reached a deplorable condition. Suit had been brought\n against the trustees personally on the bond for accumulated interest, and\n a crisis seemed imminent. The bishops requested and authorized Chaplain\n C. C. McCabe to raise the money. He was then engrossed in his arduous\n duties as secretary of the Church Extension Society, but without in the\n least diminishing his labors in that office, he inaugurated an effort to\n extinguish the debt. He proposed to Rev. R. N. Baer, D. D., then\n pastor of the church, that if the congregation would raise $15,000 (in ad-\n dition to the $4,000 secured by Dr. Newman on his lecture tour), he\n and Bishop Simpson would assume the balance of the debt. This propo-\n sition was acceded to, and Dr. Baer, assisted by Bishop Andrews, then\n resident bishop, secured the required amount ; while Chaplain McCabe,\n by popular subscriptions, involving an immense amount of personal labor,\n secured the sum of $30,294.27, making in all the sum of $50,294.27, with\n which the bonded debt, with its accrued interest, and the floating debt\n were liquidated ; and on the 27th day of January, 1884, \u2018\u2018 Emancipation\n Day \u201d was celebrated. In the morning Bishop Simpson preached ; text,\n Isaiah 42:4. In the evening Chaplain McCabe preached ; text, Num-\n bers 13:30.\n</p>\n<p>\n This closed the long and disheartening chapter of the burdensome and\n crushing debt which had rested upon the church for fifteen years. It was\n the stone of Sisyphus, which continually rolled back upon the weary\n burden bearers. There were days and years when the possibility of relief\n seemed hopeless. But in all this time the faithful men and women of the\n Metropolitan Church were contributing liberally of their means to all the\n connectional enterprises, the collections of the church during the first nine\n years averaging $20,000.\n</p>\n<p>\n The connectional collections to March, 1894, were as follows : Confer-\n ence claimants, $5,442.45 ; missionary (church), $9,918.73 ; missionary\n (Sunday-school), $10,620.15; Woman\u2019s Foreign Missionary Society, $4,-\n 020.39; Woman\u2019s Home Missionary Society, $1,257 ; Church Extension,\n $1,113.64 ; Tract Society, $98.07 ; American Bible Society, $517.90 ; Sun-\n day-school Union, $222.32 ; Freedman\u2019s Aid and Southern Educational\n Society, $716.69; education, $360; children\u2019s fund, $95 ; total, $34,388.34.\n Totals for years : 1870, $767.29 ; 1880, $754.96 ; 1890, $1,809 ; 1894, $2,592.\n</p>\n<p>\n During the struggle with the debt the church was fortunate in having\n as the president of its board of trustees the Hon. Matthew G. Emery, as\n the treasurer of its funded debt Hon. Thomas L. Tullock (now deceased),\n and as treasurer Mr. Samuel Fowler, men of proven financial ability and\n resources.\n</p>\n<p>\n But while for a period of fifteen years the debt clouded the horizon, the\n history of that period is far from a mere successful struggle with a huge\n debt, however creditable that is conceded to have been ; for during all\n of these years the glorious gospel had been faithfully preached, attend-\n ance upon public service had been large, the membership of the church\n and Sunday-school had increased, and all the work of an evangelical\n church had been done, and well done.\n</p>\n<p>\n When the church was dedicated, it was still incomplete, for it was with-\n out the spire, and also without the iron railing. Mrs. A.

With it\n she presented two bells for churches in India and one in China, so that\n the notes in the chiming of the Metropolitan bells are heard afar in\n heathen lands. In the evening of the same day Dr. and Mrs. Newman\n held a reception in the parlors of the church, among the guests being the\n President and Mrs. Grant and many distinguished public officials.\n</p>\n<p>\n On February 1, 1876, a terrible wind storm visited this locality, and the\n graceful and beautiful spire was badly wrecked. Riggers from the United\n States navy yard scaled the dizzy height s to put it in place, and, under\n the directions of Mr. W. T. Dewdney of the Treasury Department, the\n spire was firmly and securely restored to its original position. Mr. Chas.\n E.

On the 4th of\n July* 1876, the centennial of American independence, there was a nota-\n ble special service held in the church, addresses being delivered by Dr.\n Newman and Senator Wright, of Iowa ; an original poem by L.

Robert N. Baer, D. D., March, 1880.\n The youngest pastor of Metropolitan Church, Dr. Baer was excep-\n tionally gifted ; of large frame and noble bearing ; of womanly modesty\n and manly grace. He preached the gospel here for three years with elo-\n quence and impressiveness. The charm of his deep-toned voice and\n earnest manner is recalled with mournful pleasure, as we remember that\n on September 28, 1888, in the midst of a successful career in Baltimore,\n at the age of 48, he was suddenly called from labor to reward.\n</p>\n<p>\n In 1881 the Chinese school was organized by Harry 0. Hall. Miss\n S. L. Sommers is now in charge of the school.\n</p>\n<p>\n In March, 1883, Rev. E. D. Huntley, D. D., was transferred from the\n Wisconsin Conference and stationed at the Metropolitan Church. His\n pastorate extended over three years. Mrs. Huntley was his most efficient\n helper. The prayer meetings during this period were well attended and\n were always occasions of profit and interest. During his term, in March,\n 1886, the Baltimore Conference held its sessions in the church, Bishop\n Ninde presiding.\n</p>\n<p>\n In March, 1886, Dr. Newman was appointed pastor of the church for\n the third time. There are many changes in a Washington congregation\n in the course of eight years, and he doubtless missed many familiar faces\n and faithful ' friends, but. his remarkable pulpit powers soon filled the\n church with congregations. almost equal to the old-time throngs. The\n Arch geological class was instituted, to the delight of the people, while the\n special discourses of holy week attracted crowded audiences. .In the\n midst of his term the General Conference, in May, 1888, laid its hands\n upon him and called him to a wider field of usefulness by electing him\n one of the bishops of the church. Before leaving the Metropolitan Church,\n Dr. Newman had the church repaired and the main auditorium refrescoed,\n causing the interior of the church to be thoroughly renovated.\n</p>\n<p>\n In the fall of 1888 Rev. G. H. Corey, D. D., of the New York East\n Conference, was transferred to the Baltimore Conference and appointed\n pastor of the Metropolitan Church. For five years this scholarly and\n eloquent minister served this church, and all its interests prospered.\n During his term the Epworth League was organized, November 12, 1889,\n with Wm. S. Washburn as its first president. The league has flourished\n exceedingly; all of its departments of work are being vigorously prosecuted\n by the young people of the church.

Its first superintendent,\n David A. Burr, esq., was consecrated, enthusiastic, and progressive; he\n was the Sunday-school leader in this section. The friend and follower of\n Vincent, he put into operation the instrumentalities and methods of\n modern Sunday-school work, and laid the foundations for the future suc-\n cess of the school. The superintendents who followed him with efficient\n services were John A. Ruff, Andrew B. Duvall, Anderson P. Lacey, Harry\n (). Hall, Thomas G. Ilensey, Percy M. Hughes, and the present success-\n ful superintendent, Thomas H. McKee. The school now numbers 77\n officers and 438 scholars.\n</p>\n<p>\n The ministers whose names are connected with the Metropolitan Church\n have been men of distinction. AVhile serving this church, Drs. Slicer,\n Newman, and Huntley were chaplains of the Senate ; Dr. Eddy was elected\n missionary secretary ; Dr. Newman was elected bishop of the Methodist\n Episcopal Church. Dr. Dellaas was consul to Jerusalem; Dr. Naylor\n was presiding elder of this district. One of our layman, S. S. Henkle, esq.,\n was elected a delegate from the Baltimore Conference to the General Con-\n ference of the Methodist Episcopal Church held in May, 1892.\n</p>\n<p>\n The faithful ones who to-day love this Zion, and whose prayers con-\n tinually ascend for its prosperity while they joyfully labor for the Lord,\n surely have \u201c a goodly heritage.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n The \u201c Roll of the Dead \u201d was delivered by Rev. Plugh Johnston :\n</p>\n<p>\n We are commemorating the twenty-fifth anniversary of this time-\n honored sanctuary, hallowed by ten thousand precious associations and\n fragrant with ten thousand tender memories. In our rejoicings we pay\n the tribute of respect and honor to those whose names will be forever\n associated with the Metropolitan Church and linked with the history of\n Methodism in this city and land. All nations honor their great men, if\n not while living, certainly when death comes, and when the Christian\n dead pass from us, we should record our gratitude for their worth. The\n human forces of the church of God are its living men of zeal and wisdom,\n force and piety, while its treasures are the blessed and holy memories of\n those who have been removed to the church triumphant in Heaven. We\n record these names, not only as a memorial, but as an inspiration, that\n others may emulate their fidelity and follow their example. As autumn\n leaves falling upon the ground enrich the earth beneath, so these church\n members who have fallen leave a golden heritage to those who come after\n them. How touching it is to record the names of many who were pillars\n and ornaments of the church, and how beautiful is the perspective which\n death gives ! Every admirer of natural landscape is aware of the soften-\n ing power of distance. Browning, the poet, speaks of a very common\n thing \u2014 a windmill. Near it, what a roar and tear it makes ; how it grinds\n and bruises ; but \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Seen at a distance ; radiating\n</p>\n<p>\n Its delicate white arms against the sky.\n</p>\n<p>\n So soft and soundless, it is simply beautiful.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thus it is with the character of our vanished friends. Mingling with\n them in the varied intercourses of life, we are aware of their inconsisten-\n cies and defects, their inequalities of temper, their asperities of manner ;\n but viewed in the retrospect, the rough is so softened, the hard so mel-\n lowed, that the failures and imperfections are forgotten, and that which\n is immortal alone survives.\n</p>\n<p>\n I begin with a record of the pastors who have fallen. It is remark-\n able that for one-third of the period of the church\u2019s history this pulpit\n has been occupied by our beloved bishop, and of those who occupied the\n remaining time one-half are dead.\n</p>\n<p>\n Rev. Thomas M. Eddy is embalmed in the imperishable remembrance\n of all who knew him. He was a bright and shining light of the church,\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0056/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 269}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0056/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 539}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0056/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 641, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1079}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0056/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1283, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2159}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0056/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2567, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4318}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0056/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tw/en/ty/fi/ft/ha/nn/iv/00/wa/sh/twentyfifthanniv00wash/twentyfifthanniv00wash_0056.jp2", "height": 4318, "width": 2567, "levels": 6, "size": 690580}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"56\">\n<p>\n and when called suddenly from his untiring labors here to the higher\n service of the church above, as he was breathing his last, he exclaimed,\n \u201c Sing and pray ; eternity dawns ! \u201d We have been linked to him through\n his own mother, who spent the closing days of her beautiful old age in\n this city with her daughter, Mrs. Somers, of Mt. Vernon Seminary. I\n had the privilege of visiting her, and though her sufferings were intense,\n no murmur escaped her lips. On one occasion I sang, \u201c I am Trusting,\n Lord, in Thee ; \u201d with uplifted hands, she said, \u201c That is my experience.\u2019 \u2019\n She was 94 years of age, and just before entering the sleep of death\n she waved her hands in triumph and a look of rapture unutterable came\n into her face. Rev. Otis H. Tiffany was a man of marvelous natural\n gifts, highly cultivated. His sermons were characterized by deep thought,\n practical wisdom, charming variety, graphic power, and great earnestness.\n He was a kingly man, and the tidings of his death in Minneapolis fell\n with a sense of personal bereavement in ten thousand homes and hearts.\n Rev. Robert Baer was so consistent, so exemplary, so humble, so gentle and\n kind, that he was everybody\u2019s friend and nobody\u2019s enemy. The church\n bears testimony to the excellence of his character as a man and to his\n Christian affection as a minister.\n</p>\n<p>\n Coming now to the first trustee board (there are only two members of\n the original number now living, the Hon. Matthew G. Emery and Brother\n Samuel Fowler \u2014 and long may they be spared to us), first is the name\n of the greatest hero in modern military annals, Gen. Ulysses S. Grant.\n His removal from the heart of the nation was like the disappearance of a\n great island from the midst of the sea. His life, embodying all that was\n noble in patriotism and lovely in virtue, reached it? culminating glory,\n not on the field of Appomattox or in the White House as the ruler of\n a reunited nation, but when feeling the cold hands of death clutching\n at his throat, he sat down and wrote the story of his life that those\n whom he loved might be left in comfort ; and then amid the waving pines\n of Mt. McGregor breathed out his life into his Maker\u2019s hands. Samuel\n Norment was one of the charter members of the church and a trustee,\n who gave at least $10,000 to the building fund. Francis A. Lutz was one\n whom everybody loved, generous, and deeply interested in every depart-\n ment of church work. His aged widow lingers with us in feeble health,\n and his children\u2019s children are a benediction to the church. David A.\n Burr was one of the most active of spirits, bright, vigorous, and aggressive.\n He was our first Sunday-school superintendent. His removal to New\n York was a great loss to the church. He also has been promoted to the\n glories of the skies. Dr. Flodoardo Howard was another beautiful,\n sympathetic, Christ-like soul (for forty years the family physician of some\n of you), who seemed to belong to the whole community just as we feel\n that the light of the sun and the beauty and fragrance of the flowers are\n ours. His wife, also a sincere Christian, and a devoted son have been re-\n moved from us by death. And what shall we say of the secretary of\n the board, Thomas Logan Tullock, so long the ornament and pride of our\n officiary? In all the various public positions in which his eminent\n ability placed him he was most efficient and faithful. A Christian great-\n heart, he was devoted to his friends and unswerving in his religious con-\n victions. He was a fine student, with cultivated tastes, and loved the\n service of the Lord. When at Atlantic City his hour of death drew near.\n Though a surprise to his friends, it was no surprise to himself, and he\n said to his wife that he had not left preparations for the other world to so\n late an hour There is one other name belonging to the first board of\n trustees \u2014 the illustrious name of Chief Justice Chase. The service which\n he rendered to his country in the chief counsels of the nation will be\n remembered for generations to come.

Newman, the emblems of the broken body and shed blood of his\n Redeemer. Those were brilliant days of the church when the first\n officers of the nation \u2014 the patriotic President, the incorruptible Grant ;\n Vice-President Colfax, without blemish in public or private life ; the\n Chief Justice of the Supreme Court; the beloved Gen.

Retiring from active work, he came\n to this city in 1872, and from that time until his death was closely allied\n with the church. Like Enoch he walked with God, and like him the\n angel of the Lord carried his beloved suddenly away. He was seated at the\n table about to eat an orange, when without a moment\u2019s warning his spirit\n fled. \u201c God\u2019s finger touched him, and he slept.\u201d He belonged to the\n kingly builders of this nation. His body rests side by side in New England\n with his father, grandfather, an d great grandfather \u2014 four generations. His\n beloved wife, who died not long ago in Chicago, was also of symmetrical\n Christian character. W. C. Atkinson was another good man, who went\n to Heaven in 1888. His widow, beloved by us all, was taken from us less\n than a year ago, and her passing was but the \u201crustling of angels\u2019 wings\u201d\n coming to carry her emancipated spirit to the home of the happy and free.\n John Adams.\n</p>\n<p>\n W. H. Barnes, the son-in-law of Dr. Adams, was an educated and\n graceful writer. Margaret Boyd. Mrs. Georgiana Bird was an excellent\n Christian woman. Mr. and Mrs. Bolton were quiet and retiring mem-\n bers of the church. Mr. Bolton had been wounded in the Army by a\n bullet that passed through his lungs. He was delicate in health, and this\n sum ner, after a brief illness, he entered into rest. C. C. Burr was one\n whose zeal in the cause of Christ was great. He had been a minister in\n his early days, and, coming to the capital, he maintained a consistent\n walk, expressing in his life every Christian quality and embodying in his\n cultured mind and heart every Christian grace. Capt. S. S. Blackford\n was a soldier, who lost his arm in the service of his country. He was fond\n of flowers and all beautiful things. This true patriot and true Christian\n was suddenly removed and went from the streets of our city to walk\n the golden streets of the New Jerusalem. And who can measure the in-\n fluence of that excellent class leader, Seth S. Bryant? A hundred young\n men will tell you of the warm grasp of his hand and the kindliness of his\n welcome. He too was translated, that he should not see death ; for while\n calling at the home of Mr. Tasker, as he was repeating one of Isaac Watts\u2019s\n glorious hymns, \u201che was not, for God took him.\u201d Mrs. Louis Bagger,\n the wife of our consul for Norway, Sw r eden, and Denmark, was also called\n suddenly home.\n</p>\n<p>\n Benjamin F. Cutter, the father of our gifted and consecrated Mrs.\n Roach, was a constant and regular worshiper here. Dr. E. L. Corbin was\n a faithful officer in his country\u2019s service and faithful in the church.\n Samuel Cram. Henry Cross. Bellie Crist. Delbert M. Covey. Mr. and\n Mrs. Robert Cohen. Mrs. E. Carter. Dr. Samuel Crew. Mrs. T. E.\n Clark, an estimable ladv. Col. D. C. Cox, a trustee of the church, whose\n brilliant parts became ' a snare to him. Gov.

You can not find a person in\n this city, not even a child, who presented a needy cause that was ever\n turned away unaided. \u201c Mark the perfect man and behold the upright,\n for the end of that man is peace.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Israel Dishl was an enthusiastic evangelist, who died shouting \u201c Glory.\u201d\n Mary Drum ceased to breathe in May, 1883. John DeFord was an active\n worker, who took an abiding interest in young men. Mrs. L. E. Deane\n was a gifted writer, deeply spiritual, tenderly attached to the church, and\n was wont to say that she loved every brick in it. Mrs. Eliza B. Duvall\n has but recently passed from us. Early left a widow, she raised her four sons\n and two daughters to be as polished stones in the temple of the Lord. Her\n death was a translation. Its sudden coming was only the Father\u2019s foot-\n fall to escort His weary child home in the twilight of a long beautiful, busy\n day. We congratulate the children and grandchildren on having had\n such a mother \u2014 a mother who was one of the highest products of modern\n Methodism.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. Kate Eastlack, active in Christian and temperance work, passed\n away in 1879. Samuel Emery, the brother of Matthew G. Emery, was\n a liberal supporter of the church, thoroughly reliable, dowered with the\n strength of the New England hills, upright and downright. \u201c An honest\n man is the noblest work of God.\u201d Mrs. Gen. Eaton, graceful and devout in\n her old age as she was beautiful in her youth, when, under Gen. Jackson\u2019s\n a Iministration, she set society agog by her marriage with the Secretary of\n War, died in 1879. Samuel R. Evans and Rev. W. V. Evans, full of zeal\n and divine fire, fervent in spirit, and mighty in prayer.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. A. O. Fullerton has left behind her a beautiful memory. Her hus-\n band died only recently while running as a candidate for the House of\n Representatives.\n</p>\n<p>\n A. E. Gould. Dr. J. J. Given. Mrs. Amelie M. Green. Mr. and Mrs.\n H. L. Gobriglit. Mr. Gobright was long at the head of the Associated\n Press, using his pen to advance the interests of our Zion. Thomas K.\n Gray, an efficient and beloved class leader, for forty years a Sunday-\n school superintendent, loyal to all the traditions of Methodism, and his\n estimable wife \u2014 the father and mother of our alto singer.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. S. L. Hall was the sister of Mr. William Jackson, active in all our\n church enterprises, warm-hearted, and liberal. Mrs. Katherine E.

John Hall, the Arctic explorer, who died amid the\n hardships and privations of the frozen seas, was a devout worshiper in our\n sanctuary. Mrs. Pliillissa Harrover was an elegant lady, of fine presence,\n refined manners, and a gifted nature which grace had sanctified. Her\n husband was a substantial friend of the church, transparent as plate\n glass, with nothing counterfeit about him, a sincerity that looked out of his\n noble face and was impressed upon his every act. I visited him dur-\n ing his last illness. He was humble as a child, and placed all his hopes of\n salvation upon his Redeemer and Lord.\n</p>\n<p>\n Miss Lizzie Jackson and Mary E.

Mrs. Nancy Knight, Annie\n Kingsbury, and Mr. and Mrs. James Keene were faithful to their trust.\n</p>\n<p>\n Thomas H. Lazenby passed away in 1883. Charles H. Lane was a\n trustee, and for a time had charge of the Strangers\u2019 Class, now led by\n Brother Tallmadge. He was affable, genial, a sweet singer, and gifted in\n prayer. For forty years he was known and loved among the Christian\n people of this city. Mrs. Nellie H. Lutz was a devoted wife and mother,\n an ornament to society, the joy of the church, and the light of the home.\n She has been removed from the earth to that circle of glory of which the\n Lord God and the Lamb are the eternal center. And now we reach\n another illustrious name, the idol of the nation, the incomparable soldier,\n the greatest volunteer general of the republic, the foremost statesman of\n the mighty west, the incorruptible and honorable senator, the unselfish,\n high-spirited, chivalrous, and magnanimous John Alexander Logan.\n .When his early home was broken up and he started out in life, all that\n he asked for and all that he received was the old family Bible, flow he\n prized that book and read the Word with daily care ! The last time he\n was in this, his church home, he knelt humbly at the communion to re-\n ceive the emblems of the Saviour\u2019s love, and on the Sabbath of December\n 26, 1886, while his pastor, our beloved bishop, was lifting up his voice in\n prayer at his bedside, he was summoned into the presence of the King\n and entered upon the service of the eternal Sabbath of the skies.\n</p>\n<p>\n Samuel B. Mav, J. LI. Mandeville, J. C. McKelden, Col. A. B. Meacham,\n D. B. Mack, and Annie B. Milans are gone from us. IL. D. McConnell\n was an exhorter and zealous Sunday-school teacher. Robert Moore was\n so blameless in life that a gentleman closely associated with him for sixteen\n years in the War Department says that he never heard from him an unkind\n or impure word. Robert and Mrs. Moore both died in the home of their\n son-in-law and daughter, Mr. and Mrs. A. P. Lacey. They introduced\n Methodism into the Mohawk Valley. He was a saintly spirit, and so de-\n voted to the Master that when his daughter, Mrs. Dr. Sites, a young bride,\n was leaving for her missionary field, he said, \u201c I\u2019d rather my child would\n go a missionary to China than as a wife of the minister plenipotentiary to\n any kingdom on earth.\u201d He escaped to the mountain of God in 1884.\n His aged companion survived him ten years, a woman of fine mind, with\n literary tastes, and versed in church history and biography. She often\n surprised me with her historical references, her philosophic observations,\n and the recital of exquisite poems.

He had been to the service of the sanctuary on the day\n that he was called to \u201c the house not made with hands, eternal in the\n heavens \u201d Thomas P.irsell was one of our quiet, generous, unobtrusive\n Christians, a typical Methodist of the old and best school.

Ruff, was our second Sunday-school superintend-\n ent. He was a gifted man, always heard with pleasure in the prayer\n meeting. As he prospered in business, the more his soul prospered and the\n more he gave. He seemed to hold communion with the invisible, and he\n saw the heavenly forms and angel faces of the departed and heard their\n well-known voices chanting high praises before the throne.\n</p>\n<p>\n Christiana Seiler and Nellie Sheidy were two Sunday-school scholars\n who died happy Christian deaths. David Sinsabaugh was a Sunday-school\n teacher, and died in the faith ; and Louis W. Sinsabaugh, his brother,\n passed suddenly from us as the result of a delicate and difficult operation.\n Waddington Summers was also taken away unexpectedly by hemorrhage\n of the lungs. Mrs. Sallie Smith, a sweet singer and a member of the early\n choir. Judge AV. B. Snell was a gentleman of great ability, quiet, digni-\n fied, and deeply spiritual. John W. Shiles, another honored member, was\n kindly in charity and of piety towards God. His son is taking up his work\n and following in his father\u2019s steps. Senator Leland Stanford possessed\n sterling qualities of mind and heart, purity of life, and faith in God. He\n was a genuine philanthropist, and loved his fellows and his God. In my\n last interview with him, when he spoke of his failing health, I ventured to\n inquire as to his soul\u2019s health, and his answer was, \u201c I have peace with\n God, and have come to look upon it as the supreme moment of existence\n when the soul is called into the presence of its Maker.\u201d Suddenly the\n rapture came, and his soul was kissed away to the beatific vision.\n</p>\n<p>\n Clara Thompson. Mrs. Cecil Trembly, an earnest Christian worker,\n whose husband was the correspondent of the New York Times. Miss\n Belle Twombly was a lovely girl, the assistant teacher in the infant-class\n department, who ripened quickly into celestial beauty. No church ever\n mourned the loss of a child-saint, scarcely out of her teens, as did this\n church over Miss Twombly. Her beaming face, her soul-lit eyes, her\n radiant manner, her whole being, instinct with the divine, touched a\u2019l the\n higher chords within, and no one can compute the value or measure the\n influence of that young life now dwelling in heights where the seraphim\n soar. John C. Tasker is another whose works fill the church with fra-\n grance as did the costly spikenard of Mary in the house at Bethany. He\n held the offices of steward, class leader, trustee, and treasurer, and was\n competent, conscientious, and faithful in all. His will was iron, his pur-\n pose was rooted like the oak, while his heart had a mother\u2019s tenderness.\n There was a beautiful balance of opposite qualities, a combination of the\n inflexible and the tender, yet all the sterner elements of his nature were\n mellowed by the atmosphere of the cross.

He passed suddenly from earthly joys to \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n That river in the skies.\n</p>\n<p>\n Whose banks are with immortal verdure clad,\n</p>\n<p>\n Whose streams make all Jehovah\u2019s City glad.\n</p>\n<p>\n Of Annie Zoder is the record : AVent to Heaven in 1877.\n</p>\n<p>\n These are but a few of the company to whom the heavens have opened\n over this national church through the last quarter of a century. They\n have gone to the general assembly of the church of the first born, which\n is written in Heaven. It is with us as at the soldiers\u2019 cemetery out yon-\n der on the wooded heights of the Potomac. AVe read the names of\n thousands of fallen soldiers on the head-stones, but there is a great mon-\n ument fo the unknown heroes who died for their country. Their names\n were not recorded, but they were not forgotten. So, belonging to this\n church are many departed worthies whose names we have not been able\n to record. But they are written in Heaven, and are among the great cloud\n of the glorified. Death is a wonderful camera obscura. It projects the\n images of the departed in colors tender and beautiful like a golden atmos-\n phere mellowed and enriched by the light of the setting sun. And how\n precious is the memory of the just and the good. They leave behind\n them a train of light and blessedness.\n</p>\n<p>\n Were a star quenched on high,\n</p>\n<p>\n For ages would its light,\n</p>\n<p>\n Still traveling downward from the sky,\n</p>\n<p>\n Shine on our mortal sight.\n</p>\n<p>\n So when a good man dies,\n</p>\n<p>\n For years beyond our ken,\n</p>\n<p>\n The light he leaves beyond him lies\n Upon the paths of men.\n</p>\n<p>\n How this church has been bereaved ! AVhat standard-bearers have\n fallen ! As we think of them, we are ready to take up Elisha\u2019s cry, \u201cMy\n father, my father, the chariot of Israel, and the horsemen thereof.\u201d\n There is so much to be done and the workers are so few. But the church\n must still have the highest place in our affections. It must still goon,\n starting waves of influence that shall roll over the whole land. When\n President Lincoln was assassinated, it was Garfield who gave utterance to\n the sentiment, \u201cThe President is dead, but, thank God, the Government\n at AVashington still lives.\u201d So, though many workers have fallen, thank\n God, the Metropolitan Church still lives. The church is permanent in its\n organization and wasting continually is yet continually renewed. The\n burdens and responsibilities w r hich others bore so nobly and discharged\n with such fidelity have fallen upon our shoulders.

Some\n human existences encircle breadth and length, heights and depths, while\n other lives have only epochs in their history. Every Christian individ-\n uality must transmit some perfume, when the alabaster box is broken, that\n will emit its sweetness to render other characters more Christ like. There\n is a fragrance in the memory of the one I am to remind you of this even-\n ing, who worshiped with you in this temple for a brief period, whose\n name is enrolled on your record, but is now transcribed in the Lamb\u2019s\n Book of Life. Mrs. Katherine Lamont Hurst was suddenly translated\n from the church militant to the church triumphant, \u201cto the house not\n made with hands, eternal in the heavens,\u201d while yet the sun-dial of her\n earth life was in its midday splendor. The Heavenly Father, too wise to\n err and too good to be unkind, must have known her life work was com-\n plete and claimed her in all the beauty of her womanhood to higher serv-\n ice. She was with me in college in the sunny days of youth, only a few\n years my junior. I seem to see her now through the vista of years, as\n beautiful as an angel \u2014 her classic features a model for an artist, a pro-\n fusion of dark hair hanging in rippling curls over her graceful shoulders,\n her eyes radiant with love almost divine, her complexion transparently\n white, with a pale tint of pink which seldom came to the surface except\n in the exuberance of joy or special delight. Mature womanhood de-\n veloped rare accomplishments and refined dignity. She was a natural\n linguist and translated fluently the German, writing several sets of his-\n tories of royal personages while Hr. Hurst (now bishop) was president of\n the theological school at Fran kfort-on-the- Main. Her lot fell on the same\n lines as my own \u2014 the wife of an itinerant. Thus, when we met, we always\n exchanged notes. Gracefully, yet somewhat timidty, she adorned every\n avenue in which she was placed, as a devoted, consistant Christian. Only\n a little while before she came to reside in Washington, she visited me in\n our parsonage home, only a few steps from this church, as she said, to\n talk over our school days, and in particular to remind me of the happiest\n event in her life, when I led her to the altar in a season of revival at the\n college, where she found Christ as her Saviour. It came to me like new\n revelation, as we clasped hands in a renewed consecration. It was an in-\n spiration to a higher, better life. It will follow me until we meet at the\n throne of God to cast our crowns at Jesus\u2019 feet, amid the innumerable\n company of angels and the first-born in Heaven. Her attendance at this\n church must have been a benediction.\n</p>\n<p>\n It was a privilege far beyond the common walks of life, quite on the\n verge of Heaven, to be with Mrs. Benjamin Charlton as her redeemed\n spirit passed through the golden gateway into the Celestial City. Surely\n it was not death ; it was translation. She was sitting calmly ' beneath a\n white tent amid the native forest trees at Washington Grove camp meet-\n ing, whither she had come to worship with the people of God, when the\n angels whispered, \u201cThe Master has come and calleth for thee.\u201d She had\n walked the earth in white, ready to depart at a moment\u2019s call, expecting\n the heart would suddenly cease to pulsate, and to cease at once to work\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0065/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 269}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0065/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 539}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0065/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 641, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1079}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0065/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1283, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2159}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0065/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2567, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4318}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0065/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tw/en/ty/fi/ft/ha/nn/iv/00/wa/sh/twentyfifthanniv00wash/twentyfifthanniv00wash_0065.jp2", "height": 4318, "width": 2567, "levels": 6, "size": 619225}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"65\">\n<p>\n 41\n</p>\n<p>\n and live with Christ was not a surprise.

She lived until within the fourth year of the tenth decade of a\n century \u2014 ninety-four illustrious years, which rounded out into complete\n symmetrical cycles full of good works and alms deeds, which were be-\n stowed with an open hand. Scores and hundreds must for years to come\n continue to rise up and call her blessed, having her name in grateful re-\n membrance. This truly wonderful woman from childhood until fair\n maidenhood maintained an unblemished character. Her graces increased\n in genuine sterling worth into fully developed womanhood. She was al-\n ways loved and admired by a large circle of relatives and a host of friends\n in and out of the church, who delighted to pay homage to her as if she were\n a queen. Indeed, she was every whit a queenly woman, and did we canonize\n in our church, we would certainly call her St. Elizabeth, of the Metro-\n politan M. E. Church. In early life she gave her heartfelt affections\n to Christ, whom she loved and served with devout fervor and holy zeal\n all the days of a long life. She often spoke laughingly of her many lovers ,\n but, firm in a choice all her own, remained unmarried. She was truly\n wedded to the hallowed interests of the church she loved so much, and\n particularly to \u201cthe dear Metropolitan,\u201d as she always called this church.\n Hers was among the first names enrolled on its records. Always young,\n never seeming to have a thought of growing old even at the \" age of\n over 90 years, she evinced great vivacity, which overflowed in love and\n affection until it blended in an eternal springtime. Oh, I am very happy,\n dear friends, who are here this evening in this church, in the thought that\n ere long I shall clasp glad hands with dear \u201cAunt Lizzie \u201d and the goodly\n company gone before on the \u201cever-shining shore.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Miss Mary Ellen Jackson, niece of Miss Elizabeth Jackson, who was\n with her aunt until she passed into the life immortal, we thought would\n take her place in the family and in the church.

But now they are in holier fellow-\n ship \u201cin Heaven above, where all is love.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n Allow me to add a brief tribute to the King\u2019s Daughters. It was my\n privilege to organize in this church a complete circle of one hundred, or\n ten \u201ctens.\u201d The half of this circle was from what our dear Miss Cor-\n nelia called \u201cher jewels\u201d \u2014 those who were or had been in her depart-\n ment.

More than a quarter of a century ago I had the pleasure\n of listening to the exercises on the memorable occasion of the dedication of\n this temple. Bishop Simpson\u2019s sermon is never to be forgotten, the\n sublimity of which rests like a halo over his memory. There have been\n few audiences of men of greater minds or more potent influences than\n once assembled here. But, alas ! with the receding years, how many of\n them have been borne to that land from which none have ever returned,\n His Eminence Bishop Simpson among the number.\n</p>\n<p>\n Beneath this vaulted roof have been gathered votaries from every\n quarter of the globe, as well as from every State and Territory of the\n Union. The assembly under the dome of our proud capitol is not more\n cosmopolitan than the congregations who have worshiped in this church;\n and what a blessing it has been, in that it has made a home for sojourners\n within the gates of the city. The name Metropolitan w T as fitly bestowed,\n because, while not the oldest, it has been the mother church for Method-\n ists under the new era for Methodism at the nation\u2019s capital.\n</p>\n<p>\n In his mighty sermon Bishop Simpson prophesied wiser than he knew\n of the future of Metropolitan Church and the city of Washington. He\n was called to a higher church and a greater city, but we who have lingered\n on have witnessed the fulfillment of his prophecy. No w T ork watered by\n his tears and upheld by his prayers and those of the disciples who have\n followed him, who have been sustained by the Omnipotent Hand, could\n fail.\n</p>\n<p>\n After the dedication the church was consigned to the keeping of Dr. J.\n P. Newman, in the selection of whom there was a direct intervention of\n Divine Providence. His inspiration, spiritual power, eloquence, far-\n reaching research, masterly ability, robust physical strength, keen in-\n sight, scholarly manner, patriotic loyalty to God and country brought to\n this sanctuary multitudes, till there was not room to contain them.\n Chancel, gallery, pew, and aisle were packed at every morning service,\n lecture, prayer and praise meeting. Every service was thronged, and for\n years it seemed that the planting in this vineyard was the beginning of\n the millennium. In the dual capacity of chaplain of the Senate and pastor\n of the Metropolitan Church, he satisfied each body by ministering to the\n spiritual needs of each without any attempt to unite church and State, his\n creed being antagonistic to such a union.\n</p>\n<p>\n Heroes, statesmen, celebrities of every nation, men and women of dis-\n tinction waited upon every sermon and dwelt upon it when it was over.\n Communicants and noncommunicants were glad to hear the Word as Dr.\n Newman preached it. Believers in every dogma listened with delight to\n his exponency of the law and the gospel. To name the throng would re-\n quire much more time than I would dare to consume, but a few of them\n were such central figures in the world\u2019s galaxy of great men and women\n that I can not refrain from naming them .\n</p>\n<p>\n Conspicuous among them was that majestic man who sat so long on the\n left of the east aisle near the front pew, and whose bowed head in the hour\n of prayer would scarcely suggest to the stranger the masterful Chief Justice\n of the Supreme Court, Salmon P.

Dr. Eddy on account of his election as missionary secretary and\n the untimely death of many of the most prominent attendants, we experi-\n enced for a few years much apathy in the church. But the return of Dr.\n Newman to the charge, twice repeated, revived the latent energies and\n interest of the membership, and has brought us to our twenty-fifth anni-\n versary in the enjoyment of prosperity and goodly numbers. Of those\n who still remain of the phalanx, who have braved every danger threaten-\n ing the church, and who have never been found wanting, delicacy forbids\n me to speak.\n</p>\n<p>\n The present pastor has reason to rely upon the efforts and devotion of\n this loyal congregation, who hold him in high esteem and tender regard.\n His righteousness, ability, and enthusiasm in his Master\u2019s work have\n awakened much of the old-time activity in the congregation, and he will\n doubtless have many souls for his hire.\n</p>\n<p>\n The spectral legions who beckon us on include the mightiest and the\n humblest, the wisest and the best, and may we be permitted to join that\n throng when we are done with time and things.\n</p>\n<p>\n The remarks of Mrs. T.

It has also in its charge the\n care and furnishing of the parsonage. Its best efforts have been put\n forth to render the pastor\u2019s family comfortable and their home attractive.\n</p>\n<p>\n The work began with the first pastorate of Dr. Newman. The ladies\n came together, as Mrs. Newman expressed a wish to have them. She was\n a most indefatigable worker, and inspired her associates with her zealous\n spirit. We were most successful in raising money for assisting in pay-\n ing the expenses of the church and Sunday-school, as well as the dreaded\n interest on the church debt. The social interests of the church have also\n been promoted.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have always been a working society, and many times we have been\n wearied almost beyond endurance. I recall one occasion in 1876, when\n the Baltimore Conference held its session in this church, Bishop Bowman\n presiding. A reception was given to the bishop, the conference, and\n friends. We had a large attendance. In those days we were lavish with\n our refreshments, and it was late when the guests left. Then we were\n told, with the sublime confidence of man, that the bishop would want the\n little class room (which he used for his office) at the usual hour in the\n morning, and that the conference would expect to resume its session at\n the regular hour. I did not sleep much that night. Early the next morn-\n ing I hurried to the church, wondering if I could obtain entrance. I\n found Mrs. Newman had been there, before daylight I believe, washing\n dishes, assorting spoons, forks, knives, and china, until there was a hope\n at least that we would have the church in readiness for our brethren \u2014\n and we did.\n</p>\n<p>\n We were made an organized society by Dr. Eddy, his wife serving a\n short time as president. Mrs. Tullock, Mrs. Baer, Mrs. Huntley, Mrs.\n Tasker, and Mrs. LaFetra have served as president, all doing excellent\n work. The wheels of time have rolled around, and I am again serving.\n</p>\n<p>\n We have placed to the various uses of the church several thousand\n dollars. Our roll in the church triumphant is a large and honored one.\n AYe are encouraged by the fact that our young people are showing a will-\n ingness to share in our efforts, and I desire to thank Bishop Newman for\n his words of advice and encouragement to the young this afternoon.\n</p>\n<p>\n My committee has assisted in visiting the poor, the sick, and in seeking\n out those who come to us strangers. AYe are working for the Master, and\n seek His favor in all that we do.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. J. C. Tasker said :\n</p>\n<p>\n I come here to-night, bringing only a little testimony for the Master,\n who has done so much for me since I became a member of this church.\n I was not present on that Easter morning when the organization took\n place, but, my husband being here, he came home and informed me that he\n had presented our names to become members of the new Metropolitan\n Church. I felt a little sorry at first, for I had learned to love \u201c AA 7 esley \u201d\n as my church home ; but it was all right, and the week following we came\n together to attend the first prayer meeting. It was held in the church\n parlors. The room was filled with our people, and some of the testimonies\n given are very fresh in my mind to-night. There seemed to be a burden\n of soul desire to become better men and women in the service of Christ,\n and of the need of a new consecration in commencing the work of the Lord\n here. Then the classes were formed. The one assigned to meet in the\n little southwest class room became particularly dear to me. Perhaps it\n was because it was placed under the leadership of one I loved \u2014 one whom\n I knew to be a man of God, whose supreme desire w r as to be a faithful\n servant of Christ and of His church. For many years he was found every\n Monday night in that little room, trying to help in their Christian life ail\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0069/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 160, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 269}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0069/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 320, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 539}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0069/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 641, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1079}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0069/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1283, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2159}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0069/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2567, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4318}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:tw:en:ty:fi:ft:ha:nn:iv:00:wa:sh:twentyfifthanniv00wash:twentyfifthanniv00wash_0069/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/tw/en/ty/fi/ft/ha/nn/iv/00/wa/sh/twentyfifthanniv00wash/twentyfifthanniv00wash_0069.jp2", "height": 4318, "width": 2567, "levels": 6, "size": 552039}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"69\">\n<p>\n p\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n</p>\n<p>\n Bishop John F.

Four consecrated women, whose names have\n been read by our pastor, have gone out from our ranks to teach and preach\n the gospel. The last one to leave us was our own dear Ruth Marie Sites.\n There have been many honored names on our rolls, prominent among\n which is the family of the devoted Rev. Dr. Sites, of Foo Chow, China,\n and their presence among us is always an inspiration and a blessing. We\n believe this anniversary will awaken new interest and create new life\n among us. We appeal to all in this audience who are not already mem-\n bers to unite with us in this good work. We ask 2 cents a week and a\n prayer for the salvation of the world through the Woman\u2019s Foreign and\n other kindred missionary societies.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mrs. W. G.

All are welcome.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n A meeting of this character is peculiar to Metropolitan Church, and was\n no doubt suggested in view of the fact that so many Methodists through-\n out the country had contributed towards its erection, many of whom were\n expected to subsequently visit the capital and worship where they had a\n right to feel at home. C. C. Burr was the first leader. The next was\n Charles II . Lane, who held the position for a short time. They were\n succeeded by Rev. Wm. M. Ferguson, of the Central New York Confer-\n ence, who has been a member of the quarterly conference of this church\n since it organization, and who served as leader of the Strangers\u2019 Class\n until my appointment at the commencement of the conference year 1883.\n</p>\n<p>\n Most of the ministers of the M. E. Church, superannuated or relieved\n from active work in their various conferences, who have made Washing-\n ton their residence, connect themselves with the quarterly conference of\n this church, and have contributed greatly by their attendance in making\n the Strangers\u2019 Class interesting. Among those who attended the clas s\n regularly while worshiping here were Rev. Charles Adams, Rev. Samuel\n Kramer, and Rev. J. E. Parker, all of whom have gone to their reward.\n Rev. William M. Ferguson, who has been a helpless invalid the past four-\n teen months, continued to manifest an intense interest in the class even\n after he ceased to be a leader. Frequently the visitors inquire, with the\n greatest regard, for these ministerial brethren, of whom they have such\n pleasant recollections connected with a former visit. Rev. Stephen Brown,\n of the Genessee Conference, and Rev. Levi H. York, of the Oneida Con-\n ference, are still helpers, as they have been for years past.\n</p>\n<p>\n Our own church members also take great interest in the class, about 60\n being enrolled therein, many good singers among them, so that every\n meeting has a fair representation of the church, all of whom make the\n visitors welcome. Hence this feature of the church has performed its\n peculiar work, and has become noted among the Methodists at a distance,\n who often repeat their visits, always declaring it gives them a homelike\n feeling. Very often there are visitors from some other denomination, who,\n in a spirit of religious investigation, attend a class meeting for the first\n time and embrace the opportunity of observing how our class meet-\n ings are conducted.

It is\n due to that fact that I have been honored with an invitation to say a word\n on this interesting occasion. It was during the dark days of the Civil\n War when Dr. Newman was sent by the bishops of the church, with the\n approval and sanction of the War Department, to New Orleans to re-\n establish the Methodist Episcopal Church in the South. During the first\n year of his ministry, thousands, attracted by his eloquent preaching,\n gathered each Sunday to hear him. Officers of the army and citizens\n from every State in the Union, attracted to that city during the last years\n of the war, were in his congregation. The return of peace and the dis-\n bandment of the army and the return to the North of those composing\n the greater part of the congregation made the task of reorganization most\n difficult. Notwithstanding the clouds which gathered during the dark\n days of reconstruction, the doctor built a large church and gathered into\n it there, as he did in this church, a congregation that was greatly attached\n to him. I very vividly recall how the members of that congregation felt\n when Bishop Simpson ' announced that Dr. Newman was to go to Wash-\n ington to organize the Metropolitan Church. The times were exciting ;\n political revolutions had several times caused bloodshed in the city ; there\n was prejudice against the \u201c northern \u201d church.

It was at the time, you know, when Shy lock\n was demanding his pound of flesh, yet in my ministry of more than thirty\n years I have never seen steadier faith nor calmer fortitude evinced by\n Christian men and women.
