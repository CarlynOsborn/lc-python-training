While they\n diligently pursued the means which labor and\n skill could furnish for the accomplishment of\n their lawful undertakings, they felt their best\n efforts to be vain unless aided and sanctioned\n by the divine favor. They were accordingly\n ever ready to give thanks and praise to their\n Heavenly Father for all their enjoyments. The\n productions of the earth were among the richest\n of their temporary blessings, and when these\n had been harvested and a sufficient supply for\n the ensuing year was found to have been ga\u00ac\n thered and secured, a peculiar occasion seemed\n to be furnished for the manifestation of grati\u00ac\n tude to Plim whose mercies had rendered the\n season propitious and crowned the labors of the\n husbandman with success. Hence the early\n custom of setting apart a day towards the close\n of each year for a public religious festival of\n Thanksgiving and Praise.
