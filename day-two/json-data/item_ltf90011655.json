seeking redress for alleged injuries to them. The action\n complained of, while judicially relieving Dr. Talmage of a\n grave accusation, has not harmfully touched a hair of their\n heads. If not in accordance with their judgment, this is no\n more than always happens when the views of a majority\n prevail over those of a minority. To he out-voted is cer-\n tainly no grievance. Dr. Talmage is the only party that\n could have been aggrieved by the action of the Presbytery ;\n and, being acquitted, he has had no occasion either to\n complain or appeal.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Book of Discipline, chapter VIII., section 4, contains\n the fundamental law of the Presbyterian Church in respect\n to complaints, and, among other things, declares that a\n complaint, the proper preliminaries having been supplied?\n \u201c brings the whole proceedings in the case under the review\n of the superior judicatory.\u201d It further declares that \u201c if the\n complaint appears to be well founded, it may have the effect,\n not only of drawing down censure upon those who concurred\n in the judgment complained of, but also of reversing that\n judgment and placing matters in the same situation in which\n they were before the judgment was pronounced.\u201d These\n provisions define the jurisdiction of the Synod in respect to\n this complaint. There is a general cognizance of \u201cthe\n whole proceedings in the case\u201d of Dr. Talmage from their\n initial point to their final consummation.

The first reason assigned by them is in\n the following words : \u201c Because during the process of the\n trial the Presbytery allowed the presence of an audience\n who manifested their sympathy for the accused by applause,\n laughter and hisses, accompanied in several instances by\n personal indignities towards members of the Court, whereby,\n as we believe, the judgment of the Court was unduly biased\n and its dignity and authority brought into contempt.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n To this the Presbytery answer : 1. That during the tak-\n ing of the testimony the sessions of the Presbytery were\n open to the public ; that there is no law of the Book of Dis-\n cipline or of established usage against open sessions in a\n judicial trial ; that it is the province of every ecclesiastical\n court to settle this question according to its own discretion,\n and hence that no superior judicatory has the right to\n review its decision on this point.\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. That while there were occasional manifestations on\n the part of the audience, they were promptly rebuked by\n the Moderator and always discountenanced by the Presby-\n tery, and that the effect was to decrease such manifestations,\n and finally to suppress them altogether, and that there was\n evidently at no time any intended contempt for \u201cthe\n dignity and authority \u201d of the Court, and no desire to disturb\n the order of its proceedings.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. That the statement of the complainants that \u201c the\n judgment of the Court was unduly biased\u201d by the presence\n of an audience and by the manifestations made, is without\n the slightest evidence to support it.

That this accusation against Mr. Hathaway, to which\n Dr. Yan Dyke testified as having been made to him in the\n latter part of November, 1876, was the subject of a series of\n interviews between Dr. Talmage and Mr. Hathaway in the\n early part of January, 1877, which resulted in a satisfactory\n settlement of the whole difficulty, and the resumption of\n pleasant fraternal relations, and that Mr. Hathaway, having\n accepted this settlement as final and complete, never made\n any complaint to the Presbytery, and never sought any in-\n vestigation or redress in respect to the matter involved in\n the fourth specification.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. That the \u201cproceeding\u201d to which the complainants re-\n fer, and which they designate as u a mutual agreement \u201d or\n \u201cso-called covenant,\u201d consists in the preparation of two\n letters addressed to the Moderator of the Presbytery \u2014 one\n by Dr. Talmage and the other by Mr. Hathaway \u2014 written\n after the latter had testified for the prosecution and been\n discharged as a witness, expressing the regret of each that\n the matter which had been settled between them two years\n previously should be revived in the form of specification\n four, and in view of this settlement declaring that, in re-\n spect to this matter, neither would undertake to vindicate\n his character at the expense of the other, which letters the\n Moderator announced to the Presbytery, and then re-\n quested each of these gentlemen to read his own letter in\n its hearing.\n</p>\n<p>\n 4.

He so testified, and I take it\n that no one will here charge him with perjury. He certain-\n ly did not begin the day with the plans and purposes of a\n deceiver, or in a mood of mind favorable to such plans. But\n he did begin it as a Christian. I cannot think that even\n his most malignant enemy will construe this prayer into a\n hypocritical farce. He then had no idea that the fact\n would ever be known, or that he would ever have occasion\n to state it as a witness. It was then a matter between\n himself and his God.

These antecedents in the his-\n tory of Mr. Hallock, who, when on the witness stand, ap-\n peared as a very voluble, loose, and hap-hazard talker,\n explain why Dr. Talmage, as he swears, came to the con-\n clusion that he probably would not buy the paper at all.\n He had become accustomed to Mr. Hallock\u2019s talks on this\n</p>\n</page>\n"}], [{"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ta:lm:ag:ec:as:ec:om:pl:00:sp:ea:talmagecasecompl00spea:talmagecasecompl00spea_0025/full/pct:6.25/0/default.jpg", "width": 152, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 264}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ta:lm:ag:ec:as:ec:om:pl:00:sp:ea:talmagecasecompl00spea:talmagecasecompl00spea_0025/full/pct:12.5/0/default.jpg", "width": 304, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 529}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ta:lm:ag:ec:as:ec:om:pl:00:sp:ea:talmagecasecompl00spea:talmagecasecompl00spea_0025/full/pct:25/0/default.jpg", "width": 608, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 1059}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ta:lm:ag:ec:as:ec:om:pl:00:sp:ea:talmagecasecompl00spea:talmagecasecompl00spea_0025/full/pct:50/0/default.jpg", "width": 1217, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 2118}, {"url": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ta:lm:ag:ec:as:ec:om:pl:00:sp:ea:talmagecasecompl00spea:talmagecasecompl00spea_0025/full/pct:100/0/default.jpg", "width": 2435, "levels": 1, "mimetype": "image/jpeg", "height": 4236}, {"mimetype": "image/jp2", "info": "http://tile.loc.gov/image-services/iiif/service:gdc:dcmsiabooks:ta:lm:ag:ec:as:ec:om:pl:00:sp:ea:talmagecasecompl00spea:talmagecasecompl00spea_0025/info.json", "url": "http://cdn.loc.gov/service/gdc/dcmsiabooks/ta/lm/ag/ec/as/ec/om/pl/00/sp/ea/talmagecasecompl00spea/talmagecasecompl00spea_0025.jp2", "height": 4236, "width": 2435, "levels": 6, "size": 540294}, {"mimetype": "text/xml", "use": "text", "fulltext": "<page pagenum=\"25\">\n<p>\n 21\n</p>\n<p>\n subject, without any actual purchase ; and if he did not at\n the Astor House interview, either from what Mr. Hallock\n said, or from the memorandum, get the impression that the\n paper had been purchased by Mr. Hallock, the fact, in the\n circumstances, would not be at all surprising.

The sixth scene of the day is one in which Dr. Tal-\n mage and Mr. Shelly were the parties directly concerned.\n Mr. Shelly was a member of the Tabernacle Church, and\n his place of business in New York was but two or three\n blocks from the office of the Christian at W ork.

He could not then foresee that this\n scene would be of any future consequence to him, and that\n Mr. Shelly would serve him as a witness. He then had no\n idea that the sceue would be brought out in any future\n trial on the charge of falsehood and deceit. He was not\n then preparing evidence for such an emergency. He acted\n as he felt, and spoke as he thought, iu the presence of a\n friend whom he trusted. This brief interview with Mr.\n Shelly speaks volumes as to his state of mind, since it\n clearly shows that, after being informed about the sale of\n the paper as he testified, he supposed himself to be the vie-\n tim of a sharp and dishonorable game.

The seventh scene, lying very near the one just\n described, occurs between Dr. Talmage and General How-\n ard. Bear in mind that the former had been in negotiation\n with the latter for some time, and that on the 4th of Octo-\n ber, which was Wednesday of the previous week, the nego-\n tiation, though not complete, was, nevertheless, so far ad-\n vanced and so likely to end in a fixed agreement, that Dr.\n Talmage, on the 5th of October, which was Thursday,\n addressed a letter to Mr. Remington, giving him thirty\n days\u2019 notice of his intention to retire from the Christian at\n Work in one month from that date, expecting to go to the\n Advance at the termination of this period. The informa-\n tion, however, which he received on the following Monday\n about the sale of the paper, and the views which he had in\n regard to it, led him late in the afternoon of that day, prob-\n ably after his interview with Mr. Shelly, to see General\n Howard, and at once complete his arrangement with him,\n and summarily retire from the Christian at Work. He\n swears that he did so ; and the affidavit of General How-\n ard, read simply as a letter, confirms the statement. The\n purpose of retirement from the Christian at Work is now\n settled, if it was not before ; and the purpose to publish a\n farewell editorial to the readers of that paper is also settled.\n The indignation of his mind at a supposed wrong has\n reached this practical form.

Hr. Talmage\n begins the day with prayer for divine guidance. At twelve\n o\u2019clock he has an interview with Mr. Hallock, but did not\n understand from him that he had bought the Christian at\n Worlc. The managers of the paper maintain a profound\n silence toward him as to its purchase by Mr. Hallock. Be-\n tween two and four o\u2019clock in the afternoon, he gets his\n first intimation that the paper has been sold ; and he sup-\n poses that the sale was to a gentleman in Philadelphia. At\n about half-past three o\u2019clock occurs his short interview with\n Mr. Bright, who showed him the paper as then made up,\n and he said to him, \u201c All right, go ahead.\u201d Then he sees\n Mr. Shelly, and expresses his indignation at the sale of the\n paper, and says that he \u201c is not going to stand it.\u201d Then\n he sees General Howard, and closes up his contract with\n him, and determines to leave the Christian at Work at\n once and go to the Advance. Early in the evening he is in\n the proof-room, and hands his valedictory to the foreman,\n directing its insertion in the next issue of the paper. Then\n he goes home, and there occurs the scene to which his wife\n testifies. Such is the history of the day, as furnished by\n the evidence.\n</p>\n<p>\n Let it now be remembered that everything, as to the\n guilt or innocence of Hr. Talmage, turns upon his state of\n mind in the transactions connected with his withdrawal\n from the Christian at Worlc. He was not on trial for in-\n discretions. He was not prosecuted for damages done to\n the paper by his retirement therefrom. The sole and only\n question was whether he had been guilty of \u201c falsehood and\n deceit\u201d on the 9tli of October, 1876.

I do\n not see how there can be any doubt upon this point. Dr.\n Talmage is, by the evidence, presented in the afternoon of\n this day as an excited, indignant, angry man, who regards\n himself as having been badly treated, especially by Mr. Bem-\n ington. His own testimony shows this. The testimony of\n Mr. Shelly and that of his wife clearly prove that he supposed\n himself to have been wrongfully and unjustly dealt with.\n His visit to General Howard and the immediate completion\n of his contract with him are thus explained. His change of\n purpose, as to the time when he would retire from the\n Christian at Work , has an adequate reason in the view\n which he took of Mr. Bemington\u2019s action. This view led\n him not to wait a month, as he had expected to do, but to\n withdraw hum the paper at once. His purpose was\n changed by a new state of facts, as he saw them, which\n excited and angered his mind. Even if he were mistaken\n as to some of these facts, still they were facts to him, and\n produced an impression upon him as such. They were suf-\n ficiently real in his view to furnish a basis for immediate\n action on his part.\n</p>\n<p>\n Bow, it was in this state of mind, clearly shown by the\n evidence, that Dr. Talmage determined to write and publish\n his valedictory, and summarily close his connection with the\n Christian at Work. The motives which actuated him in\n so doing, stated by himself under oath, are as follows :\n</p>\n<p>\n \u201c I knew from the feeling of E. Bemington toward me\n that it was my only opportunity of getting my valedictory\n in the paper. I felt that if it did not go in at that time, it\n would not go in. I would go out of the paper, my name\n would be dropped, and people would never know it. My\n feeling in that respect was very much as if I left my church\n in Brooklyn to go to a church in Chicago.

The fact is that the paper was sold on the 7th of\n October, 1876, and that he was not aware of the sale at the\n time. Neither Mr. Eemington nor the managers of the\n Christian at Work gave him the information.

He said to him, as he swears, \u201c Why not rent\n the pews ?

Both the question and\n the remark would be absurd upon any other hypothesis.\n The answer of Dr. Talmage, \u201c You know my idea is to run\n a free church,\u201d corresponds exactly with this view of the\n case. It gives the reason, which he gave to Mr. Pearsall,\n why he was not willing that the pews should be rented in\n any sense that in his view would be inconsistent with run-\n ning a free church. The further answer in the same con-\n nection, \u201c When it is known that this is not run as a free\n church, I will leave it,\u201d shows that Dr. Talmage supposed\n that it was run as a free church.

This upon its face is\n a very strange spectacle.

Did it come to the committee, or some\n member thereof, by information, and if so, who was the in-\n former? Was common fame the informer? There was\n no common fame on the subject.

The indictment against Dr. Talmage declared that he\n</p>\n<p>\n u stands charged by common fame with falsehood and deceit \u201d\n in seven enumerated particulars, of which the fourth specifi-\n cation is one, when, as a matter of fact, he was not thus\n charged in respect to this particular ; and hence the indict-\n ment declared that to be true which was not true. The\n fact was not as it was stated. ^\n</p>\n<p>\n 2. The Book of Discipline, chapter iii., section 5, express-\n ly provides that, before a judicatory shall take cognizance\n of an offense on the ground of common fame, the common\n fame u must specify some particular sin or sins.\u201d This\n cannot mean less than that it must point, with more or less\n accuracy, to the act or acts which constitute the offense. A\n common fame that calls a man a rascal or a thief, but does\n not state in what his rascality or thievery consists, plainly\n is not the common fame which the Book of Discipline\n means to make the basis of judicial action. It does not\n particularize anything. It does not specify any particular\n sin or particular sins. JSTo sin, according to the Book of\n Discipline, not thus specified, can be prosecuted on the\n ground of common fame, and this is fatal to the theory I\n am considering.\n</p>\n<p>\n 3. The theory, if admissible in respect to one particular sin\n not known to common fame, would be equally admissible in\n respect to any number of such sins not thus known ; and\n hence a person might be arraigned on some general charge\n based on common fame, and tried for a series of particular\n sins, when not a single one of these sins had been a matter\n of any common fame at all.

This is\n all that the testimony shows. As to the question whether\n these statements were false , and as to the further ques-\n tion whether Dr. Talmage thought them false when he\n made them, Dr. Van Dyke gave no light. There could\n plainly be no conviction simply on his testimony, since\n it failed to establish two material points, namely, the\n untruth of the accusations and the falsity of Dr. Tal-\n mage in making them. We are to bear in mind that\n Mr. Hathaway is not the complainant in this case, and that\n the charge against Dr. Talmage is not that of slander, but\n simply that of falsehood, and hence that all the constituents\n of falsehood must be affirmatively shown, or the charge falls\n to the ground. Dr. Van Dyke does not show all of these\n constituents. Indeed, his testimony does not show any\n falsehood at all. It simply shows accusations as matters of\n fact.\n</p>\n<p>\n Mr. Pearsall is another witness introduced by the pros-\n ecution ; and being questioned as to the character of Mr.\n Hathaway and his management of church finances, so far as\n committed to him, he spoke well of him in both respects.\n This, however, does not prove that the accusations of Dr.\n Talmage were false, or that he thought them such when he\n made them. Dr. Talmage might have known or heard\n some things about Mr. Hathaway which Mr. Pearsall did\n not know and had not heard.

He may have heard things\n about Mr. Hathaway in the course of these nine months\n which changed his views, and gave him an unfavorable im-\n pression, especially when, as he supposed from his conversa-\n tion with Dr. Van Dyke, this very man, whom he had in\n various ways befriended, had had something to do with the\n offensive statements made in the u Augustin \u201d letter, which\n were a matter of discussion between Dr. Talmage and Dr.\n Van Dyke when he said what he did say about Mr. Hath-\n away.

One part of the offense consists in an endeavor \u201c to\n obtain false subscriptions toward the payment of the debt\n of the church.\u201d Does the telegram show such a fact ? Not\n at all.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is plain on the face of the telegram that the proposi-\n tion of Dr. Talmage did not contemplate a false subscrip-\n tion in the sense of a forgery. He asked Mr. John F. Tal-\n mage whether he and Mr. Hobbs would \u201c allow \u201d him to\n pledge each of them for five thousand dollars. He was in\n Brooklyn, and they in Baltimore ; and he solicited from\n them, in the form of a question, the authority to make such\n a pledge in their names.\n</p>\n<p>\n It is equally clear that the subscriptions were not to he a\n sham , but to be made in good faith on the part of Dr. Tal-\n mage and on the part of these gentlemen, as to the ques-\n tion of payment. This is evident from his seeking their\n authority thus to pledge them, and, also, from the impli-\n cation involved in his question, that, in the event of re-\n ceiving such authority from them, he would be willing to\n \u201c make up \u201d privately, to each of them, \u201c the difference \u201d be-\n tween the amount subscribed and such a part thereof as\n they might choose to give themselves. All this goes upon\n the supposition of honaftde subscriptions, to be paid by the\n parties making them. They were to be the subscribers\n through Dr. Talmage, and to pay the subscriptions ; and, in\n the theory of the question, he was to \u201cmake up \u201d to them,\n either before or after payment, such a part thereof as they\n might choose to demand. This \u201c difference \u201d thus made up\n by him, whatever it might he, whether fifty or five hundred\n dollars, would be directly a gift to them from Dr. Talmage,\n and indirectly, through them, a gift for the object in respect\n to which he wished each of them to subscribe and pay five\n thousand dollars. There is no sham in such a proposition.\n</p>\n<p>\n It may, however, be said that if Mr. John F. Talmage,\n for example, had subscribed five thousand dollars, and Dr.\n Talmage had furnished twenty-five hundred dollars of the\n amount paid by the former, then the subscription would\n \u2022 have been a false one.

T. De W. Talmage is charged by\n common fame with falsehood and deceit, and with using im-\n proper methods in preaching which tend to bring religion\n into contempt, and \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n Whereas, It is the duty of the Presbytery to protect the\n good name of its members when they are unjustly assailed,,\n and to subject those who offend to proper discipline, there-\n fore \u2014\n</p>\n<p>\n j Resolved, That a committee, consisting of three ministers\n and two elders, be appointed to investigate the nature and\n extent of the common fame referred to in the preamble,\n and report to the Presbytery what, if any, further action\n should be taken.\u201d\n</p>\n<p>\n All this was done at a single meeting of the Presbytery,\n upon the motion of one of its members, after the discussion\n of but two or three hours, and without any conference with\n Dr. Talmage as to the matters involved. The accusation,\n so far as the Presbytery in its organic character was con-\n cerned, loomed up at once into astounding proportions.\n Whatever individual members may have privately thought,\n or heard, or said, the silence of death had reigned in the\n Presbytery until this meeting, and then common fame sud-\n denly thundered with ' an imperious clamor.\n</p>\n<p>\n The Book of Discipline, chapter iii., section 5, says that\n u taking up charges on this ground, of course, requires great\n caution, and the exercise of much Christian prudence.\u201d I\n submit that here was no \u201c great caution,\u201d and no \u201c exercise\n of much Christian prudence.\u201d The action was precipitate\n and hasty. The Presbytery, without inquiry and without\n ever before having heard the accusation upon its floor,\n plunged itself at once into a formal and authoritative dec-\n laration that Dr. Talmage was charged thus and so by com-\n mon fame.

The answer is that when the charge and\n specifications were presented to the Presbytery, this fact did\n not appear in respect to all of them, and hence was not at\n the time known to the Presbytery. The Investigating Com-\n mittee, if they knew the fact, did not disclose it.

The theory adopted was that if any of\n these offenses came within the time prescribed by the Book\n of Discipline, this fact would virtually revive those that had\n been outlawed, and hence that the Presbytery might legally\n put them into the indictment. The offenses, not then known\n to be excluded by limitation of time, were assumed to give\n vitality, for the purposes of trial, to those that would other-\n wise have been excluded.

His acquittal is really the only bright\n spot in this strange procedure. It made some amende to\n him for the injustice of putting him on trial at all. Had\n \u2022the views of these complainants prevailed, there would have\n been two wrongs instead of one, with no remedy in the Pres-\n bytery for either.
