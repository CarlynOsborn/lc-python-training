A Saturday excursion to\n the country in search of trees was inaugurated, and\n each boy was encouraged to select, plant, and care\n for a tree, to be called by his name. I well recol-\n lect the interest with which I watched my particu-\n lar tree. No doubt good seed was thus sown which\n bore fruit in after years, in the planting of many\n shade trees. Flower beds were also assigned to\n the girls, who were expected to plant and cultivate\n them.
