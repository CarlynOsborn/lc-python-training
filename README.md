# Two Day Python Workshop

This two-day workshop will teach the basics of the Python programming language with a focus on managing data. Day one will introduce Python and the Jupyter Notebook. Day two will introduce Pandas, a library for data management and analysis. Participants will receive hands-on training and leave with introductory knowledge of Python and Pandas.

Dates:
- **May 22nd**: Introduction to Jupyter, & Python
- **May 23rd**: Introduction to Pandas and Web Data


Instructors:

- Matt Burton (mcburton@pitt.edu)
